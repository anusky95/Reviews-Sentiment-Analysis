P =>  great palce great location There are are more luurious places in Vegas but  Bally s has a perfect loaction  great staff  and clean comfortable rooms  Hard to go wrong  
P =>  Acceptable   ent choice for the   Did not have a choice and stayed at Bally s for a conference  Have not stayed there in    years  Nothing has changed  I am sure it is all the same decor  Looks very dated  Everything about the hotel was OK  nothing exceptional Rooms were big but not luxurious  Everything in the room clean and functional There was nothing really wrong with our stay  but when spending my own money I much prefer staying at the nicer properties in town  
P =>  great location and price We stayed here for   nights after returning from the Grand Canyon Arrived Wed   th at approx      pm check in was quick    mins   I asked if we could have the nicest view possible as we were celebrating my husbands   th birthday    we ended up with room       top floor facing the eiffel tower and the Bellagio fountains  wonderful I need to thank  quot racegrrl quot  who put an amazing promo code on the forum          a night     The room was huge  and although it is not very modern  it was clean and the beds were comfortable We would definatly stay here again  not just because of the cheap rate  but because of the location and friendly staff  
P =>   great location This is a small hotel for vegas  which isn t a bad thing  There are no long walks to your room or to breakfast  Perfect location in the center of the strip  
P =>   Great location   center strip  Bally s is located center strip with the Bellagio and Caesars Palace accross the street  Price was good  Hotel room in North Tower was a very large room with a love seat  king bed  desk and a large bathroom  South Tower might have a better view but the rooms are nicer in the North Tower  Casino is smaller scale  compared to all of the other monstrosities on the strip  Overall good value  location and it s connected to the Paris  very short walk  I would stay again  
P =>   Lovely spacious room with a wonderful strip view On check in we requested   adjoining rooms on a high floor in the north tower    we used the     trick    Our rooms on the   st floor were very spacious and well maintained with wonderful views of the Bellagio fountains and the Eiffel Tower  The beds were very comfortable and there was always plenty of fluffy towels The coffee maker was an added bonus  The central strip location was excellent  as was the walkway through to Paris  The casino did appear very dated and could be doing with some upgrading  Excellent band in the bar each evening  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Bally s  
P =>   Good Location   Review Titled Good location by oberbride is the same experince I hadthough I stayed      to      
P =>   Good location We went to Vegas from Sunday to Wednesday  Our room was okay  wall paper peeling  no where to put your stuff in the shower  ect  There were at least   room service trays in our hallway for at least   days while we were there  The hotel is okay but it is in the perfect location  It is terrible  though  every time you come in and out to have someone hound you to go look at Harrahs new condos or time shares  There is a little  quot cafe quot  that we ate breakfast at  They ran out of plain bagels by   am when we got there  they open at  am  and the egg sandwiches are terrible  The only other restaurant we saw was Sbarro by the monorailWe didnt use the fitness center but its way out of the way and you have to pay to use it  You also have to pay    for the safe everyday that you use it I would only recommend this hotel because of the price and location  If you are looking for high class this is not the place to stay  
P =>   went downhill fast I ve been going to Vegas over Super Bowl with a large group for about the last    years  The majority of those years we have stayed at Bally s  I was amazed at the changes I saw in just one year  The hotel itself just looked shabbier  There s peeling paint and just a general lack of cleanliness to the place  I checked in on a Sunday  As I got off the eleavotor there  on a table by the windows  was a styrofoam container with someone s half eaten carry out dinner inside When I checked out on Wednesday  it was still there  The hotel s restaurant situation was just as bad  The buffet and deli have closed down  We ate at their steak house one night Very expensive  and the quality has suffered  I ordered Chateubriand and it was served with  believe it or not  potato chips  That was a first Not everything was bad  The front desk and the staff at the poker room were friendly and effecient  And  of course the location is great  Unfortunately  it s just not the hotel it once was  
P =>   Basic place to sleep We arrived around   am on Sunday  Check in line was    minutes long  the room wasn t ready  not a surprise since it was pretty early   Was offered an upgrade to a ior Suite for     night  We passed  We were told that the room would be ready at  pm and that there would be another line dedicated to folks just picking up keys  Went back at        no special line  so we waited in the check in line again  Just    minutes or so this time  The room was ready  It was in the South Tower    rd floor  the top floor   Walking down the hallway  there was a room service tray outside the door of the room across the hall  This remained there for   days  At one point someone tripped over the tray  broke a glass and glass was strewn through the hallway for the next few days  The room was large with a king size bed and   fairly comfy chairs  The view was pretty nice  overlooking the Eiffel tower and we could see about     of the fountains of the Bellagio  The carpet was stained and patched  the bureau drawers were broken but usable  Everything was beige  Bed was quite comfortable  Towels were fluffy and the maid service was quite good  All the employees were very friendly with the exception of the check in staff   they were quite cold  Didnt care for the casino   dont know why  just didnt get a good feeling there One note of caution if you are planning to see a show out there   we found this place  several actually  called Tix Tonight  It was in front of Bill s Gambling Hall across the street and was touting     price tickets  We waited an hour in line and bought tickets for Cirque do Solie  KA   We were charged      each and were given a VOUCHER for a ticket which we had to present at the actual box office of the show  MGM  to get a real ticket  We were told the sooner we got there  the better the seats  So we walked right over  waited in another line there for about a half hour and got our tickets  The face value on the ticket was         So I paid an extra     ticket for what    You re better off just going directly to the box office to buy your tickets  who knew      price    I dont think so  Anyway  the seats were very good   th row  center stage  Worth the money to us  but we could have gotten the same for    bucks less  Live and learn I guess  All in all a pleasant experience  and the location is perfect  just about dead center in the strip  But  I dont think we d stay there again  
P =>   We had a great stay at Bally s Las Vegas I am in Las Vegas several times a year and stayed in different hotels  but let me tell you that I had a great time at Bally s Las Vegas  I was not due into Las Veags until            but I called to see how much it would cost me to come a day early and the told me that it would not cost me a dime  Arrived at the hotel on           check in went great  Received keys with coupons for different   for   drink specials as well as dicounts for food  Room was great  we had a king size bed with a couch  chair and two desks  the room ans service we received for these   nights was great  
P =>   Good Value for Great Location Perfect location for sightseeing on the strip  Great covered walkway to Paris Paris Hotel  Rooms are very dated  but have large bathrooms  Bed was firm  but room looked clean  South tower room on  th floor  Good view of strip  
P =>  Surprisingly nice stay I recently stayed here for   nights with a friend  I had reserved a South Tower room  but upon check in  we were given a North Tower room  which I think is supposed to be nicer  The room was very nice   clean  spacious  nice furniture  granite bathroom  There are express elevators to floor    and up  which we used and they always came quickly  We had a westward view of Rio and towards the Strip  My only small quibbles were that the bed linens could have been softer and more comfortable  but I still slept fine  And the bathroom only had about   toiletries  sham con  lotion and soap  Nothing else  But given the great location of Bally s and the nice room  I d stay there again anytime  Room was nice and quiet   no street noise  
P =>   Consider this hotel We stayed at Bally s on a Wed  and Thursday night and couldn t be happier with our experience  We usually stay at Paris or Mandalay Bay Hotel but won a trip to Las Vegas and it included the two nights at Bally s Hotel  Our check in was smooth and staff very friendly  Once you get on the elevator  you are wisked on an express to the   th floor and beyond  saving alot of time waiting for others to depart  etc   We never had a problem getting an elevator which was not the case at other properties  Our room was huge  great bed  linens  lots of fluffy towels and a large granite bathroom  The view from the   th floor included the strip and fountains at Bellagio  It was very quiet  no street noise  and all the furniture was new  The best part was when exiting the elevators  you can walk down a short hallway and be right inside Paris so it feels like you are staying at that property  Be aware it is an older property without the bling of the newer casino hotels but I would consider staying here again since you don t spend alot of time in the room   extremely comfortable hotel  
P =>   Cheap  I stayed at Bally s in uary for three nights  They were running a really attractive sale  I think my bill for all three nights was       including taxes   The location is good and the hotel is basically well appointed  I stayed in a room on the  th floor of the North tower  My room had an atrocious view  an empty lot across the street and the track for the monorail  I didn t expect much better for the price I paid  I was pleasantly surprised by how well maintained the room appeared to be  The furnishings were in good repair and seemed pretty modern  However  I have two main complaints    They let room service dishes sit out in the hallways for hours and even days at a time  I had to call for them to pick up my neighbor s dishes on two different days  If I hadn t called  who knows when they would have thought to come back to get them  That s sad because the general maid service was good    The bed was the single most uncomfortable hotel bed I ve ever slept in  I remember a friend telling me that he also thought the beds at Bally s were too hard  But I chanced it anyway because of the super low price  It really wasn t worth the low price because the bed was SO unbearable  I tossed and turned and slept very poorly because of the terrible mattress  If you normally sleep on the floor or a wooden board  then this is the hotel for you  If you want to sleep on something even slightly more comfortable  go somewhere else  Even Circus Circus must be better  
P =>   Very satisfied I m late writing this review but we booked   rooms at Bally s for ember   th to uary  nd  We paid      a night for each room  booked on hotel website  which was a really great deal for the New Years holiday  Both rooms were in the south tower on opposite sides of the hallway   st floor  Check in was fast and friendly  The rooms are the biggest standard size rooms I have ever stayed in  The bathroom is also larger than average  The decor is slightly outdated but really for that price who cares  Views were really nice  One room had a nice view of the Bellagio fountains and of the Eifel Tower  Rooms were always cleaned thoroughly and pretty promptly too  The staff throughout the hotel and casino is super friendly  I found the location to be ideal  pretty close to being center strip  Bally s is connected to Paris as well which was nice and you are able to cash chips in at either casino  We had breakfast at The Sidewalk Cafe  The prices were very reasonable  the food was good  and the service was excellent  They also have a cafe at the bottom of the elevators called Java Coast which is open    hours  They had good food and coffee but the prices are a little high there  I paid    for a small bottle of Dole OJ  I will definitely stay at this hotel again  All   in our group had a blast on our trip and our experience at Bally s contributed to that  
P =>   Would Definately Stay Here Again My brother and I travelled to Las Vegas to attend our cousin s wedding  When planning the trip  I was up in the air about Bally s and the Imperial  and in the end  chose Bally s  and was glad I did  Other guests of the wedding that we were attending stayed at the Imperial and would have switched hotels if they could have  It was a real dive  They spent as much time out of the hotel that they could and only returned to sleep Ok  our flight got in around       PM and we took one of the shuttles into the hotel  There were about   guests ahead of us to check in and it went quickly  I had requested a room in the North Tower  after looking at different reviews  and also had        in my hand  which I ended up tipping the counter attendant with   We were told that there were no rooms left in the North Tower that night  but they would put us in a suite for the night then would be moved the next day  We were good with that  Well  the suite had as many square feet as my house          One huge kitchen   bar   full bath   living room with pull out couch   two tvs  and much more  and a wall of windows that overlooked the Eiffel Tower next door    nice  The bedroom had a king bed  two dressing areas  a sunken hot tub  an enclosed shower  enclosed toilet  and thirdly an enclosed bidet  The wall of windows in this room also overlooked the Tower After a quick sleep  we were still on our home time  so we were up and gone by      their time and we spent the morning exploring and sightseeing  We came back to switch rooms and they moved us to a nice room in the North Tower  The room was clean  modern and enjoyable to be in The hotel may not have been the fanciest on the strip  but we found it located centrally  and if we wanted glitter  glam  and to be wowed  we just had to walk out the door  and turn right  left or cross the street  You can wander all the hotels to see the sites  but there isn t really a need to pay the extra just to sleep  which is what we were using our room for  The casino was pretty much the same as all the rest  we didn t gamble very much  Check out was quick and easy  we just had to settle up for the high speed access  and we hopped a shuttle back to the airport If I ever get the chance to head back to Las Vegas  Bally s is the hotel I m choosing  which I also reccommend to anyone who is heading that way  
P =>   Great location mid strip clean helpful staff and plenty to do Ballys was recommended to us for it s location  We upgraded our room to a junior suite and it was MASSIVE  They had executive suites available too but ours was plenty big enough We stayed in the south tower  The room had a super king size bed  TV  dining table and chairs    huge comfy chairs and   fitted wardrobes either side of the bathroom  The Bathroom had   sinks  a sunken bath  a spacious shower  a toilet and a bidet  All in all  it was extremely luxurious  The view from the room overlooked the Paris hotel pool and Eiffel Tower straight on  but if you looked left you could see about     of the Belagio fountains pool and therefore hear and see most of the fountain shows Ballys has a extensive casino and loads of restaurants or fast food outlets for getting food  plus downstairs there are a large selection of shops too  I d recommend the nail bar  I had a mini manicure and it looked great for days  Go see Bobbi  There s also a pool and access to the Vegas Monorail from the hotel You also get coupons for money off in the buffets of the other Harrah hotels  Haraahs  Rio  Paris etc  which were well worthwhile using  The Harrah s and Rio buffets were out of this world Downsides to the hotel were minimal  As in the other Harrah hotels you are harrassed when walking into each hotel by timeshare sales staff  but if you can manage them they re just a slight annoyance  There s no theme to this hotel  but it s attached to Paris so you re not far from some glitz and glamour  The escalators were always breaking  but there were lifts available to use I d say Ballys is great for older travellers not bothered by the overwhelming pomp and ceremony in the themed hotels  but then again we were on honeymoon and it suited us fine  we re in our mid   s   I would have preferred to stay somewhere younger but can t complain about the service and facilities here  
P =>   Great Hotel in need of repair    We have stayed at Ballys several times in the past  After a   and half year break  we came back to Vegas and stayed at Ballys for   nights   and I was appalled by the state of disreppair this great hetel is in  I shouldn t have been that surprised  because last time we were in Vegas we stayed at Paris  also owned by Harrahs  and already noticed that Harrahs has decided not to put money into maintaining its properties  Ballys still is desirable for its location in the middle of the strip  which makes it very convenient to walk to other great hotels and casinos  and the lobby and casino are still OK  but the rooms and hallways obviously have not been touched for a while  Most appalling is the peeling wallpaper everywhere  the peeling paint on the bathroom cabinet and the rusty towels rack in the shwoer  is this still considered a   and half stars hotel     I ve taken some pictures  see for yourself  I d say Ballys should drop the room price to equal that of a   stars hotel until they ve put some money into restoring what used to be a great hetel  
P =>   Horrendous We arrived at the Bally hotel at about   oo am after a long flight from the Uk via Atlanta  five hours stop over  We had to queue for over    mins to get checked in  At the desk I handed over my reservation code from my travel agent  the was no polite  quot Sorry you have been kept waiting quot  the girl then went into a rant about how every one had been fired because of the recession and she will upgrade us  I said thank you and took the key card from her  We were told how to get to the room   The room is massive with the oldest ugliest furniture I have ever seen  this stuff wouldn t even sell in the Oxfam shop   stained   chipped  clunky         style with ashtrays everywhere Yep its a smoking room   I did not realise this was allowed still  I have a very tired and sick man on my hands and all he wants to do is sleep  he cannot bring himself to change rooms so I let it go  I try to find the TV remote   getting my hands dirty in the process and realise the TV and the cabinet it is housed in is dusty and covered in fingerstains and behind it is even more muck and dusty and a collection of wires  There is no remote I sleep in my long t shirt and we both get up after about   hours of sleep   we shower and my partner tries to shave and in none of the two sinks does the plug thing work   we block it with a plastic cup so he can have a shave  We leave without breakfast I have no idea if its even offered  I can t wait to get out of this hell hole I hand a letter to the reception telling them how bad the room was   the receptionist looks at it and shrugs his shoulders  
P =>   Go Somewhere Else  During the trade show time  got a good rate thru Expedia com  Reserved a deluxe room which is     more per night than a standard room  Tried checking in around  pm the room wasn t ready   Told the check in time is  pm   Came back around  pm and the room was still not ready  Had to settle with stinking smoking room  The deluxe room had pretty much no amenities like coffee maker  bottled water  bathrobes  feather blanket  Inside the quality is simiar to a motel other than hi speed internet  The location is nice but that is about it  Would not opt to come back  
P =>  No major complaints We stayed at Bally s in a standard North Tower room for three nights in ember       Unfortunately when we checked in  we were informed that they did not have any non smoking rooms available for us with a king sized bed  Our choices were a smoking room in the north tower  or a queen sized non smoking in the older South Tower  Fortunately for us  the smoking room turned out not to have a lingering smell and overall was extermely clean and spacious with flawless furniture  On one of the three nights we did perceive a heavy odor of smoke evidently from one of the adjacent rooms that share an air vent  but the that was just once  Overall the room was large and well appointed for the price  although a lack of mini fridge was at times inconvenient I would say that the primary reason to stay at Bally s  or indeed to visit Vegas  is not to linger in the room  In that respect  this hotel casino has several advantages  First  it is rather well located for exploring some of the more ostentatious nearby properties  e g  the Bellagio is directly across the street  Paris is immediately adjacent  etc   In fact  Paris is directly connected to Bally s casino  and shares a parking garage  and we found that our daily routine involved coming down the elevator  bisecting the casino floor and heading directly into Paris for their excellent breakfast buffet  On the whole  I find that Bally s was a competent hotel with no major negatives and with an excellent location smack in the middle of the strip  
P =>  No problem  Ballys  a decent comfortable hotel  accomodating when travelling with others will do their best to put you  at least on the same floor  Casino   smelled strongly of cig smoke as most casino s do down there   we re all non smokers Shops  not many but a huge outlet mall close by my husband and I didn t go but our friends did Planet hollywood has lots of shops as well  actually all the hotels have some shopping experiences better than Ballys Restaurants   only ate once for breakfast at ballys  a little pricey   rest of time went to Denny s about a    min  walk from Ballys Ballys is connected to Paris through a cobblestoned walk way that are quite slippery when wearing high heals  Very pretty though  gives you a feel of walking through  quot old Paris quot  with little shops and cafes Getting around  bring comfortable shoes  so much walking     The mono rail is expensive     from Ballys to Statoshere area one way  Where you can take the  quot Duece quot  double decker with stops all along the strip for     good for    hours Things we did  Grand canyon  Hoover Damm tour   awesome  breath taking scenery   A must see  Explored nearly all the big name Casino s     days is not long enough  each casino has a different theme with so much to see  my fave was Caesars Palace My husband and one of our friends went on the crazy rides up top of the Stratosphere  which dangles you over the edge of the tower   I stayed on the viewing platform taking fantastic view shots of Las Vegas at night  Another great View is top of the Eiffle tower  go up at dusk and watch as the sun sets and all the Hotel lights come on  stay a little longer and watch the Ballagio Fountains do their thing Only went to one show  at the stratosphere   live impersonations of Michael jackson  Elvis  Rod Stewart  quite good  with a photo op and autograph signing at the end  Michael was the best Las Vegas   been there done that   another pin on my travel map  would we go back    maybe    
P =>   Great place to stay on my first trip A       Tuesday promotion drew me to the Bally s web site  I paid      USD for   nights from Mon Fri  Paired with a      flight from priceline my trip was      cheaper from any package I found  My reservation was in the South tower  I used thetwentydollartrick com and was upgraded to the North tower  My room was outstanding   springy king size bed  plush loveseat and glass coffee table  desk and table  plus a large bathroom with a towel rack and shelf for shower products plus a shelving unit for towels under the sink  I had a nice view south of the top of Mandalay Bay and a mountain range I did notice a few flaws in the room  peeling wallpaper along the bottom of the window  partially plugged shower head  chips out of the toilet seat  chipped paint on the bathroom shelves  Also  dirty exterior windows which is a common complaint and to be expected when you can see the airport from your hotel Bally s is in a prime location in the centre of the strip  It was ideal for my first trip as it allowed me to explore the south strip on foot and the north strip and downtown by monorail bus I walked south to Excalibur several times  only Luxor and Mandalay Bay are further south   Going north is a longer trip and Bally s has a monorail station  plus the Deuce  bus  has a stop right in front of Bally s on Las Vegas Blvd  The casino was busy at all times of the day  It is one of the smaller ones I saw which makes the hotel easy to navigate  There are restaurants  shops and the sportsbook along the walkway to the monorail I was far away from the elevators and the hotel was quiet except for one family with several kids who I heard come in around  pm every night I would recommend Bally s to anyone traveling to Las Vegas  
P => 
P => Best Place to Stay on the Strip Where else to celebrate a   st b day other than Las Vegas  Trying to decide on a hotel was hard with so many to choose from  but i am very glad this is the one i picked  We had a lake view room which was beautiful to watch the fountains and view the strip and mountains in the background  The room was fully equipped with everything you could need and want  The hotel had wonderful scenery and lots of detail  The spa was one of the best and the hotel offered many amentities  after touring the other hotels i recommend this hotel because it was beautiful and relaxing and i didn t feel like i was in a mall like the other hotels made me feel  The casino was nice but the food was a little pricey and we were never that hungry only complaint we wanted a place for a quick bite to eat but a variety of something to choose from  but everything is expensive on the strip  
P => Can t wait to go back  My husband and I stayed at the Bellagio for one week in ember       First of all it is the ultimate spot on the strip  It has the best view  if you get a lakeview room which is highly recommended  and it is the center of  quot the strip  quot  The hotel is spectacular  There are a couple minor things that can be updated in the rooms and around the hotel but for the size of the hotel and the amount of people passing through it each day  which is in the thousands no kidding  it looks amazing  Check in took about    minutes but moved rather quickly for so many people being in line  This is a huge resort with people from all over the world traveling to see it  so  don t expect to be the only ones arriving  The staff work hard to accomodate hundreds of people at a time  Anyway  the room service is great  twice a day  It s wonderful to come back from brunch or dinner and have the bed made  If you take full advantage of the services the hotel provides  than you barely lift a finger  After a long week there we had a lot of shopping bags and the hotel gladly brought boxes to our room and picked them up when wewere done to ship them for you from the Business Center  People have complained about the smoke in the hotel but  hello  this is Vegas and it s a Casino what do you expect  It s perfectly quite in the rooms and you never get disturbed  In Room Dining is fantastic and reasonably priced for a luxury hotel  My one fear was having a room double booked b c I have read that this is a problem at the Bellagio occasionally  I was assured upon our arrival that this would never happen and sure enough we were resting before dinner on our  th night and someone was using a key to get into our room  Luckily we had the lock on the door  We spoke with a manager  who was very nice and apologetic  We weren t looking for any comps or anything b c we really just wanted to inform her of the situation  She gave us new keys and made sure there weren t any duplicates  Later that night we received a message from the front desk saying that she has removed any charges for the room service we had ordered  That made us feel a little better b c of the way she handled the situation and spoke with us face to face  Again  this is a ridiculously large resort with so many people  tourists and locals  passing through  so you can t expect      perfection but they certainly do everything they can to accomodate and make your stay as pleasent as possible and make up for any faults  The Buffet is great for breakfast and dinner but only once or twice b c the food never really changes  Warning  the Buffet price doubles over the weekend  Noodles is a great asian spot for lunch and Sensi is fabulous for dinner  We recommend the surf and turf at Sensi  The flavors are incredible  Fix restaraunt had a great atmosphere but the entree was flavorless and skimpy for the price  We enjoy eating good food and are not afraid to spend for a good meal but Fix was not our favorite  Almost every night we enjoyed a Caramel Latte and Gelati from the Gelato Cafe near the pool it happens to be just a few feet past the guest elevators  Speaking of guest elevators  they have security standing there making sure you have a key or you cannot have access  It makes you feel much safer in such a big place  There is someone to assist with everything you do  You need a taxi and they are lined up outside the hotel at any time  better than any other hotel  We called the concierge whenever we needed tickets to shows  or reservations for restaraunts and they easily took care of things for us  We saw  quot O quot  Cirque De Soleil at the Bellagio which made it so easy to get there and be seated right away  There are assigned seats  so  no wait or heavy line to push through  It was a fantastic show with colors  music and amazing talents  We also saw Zumanity Cirque De Soleil at the New York  New York b c we loved  quot O quot  so much  Zumanity is the adult show     and it was fantastic but had less acrobatics and more comedy  You need to be open minded and not shy for this one  Also  get a couple rows back for each show or you might get WET in  quot O quot  or picked to participate in Zumanity  Also  when you call the concierge or front desk  the answer the phone by your name  which saves you the trouble of giving all of your information The Conservatory is gorgeous and themed for each season  It is a great spot to take pictures since the colors jump out at you  There is always someone cleaning around the hotel and you can tell they do there best to keep it a   star  When you visit other hotels and step back into the Bellagio  you realize how incredible the atmosphere and luxury of this hotel is  The fountains are there pride and glory and give you this amazing feeling  It is worth watching a show from the outside terrace and from the inside of your lakeview room  We went to the top of the Eiffel Tower and saw the fountains from above which is breathtaking Overall  it is the ultimate place to stay in Vegas  People that know Las Vegas  know that the Strip is a very expensive place to stay  eat  play and shop  Do not visit the Las Vegas Strip if you are finacially challenged  It WILL cost much more than you planned  There are other gorgeous modern hotels but they do not have the views and location  We can t wait to visit the Bellagio again soon  
P => Amazing      We stayed here for one night at the end of our   night stay in Vegas with friends  Check in was quick and easy  we were put on the same floor as our friends  The room was amazing  Clean  big and the bathroom was great  The room we had was a deluxe lakeview room so the massive window overlooking the fountains was beautiful  We had all six of us in the room with a bottle of champange and watched the fountains in the dark with the music on the t v  All I can say is one of the best nights ever      I was sad that it was only one night there in the end  I would deffinately stay again next time    
P => High Expectations met  It is perhaps unfair on the Bellagio that expectations are so high before you arrive that you maybe fail to appreciate the quality of the hotel  As expected  everything was superb   the bathroom and the view were our favourite features  We stayed in the Spa Tower and initially were put off by the constant drooning noise on the   th floor  We were quickly relocated with a minimum of fuss and went on to have a great experience in the hotel  Everything was perfect and the extra things to do in the hotel should be appreciated   the indoor garden and freshly made crepes were highlights for us  This hotel is much more than another casino with rooms and the famous water fountain never fails to take the breath away  
P => oceans    Pool area fantastic  rooms fantastic  choice of resteraunts good  fountains spectacular  location fantastic  most places are in walking distance    days is enough in vegas  
P => Beautiful Place Horrible Service While the design and decoration is stunning  the lack of customer service is as stunning for a five star hotel  Every staff member I came into contact with was rude  curt and just plain unfriendly  I work in HR and seeing this type of behavior  this makes me think it comes from the top  
P => Bellagio   Las vegas Lovely hotel been there twice and would go again  
P => great poker room went to play poker in vegas  great hotel for that reason only  other than that is overpriced  fountains were amazing 
P => Beautiful but expensive The Bellagio has a very impressive entrance lobby and if you are lucky enough to have paid for a suite then you don t have to spend too much time there as you can jump the massive check in out queue  The experience at the Bellagio is great if you can afford not to look at the bill  All the restaurants have inflated prices as do the shops  The service is good though  
P => Fabulous   cheer up check in staff though  The only negatives I have were that the check in staff were beyond miserable and if you get given a room in the spa tower it is likely that you will be able to hear the maintenance noise  We complained though and were moved to the main tower  The views of lake bellagio are immense and the beds incredibly comfortable  Great central strip location  Housekeeping staff were brilliant  
P => Loved it  Stayed in a standard room but with the fountain view  I know you aren t in your room for long  but when you are   what a view Lovely  spacious rooms  Big comfortable beds  big bathroom etc  Awesome location in the middle of the strip  The buffet for breakfast is a bit much  but for dinner is great  Make sure you try the Noodles restaurant    YUM Overall  great stay and would certainly stay again  
P => great     great shops loved the fountain show  but eoom service was horrible and overpriced 
P => View of the Fountains The hotel as a whole is fantastic  very classy but    the rooms with a view to the fountains are getting very old  beds were small  and could hear next door neighbours in the bathroom  The view of the fountains from the room was spectacular  We stayed here the previous year in the newer wing  this room was heaps better  new and didn t hear the neighbours  We also had great view of the strip and fountains from the room  If you stay I would recommend this part of the hotel  
P =>   Met Our High Expectations We were lucky enough to stay in a lake view  quot TDK quot    tower deluxe king room on the   th floor of the Bellagio  The views were simply stunning  A highlight of our trip was watching each of the fountain shows from our room  the music is piped in through the television   The room was nicely appointed   especially the bathroom  The TDK rooms are corner rooms providing windows on the front and also on the sides of the room  including over the whirlpool tub   The bathrooms are larger than a Bellagio standard room  and feature a separate shower and W C  Our bed was very comfortable  Housekeeping was excellent and very friendly  Service was equally outstanding at the front desk  bellman desk and valet We were always greeted by name and with a smile  the valet has a simple little trick  so that when you return they say  quot hello Mr       welcome back quot    Contrary to another reviewer  before leaving the room  we were able to call down for our car  It was always ready by the time we got downstairs  The buffet was very good  However  we saw no difference between the     buffet on Friday night and the     buffet on Sunday night  The same  quot gourmet meats quot  were present  ostrich  Kobe beef  and the all important sushi selection was identical both evenings   Tip  For a delicious buffet at a great value  try the beautiful new M Resort about    minutes south of Bellagio just off of I     Bellagio must mean  quot huge quot   The walk from the room to the car is extremely long  even without stopping at a table to place a bet   However  we saw this as a blessing given the amount of food and drink consumption during our   day stay We walked through the pool area  It was too cool for us to swim  but there is a gorgeous and elegant swimming area  The truly wealthy can reserve a luxurious private cabana  we estimate more than    around the pool  The only negative moment for us came at the sports book  The clerk there was somewhat rude and seemed bothered by our newbie questions  But  still  the sports book watching the NFL on Sunday was a blast   Get there before   a m  for a seat   Surprisingly  this is only one of a few casinos offering free drinks in the sports book  And  the Bellagio serves excellent alcohol  call brand hard liquor  as well as imported beers   
P =>   Fancy decor okay amenities great staff expensive eateries The Bellagio in Las Vegas is beautiful  It s big and marble and filled with lovely flowers and seasonal decor  I loved the conservatory area  very creative and fun to look at  The staff was always friendly  smiling and ready to help  From the front desk clerk  the concierge  and the housekeeper  they were all great  Our room was nice  very comfortable and clean  The bathroom was great with a nice shower  One negative I have about the room is a lack of a coffee pot  I don t think I ve ever stayed at a hotel that did not offer you a way to make your own coffee in the room  Aside  from that I think the room was great  We had an excellent view  The Jean Phillipe Patisserie was a fun place to visit  looking at all the cakes on display and all the goodies they offered there  like gelato  pastries  crepes and candies  However  the prices were a bit high      for two coffees  come on people  And the crepes  They were great but     for a small lunch is a bit crazy  But then again  that s Vegas The spa was great  lovely decor  helpful staff and wonderful treatments  http   reviews houseofskip com 
P =>   Everything that is Vegas This hotel is everything that you would expect in Vegas  it is grandiose to the extreme and the size of it cannot be exaggerated  This was my second stay at the property on business and yes you can combine business with pleasure  Service is pretty good and the rooms are of a standard    nature  I was not expecting to have to pay USD    everytime I went to the gym  this is excessive and left a bad taste in my mouth  Food options were varied and quality was pretty good and as the hotel is on the strip its a short walk to other hotels and outlets  Make sure you get a room overlooking the fountains as this adds to the experience  would be much more fun to take a partner wife with you and that s exactly what i plan to do next year       
P =>   The Bellagio   An Icon in Las Vegas There may not be a reason to leave the Bellagio while in Las Vegas  The property contains enough visual treats and activities that  in a short stay  may be more than adequate for the guests  The standards for the hotel are high and meet the level of the finer hotels in Asia  The rooms and baths are large and well decorated  If the price is reasonable  then the Bellagio should be highly considered for a hotel in Las Vegas  
P =>   Great Birthday Weekend at the Bellagio We had a great time at the Bellagio in        Rooms were very clean comfortable and the service exceptional  We enjoyed the dancing waters shows day and night  Food was quite pricey but we did treat ourselves to a couple of nice dinners Although the lobby is quite noisy and crowded  check in was very quick and are room was ready earlier than we expected We did visit the club located on the premises one evening and had a great time  The Gentlemen have to pay around     but Ladies get in free with complimentary passes that were given to us in the casino Overall it was a great weekend stay at the Bellagio  
P =>   Massive  This hotel sums up Vegas  In a square mile on the strip there is        bedrooms  Coming from dublin and being in this industry it was a learning curve  Do not stay here if you want personal service as there could be up to       guests       bedrooms   There was at least a    min queue for breakfast each morning mid week However the rooms  location  fountains and lobby are all top class  Its in the middle of the strip opposite the mono rail within walking distance of all attractions  Had a meal in Prime and was excellent  Rooms clean and have all you need  Would reccomend this hotel if you get a deal and would stay here again  
P =>   Truely    and luxury at its Las Vegas best  First thing noticed  Foyer   WOW  This place is a cut above the rest  Spotless common areas  Deluxe Room   luxurious  plush bedding  massive bathroom        for   nights    adults   The pool area is out of this world  very luxurious  u feel like a celebrity  Free fresh towels  x   every day and a few big hot jacuzzis  Now onto the real highlight of this place  the buffet      for all you can eat  and this place is OUT OF THIS WORLD  All the meats and sides you can think of for every international cuisine  fresh made sushi  crab legs  veal  sea bass  venison  poke  hawaiian raw fish delicacy   millions of desserts  free unlimited soft drinks  This is a truely hidden gem  and very good value for money recommended to me by a friend  It doesnt stop there as there is also an unlimited breakfast buffet which is just as amazing  Everything you can think of for a great  and filling  start to the day  Go direct to website and check for a good deal before booking  Great casino  u will get free drinks but dont get shouted at for not giving a good tip   haha  
P =>   Very pretty but lacking in service See review title above  The hotel s a visual extravaganza but we found its service  particularly at check in and in the cheaper restaurants  to be quite hit and miss  
P =>   Amazing   Amazing hotel and service  Concierge set everything up before hand from a suprise breakfast in bed for the bday girl  to arranging flowers to be waiting at the restaurant for us  Rooms were very nice  we had a view of the pool which was cute  Didnt eat at any of the restaurants inside the hotel although next time will def check out Yellowtail  Planning on going back this  again and will def stay there   
P => 	star hotel w  a few disappointments First let me say this  The Bellagio is a gorgeous hotel  It was such a treat to stay there during my husband s conference  Let me now tell you some things I found out  you have to pay for wireless internet service      for    hours   you have to pay to use the fitness room        there is no coffee in your room  costs    a cup from the cafe   there is no complimentary breakfast with your night s lodging  IF you are fortunate enough to be wealthy  you have no worries  If you are splurging for a special occasion  DO IT  But if you are average income folks like us  stay somewhere where these amenities are included and come visit the Bellagio  It costs nothing to watch the fountains outside or visit the conservatory inside  
P =>   So last century I know this hotel was built last century but does it have to feel so completely old hat  I really can t think why everybody drools over it quite so much  Yes the fountains are lovely and the location is great but that s about it  The carpet in our bedroom was dirty  the towels and bathmats were stained  the whole room never felt particularly clean  The carpet was badly vacuumed on our arrival and never really improved during our    night stay  There were sticky marks on the tiles outside the bathroom which meant we could not walk barefoot  The toiletry supply was mean to the point of being depressing  one very small bottle of shampoo  conditioner and body lotion a day   no bath gel at all despite Las Vegas water being the very worst in the world   which meant my husband and I had to fiddle about transferring these wretched little bottles between the bath and the shower every day The TV in the room was practically an antique and the nickel and diming was too tedious for words      a day WiFi      a day for a fridge      a day for a dvd player  We needed a fridge as the one in the room is stuffed with overpriced junk and weighted so if you so much as sneeze against it  which you well might given the amount of dust in the room  you ll be charged for the lot  We also wanted to watch a dvd of Honeymoon in Las Vegas because that s what we were having but we went out and bought a dvd player for     and took it home rather than give the Bellagio     for a day s use of one Despite the fact that hotel staff knew we were there for our wedding and honeymoon they did their level best not to give an inch  not even when I requested a late check out by a couple of hours  No  out trotted the automated machine gun response  we re full and need you out by noon  our flight was at         On hearing of this when he returned to the room  my husband called front desk and quite snottily demanded a word with the duty manager  who I must say was great and immediately granted us a  pm check out which was hugely appreciated But   what is their problem   depressingly mean and drearily slack about sums up my impression of the Bellagio  I only hope the arrival of the Mandarin Oriental in ember brings some Asian standards of hospitality and shakes up the whole of shabby old  penny pinching Las Vegas  for the Bellagio is not alone among the    hotels in its purveyance of such low standards  in fact none of the others is any better at present   
P =>   Great  but not as good as Venetian I think this is great for a special occasion and you do feel the prestige for your money  That said the Venetian is about the same price and just seems to have the edge for the excitement factor of its features and casino The room standard of the Venetian is also better but the Bellagio pool area is the best of the hotels I ve visited unless you want lots of noise and action  The Tuscan style buildings with poplar trees and mosiac tiled pools are beautiful  Fontana lounge had a good live band playing good dancing music for the non rave type crowd  No complaints at all about the hotel but at over twice the price of some other hotels which are also great the difference isnt really worth it for more than a short visit   
P =>   Best Birthday Experience I decided to take a trip to Vegas for my   nd birthday  My amazing girlfriend decided to surprize me with a nights stay on sunday night  When I walked in the room for the first time and saw the view of the strip  lake and fountians  I grabbed my girlfriend and gave her the biggest hug and kiss  I thanked her for such a great gift but told her that we couldn t stay here for just one night  So I picked up the phone and called the front desk to check the rates for another night and couldn t pass it up so I booked for monday night  Once Tuesday morning came around  I said we can t leave yet  so I booked yet another night  The room was beautiful with a large soft bed  flat screen tv  marble bath  Oh and that view    WOW   we could watch the fountians from the large floor to ceiling window and still hear the music by tuning into channel     on the tv  The facility was beautifully decorated  a lot of attention to detail  The pool area was stunning with multiple pools and hot tubs  It was great to enjoy a cold Blue Moon while relaxing in the hot tub  We enjoyed a great breakfast in the open air at the pool cafe one of the mornings This was the cleanest hotel I have ever stayed at  The service was friendly and prompt to requests  I suggest this place to everybody I talk travel with  I will be returning to Vegas but I will be booking the Bellagio   
P =>   Gorgeously opulent and a price tag to match  SummaryWe weren t disappointed by the Bellagio at all  It is very lovely and in its own tacky way  very extravagant  marble floors next to fake plastic statues   But no details missed and walking around is fun and the pool is gorgeous  The Bellagio is well suited for both the wealthy and the not so wealthy with things like park yourself or valet  and more and less pricey restaurants and bars  We had an amazing   nights for   offer through Airmiles  well worth looking out for  Amazing day trips offered too like bouldering  dune buggying  horse riding and helpicopter rides over the grand canyon LocationGreat  in the middle of the strip  we walked down to Mandalay Bay for the Ice Bar and did a casino crawl back past many of the favourites  Taxi ride away from the cheaper casinos though when you start to feel a bit poorer   RoomsHuge and gorgeous with comfy beds  soft towels and after dinner mints in the evening  Bathroom was wonderful with two sinks  brilliant shower and large bath ServiceGenerally extremely helpful and polite but never forget to tip the drinks girls  The reception could get over busy and leave you queuing a long time for concierge etc but staff courteous about this  just should be more of them Bars and RestaurantsMake sure you get cocktails in the fountainside view bar  beautifully romantic and great cocktails  We ate in Prime  and it was wonderful  very good steak  I had mine blue which I only do if the meat is great  and the best sauce I ve ever had  Other restaurants looked nice though we wondered out on other nights  Cocktails by the pool were also very tasty  Generally they were very nice but a tad over priced  even Prime   
P =>   Bellagio  saved  Holiday As we travelled by taxi from the airport along the  strip   thought we had gone to  hell   Fortunately entering Bellagio things  looked up   A fabulous reception area decorated for Haloween and dominated by the ornate ceiling  Given a room at rear of hotel with a view over the mountains  The room was large with a bathroom that contained a huge shower  double sink and bath  Unusually the soaps and toiletries were replaced every day even if they had just been opened  seems rather wasteful  The room had the facility to open   close both sets of curtains remotely from the bed or room door and supplied with a large flat screen TV Note we were warned on registaration that the minibar and sweets nuts in room were attached to sensors and moving them could result in a charge  This was verified one day when the maid must have moved some items resulting in     being added to bill  later removed without any problem   The hotel contains a range of designer shops readily available to spend your winnings from the casino  As in all Las Vegas hotels the casino is placed so you are forced to walk through it to get to your room ar any of the restaurants There are numerous cafes and restaurants within hotel ranging from a Gelateria to a  designer chef  restaurant with prices to match  The popular Bellagio buffet has an unbelievable choice of food at a cost of around     including unlimited soft drinks  One complaint is that at peak times there are long queues which can result in a wait of up to an hour  This doesn t apply to those guests in possession of a  line pass  who can walk straight in to the restaurant  I still haven t discovered how you get this pass but assume it is for regular guests and big gamblers Overall having visited other hotels in the  strip  I would place the Bellagio in the top three with Wynn and Venetian  While we thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the Bellagio  Las Vegas holds no appeal for a return visit  
P =>  If you want class you ve found it Amazing  My boyfriend and I stayed at the Bellagio hotel from         and had a wonderful experience  Check in took about    min  which is not bad at all  Unfortunately we were not lucky enough to get an upgrade with a view  so we got a  quot Sunset Room quot  Don t be fooled by that name it means you face the mountains  The room was spacious and had a wonderful sent  the bathroom included a shower as well as separate bathtub  Room service came twice a day  and a night left chocolates and set the TV to the smooth jazz channel  There is even a set off buttons on the wall when you walk in and another set near the bed that open and clothes the curtains The Bellagio is central on the strip which was perfect for us cause we did ALOT of walking  We didn t gamble to much at the Bellagio  most of our money was spent at the Mirage  But for those who say the hotel is too smokey I don t see it  its not bad at all compare to other casinos on the strip  We attended  quot O quot  which was amazing as well  its a must see  Check out was a breeze took about   min and the lady who served us was extremely nice  she credited back some charges made to our room just as a thank you  The last hotel we stayed at was the Mirage  and they where amazing as well  So far the MGM Mirage family has been great to us and that s the family we ll be staying with next year as well  no doubt 
P =>  The Best Hotel     The hotel is a combination of luxury and entertainment   the casino is ausum  and the food court is unbelieveable   the best of all  the spa  is one of the world s finest massage parlour  and the coconut milk bath was ausum   and at the end in this place u can find whatever u want  with the ultimate shopping complex   
P => Great Hotel     Very beautiful hotel in the heart of the Strip  Good services and a nice Pool  
P =>  Fountain of delight The Bellagio is all about the dancing fountain  It s great entertainment even if you just sit by your room s window and watch it perform every    minutes  But there s more  The food in all the restaurants and the buffet can not be beat  the hotel is kept spotless  and the towels are fluffy  Want some downside  The rooms are dimly lit  Sure there are many light sources  but overall  the rooms are not designed for reading at night  I guess they want you down in the casino paying for your discounted room  Also the bathroom lighting by the sink is not positioned properly if you want to see yourself in the mirror to shave or put on makeup  Another quirk   there are no towel bars for your hand towel  We used the arms of the lamps flanking the sink to hold them   it worked  This was our second time there  We would go back  Obviously  others think the same  The place was crowded despite the current economy  It must be the specials they keep having  
P =>  Amazing beyond words It was my first time in Vegas so I wanted to do it right  So we booked ourselves into the Bellagio Hotel  It was such an amazing hotel with an amazing room  which was upgraded on check in free of charge   Check in was very quick and easy  than god as we were so excited to see the room  which was beautiful with a fantastic view  The Hotel lobby is very elegant as are the grounds  There are lots of restaurants in the hotel to choose from and the Jean Phillipe crepe shop is divine  The pool area is fab and the PINK frozen cocktails are amazng  although a bit pricey at     each but soooo worth it    I would also recommend to go see  O  Cirque De Soliel at the Hotel  it was spectacular  I would definatly recommend this hotel and will be returning soon  
P =>  The Beautiful Bellagio My husband and I celebrated our anniversary by staying at the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas  Even though we paid a discounted  quot promotional quot  rate  we were given a room located towards the middle of the hotel on a very high floor facing the fountains  It was perfect  I assumed we would automatically be given a room in the back of the hotel since we were paying the  quot promotional quot  rate  The room was very clean  comfortable  and decorated in hues of beigh and brown  The bathroom was very large  There was one large picture window in the room from which we could view the water shows every fifteen minutes until midnight  Just past the check in desk is the Bellagio Conservatory and Botanical Gardens  Each season is created with flowers  plants  trees  gazebos  bridges  ponds  and water features  It is absolutely beautiful  The staff was very friendly  and the check in out process was very easy  I would recommend this hotel  
P =>  Amazing and cant wait to go back Myself and my husband went to the Bellagio in las Vagas for his   th  we were not sure what to expect as we had never visited the USA and all our holidays are normally beach  However we went with open minds  The hotel is the best in the strip clean friendly  massive but you did not get the ching ching from the slot machines as in some of the other hotels  if you are young then this may be quite boring  if you like      hotels then this is the one  I can not think of any bad points  If you visit take some time to explore the hotel  we did this on our last day and we had missed quite a lot  water bar with real water at the bar        seeing is believing      the whole place is just fantastic  The hotel is right opp the miricle mile shopping although it does take about    min to get to it  the size of the hotels are out of this world  Quite a few touts trying to get money for  free tickets  Nothing is free in las vegas   We are currently in the process of booking back to the bellagio in e        get a lake view room and you can listen to the music whilst watching the dancing fountains  i would say that was the highlight of my hiloday I must have seen over    and not one the same  i loved it  If you do any trips go with sundance tours and ask for mark stanway   what a nice guy  iv said i would pass the name of the company as we did the gran canyon trip with them  they are a brill company and upto date hellicopters with experienced pilot   tell them pamela from england sent you  If you are unsure to visit dont worry its safe  warm and friendly and its true  its Las Vegas is the adults playground  Pamela England 
P =>  Surprising  Stayed with my husband at the bellagio and will admit that the location is perfect  It does take forever to walk to and from your room to any location  I would dread it  but its a big hotel and I loved the energy in the common area Anyway  this is the bad part  There was blood stains on our sheets  It was GROSS and I was so down when this all happened  The room was facing the water show  not too big  just an ordinary room  and we were very happy  BUT when I saw the blood stains  I was so so so disappointed  the least they could do is keep the room clean  including the sheets  YUCK  
P =>  Best Hotel Casino On The Strip We stayed at the Bellagio because my wife had a three day conference in Las Vegas  We arrived Saturday afternoon via Southwest and departed Wednesday early evening  The room rate was      weeknight  which was a bargain  it was actually cheaper than Caesars which is where her conference was  The Bellagio is everything Las Vegas is about  Everywhere you walked you experienced the  quot Wow Factor quot   It is located directly across the strip from Paris and next door to the new CityCenter complex being built  The fountains are incredible and really fun to watch at night  The fountain show does not repeat for quite sometime  so stay and watch some shows back to back  We highly recommend the Cirque De Soleil show  quot O quot   We purchased our show tickets online before we arrived they were roughly      each  We were up in the upper level  but centered and they were great seats for this type of show  HIGHLY RECOMMEND  The food is great  The people are very helpful  The rooms are incredible and very clean  Don t touch the mini fridge in the room because its weighted and you get charged if you touch anything  The pools are great  They provide the towels when you go down to the pool and they take drink orders  There are several FREE water stations  so take advantage of those  The only negative to the Bellagio is the smoke filled casino  which you have to walk through to get to your room or anywhere in the hotel  It isn t bad when you are gambling  but when you are just passing by it is annoying to smell like smoke  Internet service is        day  
P =>  Awesome   Will def go back  Had a great time   went with my husband and some friends  Stayed here before and always weel taken care of  Super customer service  beautiful facility and grounds  The only disappointment was there Fontana Bar which has live music was closed for a poke tournament  
P =>   Luxury at its best I enjoyed this hotel it is beautiful  very luxurious  comfy beds  great view from our room  I found the casino a little boring and too quiet for me  I do prefer a casino that s a little more lively and has rock music in the bars  But that is what you get with a more upscale resort  We did get excellent drink service while playing the machines  The waitress would bring me   drinks at time and I never went without a drink  she was always there  The pools were beautiful  but crowded  The only restaurant we ate at the whole time was the buffet for breakfast and dinner  it was excellent  
P =>   An exellent hotel I will start by saying that we started off in the New York New York for   nights we loved it there was such a good experience and my friend who hasnt been abroad before and without her family she really enjoyed it    but after travelling we went off to Palm Springs for   Nights and returned to Vegas for our final   nights and yes we stayed in the Bellagio and really enjoyed it although we didnt get to use the emense pools because it rained on the last day     but there is so much to do in the bellagio you have the botanical gardens lots of shops and restaurants and the rooms were great there were   of us and my mum dad and sis were in the room next door and there were doors in the rooms so we can open and see each other  the foutains are impresseve  D our fave is time to say good bye and faith hill there you ll be  i also recommend going to see mamma mia at the manadaly bay theatre    its gr  fantasticin all the hotel and location fantasticwill deffo be returning    
P =>   big and beautiful Stayed here for   nights and although I didn t like Vegas at all  I m glad we stayed at the Bellagio  It s right in the middle of the strip  it s extremely clean  the pools are gorgeous  the rooms are large  the bathrooms are plush and watching the fountain shows from the comfort of the bedroom was such a joy  especially at the weekend when the shows are on every    minutes  This was the best thing about Vegas apart from our helicopter trip to the Hoover Dam and the Grand Canyon  However  in terms of the main public areas of the hotel  I preferred Paris for its character and the Wynn for its elegance and quietness  We had Champagne brunch in the Bellagio on the Sunday and wouldn t recommend it   the food selection and quality is great  but the Champagne was nasty  we queued for over an hour  the decor inside was travel lodge esque  and even though it was a buffet  we were still expected to tip  I d never go to vegas again  but I would recommend The Bellagio to others  as long as you stay in a Lake View Room    or Paris or Wynn  but i don t know what the bedrooms are like there   
P =>   Fantastic Vegas Hotel My wife and I stayed for   nights at the Bellagio  booked through Virgin Holidays  The Hotel is superb and the service fantastic  eating out in the hotel is not expensive  try Cafe Bellagio     hours service  great food at great prices  the Buffet is one of the best in Vegas  but be careful the queues get very long especially at the weekends  We dined at Olives Resturant  slightly more esxpensive      for the two of us with wine but well worth it  fantastic food and good views of the fountain shows if you get a table outside  The rooms are great  we changed our original room as we did not like the view of the car park  the staff quickly gave us a new room overlooking the pool Go and see the  quot O quot  show by Cirqu De Soleil  outstanding  will take your breath away  A great base for a Vegas break  central to the strip and you can get about easily If you go to Vegas you must do a Canyon Tour  I went by helicopter with Sundance Tours  Limo pick up and drop off from the hotel  flight over Hoover Dam and into the Canyon where you land for a Champagne picnic then fly back out down the strip  the scenary is superb  you must do this trip Will I be going back  Soon as I can SUPERB  
P =>   Solid choice for Vegas veterans I like the Bellagio and the Venetian  both offer some degree of class at a relatively good price  The Bellagio makes its money off you once you re in the complex    there really isn t much reason to leave unless you hit a show or have your heart set on a specific restaurant  I ve stayed in the suites and in the rooms in both towers  Suites are worth the money if you can get them at a discount  The smaller rooms are unremarkable but have really big nice bathrooms    they ve all had some issues cooling the room sufficiently  but I am a polar bear   TVs are cheap and nasty  and they charge for broadband  The pool area is OK and not a zoo   If you want a pool scene for the kids and teens  go to the Mandalay   The famed fountain show is cool the first time  anyway There are some midlevel expensive restaurants in the complex and you can use the passageways to Caesar s and the Paris  which have decent options as well  In the Bellagio  I ve liked the Buffet  try to get a line jump pass   Noodles  good food and OK pricing   the walk up crepes place and the Olive restaurant  friendly and quite reasonable considering the good food  try the prix fixe   The sushi place is worth it as well  Also  the fusion cuisine place  with the water fountain outer walls  was surprisingly good and worth the money Self park  it is not much of a hassle and you don t have to pay  Get a slots card and you get some freebies  The minibar charges when you move something and getting water and cokes is a hassle  so consider bringing an ice chest with your own drinks and some snacks  Morning coffee and pastries are best accessed over at Caesar s  although the crepes place is yummy anytime  
P =>   Great Hotel   issue with mix up of the rooms My wife and I have just had   nights at the Bellagio as part of a   week trip on the West Coast  I will start by saying that overll this hotel is fantastic and has everything that you would want in a high class hotel  We had pre booked via their internet site   months ago and paid for a Salone Suite with views of the fountains  Check in was fast and helpful and our corner suite on the   th floor was just amazing   large combined bedroom and lounge with a huge bathroom and separate toilet   great spa bath with views to the strip The large windows in the lounge area looked directly down onto the lake and fountains  We would sit there late at night and watch the shows every    minutes   breathtaking Our room mix up issue started when we returned to our room late in the afternoon of the first day to find our door key would not work  this happened on   separate occasions and each time we were told it would not happen again  Next morning we were woken by the front desk at      am to be told we were illegally in the room  at the same time we had a security guard bashing on our door and telling us to show proof of identity as we should not be in the room  The  st front desk manager did not fix the problem after two more complaints and it was not till we spoke to  quot Bobby quot  that she was able to fix the issue once and for all   thanks Bobby well done  She organised a bottle of champagne and a discount off the total bill   After this the stay went perfectly  We had a birthday dinner for my wife in Circo which was great   service and food excellent with a great Aussie wine  I have stayed at the Luxor and Mirage on past trips which were both good but I would happily return to the Bellagio  
P =>   Beautiful but felt like a Prisoner  We decided to book the Bellagio because of it s location on the strip and having gambled there before  however in hindsight it s best to be a visitor to the Bellagio rather than a guest  Although the pool is beautiful and worth a look i m not a sun worshiper so i only used it once  So when you visit just pop in and have a look off the balcony Because of the layout of the hotel with the lake and fountains you feel a little bit like a captive  all the resturants food and bars are owned by the Bellagio so they run a bit of a price cartel   Even a sandwich set me back     and thats the cheapest i could find  then there s the problem of water  Thank god for the people selling ice cold bottles for     the in room water was about    and that wasn t even chilled  So you have to walk miles  firstly to get out the hotel and then to get past the lake  before you make it too the strip  then supermarkets are quite a distance but there s Miracle mile shops are across the street with some cheaper eateries and shopping Overall we had a fab time but when i come back again  and i will  i ll probably try and book the venitian if i m feeling rich or new york new york   planet hollywood for a slightly cheaper option  I d also hire a cheap car otherwise your a bit tied to the strip and it s longer than you think  
P =>   Incredible Hotel While the hotel is huge  the service was very good  I had only one problem  a gimpy television  but it was repaired pretty quickly by the hotel staff  The bathroom was great and the whole room seemed clean  One of my pet peeves in any hotel is that the AC in some places seems relatively restricted  rarely getting the room as cool as I like it to be  My room at the Bellagio got pretty cool  but never quite down to the    degree temperature I like for a hotel room  Bed was comfortable and the room was quiet There are plenty of good restaurants in the hotel and often there are lines you must suffer through to eat at these restaurants  The casino is quite nice  with various bars and lounges to visit and a pretty good sports book  I d stay there again  
P =>   Wonderful Received a   free night offer from MGM  Mirage to stay at Bellagio and jumped on it   It is a world class hotel mega resort with the finist dining and the best steak house in the country    The Prime  The hotel  Rooms were large  comfy bed   remote control blinds  classy dresser and wardrobe for clothing  Robes and slippers provided  Bath and all glass shower  Amonge the top   or rooms in Vegas  Not a place for kids The Casino  We love the casino  Its roomy  clean and smells wonderful  Great video pokers options throughout  Recomend the Allegro bar which is staffed by Joe during the day  Great drink service while you play the video poker game  If you dont win at least you have the best possible service and a good buzz   If you hang out long enough he will remember your name and drink next visit  There is every gambling option to fit any budget as well   Recomend playing the Bellagio nickles for a chance at a few hunderd thousand for    cent bet  I always stop and play at least    bucks on these every trip  Great people watching here too   Walked buy the high limit area about   am and seen a couple dropping   thousand dollar coins into a slot   Casino has great layout   We love it   Would go back again on another players card offer Food  The Prime Steakhouse is unreal  I have been here several times  Bring the big boy wallet cause it  quot  Aint Sizzler  quot  figure on a         tab for   which includes a few drinks and one of the finist Filet s you will ever eat  I recomend sharing desert  Ask for a table over looking the fountians when making your reservations  Other food options are available   The Bellagio cafe has great food          Olives is unique and good  Several other places as well  Common area  Flower garden is awsome and the glass sculpture in the lobby is one of the neatest things you will ever see  There is so much to see here you could spend two days soaking int the art and decore  A must stay at least once  Pools were the only thing i didnt enjoy   Kinda stuffy and a place to be seen   I would rather party at MGM pools anyday  Even though the pools were nice it just seemed fake  Other places have better atmosphere in the pool area  
P =>   Perfect Location  If you are traveling to Las Vegas  make sure you book a hotel which is located in the middle of the strip  We decided to book   Rooms in the Bellagio  one for my husband and myself and the other one for our kids  Nice HD TVs  Staff was very friendly   even for a hotel in that size  The outdoor area was amazing  They really have a nice swimming pool  The fountains in front of the Hotel are one  quot Must see quot  attraction in Las Vegas  We had our rooms facing the strip  so we were able to have a look at the fountains every night  The buffet dinner in the Bellagio is not the best  but okay  I prefer to dine at the Paris Hotel But in overall it was one nice stay in Las Vegs and we would book this Hotel again  
P =>   Hotel To Be At    My Gf and I stayed here for   nights  We got the deluxe room  with the pool view  on the   th floor area  Room was very clean and comfy  My gf likes the bathroom lol  The maid came twice a day to make sure your room is nice and clean  when you return from your nite out We ate at the Cafe  food is good  The buffet isnt all that great  go to the Wynn if you want LV best buffets  We got to relax at the pool area  the damn pool is only   ft deep  LOL    free for guest which was nice  Make sure you stop by the ice cream area when you leave  best ice cream ive ever had D  
P =>   Superb service from beginning to end I really believe that the Bellagio experience begins when dealing directly with one of the brilliant reservationists  Not only are they gracious and helpful  but they can let you know exactly the type of room available as well as alert you to special packages  Yes  it is possible to spend less by going through one of several on line agencies  but you will miss the interaction with the staff and will have to accept whatever accommodations are assigned or spend valuable time bickering over a room change  We checked in around     PM and expected chaos  Not only was there a sufficient number of staff available at check in  but rooms were availabe  probably due to the huge inventory of rooms in general  Our room  a fountain view room on the   th floor  was not overly large but had a full  frontal view of the fountains  Amazing  The only negatives we found anywhere were the dents in the carpeting  I m not sure how they got there  but it is time to replace the carpeting or risk consequences if someone were to trip  The first thing I did after checking in was to let my wife unpack and read the hotel information while I explored the hotel to determine distances and locations of the places we intended to visit  I must say that I am impressed that it is possible to walk down the many corridors without having to wallking through the casinos or game rooms  And the noise is not nearly as deafening as that in other hotels  I picked up our tickets for  quot O quot  at the Concierge Desk  book these on line or directly with the concierge  same price  and returned to the room We explored two dining options  For the first night  we decided on the Cafe Bellagio  just as previous reviewers described  a hotel coffee shop with perhaps a little class in the service  The food will be Ok if you stick to simple preparations  For the second night  we could not resist Circo with its magnificent pasta and whimsical decor  The service and food presentation were excellent  and this is a place to which we would gladly return and spend lots more  The Fontana Bar opens at       Get there at      to be seated outside on the terrace  For     you can nurse your stellar libation for as long as you wish  Although many reviewers recommend the buffets for breakfast  we decided to order via room service and split our food  extra coffee cup and silverware at no extra charge  One continental breakfast was perfect for the two of us  On our first morning we split an excellent breakfast burrito Checking out was also perfect  You can access your account on the TV and be done with it  or check out down below  A taxi was soon ready to whisk us to the car rental agencies a couple of miles away from the airport  All of this was done with impeccable timing and coutesy I hope that management reads all these reports  and I suspect some might have done so  given the improvements made after previous reviewers pointed out flaws  I can only hope that improvements continue so that the Bellagio remains one of the leading hostelries of the country  
P =>   Awesome  This is probably the best hotel I ve ever stayed at  We had a lake view room that we got for a fairly good rate  The room was extremely comfortable  and the view was magnificent  I would definitely recommend this hotel  which I think is the best in Vegas  
P =>   Can t Wait to Go Back We arrived before check in time and we were allowed to check in  It was qick and easy  The room was spacious and the bed was comfortable  The bathroom was also spacious and clean  The only problem was the vanity mirror was about to fall off the wall because one of the screws broke off  Each night we would get the bed turn down with chocolate on our pillows  The buffet was excellent they had almost every type of food you could imagine  The location was excellent  Bellagio is located midway along the strip and everything was within walking distance  There is also a double decker bus that runs on the strip which you can buy a    hour pass and ride all day and night  We rode the bus to the old strip and it took about half an hour  We woud definitely stay here again  
P =>   Incredible First Class Outstanding I would highly recommend the Bellagio  We had a Penthouse Suite on the   nd floor  It was incredible with great views  We had his and her bathrooms with cozy robes and slippers  The service was top notch and the staff went out of their way to make sure everything was perfect  And the bed was heavenly  
P => 	 Years of Memories We celebrated our   yr wedding anniversary by staying at the beautiful Bellagio Hotel  For   days and   nights we experienced problems each day  We paid extra to stay on a higher floor with a view of the strip  they said we only paid for a room on the  th floor and a view of the freeway  second  the toilet made flushing sounds at  am   am and  am  They moved us twice and were told to confirm by using the white courtesy phones   although no one picked up we were kept on hold listening to a recording  The one saving grace is that this hotel really is very beautiful  they do have compassionate hosts  impeccable service including the valet and because of all this  yes we would stay here again  
P =>   GRANDIOUS at the Bellagio I m so glad we stayed at the Bellagio   after now having checked out all the other resorts on the strip  they are all quite dark and creepy except for Bellagio  Caesars Palace and Wynn Encore  Bellagio is well worth it  especially since we live in the UK where everything is SO expensive  At just over US     night for a deluxe room  and we got an upgrade to a Lake View   its a BARGAIN  The rooms and amenities are great    the Pool Cafe is divine  Very very grand    
P =>   Wonderful Hotel  We checked into the Bellagio after a disasterous start to our Las Vegas holiday at the Luxor  see my other review  and we were most certainly glad we switched  Amazing   From the very moment we arrived and were checked in by the super efficient Walter we were made to feel like VIP s  The hotel is stunning and its definitely worth upgrading to a fountain view room  You can sit in large comfortable chairs in the comfort of your room watching the fountains and listening to the music on the surround sound  The rooms are huge  we had a standard king  and the bathroom was perfect   huge tub  shower and fluffy thick towels  although a bit small  oh and huge comfy bed full of pillows  We ate breakfast twice at the Cafe Bellagio   approx     for eggs  hash browns  amp  bacon     for juice  huge glass and freshly squeezed  and    for coffee  Slightly expensive but hey   its Vegas  Would I stay there again    most definitely  We cant wait to return  
P =>   Fab Hotel too many people I loved the Bellagio  the staff were really nice  The rooms were lovely  we overlooked the swimming pools  The rooms were equiped with everything you could possible need  except coffee machine which would have been nice  There was even an iron which I was very surprised as I thought it would be all valet service  The bathroom was fabulous with a bath as well as a shower  The location is great as it is at the very centre of the strip and everything around  The only thing I found a bit of a nuisance was all the people around the entrance and in the foyer  I know everyone wants to have a look at the Bellagio as it is so beautiful but you almost have to fight your way in  The buffet was really nice even though there was a big queue it soon went down and it was well worth the     or whatever it was  
P =>   The Fountains Save this Hotel  The title really nails it here  The Bellagio is nothing without the Fountains  It s the ONLY reason we stayed here on a last minute decision to spend another night in Vegas to catch Frank Calliendo at the Monte Carlo  Check in took a little time but the client le are the reason there  Pleasant overall   though not very friendly This hotel is now over    years old  The casino is one of my least favorite on the strip  The Tropicana holds the lowest in my opinion  It s a massive sprawling goliath of a casino which I didn t care for much  The Palazzo wins on appearance in my book  The elevators are showing their age now too  But this is a nice hotel physically  Great shops too to look at in wonder at the prices The bedrooms aren t a winner though  I bumped up the reservation to get a lake view  If it weren t for the lake view and the Fountains  I d have left  The rooms are terrible  Very cramped and very dated now too  Dark and drab in appearance  The bathroom is large but poorly laid out  The shower isn t powerful enough to rinse your shampoo from your hair on its own either  The In Room Dining here though is very good  High praise indeed for price and quality and service  Beats the Palazzo hands down The biggest killer here though is the internet charge  By far the most expensive I ve seen anywhere         for    hours is absolutely ridiculous  Unforgivable  Seriously overpriced  And the kick in the nuts if you don t have WiFi is that you have to buy the CAT e cable from the minibar unless you pack your own  Sickener Again it s the fountains that kept me here  That is all  
P =>   All fluff and none of the good stuff  My husband and I stayed one night at the Bellagio Hotel and it will be our last  Not only was the room small and outdated  we were awakened at      a m  with an alarm sounding in the hall with an announcement being repeated over and over again  We finally called the front desk to ask if we were to vacate our foom and were told no  they were still investigating the alarm and we would be notified  About    minutes later  we got another alarm and more repeated announcements that we could ignore the first ones  The personnel were pleasant for the most part  but the valet was a bit rude  I enjoyed the Palazzo and the Wynn much more  
P =>   Best Bet Stayed here for three nights and upgraded to suite  excellent room but facing strip  Our friends did not upgrade and took their fountain view rooms which were smaller but much more visually exciting  We ate each day at the buffet which was excellent but ate once at Olives which was disappointing and expensive  Visited other hotels and Bellagio is the best bet for anyone visiting for a few days  staff were helpful and no queues on reception as others have faced perhaps due to recession  
P =>   A good safe bet if you are new to this type of experience     First trip to Las Vegas  I ve always pronounced it  quot lass quot  but locally we heard  quot loss quot  Vegas    wonder why   and  prior to travel  thought of it as a  once in a lifetime  sort of holiday  Done the Mediterranean Canaries and looking for something extra Travelled direct from the UK with Virgin because I didn t want a    hour or longer trip via somewhere else  Wanted a location on the strip with bright lights to look at so we picked an hotel in the middle and  having heard good things about Bellagio from friends  booked a room with a lake view which also means you look across to the  Eiffel  Tower  Hadn t thought too much about the weather but ober proved a good choice     degrees  clear blue sky and good for both walking around town and lazing by the pool  Spent a lot of time wondering around the strip  Lions at MGM  volcano at Mirage  ship battle at TI     mind boggling  And Glitter Gulch is amazing if you like bright lights and street artists  Couldn t see the attraction of the slot machines and didn t want the formality expense of fine dining every day  saved our money for a helicopter trip to Grand Canyon and  O  performance at Bellagio  both jaw droppingly spectacular in very different ways  Buffet breakfast at Bellagio was a good way of starting the day  after that we topped up carbs and calories with visits to Panda Express and Denny s  People seem to rave about the quality of the US buffet experience  it s good but happens all over Europe these days  Looking back  the holiday was great because we did it our way  Dressed down market  ate relatively  but still a shock now that             cheaply but stayed in   start comfort in a   star location  Saw the Grand Canyon  Saw a fantastic theatre show  Beyond that  you d be asking a lot if you want perfection from hotels which have       rooms and cater for as many breakfasts  We arrived when check in was empty and have nothing but praise for US customs clearance  taxi driver and hotel staff  All friendly and informative  And make use of Concierge and anyone else whose job is to help  they know their stuff  I ve read other reviews where people weren t so lucky  Hey ho  Luck of the draw Last word on the room  If you ve never measured the size of your bedroom      sq ft is more than enough for   people  Can be a distraction when you see other hotels with maybe     sq ft on split levels  Bellagio is a little dated and quaint  Wynn is perhaps more modern and a younger image   And the lake view comes at a cost   the booming noise of the water feature every    minutes till midnight  but are you really going to go to bed before midnight in LV   Last word on the holiday booking experience  Tried through Virgin Holidays  eBookers and Last minute  Ended up with Last minute but  over several days  all of them showed a variety of availability and prices  One day a holiday would not be available and the next it was back on again  What s that all about  Last word on price  there are cheaper indirect ways of flying into LV and plenty of motels near the strip  You still see the same sights    s pose it just depends what price you put on comfort  
P =>   Bellagio is still our favorite hotel on the strip  We just returned from a   night stay at the Bellagio with our    year old daughter  We booked a package through Frontier Airlines and we upgraded our room to a fountain view when we arrived at the hotel for     per night   It is definitely worth it to have such an amazing view of both the fountains and the Paris Resort at night We did try the buffet for dinner one evening and enjoyed the food for its quality and variety and had breakfast and gelato at the cafe and a delicious lunch at the pool cafe Overall I would have to state that the Bellagio is an incredible hotel in facilities and services  Phone requests are complied with immediately and everyone has a  quot can do quot  attitude  Our room was immaculate and very enjoyable  the proximity to shopping  dining and shows is so convenient  This was our third stay at this hotel and we intend to return again   
P =>   It is okay I think the hotel ihas been overated taking into consideration with the price we paid for the hotel with a family of four including two teenagers   The hotel is very spacious however the room is not that great and we could have got the same size of room at a much lower rate at a different hotel rated at two stars  The package including our fare from Calgary alberta for   nights was over          and it is definitely not worthy  My recommendation to anyone planning a trip to Las Vegas is to shop around for a better deal to the amount of money spent  There are a lot of great hotels with bigger rooms like Mandelay Bay  the Venitian etc  After we checked out and settled the bill there was no mention of thank you for the stay from staff members at the front desk  
P =>   Lived up to expectations Thought the hotel was as beautiful inside as it is in the common areas and the outside  The room was very decadent  I stayed for a convention at the hotel and would recommend the spa towers instead of the regular towers  It was quite a hike between the ballrooms and the rooms  One of the best burgers I had was at snacks  Cafe Gelato was unbelievable  and Circo was a fantastic meal  
P =>   Romantic stay at Bellagio  I stayed   days at Bellagio in uary       The weather was a little too cold and you need to get a warm jacket  but otherwise the trip was beautiful  We stayed in a room facing the fountains and the view was beautiful  Every    minutes they will start  The shows takes abaout   minutes  so essentially every    minutes you can hear them  One night we had dinner across the street at Mon Ami  Gabi  at the Paris Resort  amp  Casino  on the terase  We listned to the fountain show while having dinner  It was extreamly romantic  I loved it  Good spot for pictures too  The hotel was fantastic  very elegant  very clean  It is a perfect place for a romantic gettaway We will probably go back and stay at Bellagio as well  The only other choise that I can think of is Venetian  but only if we can t find a room at Bellagio  
P =>   Perfect Stay  My husband and I just returned from a wonderful stay at the Bellagio  Check in was quick  We were provided with a room on the   th room facing the fountains  It was perfect  We enjoyed our view every day  I usually find that with strip view hotel rooms it s neat the first day and then you just stop looking at it  but not at the Bellagio  We d sit and watch the fountains every day and night of our stay  Location was outstanding Room was great  Very spacious  The TV is the only thing  quot dated quot  in my opinion  But we really never watched more than    minutes of it a day anyways and it was a descent size  so I have no complaints about it  The bathroom was also large and very comfortable  Be warned though  the toilet flushes like an airplane one would     it scared the heck out of me the first time I heard it    The hotel and casino areas are very nice and very busy  Unlike some  we like that  I hate staying at a quiet location  Perhaps that s due to our age  but we love staying a properties that have a lot of action and descent night life  The clubs lounges at the Bellagio were always busy by the way  The casino is a little smokey  but I find they all are to some degree  As a non smoker  this did not bother me Check out was very quick  Check out is Noon and we didn t get out of our room until  pm  with no one hasseling us to hurry up either  Housekeeping stopped by thinking we might be staying another night Service was very good  We needed a mini fridge and it was up to our room within   minutes of us getting to our room  Then within   minutes of that our phone rang with someone checking to ensure our fridge had arrived  That was nice We ate at Fix  expensive  but awesome  We really enjoyed our meal there  both ordered the  quot drunken lobster quot    excellent    The buffet was suprisingly so good that we ate dinner there twice  Outstanding And while there may be newer  more modern luxury hotels on the strip  perhaps Wynn Encore   the Bellagio will be our first choice  The hotel is outstanding and the location is perfect  I highly recommend this hotel  
P =>   Beautiful hotel I have to admit that my expectations were already pretty high for the Bellagio so any little thing that wasn t perfect stood out  Really the only negatives were that the front desk staff were not exceptionally helpful and that I wish there had been stations to print out my boarding pass where I didn t have to pay  I ended up doing it for free at the concierge  but that is still a bit inconvenient for today s hotel standards   If those are my only complaints  then this place is still a fabulous hotel  The style is more  quot traditional quot  than the Wynn  and the buffet is not too expensive at      
P =>   Great hotel but expensive stayed in the bellagio for   night fab location on the stripe very expensive to eat and drink at hotel but loads of places to eat just up the road room was very nice very clean and big  pools where first class very clean went in lots of the hotels and would stay in them for a lot less money but the experance was good  
P =>   what a place stayed for    nights       to       third time at the bellagio what a place great location great room no complaints at all staff fantastic cannot come up with any negatives at all    had a problem charging my english cellphone but maintenance man had it sorted within   minutes of me making a call great service    would reccomend to anyone young or old fantastic base to explore the strip  
P =>   We re staying at the Bellagio don t you know  If you haven t already heard the Bellagio mentioned  you will when you stay there    The fountains are amazing and worth catching several times to compare the show when done to pop music  classical music or showtunes Massive hotel  but friendly staff  Beautiful building  lovely comfortable rooms and fantastic views over Las Vegas and Nevada   Just don t touch the minibar    Definitely in the best part of the strip and so convenient for other hotels and attractions  Whenever anyone asked where we were staying  when we said Bellagio  people always nodded approvingly    not that it mattered  but it s clearly well regarded and deservedly so in my opinion  Worth checking out the restaurants  Sensi was one of the nicest meals I ve ever eaten  and the cafes  cakes to die for  too My big tip is the show    We saw  quot O quot  by Cirque du Soleil  which takes place in the Bellagio  and after deciding to book tickets  we were thrilled to find we got a massive     off as we were hotel residents  A real unexpected bonus to staying there  
P =>   Top of the Line  The Bellagio is the benchmark for Las Vegas resorts  Eschewing kitch or otherwise limiting themes  this hotel simply aims for excellence in decor  amenities  shopping  and restaurants  Indeed  the superlative restaurants are what will bring us back to Las Vegas  We might also gamble a little  
P =>   Loved the Bellagio Visited the Bellagio from             for a girls trip to celebrate my best friend s birthday  We stayed in the Spa Tower room        Had a great view of the fountains  Paris  and Planet Hollywood  The room was pretty nice    the bathroom was great  The hotel was just so grand  I loved the fall decor in the hotel  The bakery was to die for    had yummy crepes  We ate at Noodles and Cafe Bellagio while there  The highlight of the trip was seeing Cirque du Soleil  quot O quot    which was phenomenal  This was my  th show and by far the greatest  We visited the Palms for a pool party  Rio for all you can eat crab and lobster  and ate at Delmonico s in the Venetian  We enjoyed shopping in the Bellagio and Fashion Mall  Ordered my friend s birthday cake from nearby Freed s bakery Vegas was great    we re already planning the next trip  The only bummer was the   hour time difference from Atlanta to Vegas  I woke up at      every morning  
P =>   Great Hotel     but not worth the price tag in my opinion We decided to splurge a little with a stay at the Bellagio  I ve stayed at other hotels on the strip  and in the end they are all about the same  Sure  Bellagio is very nice  but I really don t think you get what you pay for  The only staff members that are really attentive to your needs  are the maids  I asked the girl in charge of our room for a toothbrush and tooth paste  and the following day she asked if I needed some more toothpaste  She was sweet enough to remember what I had asked for the day before  which is hard to do when you re in charge of a whole floor of rooms  I think that s one of the main reasons why I didn t LOVE this hotel  you see different faces everyday with no personal one on one contact with employees  I felt like I was just a room number  Sure the hotel is gorgeous  and so is the pool  but not very attentive to the small details people appreciate  I m glad I stayed here  but I probably wouldn t do it again unless the price was comparable to some of the other hotels on the strip  
P =>   What happens in Vegas     The Bellagio lives up to its reputation as a first class casino resort  The hotel is centrally located on the strip which I found very convenient  The staff were all friendly and the cleanliness exceeded my expectations  The pool was never over crowded and we were always able to find a chair  and the drink girls came by often   There are great restaurants in the hotel and fun night life too  We spent two afternoons at spa Bellagio  The spa is only available for guests but  if you do decide to stay there  make sure you schedule a service   
P =>   Another nice stay at the Bellagio We recently took advantage of a discount email from the Bellagio and stayed   nights in a lakeview room  The room was great for the price  the staff was friendly and helpful and we had a very enjoyable stay  We also saw the Cirque de Soleil show  quot O quot  at the Bellagio and it was very impressive BTW the  quot riage can be Murder quot  show at the Fitzgerald was very funny  and the food was great  
P =>   Wow Fantastic Hotel   My partner and I stayed at the Bellagio for   nights in ust     and loved it  The hotel lived up to all our expectations  Our room was on the   th floor overlooking the Rio and Palms Hotels  The room was large with a seating area  floor to ceiling window and a huge marble bathroom  The restaurants in the hotel are really good especially Prime where we had the best steaks we d ever had  The hotel is so clean and not tacky like some of the others  although this is Vegas so being tacky is not a bad thing   We also booked a helicopter trip to the Grand Canyon through the concierge which was great  recommend Maverick Helicopter trips   This is without a doubt a fantastic hotel which lives up to it s name   
P =>   Wonderful hotel We stayed at the Bellagio when we went to Vegas and it was a wonderful choice  The Bellagio is a beautiful hotel with all the comforts  Our view was magnificent  the Bellagio fountains and the Paris hotel  We also liked that with all the walking  our hotel was in a great location and we could always go back to our room and rest a bit  At the chocolatier I had the best sandwich I ve ever eaten  It was a truly wonderful experience and our best part of the trip was staying at the Bellagio  Can t wait to return  
P =>   simply fantastic stayed at the Bellagio for   nites had beautiful mtn views room was awesome 
P =>   Gorgeous hotel excellent staff amazing food  We had a wonderful two night stay here  The hotel facility is spectacular  The location was perfect for walking the Strip  The restaurants we tried were all wonderful   especially Sense  
P =>  Awesome Hotel Food Expensive I have to say that I have been to Las Vegas many times and stayed at MGM Grand  Rio  Monte Carlo  Bally s  and Mandalay Bay and this by far is the best hotel of all of them The servie was excellent  We had a standard deluxe room and immediately the staff at the hotel was so polite When we were walking to our room we passed two housekeepers and maintenance person all of which stopped and said  quot Hello and enjoy your stay here quot   This happened throughout our stay  Nobody was rude as far as the staff The room was very nice and clean  It had a great soakers tub which my wife enjoyed and excellent shower  The only bad thing I found with the room was I wish it had free internet or wifi at least and The lighting was okay  It had plently of lights in bathroom and by the bed but had nothing that was bright enough for the whole room unless you turned on all the lights  The A C was okay I think it could be designed better for better flow but I was comfortable The resort is gorgeous with the garden area  pool area was suberb and they made you show a room key to get into the area which was nice  There was plenty of chairs to lounge in and plenty of people to get drinks if you wanted  They had   pools with   heated to I would say mid    s at   AM and   hot tubs sort of hidden which was nice The only thing I have to say I was shocked over which I guess for this resort you should expect was food prices  My wife and I had pancakes  waffles  and fruit plate with OJ and Coffe and the bill was over      This was at the    hr cafe and not some fancy restaurant  The next morning we both got coffee and   pastries to share at the coffee store  Bellagio s Starbucks  and that was      I understand it is high class hotel and the food was excellent but for those kind of places I would expect a little higher charge since at the location and on strip but still think little overpriced and will definetly remember if we stay here again The rest of the meals we ate along the strip and found some good options We went with some friends also and visited the Burger Bar and Minus   at Mandalay Bay  The Burger Bar was excellent but expect to pay about     per person with soda and meal  Minus   was unique experience and will never forget it but no cameras allowed except theirs of course and pricey to get in but well worth doing once in your lifetime  Other than that we did the usual stops on strip which we always enjoy watching the fountains  volcano  gandala rides  etc In summary I would definetly stay again at the Bellagio but will definetly not eat at any of the restaurants or shops and walk little bit to get better prices for good quality food  
P =>  Nice but too expensive We stayed at Bellagio for   nights  Everything is beautiful  the lobby  the restaurants  the pool  however  it is very expensive and I did not feel the room was anything extraordinary for what we paid for it  If I stood against the window i could see the fountains  so we didn t even have the most expensive room  I think you can find a nicer  larger room and better amenities at other strip hotels  I like the Venetian Palazzo very much  The rooms are much larger  and the service just as good and the rates about     the Bellagio  The Wynn Encore rooms are huge  the beds amazing  although they too charge outrageous fees for simple things like snacks or drinks   and no more expensive than Bellagio  My favorite strip hotel is TheHotel at mandalay bay  It is pure luxury  It costs about the same as the Bellagio  but it is a true suite    rooms separated by a door  with plenty of space  Impeccable service  
P =>  Gorgeous View We stayed at Bellagio for our anniversary and had a fountain view room  The view was absolutely breath taking  We turned the TV to the station that played the fountain music and watched the fountains over and over again  It was gorgeous   
P =>  Always wonderful  As always the Bellagio was fabulous  Our room was clean and comfortable with an amazing view of the fountain  The staff is exceptional  We dined at Michael Mina for the first time and it was such a nice experience   quot O quot  was amazing  I highly recommend the Bellagio  It takes your Vegas vacation up a notch for sure  
P =>  Beautiful hotel centrally located on the strip This hotel lobby was beautiful  Indoor garden area with beautiful flowers and birds Outdoor entrance elegant and staff very helpful  Would definitely stay there again The pools are the best I ve seen  
P =>  Class in the middle of Las Vegas  Best location right in the middle of the strip  I think this is one of the most expensive hotels on the boulevard  but when you step in  you realize why      diamonds    The facilities are awesome  you can see art and class everywhere  Try the suites facing the Strip and fountains  Helpful staff    Excellent place for our honeymoon   quot What I liked the best was the buffet breakfast  quot  it was rated the best restaurant in Vegas and I strongly agree  Beautiful pool where you can lay all day  The casino is of the  quot expensive ones quot  but is elegant  funny and safe  My only complain was trying to eat something at midnight and did not find anything besides standing in line for buffalo wings    No doubt I would come back  
P =>    th birthday bash Great value  wonderful room  very clean  housekeeping members were great  check in and check out was easy  One beautiful hotel property  
P =>  wonderful bellagio    We have just come back from a trip to Vegas for my birthday   I can t fault the hotel  the lobby pool shops bars all brilliant with excellent service and friendly people  The casino was great fun with a huge amount of choice and again friendly staff We had a lake view room overlooking the fountains  you could put the tv on and it would play the music in your room that the fountains were dancing to   spectacular  We ate breakfast in the hotel  buffet style but nothing like you would get in England it was amazing with so much choice and all lovely  think it was about     so well worth it We also ate by the pool for lunch which was great and really nice  We had room service one night which was also fab   the cleaning staff were great and tidied our room not once but twice a day Some of the reviews on here are moaning about the cost etc but you are going to Vegas   save up   and it s not that expensive The only thing I would say is we tried to get into The Bank  Bellagio s night club  but we were told guest list only which we thought was wrong as we were staying in the hotel All in all we had the most wonderful holiday and the hotel was fabulous 
P =>  First time in Vegas and it was awesome    Stayed at the Bellagio  Even if you have to book it   or   months in advance it is worth it  I got a great deal on bookit com  but the hotel is gorgeous and the food was the best  We were able to check in early and I called the day before check out and they even gave us an extra hour to check out later We saw the  quot O quot  show  it is amazing  The food at Yellowtail was great  At least try their Rock Shrimp appetizer   it is soooo good  I told them I was celebrating my husband s birthday and they had a birthday card signed by all the staff waiting for him at the table  We also went to The Bank nightclub  which was very chic and hip if you like to party  Overall  I don t know that I will stay anywhere else when we go back  My only negative is  and this is only because my mother in law had this issue  if you are playing the slots at Bellagio don t think the waitresses will be coming by to check on you  I guess they don t have as much staff as they use to  and all the waitresses are at the poker tables instead waiting on those gamblers  My mother in law was mad because she had to get up and ask for a drink  I did not really gamble  so personally I don t care  Besides  I know there are plenty of other casinos that have lots of waitresses ready and waiting for the slot players  
P =>  The more you pay the less you get Why is it that the more expensive the room  the less you get  After paying      per night  Labor Day weekend  the Bellagio charges     for the Internet and does not have a refrigerator  microwave or in room coffee  Judging from the guests schlepping their cases of beer the     yards from the parking garage  through the casino  to the guest elevators  there was going to be a lot of ice in the whirlpool tubs  The pools are plenty  but the guests place a towel on the chairs early in the AM and the hotel does not enforce the no squatting rules leaving the rest searching for a place to sit  Then the pools close at   PM  you must gamble   vs  most hotels that stay open until    PM  The bathrooms are fabulous  but save your money and stay elsewhere  
P =>  BEST HOTEL WE HAVE STAYED IN IN VEGAS SO FAR Belllagio is the best hotel that we have stayed in Vegas  We have been to Vegas    times and in the last year have stayed at Bellagio three times   The staff is personable and anything is yours for the asking  We requested a fan for our room and it was promptly brought to us without a fee  The rooms are spacious and neat with chocolate being delivered each night along with turn down service and replennished towels and glasses  The casino is great nice size  Only complaint was we didn t win much  As they say these massive casinos arn t built on winners  All in all a great hotel   We are planning returning in the spring  
P =>  A beautiful hotel  This was a beautiful hotel  The lobby is just gorgeous  The service is wonderful  The pool is absolutely gorgeous  My only complaint is that the casual food   i e  breakfast  etc  was quite expensive and they charged      a day per person  to use the fitness center  
P =>  absolutely beautiful hotel My husband and I stayed at the Bellagio in e  This hotel is absolutely beautiful  The pools were my favorite I could have spent a week there alone  The only downside was the buffet  The food and service were both horrible  I would stay at Bellagio again since the location and hotel itself is beautiful  but I would go somewhere else to eat  
P =>  beautiful view beautiful view of the fountain  great location  the bellagio was also playing the show  quot O quot  in its hotel and it was fantastic  highly recommended   
P =>  Delightful  Like the grande dame that she is  the Bellagio showed a wee bit of wear and tear in the room furnishings  but was overall scrumptiously elegant and gracious  Their famous restaurants were out of our price range and the terrace restaurant food less than memorable  but the hotel staff was stellar and the casino the most fun one on the strip  Watch for specials on their rate calendar    you can occasionally find a bargain like we did  allowing us to stay in a hotel I d always dreamed of visiting  
P => Rooms are dated need updates For the price  I would have expected Bellagio to be way better than Paris  Everything else is super    
P => Las Vegas   It s not all about gambling  We were in Las Vegas for   nights and had a really total experience  We stayed at the Bellagio and it was beautiful  The rooms were spacious  we had a partial view of the water fountain show but saw it all  Lovely pools and spa  There is a wonderful conservatory  that changes seasonally  and has animated items  glass metal sculpture  amp  gorgeous plants  People who didn t stay at the hotel came to see the conservatory and world s largest chocolate fountain Yes  we gambled  but we also visited other hotels  saw CHER  who put on the show of a lifetime  saw  quot O quot   the Circque de Soleil show in water  which was incredible staging  performance and sensory overload  and we took the Pink Jeep Tour of the Hoover Dam which included floating in a pontoon in the water below the Dam Emeril s Delmonico Steakhouse at the Venetiain and Michael Mina s at the Bellagio were outstanding  A lot of the restaurants were offering prix fixe because of the economy It was just the right amount of time and mixture of things to do  
P => 	days at Bellagio with adult kids and their partners The weather was incredibly hot with   of the    days breaking     degrees  so any walking at all was uncomfortable  To add to the misery  one side of LVB from Harmon up to MGM was closed down  with pedestrians having to walk in a dirt and sand mixture in what was once the street When we arrived at Bellagio  the young man behind the desk was great  Saxton   I told him that my kids and their BF GF would be joining me at the end of the week and I wanted a penthouse for the last   nights  I requested an upgrade for my own room and he complied with a deluxe room The day before my kids were supposed to be picked up by limo and transported to the hotel for our stay in the Penthouse  I attempted to confirm the arrangements in the Executive check in and they acted like they never heard of it before  It took several  quot are you sure quot  and  quot who did you talk to quot  before they realized their mistake and sent a car I had booked   bedroom Penthouse with adjoining Tower Room           per night  and once again got the dummy treatment  The girls at the executive check in desk told me there were no radjoining rooms available even though I had booked the Tower room for just this reason  I had to stay in a room seperate from my family and they acted like they were doing me a favor by allowing me to remain on the same floor I had also pre booked Spa appointments for my daughter and my son s girlfriend and had selected the  quot Bellagio special quot  for       apiece from the spa menu  When the girls returned  I saw on my bill  which they were not given and I had to check it on line  that they were charged         APIECE    Again  my calls were met with transfers to empty phone lines  In summation  even though we enjoyed our stay at Bellagio and the amenities are superior  service and record keeping were terrible  They ll have to kiss my butt with a great offer before I return  
P =>  Exquisite  Would definetly go back  The hotel staff was extremely accomodating  Had a room in the Spa tower overlooking the fountains   amazing  Great central location  
P =>  Very Classy and Beautiful We stayed at the Bellagio for   nights in tember    what a beautiful hotel it is  Getting to the hotel from Car Rental pick up was simple and the parking garage is huge so you always find a spot and its free    Check in was a breeze  no lines granted we checked in after midnight on a Friday   Receptionist was very pleasant    she give us a room on the   th floor with the most amazing view of the strip  Paris was right in front of us and the Bellagio water show   what a view     Everything about our room at the Bellagio was great  The food at the Bellagio Buffett was excellent    but the wait and line to get seated is very very long   I guess because its that good and the price is great for all you can eat  Saw two shows while in Vegas   Zumanity at NYNY Hotel is a must see with your partner   great show  Also saw Legends in Concert   that too was great   Everthing about our trip was great   from the flight  to the car rental  the hotel our independent trips to Hoover Dam and the Grand Canyon  For the trip to Grand Canyon you will need a whole day and night  we left the Bellagio around     am and got back to the hotel around   pm  
P =>  Fabulous Hotel We went to Vegas for a wedding and managed to get a great pkg deal from SW  The pkg included airfare  room  transfer to and from airport  a couple of excursions and a show  we didn t use excursions or shows due to other commitments   We had the Standard Rm at the Bellagio and it was great  The front desk tried to upsell another room w a view at check in  but we waited until we saw the room No need for an upgrade  it was great  The bathroom was   X   and a great big glass enclosed shower  A view of the fountains and Vegas  Staff were great  bed was more than comfortable  turned down at night  hotel beautiful  If I actually had money  I d stay there at full price  
P =>  Great Great Great Got great deal for Bellagio  It was luxury  The Buffet serves great food of all discriptions and very reasonable  Went for snooze  afernoon and when we came home that evening the bed had been changed   Casino spotless staff very helpful big or small roller treated with the same courtesy  Loved it 
P =>  Surprise   th Wonderful at Bellagio    I took my husband to Las Vegas for his surprise   th birthday  I booked a room at Bellagio and am sooo glad I did  The other option for us would have been Venetian but I m SO glad we did not stay there  The smell in the Venetian is enough to make me sick  which is sad that it s such a beautiful place but the smell is HORRIBLE  Checking in at Bellagio was a breeze  We were upgraded from our deluxe  non lake view  room for     a night more we got a Salon Suite on the   nd floor lake view  It was amazing and for that price we could not pass it up  That was only     on top of the riduculously great rates I got through bellagio com  Overall  we were very happy  I think the lady checking us in gave us a great deal as far as the upgrade price goes b c we told her it was my husbands birthday  I can t imagine it s really only     more a night to have a huge suite with a wonderful view  We will definitely stay there again  
P =>  wonderful as usual but still no coffee      this was our  nd stay at bellagio and both times the fountain veiw room   believe me   it s the only way to go   great food play stay and shows for sure with one exception   it seems quite small in the big picture but why no coffee in the rooms   room service or the    min walk paying     for   coffees is a bit much   we re not world travelers but have stayed at quite a few luxury hotels and they all have coffee in the rooms   i realize the scope of the investment with      s of rooms but a free hot coffee in the morning with a coffee maker vs looking at the outragiously expensive snack drinks vending machine that seldom gets used would make the patron feel much more welcomed   our plan has been to visit vegas every   years   this is our  rd venture and no doubt will make the bellagio our home away from home again     
P =>  AWSOME HOTEL   We went there after our wedding on y  The hotel is so beautiful with great service  The location is also great too  it has Planet Hollywood on the opposite side and close bus stops around  Their service is really good  room is clean and beautiful  The water show that performs very hour is incredible  The garden that locates in the lobby is beautiful too  From Bellagio to Las Vegas Premium Outlet only take us    mins with taxi  and only cost us     bucks  We have try other hotel s buffet  yet  Bellagio s buffet is the number    it a must have buffet         I will definitely stay at this hotel again next time I visit  
P =>  A little disappointing My wife and I stayed at the Bellagio in a Lakeview suite for   nights on our honeymoon  We had high hopes for the Bellagio and   whilst parts of the hotel  particularly the bars and restaurants are first class   we were a little disappointed in general Our room was very spacious and nicely decorated  with excellent views of the lake and the Strip  though even on the   th floor with thick glazing we could still hear quite a bit of road noise  The main problems with the room included  the bathroom sink drains which smelled unpleasant   we took to leaving water in the sink with the plug in to block it out  the jacuzzi bath seemed to develop a green scum after use   even when no bath salts or bubble bath had been added  the mini bar fridge door had a tendency to fall off   we didn t use it THAT much The check in staff were great  the concierge was extremely helpful but the security personnel were fairly sullen   insisting on checking our room card before permitting access to the elevators  why not have elevators which only permit room key holders to select the floor    Some of the dealers were great  and some were pretty grumpy   but generally the casino had very little atmosphere We had dinner at Michael Mina and it was the best meal we had on our entire trip   and it must rank amongst the best meals we ve ever had  The service  presentation and attention to detail were first rate  If you are treating yourself it comes highly recommended  Petrossian  a seafood restaurant bar just off reception had an excellent menu and drinks selection  with a piano player every night  On our first night we had room service and even here the attention to detail and presentation were pretty good We tried the famous breakfast buffet and thought it pretty over hyped  A reasonable selection of foods  and some strange inclusions  but nothing we hadn t had before for less money Overall it s by no means a bad hotel  but it failed to really impress us as a sophisticated  classy establishment  If we go back to Vegas I think we ll gamble at Planet Hollywood  stay at the Wynn but still eat at Michael Mina  
P =>  Vegas Get Away Got a great rate for mid week at the Bellagio Hotel  Have stayed just about everywhere but the  quot B quot  for business  While I d rate it a   star in all respects  they are missing one  The Venetian Hotel has much better rooms for the price    so we were a little disappointed in the room selection    ah well  you can t have everything Pool service was wonderful  the Buffet is astounding   quot O quot  always wonderful  A quickie get away that was great  
P =>  wow I loved it  the room was huge and very plush  the views where amazing  the hotel was just great  I would definatly stay there again  The show was brillant  and the hotel was right in the middle of the strip  
P =>  Beautiful hotel    Absolutely amazing  Highly recommend  I don t even know what to write as this hotel is simply the BEST  It is beautiful inside out    Fountains of Bellagio are the best thing to see  especially in the evening  the show is spectacular  Rooms are very spacious and very well appointed Pool area at the time  end of august  hotel was running at     of capacity  did not seem crowded to me at all  there are quite a few pools and jacuzzis  but the water in the pool seemed to be very cold  even though it was    F outside   so I am not sure why   Regardless  this hotel is simply amazing  with really great selection of shops bars restaurants and great casino and we will definitely return  Would have provided more pictures if TripAdvisor allowed it  
P =>  Overpriced I hadn t been to Vegas since the mid seventies  so I was amazed at how the Strip has changed  I will definitely go back to Vegas soon  but I won t be staying at the Bellagio The Bellagio has some good points and some bad The good      Our lakefront room with a view of the fountains    Room service     Cirque du Soleil s  quot O  quot  currently playing at the Bellagio  Be sure to see it   And also  go over to the Mirage and see their production of  quot The Beatles Love  quot  Fantastic     The pool s   although on a hot ust day  it can get very crowded  So grab a lounge early The bad      The place is TOO BIG  it took me    minutes just to get from the front desk to our room   If you have mobility issues  as I do   the Bellagio is not for you         charge to the room for    hours  use of Internet     Rooms can be very expensive   or not  One night  I paid      for the room  three nights later  the room was          Many parts of the hotel are  quot plastic quot  and tacky   especially the conservatory     The front desk and administration    a  After our third night was up  I decided to stay longer  I was assured I could have the same room  The next two days  housekeeping tried to get in and called the room  indicating that their logs showed me as being checked out  When I tried to clear this up with the front desk  the person I spoke with was surprised to hear that I was in the same room  because her records showed me as having checked into a different room  I had also asked to have all incidental charges from the first three days transferred from my boyfriend s debit car to my credit card  and I was assured this was done  Not  Let me put it this way  at the front desk  the right hand doesn t know what the left hand is doing  b  Depending on the day and the time of day  the line to check in or out can be extremely long  c  I m aware the hotels ask for your credit card upon check in  I ve always assument that was so that they can make note of your account number IN CASE OF additional charges   At the Bellagio  they take your credit card upon check in  and they put a hold of       daily on your card  lousy surprise if you ve given them a debit card   
P =>  Beautiful Hotel in a fantastic location on The Strip We stayed at The Bellagio this year having stayed at The Mandalay Bay last year and it is nice to have a different experience each time you visit Las Vegas  The Bellagio location on The Strip is great   you can easily walk to as far as TI or MGM with PH and Paris right opposite and the Miracle Mile shops  The hotel is beautiful with the glass ceiling lobby and we checked in straight away  we did not have to wait at all  No room upgrade offered so no fountain view but a nice view of the mountains and one of the pools below  Our room was clean and the King bed very comfy  The bathroom is all opulant marble which even had some electronic weighing scales which I thought was a nice touch  The shower was not very powerful though Maid service is twice a day replacing any towels that you may have used and leaving some chocolates at night for you along with mellow jazz on the TV We sampled meals from both the Cafe Bellagio and Pool Cafe during the daytime and was served swiftly and efficiently with perfectly cooked and served food of a good portion too  Food and drinks however are on the pricey side  There are several bars in the casino but they are all quite formal   it could do with a more casual bar to drink in  The gambling tables do get quite full with several tables left closed for some reason  If you do try out some of the restaurants in the Casino or The Fontana Bar they have great views of the fountains which is also a nice touch  There are several swimming pools and lots of sun loungers which can get busy but we always managed to find a good spot at whatever time of day with plenty of clean towels always available  The pool cocktails were delicious  We thoroughly enjoyed are stay here and would not hesitate to stay again  Enjoy                         
P =>  Great Looks But Too Big To Be Top Class   We had a   night stay here with a fountain view room  The room was clean and well presented with a walk in shower and bath but it wasn t breath taking  It was the view made it extra special though  This Hotel is huge so expect a few que in places ie  check in  dinning etc For me it didn t have that   star intimate feel due to the scale of the place   but you don t go to Vegas for intimacy right   Like all Vegas Hotels it is the novelty factor that attracts people to the Hotel and the Bellagio has its fountain FREE parking was a bonus  
P =>  Class all the way We have been to Las Vegas many times  but this was the first time we stayed at the Bellagio  The last couple of times in Vegas we stayed at the Mandalay Bay  which is another beautiful hotel  I would say that the Bellagio s slight advantage over the MB is the location  the Bellagio is located right in the middle of the Strip  making it convenient to walk to other hotels  which offers up a lot of other dining and entertainment options What we loved about the Bellagio    Beautiful  just beautiful  Everywhere  Lobby  Conservatory  casino  restaurants   The rooms  Well decorated and appointed  Comfortable bed  nice sheets  Great shower and deep bathtub  The only thing missing was some bubble bath  hint to Bellagio   We had a Deluxe Lakeside room  We were on the   th floor  in the center  right over the lake  We could see the beautiful fountains every night  and listen to the accompanying music on one of the TV channels   Location  location  locationWe arrived on a Friday  but noticed that the hotel actually became more crowded starting late Sunday  Lines at the Reception check in weren t bad when we arrived  but other times it seemed busier when we walked through the lobby  As mentioned by other posts here  I think check in times will vary  it s just the luck of the draw  Lines at the Concierge Desk were rather long  but if you plan well before you leave home  you probably won t need the Concierge  A wonderful hotel  we will return  And hopefully we can get the same room  
P =>  A stunning hotel right where you need it  This hotel is stunning and full of luxury  We only stayed for one night  last night of a seven night break  and it was well worth the move  We were greeted quickly and by friendly staff at reception  who went out of their way to allow us to check in early  Everyone we met who worked there was friendly and helpful The hotel itself is amazing and incredibly elegant  The casino is quite big and there are  high end  designer shops attached which are great for if you have a big win The rooms are large with very impressive bathrooms  Views do vary   we had three rooms in our party   we had one overlooking the fountains  one overlooking the stunning pools   gardens and one overlooking the top of the reception  actually nicer than it sounds    We were offered an upgrade at check in for USD     a two room pent house suite  which we declined  As the rooms were so nice anyway  we were pleased with the decision The pool area is amazing   many pools to choose from and they do not get too busy  
P =>  What beautiful fountains Is this not the most famous hotel in Las Vegas This was the second time I stayed here  a truly unforgettable experience  I travelled with my parents  I knew it was their one and only chance to go to LV so I thought it important to go to a casino that they would always see on TV From the moment we entered everyone was in awe of the beautiful coloured blown glass flowers on the ceiling of the reception area  The Bellagio is constantly rammed due to the foot traffic  it is a must see place for anyone that visits  As a result you walk around constantly trying now to walk into people  Reception is marble and the staff there are used to catering to high end clientele  the nice thing is that it is still not snobbish  There is little room to negotiate beyond the room you have booked due to the demand  Leave your wishes for an upgrade at the entrance The best place to stay is at the front with a fountain room  then you get to see the fountains in the nights  My parents spent one of the evenings just inside with the tv tuned to the fountain channel listening to the beautiful music and watching the dancing fountains from the room window  it was a very special experience for them When you come down to reception from the room it is very smokey due to the number of people  if it bothers you then you should consider a hotel like the Mandalay Bay Another of the great things in the hotel is  O  by Cirque du Soleil  What a show   I think I have seen it   times  they have a    m theatre built just for the show  it makes it so much easier to walk down from your room to the performace  Not having to queue up for taxis after the performance is also a blessing  Saying this  I don t think you have any other advantage in getting show tickets by staying at the Bellagio  The shows are sold out way in advance so you need to plan your trip  Most of the tickets they have available are limited view so not very useful One other thing about the O tickets are the blocks  You can be guaranteed that the main head on seats are block booked for comping their many gamblers  Normal people like you and I can t access the nice seats  I had to get Amex to sort me out with their reserved rows to get anything half decent The Bellagio has a beautiful pool area which is great for breakfast  it is elegant with little hedge type plants and walkways  very civilised  The age group is older    s and up so be aware that the energy level around the pools is catered to relaxation rather than fun The location of the Bellagio is perfect  you can go for a stroll window shopping in the Bellagio arcade which connects to Caesars Palace and there is PH opposite so you can go and look at the mile long shopping arcade If you are staying at the Bellagio you may have considered Caesars which is of a similar price  Caesars is pretty classy but it is old school classy it has been around for ages but in my opinion is a little run down in appearance  The newer Wynn etc  are also great but too busy  they have gone to the effort of making use of every square foot and it shows  I doubt there will ever be another casino on the strip which has such a large area devoted to a gimmick  the fountains  but what an amazing gimmick it is  If your budget allows then stay here  remember this is the one you will always see on TV it s a nice thing to be able to tell people around you that you have been there and to have pleasant memories of your trip  Enjoy  
P =>  Queues  lines  everywhere Very nice clean room with a view of the fountains  No complaints on that front  Good pool also  but gues what    very crowded However there were queues everywhere  For breakfast  for lunch and for dinner  We are talking circa    minutes here  so no small wait  Basically the hotel has too many rooms and not enough catering capacity  If you stay here make sure you don t pay for breakfast as it ties you to the hotel  Much better to go next door to Caesars which while still busy has beter facilities The casino is good  but too few bars to get a drink in peak times You have to pay for the Internet in your romm some     per day I wouldn t stay here again  I have stayed at other hotels on the strip and prefer them as they are less crowded  
P =>  Great Location very clean and nice atmosphere We stayed at the Bellagio over ust Bank Holiday weekend as we were getting married  When we arrived at the hotel we thought it looked very clean  well presented and the lobby has a nice atmosphere it  i e  bright  spacious  etc  We checked in almost immediately  which I was surprised by as there are alot of reviews which say there are long queues to check in  I think it really depends on the time of day and the day of the week The rooms was lovely and celan and overlooked the dancing fountains  We really could not complain really  There is a really good bar in the hotel called the  Fontana Bar  which has good live music and again overlooks the fountains  The only thing we found wrong was that they keep you queing outside and when you get in it is virtually empty  I think this may be in a bid to make it look exclusive   Also  the waitress service was very poor and the waitresses were on the rude side on more than one occaision  We did not find that to be the case anywhere else though On Saturday nights the gambling tables are so busy that it is hard to get on them unless you are a big spender  every other night seems to be ok though I would stay here again because I think the hotel is one of the prettiest on the strip and the location is great  I think next time I would probably venture out a bit more as I think there are probably more lively  cheaper and more friendly places to go for a drink and see some nightlife than if you stay in the hotel itslef  
P =>   Best on the Strip by far    check out my photos  This is the second time I ve been to Vegas  the first to the Bellagio  but I wouldn t stay anywhere else in the future  I went with family for my brother s   st birthday and it was fantastic   there was   of us in total The rooms are clean and spacious  there were four young adults in one room and it was fine  One down side to the room is you can t use the fridge to put your own drinks etc in  if you move anything in the fridge you get charged for it due to the sensors  you can obviously tell them you didn t actually use it   The bathroom is clean  with both a bath and a shower  tip  you can use the bath as a fridge  simply fill it up with ice and chill your drinks    The cleaning ladies were lovely  despite being four young adults they didn t treat us any differently  usually we get treated as though we re going to cause trouble   The staff as you can probably imagine aren t the most friendly  but to be honest it s kind of expected with a  posh  hotel  I don t agree staff should be any less friendly but I see no reason to reduce the overall rating for this reason alone The pools are freezing  but incredibly refreshing  Again it is all very clean  The bars are great  the nightclub  Bank  is awesome   definitely would recommend it  The casino was the most appealing casino we visited  the rest seem dingy  The hotel itself is beautiful  and the parrots are really cute We ate at the Buffet once  which was good  however I would recommend elsewhere as the food here is a slightly overpriced for what you get  Also  we were rushed even though we were one of the last to enter    they start clearing things away pretty quickly after the last entry  which wasn t ideal  The location is perfect  right in the middle of the Strip  What more could you ask for  We also went to see the Cirque de Soliel show on our last night  which was fantastic  I d love to go and see a similar show in Vegas again  
P =>   Wonderful Hotel My husband and I stayed at the Bellagio   nights  for a trip that was a combination of business and leisure  We stayed in a standard King room  The bedroom was roomy  decorated very nice  The marble bathroom was extremely nice  We had good service while there the hotel staff is friendly  and helpful  We had no trouble with check in  but did have a wait about    minutes to check out  They do have a shuttle service to the Airport  but we did not know that in time to use it  You are supposed to book the shuttle at least    hours in advance  I attended a convention that was at the Bellagio  and the facilities there were as nice as the rest of the hotel  We ate several times at the Buffet  and would recommend it  We had drinks at the Yellowtail Restaurant and Bar  and that was relaxing  We also booked two shows  KA and Love  through the Concierge  and were able to get good seats and a good price for the show  Wonderful hotel and casino  We will definitely come back  
P =>   wow This is the nicest  plushest hotel  from the moment you walk into the incredible lobby  to the gorgeous room  We had a suite which was great because we had our   teens with us and it is a real suite  Some of the hotels in Vegas call large rooms suites  but they don t have   seperate rooms  The bathrooms are amazing  one even has a steam shower  The bed is so comfortable  The other room had a pull out sofa and they brought up a nice rollaway for our  nd child  The buffet is to die for  and since we were in a suite  we didn t have to wait in line 
P =>   Sheets were a surprise Check in was a breeze  the room was very clean and had nice decor  We loved everything about the room and the hotel  but when we got ready for bed  at       PM we had a surprise  The sheets had holes in them and were streaked with long lines of black grease  I know housekeeping must have seen this when they made the bed  We called the desk and they sent a nice lady to clean our room and change the sheets  It took her several sets of sheets to find a set without black grease  I was so shocked  imagine a hotel of this class with holes and black grease streaked sheets  Other then this our stay was wonderful  I am not sure I would stay here again  especially for what we payed for the room  
P =>   Great hotel with a few suggestions Checked in      in the afternoon had no lines but lobby was busy  Had reserved a partial lakeview because we wanted to try the Spa tower  Was given a very nice room on   th floor had a good lake view could see most of the fountain show  Nice beds and the room was always kept clean by out maid   Here where the suggestions came in and I did tell the front desk   Our room was hot we lowered the A C to lowest possible temp we had plans to meet someone later so we left room thinking A C would cool room  well it never did   Called front desk and they sent someone about   hr later and he came in and basically said the room A C is in a very bad spot on the wall and we might get cooler next day  Well that never happened either  I think for a hotel with such luxury they could have positioned A C in a better spot  Other than the A C issue I think the hotel is wonderful   
P =>   Brilliant location amazing Sunday brunch We stayed here as part of our honeymoon  When we checked in  we were not given a room overlooking the fountains at the front of the hotel as we had requested when we booked the room  This was a little disappointing  especially as we were on honeymoon  but we were offered a fountain view room the next day  Our room was spacious and overlooking the pool area at the rear of the hotel  There was plenty of space for all of our belongings  and the d cor was fairly tasteful  The bathroom was roomy and clean  the bed was comfortable  and there was a good sized television As you re in Vegas  you don t spend a huge amount of time in your room  but what you do get at the Bellagio is great facilities  The pool are is very big  and there is a wide choice of bars and restaurants  as well as the huge casino and shopping mall  We only ate in the hotel once  and that was for Sunday brunch  which I would highly recommend  There is champagne brunch on the Saturday and the Sunday  where your glass is constantly refilled  at no extra charge  and the food is fabulous  There is every kind of cuisine that you can think of and it is of a very high standard  especially the carved meats  We also had drinks in Caramel  which had a young crowd and you could only have a table if you were buying a bottle of champagne or a bottle of spirits  There is no priority for hotel guests We did a walk of the strip and called in at all of the other hotels  and to be honest  the only ones that are going to give you a classy  romantic experience are the Bellagio and the Wynn  The Bellagio has a great location at the centre of all the action on the strip  and we ll be checking back in here again on our next visit  
P =>   My fourth stay and I still enjoy it each and every time I love this hotel  From the lobby with the huge Chihuly in the ceiling  the fountains   I cannot get enough of this hotel  The staff is accomodating  the maids are clean  clean  clean fanatics and my only complaint is the smoke in the casino   but that is everywhere in LV  They must keep good records as they seem to know my preferences when return  Do yourself a favor   and enjoy a stay here  Word of warning   if the winds are high   they do not have the fountains on  
P =>   Great week end getaway Just came back from a   day stay at the Bellagio  It was my  th or  th stay  Check in went very smoothly  there was no line and there were sufficient desk staff to assist  Staff throughout the weekend were very helpful and customer service oriented  My favorite part of the stay     turn down service with smooth jazz on the t v awaiting my return at night  The champagne buffet was nice  selections during the early morning were fairly standard  Gaming was good  it was a slow weekend in LV which meant there was no fighting for space at the tables nor at the slots  Check out at      a m  had a tiny line  with one person  After the   th person got in line  another individual came to assist I ve read a lot about the rooms recently and have to agree  I reserved and stayed in a Bellagio Queen room  It was clean with the usual amenities  but the carpet was showing wear  The size was that of many Westin hotels  The decor was dark  which made theh room appear smaller and feel as if one had to have the lights on at all times  The room was located on the north odd numbered room side of the corridor  It overlooked parking and the ustus Tower side of Caesars  The room was also a bit warm as some other reviews mentioned  This is probably due to the unfortunate placement of the desk right in front of the air vent  The air con  has no place to go but under the desk  If you sit at the desk or the chairs that are right in front of the window  you d be cold in a heartbeat  All in all a very nice weekend for relaxing at a still very nice hotel and casino  
P =>   Fantastic hotel in every way Me and my partner recently stayed here for a week and loved every minute of it  The staff were fantastic  really pleasant and attentive  The room was excellent and very well maintained with an exceptionally comfy bed and good sound proofing  We were lucky enough to get a lake view and watching the fountain shows from your room is a fantastic experience  We gambled quite a lot in here and it was really good  the drinks waitresses were far better at looking after you than in other hotels we gambled in  My only slight gripe was that i had brought some of my gym gear and really quite fancied going in to the gym on a few of the days  yes i know that sounds mad   but was pretty annoyed that after paying out for the hotel for a week at quite a cost that when we got in the gym it was     per person per day to use their facilities  I thought this was truly unbelievable and was really disappointed  this is something they should really look at changing in the future  
P =>   Magnificent   Would stay again without question  Have always wanted to stay in a fountain view room at the Bellagio  so splurged for a   th birthday trip to Vegas  Great deal    stay   nights  get  rd night free  Worked out to about      a night for a deluxe fountain view room on the   th floor in the center of the building    the view was absolutely perfect Waited about    minutes at check in  Actual check in went very smoothly and in recognition of my birthday I was given a line pass for the Buffet and Cafe Bellagio  Actually never needed it as the lines were not too long while I was there  Turn down service was great and had chocolates and smooth jazz music playing every night we walked into the room The property was incredible    casino  conservatory  lobby  fountains  shopping  restaurants  pools  WOW    and room  Yes the rooms were older and not as large and magnificent as what I ve stayed in at the Venetian  but they were very elegantly done and I would not have traded the room for anything once I saw the great fountain view and Paris across the strip Would stay at the Bellagio again in a heartbeat  but most likely would not pay the posted rate of        Center strip location can t be beat  
P =>   Not sure if I would return I had been planning this trip for several months so I was very excited  For years I have stayed down town at the Golden Nugget but thought since I was coming to see Cher I would treat myself and stay at the Bellagio  I paid        plus tax for a partial view in the new tower  I thought  quot OH BOY quot   My plane was on time no line at baggage and no line for taxi  I thought great    Well it changed when I went to check in  There was obnly two people ahead of me and there appeared to be some problem  After that was cleared up it was shift change so I had to wait for that to take place  The man who checked me in was very nice and after a       dollar tip I received a room on the   th floor and a line for the buffet  The room was clean and very large for one person  Fairview for that price  Not to drag this out I only had turn down service one night  I ask for     am housekeeping since I go to breakfast at      and then off for the day it happened one day  I wanted a card for gambling to get comps and stood at counter while all three girls stood behind the counter talking and ignored me  I finally threw my hands in the air and walked away hoping someone might see me and call down there  no such luck  back to my room  the tv in the bedroom and living room were not flat screen but if they would have worked properly I would not have cared  T he one in the living room had sound somtimes and sometimes not  The bottom line is the check inordeal  The Golden Nugget has VIP check in and it is in a private lounge where you can at least sit down while waiting  I also hated being ignored by people who are not busy  just talking  I was thinking about trying ARIA in il but since it is owned by the same group I m not sure  I might try the Wynn or go back to the Nugget  
P =>   The Bellagio exceptional customer service but at a price     Stayed at the Bellagio with my wife on   th to   th t       to say I am fussy is an understatement but throughout my stay I couldn t fault the Bellagio  During my stay in Vegas I visited almost every hotel on the strip and the Bellagio was in my opinion  the best hotel in Vegas  Whilst visiting the Venician to watch Phantom I was disappointing to note that they let timeshare touts operate on their premises  The Beallgio would have none of that  its a better class of hotel  The staff were excellent  the pools    of them  were great and the Casino was fantastic  I even managed to get a free upgrade to a lake room so I could watch the amazing fountain shows from the comfort of my room  
P =>   Class Hotel I ll get the negatives out of the way first   I found it strange that you had to lug your luggage yourself throught the casino when it is a   Star hotel  The sound proofing as another guest has said is not the best and unfortunately there were a couple of stains on our bed linen   again not what I expected from a   Star having only stayed in   Stars before  We stayed at what used to be The Aladdin the last time and the room was bigger and the luggage was taken to our room I d still give it a good review because the location canot be beat  The housekeeping was impressive  I liked coming in at night to the  Smooth Jazz  playing on the TV  Drapes adjusted  soft lighting and chocolates  The Casino is light and airy compared to most which are pretty dark and the hotel smells gorgeous on approach  We never ate at any of the restaurants but we did go to The Fontana Bar on our last night to sip cocktails and watch the fountains   it was very romantic and I would highly recommend  
P =>   Bellagio I have just returned from   days in the  quot Disney for Adults quot  town of Las Vegas  I opted to stay at the Bellagio purely because of George Clooney and Oceans Eleven   It proved to live up to every expectation  The fountains are beautiful to watch during the day  but by night are just breathtaking  We had a member of our party in a wheelchair and she said that the disabled room was the best one she had ever stayed in  She could literally wheel her chair into the shower room and transfer herself to the shower seat  The whole of Vegas was wheelchair friendly We managed to visit  walk through  most of the other hotels on the Strip and apart from Encore Wynn we felt the Bellagio was the best  The thing we noticed most was that the pool was in a more  quot private quot  place and not immediately visible to day trippers The drinks were pricey  but if you are at a table gambling then the drinks are free   which is the case in most hotels  The casino in the Bellagio  Wynn and Encore felt less oppressive than  say  Caesars  We worked out it was because of the height of the ceilings and the lighting We had dinner at the Stratosphere Restaurant       floors above Vegas   an absolute must  We had a     pm slot and the views are truly amazing and because it is revolving you get a     degree view The men in our group were brave enough to the the X Scream ride    NOT for the faint hearted or like me scared of heights The food is expensive but good and you cannot buy a view like it in Vegas  Tip  We had forgotten about the American size portions and ordered too many side dishes     between   is more than enough One hotel NOT to stay at or even visit is Circus CIrus  Very old  very run down and very tacky  It is at the far end of the Strip near the Stratosphere and not worth the trek from the main Strip We flew with Virgin Airways as they were  at the time of booking  the only airline to fly direct  I understand that BA now fly direct too  Virgin were excellent  
P =>   Absolutely fantastic hotel Great hotel  Nice big rooms  clean and large pools  just not very deep so no diving   oversized but decent meal restaurants  what else is new in the US   and fantastic architecture  If only a stay at the casino were profitable  than this would truly be a place to return    
P =>   Amazing and love it   We visited Las Vegas for   nights and checked in the Bellagio  we were supposed to get a standard double room  but once they knew we were on honeymoon  updated us to the City Suite Room  I have never in my life seen anything as beautiful and I will remember this room forever  it made a great trip  fantastic  Staff great  we won some money on the black jack  pure fluke  and it was so hot outside and loads of shops  Everything is so close by and the fountains are amazing Loved it  Loved it    Definately  stay again  you must stay here  
P =>   Best Hotel Stay Ever We loved The Bellagio It was so magical  effortless  clean and enjoyable  The room was very luxurious and comfortable We slept so well each night of our   night stay  The bathroom was truly amazing  I am a tough Customer and was just taken by this place  This hotel was very relaxing and lacked the chaos of most of the Vegas hotels There was an air of quiet elegance  The pools were amazing and there was never a problem finding a chaise lounge  Service was over the top throughout the resort  We felt like We were in Europe and there was beauty and elegance at every turn  The only issues We had  and this place is so nice that they were easily forgiven  were that The Guy at the front desk who checked us in wasnt really very nice or welcoming but I gave Him a     tip and We got a King Bed  non smoking room on the   th floor with a beautiful clear view of the desert and mountain Also One of the chairs in the room had a stain and the faucet handles leaked a little  The bed sloped a little on one side but it was still one of the best beds we had ever slept on  Back to the good stuff I loved the twice a day maid service and chocolates left at turn down  The level of service is very high here and The Concierge  Bellman  Pool Staff  Housekeeping and Restaurant Staff were really excellent  I thought Karin at Guest Services and Bruce at Check Out were really special  We have stayed at The Wynn Caesars and MGM Grand and none of these can compare to Bellagio It is a gem of a Hotel  There is no absolutely perfect hotel but this was by far the best place I have ever stayed and I have stayed at some of the worlds best  We are already talking about booking Our next trip to The Bellagio  We loved it     
P =>   Excellent delicious ice cream and dinner Just one word  WOW  Despite the other overthemed  noisy  overdone hotels on the strip  the Bellagio still has the cosy Italian charme   one of the few hotels you enjoy wandering around and not having to queue when checking in  The front desk and the conceriege staff is very helpful and witty  the waiters can sound rude sometimes though  The hotel is chic and luxury  yet not vain  We took a partial lake view room in the   st floor in the new buildling  and the few was excellent  The room itself  after one week camping in the national parks  was like heaven to us  Only drawback  We got a room with a connecting door and so were able to hear the filthy conversations of our neighboors  We used the swimming pool only for a few minutes as the water wasn t chilly and more like a puddle for things you don t want to have on your skin  Tip   Although it requires you up to    minutes mind numbingly queueing  Use the Bellagio dinner breakfast lunch buffet  amazing  As somebody on YouTube put it  Either this is heaven or something we haven t yet understood  
P =>   BellagioWhat are you waiting for On Labour Day t  th my wife and i stayed for   night at the fabulous BELLAGIO I booked this as a treat for our   th wedding anniversary and what a good decision that turned out to be I had sought advice through trip advisor prior to booking and then used that advice and booked the Penthouse Suite  st time in Vegas and on arrival at the Bellagio we began check in We were told that we should have been checking in at the VIP Executive Lounge not the front desk We never bothered with that and checked in to be given our keys to the   th floor suite overlooking the lake with the best view in the house for the fountains down below whilst listening to the music playing on the tv at the same time Superb The suite was incredible over      sq feet in area with its own wet bar his and hers bathrooms complete with tv s jaquzzi bath in one and a sauna steam cabin shower in the other The bed was turned down and slippers laid out for my wife along with a small box of chocolates left for her on the bedside table Nice touch The most incredible nights sleep on the biggest mattress youve ever seen after full use of the bar facilities We had already had the dinner buffet downstairs beforehand and finished our stay with the legendry breakfast buffet Dont miss it I cant reccommend this as a one off treat for a special occasion it was worth every penny and will offer any other advice if anyone needs it MARY AND NEIL DUFFY  
P =>   Ok but beware of extra costs  We spent four nights at the Bellagio  We splurged on a   bedroom penthouse suite  We booked the suite because the cost was suprisingly low compared to places like Four Seasons in Maui where a comparable suite would cost you       a night  The cost averaged about      night before taxes or other charges  Theyy tack on         for tax per night and then     for  quot refereshment center quot  even if you don t eat anything from their little snack tray  And then it s        for using the internet  So the cost came out a lot higher than I expected  But for the price you do get a few amenities  You get to check in at the VIP check in which means you don t have to stand in line  and the lines at the front desk for regular check in was long  They picked us up at the airport and also took us back in a limo  They also give you passes to cut in line at the Buffett and the taxi cab line  Very nice amenities to have since the Buffett line was always long  And you get to use the VIP concierge with its very courteous staff We got a penthouse with the view of the back of the hotel  Not very impressive views  Be sure to ask for a suite with the front of the hotel to look at the fountains  The suite had three bathrooms and the toilet closets all smelled like a dirty sewer or a dirty rag  We noticed the housekeeping staff only rinsed out the glasses instead of washing them  Otherwise the suites were very nice The buffetts were a bit overpriced  The rates were higher on the weekends  The food was good but not great restaurant quality  The shrimp was plump but lacking in taste  same with the crab  The sushi was surprisingly bad  The brownies were hard and about the quality you get in a cafeteria  We had dinner at the Yellow Tail restaurant at the Bellagio one night and that was excellent but we paid      for a dinner for two people without any wine or sake It was a fun experience for us since we ve never stayed in a high priced suite before  The perks definitely make you wonder perhaps it s worth shelling out       for a four night stay rather than going cheaper  But then you also have to consider you could use the money you saved on buying other things  We ll probably go for cheaper rooms next time  
P =>   Luxury in Las Vegas This hotel was luxury from start to finish  Location was excellent right near everything  The hotel lobby and conservatory is beautiful and our room was amazing  The hotel is HUGE it takes about    mins to walk from your room to the reception  We visited the other hotels and this was by far the most luxurious  The view of the fountains was the best and i would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who would like luxury in Las Vegas  
P =>   Very disapointed I have stayed at the Bellagio numerous times and I can tell the service levels are going down and fast The good  location  the hotel itself is very nice  pool area is great  lots of food options  The bad  service    employees in the hallways dont say hello  front desk slow and rooms are looking worn out  This trip was really disappointing  After checking into the room   hr later a woman opens the door and come into my room  apparently they checked her into my room as well  I was glad I was there as who knows what could have happend to my belongings if I wasnt in the room Room service  the food is good BUT on this trip the waiter decided to add a tip on his own of       I caught it when I reviewed my balance on the TV and they removed it Jean Phillipe French Bakery  The worst service  employees are so slow and unorganized  got my order wrong   just annoying  And if you charge more than      to your room they make you wait and call the front desk to verify your credit card   I have never encountered this type of service at any other  quot high end quot  hotel Bottom line  enjoy the hotel and location  thats it  Service is non existent and employees are just disgruntled  lazy  and only after your tips  Do not except good service from this place  
P =>   Beautiful Hotel We spent three nights in a Salone Suite at the Bellagio  There was no waiting to check in or to check out  very easy  Our suite was located on the   th floor with windows overlooking the swimming pools on one side and partial strip and lake view on the other side  Everything about the room was perfect  very clean and updated  at least    amenities in the huge bathroom from toothbrush and hairspray to robes and slippers  The slippers are placed on each side next to the bed at turndown along with chocolates on the table  The snacks and items in the refrigerator were no more expensive than anywhere else in the hotel  once again do not pick them up or you will be charged  The housekeeping staff was extremely friendly and always spoke to us in the halls  front desk was a little stuffy  The pool area is a bit of a fiasco  At   a m  guests rush to get towels and stake out their lounge chairs for the day and then leave  I would imagine trying to find a chair in the afternoon would be difficult  The lounge chairs have no room between them at all so one would have to crawl on to it from the foot end while two strangers may be encroaching on your space from each side  much like Southwest airlines  Planet Hollywood and the Miracle Mile of shops and restaurants is right across the street and offers something for everyone  Try the ABC Store if you have forgotten anything or if you need a snack  The Mexican Restaurant in the Palazzo is excellent as was  quot Jersey Boys quot   Bellagio restaurants are somewhat expensive although nice  Don t miss the Conservatory  decor changes often and it is beautiful  It s a gorgeous hotel and I would recommend it  
P =>  Wonderful My mother and my   sisters and I stayed at Bellagio for   nights in early tember  We had booked a deluxe room for     night   and this included a Fri and Sat night   I am on the Bellagio email list and received an email back in ch with room discounts  Upon check in we got upgraded to a lake view room  I never thought they would upgrade us since we were paying such a low rate  A very pleasant surprise  The Lake View room is deffinatelyt worth it  Whenever the fountain show started we were instantly drawn to our window  It is simply beautiful to watch  The Bellagio was clean and spacious  The staff was always polite and courteous  We did not have any bad issues  The hotel may be a little older and the rooms might be a little outdated  but erything is kept clean  We had a wonderful stay at the Bellagio and I would stay there again  Location cannot be beat  
P =>   Disappointed this time This is a beautiful hotel but sorry Bellagio  we were disappointed this time  We had been harping onto frieds to stay in the penthouse suites   fantastic views etc  but when we all arrived we were positioned at the back and not opposite the fountains as requested at time of booking  We were paying full rate for the rooms as we booked them in uary as opposed to other guests who had got greatly reduced packages  When we asked to move rooms the reservation staff were generally unhelpful and reluctant  Also  the VIP reception lounge has been moved so that it is now virtually impossible to make use of the coffee and pastries which were available to VIP guests during the day   generally handy when there are no T  amp  C facilities in the rooms and room service for coffee is very expensive  On the plus side the view from the front window is beautiful  the bedrooms and bathrooms are plush and the all day buffet is really good value for money  Next time we will splurge on another hotel  
P =>   AMAZING My husband and I have stayed at the Bellagio two times now  and it just gets better every time  We are going back for the third time in ober       The staff is very friendly and accommodating  Our room was spacious  spotless and smelled fresh and clean  The bed was very comfortable as well  Housekeeping does an excellent job  We called for extra pillows and the service was very prompt and friendly  I also love the fact that   security guards are stationed at the elevators in the lobby and you have to show your key to even get on the elevators  This hotel is clean and very well maintained  Restaurants are great as well  This is just a great place  I can t wait to get back in a few weeks  By the way it s worth it to pay a little extra for a lake front delux room  The fountains are just breath taking  
P =>   Everything I always hoped it would be I ve been going to Vegas for years and always drooled over the Bellagio  claiming one day I would stay there  However I never actually stay in my room in that town  so I always opt for a cheap hotel rather than a luxurious resort  At long last I finally decided to stay at the Bellagio  thank you  recession specials  and I can definitely say it lived up to every expectation We were fortunate to get a deluxe lakeview room  which is a room in the main building directly facing the fountains  This for me was what made the entire experience  Watching the fountains from the street is my single favorite thing to do in Vegas  and seeing it from your room is an AMAZING experience  My problem now is it s going to be hard to go back and NOT book the same room style here Other than that treat  the Bellagio was a fine  fine hotel  Quality room  very comfortable beds  and housekeeping twice a day with a nightly turndown service that I ve never encountered outside of a cruise ship  The pool area is exceptional and caused me to spend several hours on the property rather than exploring the Strip  It s a beautifully landscaped area with five relaxing pools  Lastly we went to the spa  which was a great experience on its own  but you can only access it if you scheduled a service there that day The Bellagio is a fantastic hotel to call home in Vegas  Our best day was our pure  quot Bellagio day quot  where we ate all our meals there  went to the spa  the pool  and a performance of  O   For someone who wants to have a hotel with all that wonderment just downstairs  this is the place  I only gave it   stars for value though because  let s be honest  if you aren t planning on spending a lot of time in your hotel  as I usually would be  it s hard to justify the high price of the place compared to other hotels on the Strip  My problem now is after such a wonderful experience  it will be hard if not impossible to go back to my old ways    
P =>   lovely stay We will definitely stay here again  Very clean  comfortable  beautiful rooms  The food at all the restaurants is divine  I do wish we could have a coffee pot and our own refrigerator in the room  instead of the one that is packed full of chargeable items  
P =>   Choose somewhere else Me and my girlfriend stayed at this hotel it was utterly discusting   i recommend you choose somewhere else  The staff are so rude and ignorrant  The rooms as Un  Clean and smell awful  
P =>   Another Wonderful Stay  My husband and I stayed here for Labor Day weekend  Check in was a breeze  lake view room was spotless  I really don t understand the other negative reviews  Everything about our stay was really great  The food at Cafe Bellagio was great as was the buffet  room service was quick and good  Pools were crowded  but it was a holiday weekend  Mai Tais at pool bar were very tasty  We saw Le Reve   The Wynn  absolutely amazing  VIP seats made it all the more special  If you stay here I feel a Lake View room is a must as it is part of the beauty and relaxation  Fontana Bar is also a must  No cover charge and GREAT entertainers  Go and have fun  we are only here once  
P =>   Fabulous stay at the Bellagio and LOVED the fountains  We had an amazing stay at the Bellagio and would definitely recommend it  The lobby is just amazing and the smell of flowers as you enter is absolutely gorgeous The room we had was large with a fabulous view of the Strip and  more importantly  the wonderful fountains of Bellagio  Finding the tv channel which plays the music of the fountains was brilliant as it meant you could watch them from the comfort of your room whilst getting ready for your evening We didn t eat at any of the restaurants in the hotel but I would recommend the piano bar at the front of the casino which we found lovely and relaxing despite all the madness going on around you The only negative would be how long it takes to get from the front of the hotel to your room   but I guess this would be the same for most hotels in Vegas given how huge they all are  Also slightly disappointed that the bath wasn t a jacuzzi I would definitely recommend this fabulous hotel  
P =>   Awesome stay in a penthouse suite We stayed for one night and then moved on to the Wynn for the following   nights  We had to ask where the executive check in area was  its the double doors to the left of the main entrance   there is no sign to let you know its there  but when we found it check in was very quick  We arrived at   am so we had to wait an hour before our room was ready  but we recieved line passes for the cafe and buffet  so we made use of that We stayed in a penthouse suite on the   th floor  The room was amazing   his and hers bathrooms  his had a steam shower  hers with a whirlpool bath  a lounge area  dining area and bar  The bedroom had dual views and a TV which raised out of a cabinet at the end of the bed  The curtains were also electronically controlled  The amount of toiletries in the room was ridiculous  in a good way    everything you could think of was provided  I have no complaints about the room whatsoever  well OK I can think of one   no coffee making facilities even in the suites       Also no complimentary water provided The pool area at the Bellagio is really nice and relaxing   it didnt have the loud music blasting out which the Wynn pools had  We also got tickets to O which I would highly recommend  The show was amazing and the music was awesome  We ate at Fix restuarant before the show which I thought was really disappointing  I have had better quality food at great upscale restaurants for half the price that we paid there The next morning  we went to the buffet and again the line passes came in handy  The buffet was excellent value at       per person and they had a large selection of breakfast food The casino area itself was gorgeous  very understated and classic  I would stay here again  The location of the bellagio was great   mid strip  However  we found that we stayed around the North end of the strip for most of the time and therefore I thought the Venetian actually had the best location on the strip  
P =>   Nice Hotel But Not Very Personal This is a terrific hotel  Great room  Lots of fun  And right in the heart of Vegas  Staff were ok but the hotel is so big everyone seemed impersonal  Poker was fun  
P =>   Most Elegant hotel in Vegas Absolutely fantastic  Best hotel in VegasWe had a   bedrooms penthouse suite facing the fountains  What a room   What a view From the moment we arrived at the airport and the hotel limo was there pick us up untilthe moment we left the hotel  after   days  we had no complains at all  and we are not easy customers at all   We were a family of    my husband and I  my sister with her    years old daughter   We were all very pleased  The hotel staff is fantastic  The casino very nice and big with a lot of choices The pools  the restaurants and bars also unique The hotel spa and the salon very elegant But for us the best thing of all was the view of the dancing waters from   st floor We could not take our eyes from the waters  You must see it to believe that there is such a beauty Everything was amazing  We will definitely come back Many thanks to Sarah Brautingam from the hotel reservations department She was very helpful when I tried to book this lake view suite us the hotel was fullbut finally she managed to find for us this beautiful room Thank you again Sarah andTHANK YOU BELLAGIO  
P =>   Beautiful one stop destination  From the time we got to the airport  cab to the hotel  we didn t leave the hotel for   days until our departure  The hotel has a very understated beauty  Its beautiful and luxurious  but not pretentious  There s plenty of space to wander around and hang out  And you can t beat the water show We had the standard deluxe room for       The room itself was actually very plain compared to the hotel itself  It was still great  very clean  ultra lush  great soaking tub in the bathroom  overall a very luxurious but simple room  Compared to the Venetian  I think you pay more for the hotel itself at Bellagio and at Venetian you pay more for the room      MUST try Sensi restaurant  Its a combination of Asian  American  and Italian cuisines in a very modern setting  The service is immaculate  our server waited by us and explained everything about the food  showed us how to eat properly  and heightened our dining experience  We had lobster roll and oysters as appetizers and they were very fresh  My pasta was cooked to perfection and not too buttery       quot O quot  is a great show  For anyone who hasn t seen any Cirque shows  I highly recommend this show  Its got great music  great stunts  and overall a great story  Its very romantic but also very interesting with a great flow so it never loses its momentum  I recommend paying a bit more for better seats  it will make a difference since this is on your traditional stage type of theatre  
P =>   Best place to stay in Las Vegas My wife and I were on holiday from UK We chose a room overlooking the Bellagio Fountains and watched many displays  with accompanying music on the in house TV The room was fine  the breakfast buffet sumptious  the shops elegant  the foyer marvellous  and the location on the Strip just right  
P =>   Why Gamble on your LV stay  ust    t         My wife and I stayed four nights here  Arriving very late in the day just before midnight  I inquired and graciously received a room upgrade  When one walks down the corridor on a high floor and the upgraded room happens to be at the very end  then that means a large suite  So already we felt like we won the jackpot  The spotless room in the renovated tower was huge and luxe After   days in LV  the best feature of staying at the Bellagio  in my opinion  is the proximity of the parking to the hotel  As I recall  the other hotels force you to walk through a half mile of casino before arriving at the elevators to the hotel  Not so at the Bellagio  Once I park  of course  parking as close as possible to the elevator  the uncrowded entry way to the hotel elevator is about    yards away  There must be about    high speed elevators The hotel is well situated on the Strip  There is a wide assortment of restaurants and shops  We patronized several of them and felt that they offered good value Besides the usual chocolates and pulldown service  the bathroom has many amenities  such as separate shower and jacuzzi tub  double vanities  and lighted close up mirror  There is a safe  flat screen TV  and the most comfortable bed  The showerhead had sufficient pressure I would certainly return to the Bellagio although the   for  night s promo was very persuasive  
P =>   Perfect Just perfect  The central loacation on the strip makes it just about the best place to stay in Vegas  Classy and elegant inside I could live in the corridors  they are so nice and the restaurants were excellent  Good snacks at the Palio and we had a great meal at Jasmine with a window table looking out at the fountains We had a full view of the fountains  and across to the Paris hotel from our window  so we were constantly hopping up and down to see the water shows As it was just before Christmas the whole decor added to the seasonal feel  and it snowed for the first time in    years   Won money too  which paid the hotel bill so this was one of our best ever stays  
P =>  Fantastic room and view  We stayed at the Bellagio in ch      and had a king deluxe room  We were plesantly suprise when we looked out the window to see that we were facing the fountains  The room was big with a huge marble bathroom There is a button next to the bed to open and close the drapes  There is also a turn down service so you always have clean towels and a made up bed  plus chocolates on your pillow  This is the perfect hotel for a romantic getaway Make sure to get some sweets from Jean Philippe s Patisserie at the Bellagio  
P =>  exceptional   the only choice for a stay on the strip absolutely faultless  from the checkin staff  to the bars  restaurants  casino  rooms  room service  fittings  cleanliness  facilities  checkout    treat yourself to a meal at Olives on the terrace at night overlooking the fountains  it dont get much better   nothing more to say   the only real classy choice for a stay on the strip   If I had a young family  I would be more inclined to stay at one of the more Disney type themed hotels   but for adults  its the only choice  
P =>  Classy  I recommend this hotel       Although the Venetian is my personal favorite  I LOVE the Bellagio  It is classy  timeless  clean  and a   star resort  
P =>  Gotta love the Bellagio   Arrived on Tuesday t   st  at     am  Walked right up to the counter and was helped by Stephanie who upgraded us to a fountain view at no extra charge even though our rooms were free to begin with because of an offer that we recieved in the mail   After scouring the reviews here I was prepared to pay the extra      a night for an upgrade and not to have a room available until the afternoon  Nope  not the case  We were in our room within ten minutes Every staff person we came in contact with was very pleasant  The rooms were kept clean and the cleaning staff greeted us with smiles and wished us a great day  I m not sure about the people that leave the negative reviews about the staff  If these people arrive at the Bellagio and walk around with their noses in the air and over the top expectations and demands they get what they deserve  Give a smile and respect get a smile and respect  Simple Checking out on Friday morning of t   th  walked right up to the counter and checked out without hitch Oh and an extra tip for people who need coffee in their room  I take a small travel coffee maker that makes one cup of coffee at a time  It s a small plastic auto drip  and light weight  Dont forget to bring your ground coffee and creamer  Very hard to find hotels on the strip that have coffee makers in the rooms anymore  
P =>  Perfect Anniversary Stay Stayed in a Bellagio Penthouse Suite  room        from         to         This was a corner suite at the far end of the west wing  The Penthouse Suites are beautiful  Our room faced the south  pool complex  City Center  and the west  mountains  Palms  Rio   We did not ask for an upgrade  and in retrospect  are glad we didn t get the fountain view  Our room was absolutely silent the whole time we were there  and it was a peaceful getaway from the hustle and bustle of the strip  The mountain view is very romantic when you are sitting in your tub at night The suite includes a large living room with couch  chairs and     LCD HD television  There is a nice dining room  a bar and a bathroom in the main living area  The bar includes a refrigerator that is stocked with overpriced stuff  but it also has another refrigerator that you can put your stuff in  It even includes an icemaker so you don t have to go down the hall for ice The bedroom was fabulous  The highlight is the bed   it is SO comfortable  My wife and I agreed that this was the best bed we have ever slept on  It had a cabinet at the foot of the bed that held another HD TV  Push a button and the TV rises out of the cabinet  then goes back down when you turn it off   very cool  Curtains are powered as well The  men s  bathroom had a toilet  an LCD TV on the counter  plenty of closet space  lots of towels and a wonderful steam shower  The  women s  bathroom had another LCD TV  a small bathroom with toilet and bidet  same closet and towels  The highlight was a large Jacuzzi tub with a floor to ceiling window that faced the west  Absolutely gorgeous Some people complain that the rooms at Bellagio are tired and dated  In my experience  I totally disagree with this  Our room was clean and updated  We couldn t have asked for more The staff was courteous and professional  Everyone we met was friendly and helpful  If you meet a staff member in the hall they step aside and let you pass  along with a nice greeting  We felt like royalty The suite includes a limo from and to the airport and the Executive Suite Lounge  This gives you an exclusive check in area  as well as drinks and snacks throughout the day  You also get a line pass for the buffet and Caf  Bellagio We appreciated the security  You have to show your room key to get to the elevators  They have separate elevators for the suite floors  and they require a room key to activate the elevator  Don t forget to ask about the  secret  elevators that take you to the suites  They are behind unmarked doors and are very exclusive This hotel is very busy  It has lots of tourist attractions  so be prepared for a lot of people  But we knew this going in and it didn t bother us too much  The pool area was busy  but we always found two chairs together near the pool  either in the sun or in the shade The casino is wonderful  It is the most comfortable gambling area we ve ever experienced  We played slots and video poker  No huge wins  but plenty of good action  We did better here than anywhere else we played  Drink service was very spotty  Sometimes we never saw a waitress  and other times service was slow  We had a couples massage at the spa  First massage for both of us  we thought they were excellent  Facilities are amazing   whirlpools  sauna  steam room  relaxation room  Definitely recommend the spa All in all  I highly recommend the Bellagio hotel  
P =>  Nice but could be better We booked a fountain view room for   days on a recent vacation  we had stayed at another Vegas hotel off the strip and wanted something more romantic and near the action  The fact that the parking is the same for guests than for attendants to the casino can be a little annoying  it gets difficult to find a near by parking and  if you are traveling with suitcases you might have to walk several kilometers to get to the front desk  where  disappointingly  you will find a BIG line of people trying to check in  This I really find unacceptable  I am not a picky person  but waiting    minutes on line to do a check appears ridiculous to me  honestly if we did not have a prepaid reservation  I would ve probably walked away to another place  As every other strip hotel the place is huge and very luxurious  also very impersonal and full on wannabes  gamblers  drunk people  merely dressed ladies and curios tourists lol The rooms are nice  bedding was not impressive in terms of comfort and the TV had like    channels only  Bathroom and tub were great  And the views to the fountain the best inversion ever  Just beautiful  Only warning is  if you go to bed early  avoid these rooms cause fountain is VERY noisy and it works until midnight  The Buffet  although is still the best in town  has unbearable lines  up to an hour just to get sited  The place is good but it aint THAT good ya know  It also annoyed me that they have no preference for hotels guests there  they should have a different live in my opinion  just as with parking  but they don t Overall the place is nice but I would not stay here again  I rather go to the Paris or the Wynn in the strip or to the Hyatt place or Planet Hollywood off the strip  
P =>  Very Clean Kept up Rooms   Professional Staff Stayed four nights  Two rooms above    th floor  Was a little disappointed that the requested side by side was not met  but the next day  the staff did accomodate that request  logistics  The fountains from the higher floors are very entertaining and sets this hotel apart  Business services     a minute to check email   and web connectivity         a day laptop  seem excessive and would be an opportunity for the hotel to gain loyalty if they would accomodate in some manner  I am not a business traveler so am not sure what other hotels charge  
P =>  Breath Taking Experience   I booked the ROMANCE PACKAGE It came with The Cypress Suite Room which is the BEST room ever if you get it up high because you LITERALLY can watch the Fountains from your room  AND you have a great View of the hotels around you  The eiffel Tower being accross the street was a very romantic view  This package was      for one night and additional      for the remainder of our stay which was   additional nights  It was well worth it  It included The Package  Limo Ride  for up to    To and From the Airport Executive VIP check In     has free drinks   free little snacks   and free wine   and a lounge where you can sit and wait to be help IF there s a line    Going to Vegas   why not get the VIP treatment   we got free VIP passes to THE BANK   Champagne and Chocolate Covered Strawberries brought to our room Daily House Keeping His Hers Bathroom with TVs and Views in both    The bedroom was just separated with a divider   the TV in front of the Bed pops up when you turn it  quot on quot  Electrical controlled Curtains   Couples Massage Choice of Picasso or Michael Mina for two  It s a really goooood package  Service  Everyone was SO NICE and SO POLITE  When we first got there  we were already receiving the star treatment   but it was funny the bell man took us on the employee elevator   for a Short Cut ahhaha   i didn t mind  Dining Theres a thai restaurant   and the PAD THAI was to DIE for   it was REALLY GOOD and not that pricey  It was around       bux for a HUGE plate that me and my boyfriend shared   The Bellagio Cafe was pretty good too  We went at  am in the morning and the employees were so nice  The burger was awesomePicasso was awesome  But I bet it would be VERY PRICEY if we didnt get it with the package   the meal we ate would probably be around       The waiters were awesome and very professional and even insisted that he takes a picture of us outside in front of the fountain show   Overall it was a great stay at the Bellagio   The room was pretty sweeeet   CYPRESS SUITE   we were on the   th floor  they originally put us on the  th   but i didn t like it because we didnt have a full view  SO make sure to get the top floors  I only played Pai Gow at the Bellagio  The dealers were always so friendly and helpful  It was     dollar tables  Pretty good   i won a lot of hands there    DOUBLED my money which is always good  and the drinks that you order from the table were always good LOVE THE BELLAGIO Pool It was hard to find a spot with shade   but there s plenty   there are so many pools to choose from  Location VERY VERY CONVENIENT  everything is like walking distance   RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE of EVERYTHING  
P =>  Disappointing  I spent two nights at the Bellagio while attending a conference  Check in was chaotic with no real line  but rather a mob of folks ready to check in and all jumping around trying to locate the next available agent  I recognize the hotel was designed so that you have to go through the casino from check in  but the walk from the front desk to the room was a long way  A few comments on check out     The Bellagio does not provide a receipt under your door on day of check out  so you must go to the front desk and stand in line and    Double check your bill as my bill originally contained a     charge for  Refreshments  from the mini bar that I NEVER even touched during my stay  When pointed out  staff apologized and removed the charge from my bill but it does make me wonder how many times to folks get assessed this charge without questioning it  Good points of the room were  a  Bathroom was well kept and had separate shower and spa tub and had a good amount of space on the counter  b  King size bed was comfortable c  room was spacious and d  room contained bed  sitting chair  and desk  Bad Points of the room were  a  Old Phillips TV that does not provide a crisp picture  b  very limited TV stations to select from   maybe    U S  based and    Asian TV stations  c  carpeting was beginning to show its  age  d  room was very dark and e  internet access is    Hotel public areas have pungent cigarette smoke odor  I was on the   st floor in a non smoking room  and as soon as an elevator door opened you get a strong blast of smoke odor  As for the grounds and lobby  they are well kept  The pool area is spectacular and the fresh cut flowers through out the hotel are nicely done  Food was very pricey  Lunch for two at the Bellagio Caf   chicken wrap  Cobb salad  soup  and two drinks  was      Good location on the strip as it is an easy walk to Caesar s  Planet Hollywood  Paris Hotel and more  No opinion on the casino as I did not spend any time there  
P =>  Good but not great Got a great deal on a   bedroom suite which included airport limo pick up and return and therefore decided to stay at the Bellagio for the first time rather than the Palazzo  Venetian or Skylofts The room was massive    bathrooms  guest toilet  wetbar  dining room table etc  but overall I was a little disappointed  The  quot Executive Suite Lounge quot  is a small room off the lobby by the front doors where VIP check in takes place  Yes it has free wi fi but compared to the concierge lounge at the Palazzo it is very poor Also  to find empty condom packets on the bedside table when you check in shows that cleaning standards are not great There is no private pool unlike at the Venetian or some other hotels  We had a cabana one day for      which was very good  included soft drinks  plate of fruit  crisps pretzels  but some get no sun virtually all day The Bellagio is a beautiful hotel in a great position on the Strip but if I had not got the great deal on a magnificent room I would go for the Palazzo or somewhere else 
P =>  Magnificent everything anyone could want and more The bellagio was all I d dreamed of and more  We were on the   th floor and the views from our room were superb  The staff were friendly and helpful and a special mention to Gerald who provided us with dinner via room service and made the evening extra special  It was my husbands first visit to vegas and he fell in love with the bellagio fountains as I did on my first visit  We could easily have stood and watched them all day and night and never tired of the magic of fountains and music  I cannot wait until we return hopefully not too long to wait  Loved it  loved it  loved it     
P =>  The Luxury Unique Hotel in the heart of bubbling Las Vegas Perfectly located Bellagio is the luxury symbol of accomodation in Las Vegas  The strip never would look so nice if this hotel would not be there  Beautyful fountain play  classic interior design  and yeah    this soul of old fashion but modern sin city where the richest are meeting up for a plesure of trowing money away    Just the food sucks  Do not enter the famous Bellagio buffet   It is not so good as before  
P =>  Only worth staying for the fountain views   Lakeview deluxe rooms I was only impressed by the fountain views from the room  which you have to pay extra for  The location is great  which allows walkway connections to other major hotels  Buffet no big deal  too busy and over hyped  Try the Paris Hotel located across the street  much better staff with genuine smiles  Food is tastier there too Check in is poor  no line system  they should have a ticket machine or lined rope They have had so many comments about this  yet they don t seem to care Us tired travellers should not be made to wait in lines which have no system of first come  first served  Not fair and can cause tension between waiting guests I booked   queen beds through Expedia and paid the full rack rate  upon my arrival they had no   queen bed rooms and claimed that having a   queens bedroom was subject to availability  they suggested they can do me a huge favour  by allowing me to stay in a king bedroom for the first night and call the front desk the following morning to see if a   queen room comes available I got the impression  if I had booked directly with the hotel  I would have been treated as proper guest and got upgraded instead After many calls to the front desk  after eight hours  I managed to get myself the room I originally booked and paid full for I also  negotiated  a line pass for the buffet  which had the most unhappiest staff I have encountered  The Paris hotel staff located across the street  where polite and helpful and I tipped them well Views from the room were fantastic and the only thing worth paying staying for The car park should have an area located for guests and it s a walk from the entrance to your room through the casino area The room TV only has the basic  free to air  channels  The swimming area is well run and has polite staff  The pool is     foot deep The Business Centre was great  used it once for my online flight check in and print my Boarding Passes  the lady there was very polite and helpful Now I have experienced the views  there is no reason for me to stay there again  there are much better hotels around  
P =>   Wonderful hotel Great service Great location Bellagio is a great spot   perfect location  great shops  great dining  the service is really nice   A few nights earlier  I stayed at Mandalay Bay and their room service was a minimum of   hour   Bellagio had my breakfast to my door in    minutes   and it tasted great     a tip   don t buy the cell phone charger out of the mini bar   it doesn t come with instructions  it not intuitive and it was a waste of money  The spa is really nice   I had wonderful therapist who got me back into shape after   days of camping in the Grand Canyon  This place is HUGE so be prepared to walk a lot  Also  not inexpensive   but they do provide a great service for the money 
P =>   Best Hotel ever  We booked two nights in a Salone suite but were upgraded to a Cypress suite at check in  The Cypress suite is the most luxurious hotel room i ve ever seen  Everything was perfect from the beginning to the end  The staff was friendly at all times and the view from the room was breathtaking  The casino is huge and the fountain show wonderful  Our stay was perfect  what else can I say  
P =>   Elegant hotel great location I stayed for   nights in ch for a work meeting  I also stayed there in       The rooms are very nice and clean  and the lakefront rooms offer fantastic views of the fountain show  Pool area is beautiful  while the poker room offers a lot of action and wide array of games  I would certainly stay there again  
P =>   Beautiful hotel    but way too smoker friendly I visited the Bellagio  Las Vegas with friends in ust in room        This hotel is beautiful   the gardens and pools are lush and incredibly well kept  the spa is lovely  the rooms are spacious and the staff are very friendly  However    there is a smoking problem in the rooms and the casino making it unseemly for non smoking guests  We also had some room disrepair that went unaddressed The smoking issue   we booked a non smoking room and were bumped to a smoking room without being advised  When inquiring about changing rooms  we were told the hotel was booked and we could not move  We were also told that the non smoking rooms book quickly and people will often get bumped to smoking rooms  The room and casino smelled like smoke in big contrast to the non smoking areas of the hotel  ie  reception  other public hallways   For non smokers  it makes for an uncomfortable experience especially when the ONLY way to get to the shopping areas  several restaurants and the Cirque du Soleil O theater is directly through those areas  When checking out  we advised the checkout person about the smoking room problem and they suggested when checking in the next time to say that a non smoking room is a requirement  One would think booking a non smoking room would be enough  but be advised   it is not  The rooms   we stayed in the main hotel area  not the spa tower    it was spacious and the decor was very pretty  Aside of the smokiness  it was in some disrepair  A lamp was broken  the lightbulb fixture had been pulled out from the lamp and just kind of hanging there  our call to the hotel about the lamp went unaddressed  there was no lock on the bathroom door  the safety lock on the door was loose and nearly falling out of the door jam  Also  there are too few outlets and the ones they have are in really odd spots  The bathroom plug is in a spot that makes the hairdryer wire catch on the corner during use Overall  a lovely place with spectacular views and ammenities  but its not ideal for non smokers  
P =>   Sheer luxury We stayed in one of the penthouse suites which was sheer luxury  amp  my only regret is that we didn t stay longer  amp  go around the pools which looked amazing  The hotel is exactly what you would expect but better  I liked the fact that they treated everyone the same despite how much money you have  WE ordered room service which lovely  amp  brought up to the room by a lovely member of housekeeping who set up a romantic meal for two for us in our room  WE got a really good deal with the penthouse  amp  after seeing in some of the other rooms I would recommend that you shop around  amp  get a deal  amp  stay in the penthouse as it is sheer luxury  amp  fabulous  
P =>   Bellagio is BEAUTIFUL    We stayed at the Bellagio from   rd  th  Highly recommend starting your stay during the week because it makes check in so much easier and less hectic  It s really suprising to me how many people were in Vegas yet every cab driver  waitress  and hotel employee rave about how empty the city was and how tourism was down  Jeez  we thought it was busy enough  Anyway  the check in process at the Bellagio was a breeze    We went from the cab to the hotel room within      min and it s a long walk to the hotel room  But again  I think part of the reason was because we checked in on a Monday which made it simple as there were not as many people   TIP   Get the upgrade to face the fountains   It s worth it  We paid an EXTRA     night for a room on the   nd floor to face the fountains and it was the best     per night that I spent in Vegas  The view is incredible and you ll spend a lot of time just looking out the window  watching the fountains and listening to the music For the most part everyone at the Bellagio were friendly and really professional  The only time I experienced anything less than friendly professionalism is when there was some kind of computer problem that frustrated the employee who was getting our player s card The room at the Bellagio was really nice  not incredibly luxurious but very nice and well appointed  The bathroom has a nice bathtub  and the bed is probably the softest in Vegas  This was a normal room  not a Suite which might have been even more luxious  I read other nit picking reviews about the Bellagio and did not have any of those problems with wall paper peeling or extra linen piled up in the corner of the room  Yes the water pressure in the shower was a little on the light side but nothing worth complaining about at all THE POOL   Wow  what a huge pool area with plenty of lounges to accomodate everyone  The pool area is really nice  There were not too many kids and everyone at the pool was friendly  The pool did close for a few hours because of high winds so beware that this is a possibility during your stay As a side note  I saw so many parents who brought their kids and as a parent myself  I don t understand taking your      or   year old to Vegas  It s not really  quot kid friendly quot   You might find things for them to enjoy but overall the city is not really catered to kids in the same way Disney World is     TIP   If you are looking for a reasonable priced dinner  consider eating at the buffet  We found that by the time you walk or take a cab anywhere else  you are probably going to pay as much or more than what you pay at the Buffet  around     for    and the food is really good  But if you are a mad baller you could consider eating at one of the other restaurants at the Bellagio  I heard that the Cafe was good but it was a little pricey for us We wanted to go to see a show and went to the concierge desk and they recommended Jersey Boy s which turned out to be a great show  The concierge arranged the tickets for us to purchase at the Venecian which made the whole experience easy and hassle free  I heard that the lines to the concierge can get really long and frustrated some guests but we didn t experience long lines at all Other tidbits We visited the M amp M factory   ummm  not so much  Not worth the hassle of walking through the people or the heat unless you really want some M amp M s or M amp M clothing Mirage Zoo   Two big thumbs up  Only     bucks and you get to see the lion that pretty much cancelled Sigfreid and Roy   permanently Vinny Favorito at The Flamingo   Vinny is one of those comics who picks on the audience members  He is funny and extremely vile and nasty  We really enjoyed the show but just be aware that it might not be the place you want to take your folks to  And afterwards he hawks his CD and being on vacation of course  we bought it  But for some reason it wasn t as funny when we listened to it later  CD sells for     and unfortunatley I can t recommend it  But we both had a great time at the show Top of the Eiffel Tower   If you can find a night when it s not so crowded  then go for it  But if it s packed with folks  it doesn t turn out to be a very romantic experience because of the number of people clamoring for a view The Fix Restaruant in the Bellagio   Stay away  waayyy too pricey   even if you are a mad baller you can freely spend or swipe your credit card at other much more fancy joints where the food is much better Also  don t forget to visit the Gardens at the Bellagio    really worth the visit  And it s free   don t forget to take your camera  And the chocolatefountain is a must visit also  
P =>   All about the view We have just returned from   nights in a Deluxe lake view room at the Bellagio  Thu Sat  and had an enjoyable stay  I have stayed at the Bellagio on two previous occasions and found the overall experience to be consistently good Check in was relatively painless  about a   minute queue  The assistant was afficient although not really that friendly and probably borderline arrogant  We booked throught the American Express FHR programme  and recieved a discounted room  the cheapest rate I could find anywhere  and I looked pretty hard   free breakfast each day      credit per person per night which more than covered the excellent breakfast buffet and could be used towards the weekend unlimited champagne brunch  Friexenet brut  so not really champagne   again very good       total per person   Also had a very nice free lunch at the Olive s Restaurant by the lake watching the fountains   the     credit allowed more than covered a   course meal each   alternatively we could have had      spa credit  The rooms are definitely showing signs of age now  and it is true that more than     of the sq  feet are in the bathroom which is a little inefficient in its use of space  The rooms do not have a  wow  factor at all really  about the level of a    hotel   but the lakeview does   I would not stay here if I didn t have a lake view  The fountains are amazing and its one of the few  room with a view  upgrades worth paying for  Amenities in the room are good   nice fluffy towels and robes  and plenty of them  The TV in the room is not at all good  a   inch old CRT with a wobbly flickery picture  This really is a bit of a disappointment and worse than the ones found even in Premier Inns etc  No DVD player either Bed was big and comfortable  Turn down service good and happened both nights for us  consisting of new towels and chocolates by the bed  no ice delivered   The pools are lovely here  and the water is especially warm in the big pools  Overall a very nice ambience  We have also stayed at the Four Seasons in Las Vegas  which we thought was amazing and certainly was by far the most luxurious and inviting of the two hotels  However  I still recommend the Bellagio even if its just for the fun of having stayed there and imagining planning your Heist with Pitt and Clooney  
P =>   As pristine as the day it was built Bellagio is exquisite  as always  It is my No    on the strip  Wynn is No    and easily tops the other competition by providing top notch service  gorgeous romantic scenery and excellent gaming space  It attracts a more mature and  quot sanitary quot  crowd so you avoid the  quot other quot  side of Vegas  LOL  The dealers are among the BEST you will find  a few bad eggs  but that s life   The restaurants are amazing  with the exception of Noodles  which is disgusting  Be sure to get a lake view room   it s well worth the extra  The rooms are perfectly appointed with whirlpool tubs and beautiful furniture  Plenty of space for your things and excellent large window s   Play here often and soon you will never have to pay for your room again   which makes this one of the very best places to stay in Las Vegas  
P =>   HUGE BUSY AND FAB What a fabulous hotel  Recently spent a week at the Bellagio early ust and had a superb time  I called a few days prior to request a non smoking room it was noted on my booking but I was advised that the room will be allocated upon check in  So arriving on a Sunday afternoon you can guess it was very busy and it probably took around    minutes to check in  We didnt have much choice of non smoking rooms apart from a view over the car park or a lake view for     plus tax per night or a smoking room over looking the pool area  We also had the option of checking back later to see if any other rooms had became available  We decided to treat ourselves to the lake view and we were not disappointed it was worth every penny The   th floor is a non smoking floor and we had room       it was spacious  clean with a lovely bathroom  It also had an i pod docking station  king sized bed which was very comfortable  iron and ironing board plus the usual mini bar  ice bucket etc  Comfy chairs to watch the fountains  amazing  channel    to listen to the music and much more relaxing than trying to jostle for a space outside in the ust heat We had an excellent breakfast at Cafe Bellagio it cost around     for   omlettes  toast  tea and coffee  the portion s are huge so you can easily share  We also tried the breakfast buffet which was slightly cheaper around     for two and again very good with lots of choice although it is the first time I have stayed in a hotel that has various pizza s on offer for breakfast  We never had to que so I guess we were very lucky or very early We also had an evening meal at Olives  bottled water   drinks and   main meals cost around      plus tip my husband really enjoyed his chicken however I didn t have much choice for a vegetarian dish apart from pizza or pasta so it wasn t as enjoyable for myself   For any vegetarians reading I found the best meal choice was at the Cheesecake Factory located in the forum shops at Caesars Palace We are not big gamblers but we still signed up for the players card in the casino plus if you gave your email address you got     dollars free play for the slot machine s  you can also use the card in the other MGM group hotels along the strip to collect players points Overall we loved the Bellagio and would definately stay again  Yes it is a very busy hotel  with nearly      rooms it isn t going to be quiet around the public areas  however we never experienced any noise from the room  plus other hotels we looked at were just as busy  The location and the charm of the hotel itself you can t go wrong staying here  
P =>   Good Hotel   Shame about the Service    Hotel is up with the best of them  although the Venetian is much better     We booked and paid for a lake view room but when we arrived at     pm we were told that none were available  Apparently the Bellagio will not confirm a room  even if you have pre paid for it   So if you want a specific request get there VERY early or book into a better hotel  We were moved the second night  but only after a lot of hassle and we had to do all the leg work  The guest service was a real let down for such a reputable hotel  
P =>   Unbelievable   what a hotel   fantastic This place is magic  From the moment you walk in its like being in a fairytale  The place is amazing  The casino and general areas have to be seen to be believed  the chocolate fountain is spectacular   the chocolate covered strawberries  soooooo yummy  The rooms are BIG  the bathrooms stunning and all is immaculately clean  The staff are excellent  the room service delicious and the whole Bellagio experience better than hoped for  The fountain is AMAZING                      The Bellagio is the BEST                      
P =>   Great time at the Bellagio My husband and I travelled to the Bellagio for   nights from ust      th  Prior to leaving I had read many reviews of the hotel and knew that it was going to be great   Well  it far exceeded our expectations  We both loved it  The location of the Bellagio on the strip is great  in the middle of everything  We did not have to wait any more than a few minutes at check in  or checking out  All of the staff that we encountered were always very friendly  At the hotel we ate breakfast at the buffet a couple of times and we ate at Todd English s Olives  It was really really good  Very tasty and very reasonably priced  We spent   days at the pool  The pool area is beautiful  and very clean  
P =>   Bellagio has lost its way  This was our second stay at Bellagio  We had a four night stay two years ago  This trip when we went to check in we were told all non smoking rooms were taken  this also happened at Encore at the Wynn in e and MGM last   more about this later   The check in clerk told us they had  quot smoking optional rooms quot  for the first night and we could move into a non smoking room the next day  ughh  but no choice so we took the  quot smoking optional quot  room hoping for those opting not to smoke The elevator ride up to our room was a revealing moment  Of the choices of floors      according to the icons by the floor buttons only two of the floors allowed the smoking option  mmm  Our room smelled of stale smoke and air deodorizer  not too bad  We went to bed and by  am were choking on the cigarette smoke  It seems that the nicotine fits start early and the smoke from our neighbor s rooms was proof they were suffering from not smoking overnight  It was sickening  Apparently   quot smoking optional quot  is just a euphemism for smoking required My husband checked back with the front desk around  pm and was able to get a new room and moved our luggage himself  The second room was better  If you smoke your room is a bit ratty while the non smoking room was freshly decorated  This room was perfect for us for the remainder of our stay Since we had just stayed at Encore we had a recent comparison  Bellagio has a cafe but it is a cafe  while Encore and Wynn have a cafe s but they are far more upscale  without being anymore expensive   The pool at Bellagio is nice but they do not have an adults only pool  as they do at Encore and Wynn   The poolside food is good and nice portions  FYI at the Bellagio pools stay away from any drains you see in the pool deck  the smells were eye watering  I had to move locations to avoid the smell Would I return to Bellagio  Price being equal to Encore or Wynn  no  The amenities and the staff are far more attentive at the Wynn properties than at Bellagio  I feel more pampered at the Wynn properties  The Bellagio seems like a stodgy behemoth while the Wynn hotels seem more nimble and eager to please  Back to the smoking optional v  non smoking  If   of   floors allow smoking and the non smoking floors sell out first  wouldn t this be a clue to the hotel that more people prefer non smoking rooms  As I wrote above  we had this same situation at Encore and MGM  If over     of rooms are non smoking  and they sell out first  maybe it is time to make the hotel     non smoking  I am waiting for the day that OSHA restricts smoking within the casinos to designated areas anytime now  They did it at McCarren airport  They did it all public places  Fashion Show Mall etc  it will be the employees that need protecting from second hand smoke that OSHA makes the ruling  It would seem that a small percentage of patrons are smoking the rest of us out  
P =>   my favorite hotel in vegas i love everything about this hotel   i was there for it s opining and repeted my visit at least once a year  just great 
P =>   Excellent Excellent Excellent  My husband and I stayed here twice in ch      for   night each time  The service we received was the best we have received anywhere  from check in  to the concierge  to the towel persons at the pool  to the dealers at the table  to the servers in the restaurant The rooms are very nice not over the top but plush and comfortable and fancier than many hotels  The beds are extremely comfortable and the bedding is very cozy  We stayed in different parts of the tower on each night but the rooms were similar  only the view changed  one night of the pool  another overlooking the mountains   The rooms are very quiet  we were not bothered by hall noises or our neighbours  There is a safe in the room as well as a fridge  however  the fridge works electronically so if you so much as pick something up to read the label you will get charged for it automatically The pool area is fabulous  The pools are not heated and the weather was a little cool when we went so we did not use them  but we did lounge in the area The casino itself is also great in that it has a large selection of slots as well as tables  The dealers at the tables were friendly and were happy to explain a game if you had no idea how to play it The selection of restaurants is plenty and variable  although all a little pricey  There is a small bakery shop to buy sandwiches for those on a budget  Room service was excellent and the food tasty  however VERY expensive by the time you ve paid all the service fees and gratuities The shops at the hotel are very expensive  but fun to browse in  The Cirque du Soleil show  quot O quot  has its home at the Bellagio  so again you do not have to go far for entertainment either  however tickets are also very expensive The location on the strip is excellent as it is fairly central  There are alot of other casinos and restaurants nearby  within walking distance  Cabs can become expensive as you are more often than not stuck in traffic on the strip and the bus is not always reliable because it is often full and will pass right by without stopping  occasionally  but rarely  it is not on schedule we once waited an hour and a half and no bus came along  Although it is an expensive stay  we are normally budget travellers   the Bellagio has become one of my favourite places to stay due to the service and amenities  
P =>   Nice place but overrated    would not be my first choice We had a great rate and had always wanted to stay here  It was pretty much what I expected  It is a massive casino and it s kind of a pain to walk through that smoke haze to get anywhere  The rooms were nice    not the best I ve seen in Vegas really though  The service was really quite exceptional although we must have been last on the list for room cleaning    no one ever came by until around   PM  The pool was great and very adult oriented    not very many kids  The buffet was awesome as usual  Everything is just a little too expensive there        for a REGULAR cup of coffee at one of the cafes which is twice as much as starbucks  We had crepes one day at the chocolate fountain dessert place right off of the conservatory    those were totally great  Didn t eat at any of the restaurants really    we were on more of a budget  Too crowded with all of the walk through traffic     I would stay at Mandalay Bay next time to avoid some of the crowds  
P =>   Elegance   Location   Best Choice on the Strip I have just returned from my third stay at Bellagio   after trying a few other hotels on the strip in recent years I went back to my best and first choice  and am happy to see that it is still maintaining the same high standards  Of the five star hotels you can choose from on the strip  nothing can beat Bellagio for location and overall elegance without being pompous or snooty  The maintenance effort that goes in to keeping this hotel looking shiny and new as the years go by must be huge  I so no signs of the beautiful hotel I first stayed in five years ago looking any worse for wear now Bellagio isn t without its downsides  there are no economical eating options in the hotel period  Even the snack bars and concession stands will charge double what you d pay next door in Caesars  so either be prepared to head outside when you get peckish  or get used to paying well over the odds  The pool  while elegant and relaxing  could use at least a section that has a bit of atmosphere  Almost every other hotel on the strip is adapting to pool areas that cater for different demographics  but the Bellagio is sticking with its one size fits all solution  which may be a blessing for some  The Bank nightclub is over priced carnage  and should be avoided like the plague But those few negatives pale in comparison to the dignity and elegance this establishment brings to the strip  spacious and classically decorated rooms with the most comfortable bed I have ever enjoyed in a hotel  a casino that strikes the right balance between atmosphere and space  stunning floral arrangements on every surface and of course the fountains which after ten years still haven t lost their charm and wonder  I haven t found anywhere else I d rather stay in Vegas  
P =>   Loved the Bellagio Great place  clean rooms  good security  Nice pool and pool restaurant that serves breakfast and lunch  Good Cafe s  Didn t try buffet   Only ate dinner   night there in Fix  Very expensive  We had a wonderful stay  
P =>   Get a WaterShow Room if possible Stayed at the Bellagio for three nights to celebrate a special occasion  The hotel  as stated  is amazingly beautiful  The rooms are large and luxiourous  The restaurants offer something for everyone and service was magnificent throughout the hotel  Check in was very chaotic  It wasn t that there were a lot of people waiting  but as there are no lines to organize it  people run from one clerk to another  Also  each check in seem to take a long time  including ours and we had no issues to address   At check in the clerk asked us if we wanted a water show room  We said sure  She then told us it would be     more per night  I told her that I didn t want to spend      for that option  She gave us the upgrade anyway  It was wonderful seeing it from the privacy of your room  They have a channel on the TV where you can hear the corresponding music  An added benefit The room itself was large with a very comfortable bed and great sitting area  The room is very dark though  As the sun goes down  it gets worse  The service was remarkable  Everyone we encountered was professional and friendly  That really helps to set this hotel off from others on the strip The pool area is large and well equipped  You do have to pay for everything though  For example  at the Wynn  you are given bottled water with your towels when you arrive  Here you pay to get water  Small note  but memorable Other small concerns  The room doors are very heavy  So when people close them  unless you hold it closed  which no one would do   it will slam  So in your room  you hear doors slamming constantly My company sent me a Fedex envelope to the hotel  The Bellagio wanted me to pay     for the business center to hand me the envelope  The bathrooms have no TV or private toilet room  which is usually for a Vegas resort of this standing Their is only one parking entrance to the hotel  off the Strip  which gets very busy and hard to navigate in the evening This is a beautiful hotel  If you can get a good rate  and a water show room  I would recommend you checking it out  I don t know if I would choose it over the Wynn  but I had a good time  
P =>   Bellagio is the BEST Our stay was to celebrate my daughter s   st birthday  Mom daughter stay We were given our room before check in time  as it was available and was on the   th floor facing the fountain  Yes  the lines to check in on a Thursday morning were crowded  but we were promptly guided to the check out line and serviced by their staff Since my last vist staying in the Tower Spa  I was surprised at the condition of our room in the Main building with worn out carpeting and a light out in the bathroom cosmetic mirror  Another review stated similar conditions and possibly with the economy  thingslike this aren t at the top of their priority list  However you can t beat the view or the location in the middle of the strip and within walking distance to all the hotels  given if you are in a healthy walking condition  otherwise cabs do just fine   Yes  the halls arecrowded with patrons once you get off the elevator on the casino floor and yes  we had to ask the staff to find two lounge chairs together at the pool at  pm  because most of the chairs are saved earlier or occupied already  but the staff did help us when we asked for help in any circumstance  Drinks at this hotel are outrageous  but this is Vegas and ourhotel room was extremely marked down because of the economy   so it all worked out   We would definitely return to this hotel any day of the year and will be back with the family or just husband and wife  You can t get a better hotel than the Bellagio  It s a beautiful hotel  
P =>   Great stay at the bellagio   Penthouse suite was great Stayed for   days at the bellagio at the end of y Check in  Ver y smooth we were part of the executive level so we were picked up at the airport by the limo and brought to the hotel  We had private check in in the executive lounge and enjoyed the snacks they provided  the bell hop and desk were extremely helpful and exactly what you would expect for service at that level  Room  The penthouse suites are very spacious    bathrooms a living room a dining room a wet bar and you bedroom  Everything was impeccable and done in very good taste  very updated and clean  views of the fountains are great we were on the   nd floor  We used the executive elevators so we never felt crowded i nthe elevator levels Executive lounge and VIP lounge  they were very nice and someone was always avaible to help  There was one girl there who was very snobby and nont helpful but most all of the staff were very friendly  The sancks were great  Soda waters coffee tea anytime  Lots of little snacks and always the yummy chocolate covered strawberries  Great service from the concierge they were very helpful getting us reservations  Food We ate at the buffet one time  It was good  Ijust dont like fighting the crowds in the food lines  The bellagio cafe was very good  Loved all of our experiences there  We ate at prime one evening  very good but i didnt think the steak was worth it  We ate at sense and the kobe steak and service were better there  This was our favorite restuarant there The VIP front of line passes were very helpful as things we busy the week we were there  NOODLes was amazing wish i ate there more The conservatory and all the views were great  We spent a day at the pool and this was good too  The water was very cold as described by some earlier  lmost uncomfortable  But very beautiful Gambling   had a great time  Lost a bit but spent a long time to do so  Pit boss Jefferey was very frindly and gave us a free dinner at noodles  O was amazing  Ihave a friend from High school who is a swimmer for them so i got half price tix  Would have paid full price as we love cirque shows  Also saw Mystere   Amazing Never made it to the bank or any clubs Spent a day at the spa  Loved it  I get a   hour massage and a facial and the wife had   treatments  we both thought this spa was one of the best we have ever been to and we do like to frequent spas on vacations  Was in the top   massages i have ever had All in all a very good trip  Very good service  We would return  We dont get to vegas very often as we prefer to take our trips to the carribean beaches somewhere but it was great for our   th anniversary  Although they did not acknowelge this at all on our trip Only bad experience was with a very unprofessional and stuck up woman at the VIP lounge   other younger girls working there were very good fountains are way better in person and must be seen in person to be appreciated stayed in        right by the private elevators by the Vip lounge  
P =>   Disapointing Sadly they are building a huge complex next door so the immediate surroundings to one side is a building site and horded walkways which do not add to a great atmosphere  The hotel inside was beautiful  lots of luxurious and gorgeous restaurants and lounges and the prettiest classiest looking casino area of all the hotels in my opinion  The lunch buffet was fabulous  but sadly didn t get the breakfast buffet on our last day as it was a    min queue and would have swapped to lunch while we were eating  That was a great disappointment  I also felt that unless you were a high spender in the hotel on the tables you were not given    service  We apparently didn t exist when a tour company called to rearrange a trip and we wasted a day having planned that trip which went t the next day  The last day we missed breakfast  you only get a line jump if you are in the penthouse or guest of casino even though we left the line to get a line jump as advised by the staff    and also sat in the boilding mid day heat for the airport transfer which never arrived that we had booked through the hotel   did they care appologies help  In a word NO Be prepared to walk  walk walk  Most ladies carried their heels through the hotel and put them on going out  it can be a       minute walk from the front of the hotel to your room  although it appears to be similar in all the hotels   It is centrally placed and the bus service is great for just    unlimited for a   hour period Beautiful pool and you can rent cabanas  if available  often they are not even though you can t see anyone using them   the bieest chocolate fountain you ever saw with   types of chocolate  Fountain show are spellbinding and perhaps a little emotional  All in    hotel  beautiful amenities     service 
P =>   Awesome   quot Awe the Bellagio  It is so beautiful  quot  Our Jr  Suite was perfect and the view of the fountains was so romantic  Our room was always clean and well stocked  The staff always pleasant and helpful  I can t say enough how beautiful the flowers and walkways are Check in and check out always have lines but this Hotel is worth waiting for   
P =>   mixed feelings We stayed in a     or so square feet suite  Once in the suite it was great but the lobby and the hotel in general was just so BUSY  Even the pool was a total nightmare  Comparing it to the Wynn where it has a much more exclusive feel and a seperate pool for suite guests it lags a long way behind For the money i would rank it behind a number of the other hotels in Vegas  
P =>   Great location The view of the fountains was great and the room was spacious and comfortable  Overall  a good hotel in a great location  The pool area is nice and we enjoyed the food at Yellow Tail and Prime Steak House  wine list was pricey though   We also stayed at the Mirage on this trip and slightly prefered the bars and atmosphere there  it had more relaxed feel to us   but it was a close call between the two hotels and the fountains at Bellagio are fantastic  
P =>   A Great Hotel We loved this hotel   Me and my boyfriend stayed four nights and had the best time here  The hotel is basically in the center of the strip and you can walk to most of the other hotels in Vegas  The bathroom in our room was HUGE and the pools were beautiful  LOVED LOVED LOVED the water show    A must see for sure   We even got our room for a discounted price  I looked up coupons for the Bellagio online and got the room for        a night  Couldn t find a nicer hotel for cheaper anywhere  IWe only had two problems    one  I requested a non smoking room and got a smoking one  Apparently your request is not always honored and you can get a smelly room  Not so grand but we lived with it  The only other problem was that the rooms were waaaaay in the back  After a ton of walking up and down the strip it can get a little annoying  Not a huge deal though  I would for sure recommend this hotel to anyone   
P =>   Just go  We stayed at this hotel for   nights this summer for the first time  our  rd time in Vegas  and really enjoyed ourselves  The level is service is very high and there is a nice  quot luxury quot  feel to the hotel  the pool  the restaurants and the casino  We had dinner at Yellowtail one night with friends who had a young child and meal was very good  We mentioned to server we were a bit pressed on time and they had our food out in a snap  Another nice asian restaurant on the strip is Pearl at MGM We had a deluxe room with mountain view  aka no strip  no pool  no fountain view   Room and bathroom were good size and nicely appointed overall  but rooms are starting to show minor signs of age  We went to bed late each night    to  am  and never heard any noise or partying from other rooms  hallways etc which was a welcome change from the gong show we went through at Mandalay Bay last time we were in town Pool area was very nice and we spent part of each afternoon there  but        drinks poolside are not exactly the best deal in town    
P =>   Fabulous Resort   Terrible Traffic This resort is the best that one can get  My family just returned from a seven night stay in the PH suite with a full lakeview  The excellent staff in the VIP Lounge makes your stay as comfortable as possible with no request too difficult  We arrived very early and our suite was not ready so i of the VIP Lounge provided a room to refresh until our designated room was available The suite is very spacious and every detail is attended to make your stay the best  The housekeeping services were over the top  There were no unwelcome instrusions from any staff member and everyone was very pleasant  The pools are very beautiful and fun for the entire family  We went at various times and never found it difficult to find a chair  The drink service is very quick and the servers are friendly  The restaurants are good but expensive  The buffet is good but could be better  the Wynn is still a notch above  But with the number of restaurants available  no one should go hungry The traffic surrounding the resort is terrible  There are many detours due to numerous construction projects in the area  My advice   use a GPS system which can direct you to the hotel via the alternate routes  we did and it saved us a lot of time  But overall  the resort is the best and we will return  Everyone should stay in the PH suites and experience a level of service second to none  
P =>   The Bellagio   The Best The Bellagio   The BestThis was my  rd trip to Vegas and in the context of a   star plus luxury Vegas hotel the Bellagio cannot be beaten  Clearly it is never going to be cheap but check check and check as we got a cracking deal just by playing with a day difference here and there etc and we got a lake view at a better rate than a  lesser  hotel Anyway  Wynn and Mandalay Bay are the only   other   star plus hotels but this is the best luxury hotel because of the little things  The lake and grounds I am sure everybody knows about  Inside there is a huge lobby but the little extra is the decor  namely the glass flowers on the ceiling and the general space  The casino is also spread out so unlike nearly all the other hotels it is not in your face or you find yourself walking between tables to get to your favourite shop  The conservatory is another little thing and within it is a ferris wheel and flower  displays  with a bistro  cafe to take in the atmosphere esp at night when the place is buzzing and the lights on  This goes for the fountain of course also  All the flowers are rotated and replaced on a daily basis and the fragrance is reflected by this  Try the patisserie with the worlds  largest indoor chocolate fountain  needless to say the desserts are out of this world and actually  given it is hosted by a French Michelin star chef  are by no means stupidly priced  The location of the hotel is the next best thing as it is slap bang in the middle of the strip but being set back  and the for mentioned lobby entrance  means within just a few mins  after spending hours getting your senses bashed  you are in peace and in luxury  The forum shops are just next door and connected so that saves a min or   walking also As for Vegas as a whole  well my few recommendations are for a romantic meal the Eiffel Tower restaurant cannot be beaten  It is situated half way up the tower so overlooks the strip and you face the Bellagio fountains so have the best seat in the house all night long  The cheese cake factory within the forum shops is not to be missed for a slice of heaven any time of the day  The forum shops themselves are also the  st stop for any lady as they have all the designer shops under   roof  For the shopaholics the fashion show mall  opposite Wynn  also shouldn t be missed As for attractions there are of course the fountains at the Bellagio but also the pirate  battle  at T I  is an enjoyable watch and it is also free  For a show  esp if you are not  theme  specific the Blue Man Group at the Venetian is an evening of pure entertainment  A little tip is also to pick up the what s on magazines from the back of taxis or in the hotels as they include money off vouchers and special promotions  Mostly for food  and particularly downtown  a little gem can be found if you plum lucky as this last time we got a trip up the Eiffel tower on a   for   promo saving     and cirque du soleil where doing a promo of with   full paying adult ticket a  nd adult paid just      Given the average cost is      a ticket this is stunning and is far cheaper than even the discount show box office found on the strip Enjoy 
P =>   the best hotel We stayed in Bellagio and it was the best experience  The hotel has great location  beautiful views even if you have a room with a view to the pools  We payed     a night and it is a very good value  I recommend that hotel to everybody  
P =>   Excellent hotel  We had a room with partial lake view  so we had a superb view of the fountains We had dinner in the Circo  one the hotel s restaurants  price was high but so was the quality The room was very spacious aswell as the bathroom Didn t like the crowd however  very busy The outside of the windows needed a cleaning  
P =>   Excellent        This was the honeymoon we never had and what better place to go than Las Vegas   Bellagio   First time to Vegas in general and had the best time  The hotel was fantastic   very classy  clean and most of all staff were very friendly   A hotel which i would recommend to friends any day   A very pleasant stay  thankyou for your hospitality       
P =>   Branding sand You can t take the Bellagio serious  Not the fake pond at the front which is called lake  not the synthetic fa ade of North Italian architecture  not the deserted Chanel and Prada boutiques that market winter attire in boiling summer heat to crowds of lightly clad west coast folks  and certainly not the hotel s claim of being a five star property and one of the leading hotels of the world  Bellagio is brutal mass tourism glossed over with a pseudo sophisticated air that aims at sucking your wallet dry while giving nothing in return but empty marketing slogans  And I am not even talking about their casino here  I am talking about their overcrowded and overpriced restaurants that charge Manhattan rates for mediocre food in the middle of a dessert  The lack of complimentary fruit or water in a suite for      a night and the hilarious charges for wireless Internet access  The fact that most of their staff are poorly trained and hardly manage to disguise an appallingly sullen and frustrated attitude  The exorbitant entrance fee to their gym  The tacky floating airbed  which you can rent at the pool for     a day  The queues at reception  And the numerous pretentious  VIP  services that you can purchase  but should receive as a complimentary standard at any reputable hotel  What seems truly surprising about this factory of a hotel is that at least the elementary services tend to work well  You do get your luggage delivered to your room after a short while  housekeeping does service the room reliably two times per day  and valet parking does ensure that your car awaits you promptly at he front  These might seem outstanding achievements given the size of the establishment and the hordes it has to service  but they are not nearly enough to justify the claim of being a world class hotel  True  Las Vegas has never been about individualism and marketers here have always been experts in branding sand  but somewhere down the line behind the gambling crowds and the fake facades you ought to find two essential things  quality and value  Not at the Bellagio  
P =>   The Cypress Suites are the Best Suites at the Bellagio We booked a  quot Cypress Suite quot  at the Bellagio  which are the suites in the circular column you see right in the middle of the hotel overlooking the fountain  These suites are pricey  we paid      night   but what a view  The bed faces the floor to ceiling windows so you get a prime view of every fountain show  The suites comes with   huge bathrooms and spacious living room  We made a little video from our stay that we posted on YouTube  check it out at  http   www youtube com watch v Z JsyZ OoXk amp feature channel page 
P =>  Bed Bugs at the Bellagio We stayed at the Bellagio and by the second day  my daughter had welts on her face  arms and back  We had a nurse look at her who advised that they were bed bug bites      They were very  quot non responsive quot  and shrugged it off                         
P =>  Disappointed somewhat this time As a repeat visitor to Vegas and the Bellagio  I expected a little more  The last time I was there  I got a free upgrade room  overlooking the fountains  when I mentioned we were there in  and enjoyed our visit  This time  I asked for a room overlooking the fountains and was told  that would be        extra per night    WTF  excuse me   And I know others got upgraded for free  On my booking of the room  I requested a  quot High Floor quot   I was placed on the  th Floor with no view of anything  I came to Vegas with someone who had not been the Vegas before and I was so disappointed  She did not mind the room initially  but after I called and complained we got moved to the   th Floor  smoking floor  she saw the difference  of the view   The standard room is terrible  In all my stay at the Bellagio  I have never seen this room before  Usually  my room have the his hers vanity and spacious  Well  for some reason  I was given horrible service on check in and all my request ignored The other days were better  and that is the only reason I would recommend this hotel The spa  casino and buffet staff was wonderful  The room was kept clean and they were very pleasant I would consider staying at another hotel on my next visit to compare the standards  Because obviously this hotel does not care about its repeat visitors and or player club members happiness  
P =>  Hotel of excesses Nice hotel with good rooms  Excellent staff and room service 
P =>  Sleep well at the Bellagio We stayed at the Bellagio at the advice of friends who had already visited Vegas  Location is excellent  bang in the middle of the strip  easy walking distance to Caesars  Hard Rock  MGM   although it s not that pleasant to walk too far in     degree heat  We checked in quickly and easily   although saw days where the queues were huge   and were pleased with our room overlooking the pools  which was a large room with a king size bed and huge  marble bathroom  Although you do get some corridor noise and doors slam  we both slept like babies in the very dark room  like the casinos  you can lose track of time   and felt refreshed during our stay  The pools were very busy so get up early to get a decent spot  the casino had some good bars  We didn t eat there as we went out every day nor did we play there  but the buffet breakfast brunch was excellent and would recommend that  Queues for that were minimal  Cons  The bedding was what I would call shabby  Sheets didn t reach the foot of the bed  and I wouldn t know what to call what was under the top duvet comforter  It was clean but old   I have much nicer bedding at home which isn t what you expect from a name like Bellagio  Also do not lift items out from the fridge or tray on top  you will be charged whether you eat drink them or not  I had a bottle of champagne delivered to the room as a present for my birthday  we made room in the fridge for it and the strawberries and come check out time   was presented with a huge long list of things we d supposedly eaten or drunk  My other half did a good job of explaining but it was time consuming  All in all  I d stay there again  if the Wynn or Encore was full Things to do  Jersey Boys show was excellent  and I don t even listen to that music   as was La Reve  Bills Gambling Hall and Saloon was good fun with low tables and had a great day there learning craps and playing blackjack with fun croupiers The Wynn and Encore have fabulous bars for happy hour   you WILL get drunk  Don t bother with    margaritas in the casinos or bars unless you like the taste  One restaurant stood out  the  st floor of the Eiffel Tower was excellent  Go up at night to the top for beautiful views of the city  
P =>  So overrated much nicer hotels in Vegas My partner and I stayed here for   nights  We were in vegas for a wedding and decided on the Bellagio for the name and its central location on the strip After we checked in and got to our room we found there were items left behind from the previous occupants  Things like a journal  t shirt  hair bands  Not what you want when you re staying at a   star hotel  We called reception got put through to another department and they reluctantly upgraded us because there were no other non smoking standard rooms left The new room wasn t much nicer but did have an amazing view  The only reason this review got   stars and not   We had friends staying at Caesars and their room was a hell of a lot nicer  The rooms in the Bellagio are very dark and dated  I d recommend Caesars or Wynn over Bellagio Agree with the previous review  the pool area was crowded  People just leave their dirty towels behind on sun loungers so its hard to know whether they re taken or if people have just been lazy  The pool staff really need to keep on top of the dirty towels and it was hard to get service from the drinks girl The Buffet was good but waiting in line for an hour was not good The restaurants were no better than other hotels  The cafe at Paris Paris is nicer than Bellagio s and slightly cheaper  And the views of the fountains are better at Paris Paris Wouldn t stay here again  didn t live up to expectations  
P =>  Great Penthouse Suite for a great price Just came back from a stay in a two bedroom penthouse suite at the Bellagio and had a FANTASTIC experience  I m mid   s and went to celebrate my wedding anniversary with my husband and close friends  The room was in the main tower so I was worried that it might be a little  quot rundown quot  since the Spa Tower is newer but it was phenomenal  Everything state of the art  flat screens  ipod players in the alarm clocks and in the main stereo  It was all top notch  I ve read some reviews that the Bellagio was starting to show wear and tear and we saw none of that  The service was also fantastic  The room came with limo service to and from the airport and line passes  Our view was of the pool and mountains and it was great  We stayed in a one bedroom Skyloft last year and they are great   but a LOT more expensive  Also the   bedrooms in our bellagio suite were totally equal   not one master suite and then an adjoining room  so everybody was very happy  Please check out my pics  
P =>  Lovely hotel Lovely hotel  rooms were very spacious  room service was delicious  Only negative was that the pool got very busy and you didnt always get a lounger  
P =>  The Bellagio was a big disappointment We were very let down by the atmosphere of the Bellagio  The hotel did not give us a real friendly welcome feeling The casino personal are just amazingly rude and the pit bosses act very unprofessional and the security personal are the worse I will never stay at the Bellagio again in this lifetime I cant think of one positive thing to say about this hotel  The pools are crowded  chairs are saved and no one ever shows up  Smoke in the air by the pools is very thick at times The food is very expensive and not very good  The buffet was a bit let down to us  We waited in line for an hour to get lunch and there was nothing we liked The veggies were soft  the flank steak leather tough and the desserts overly sugary I will try Encore and Wynn next time  The MGM corp is way in debt on the verge of clasping and they are cutting corners in their properties The furniture and the room carpets were stained The Bellagio has seen its best days Dont stay there look elsewhere in my opinion  
P =>  beautiful hotel I would agree with everything the previous traveller said  It was also our first time in vegas for over    years and boy has it changed  check in was efficient but fairly impersonal when you were one of about    people checking in at about    check in desks  the hotel was always busy busy busy and heaving with people  the room was lovely  we also booked the cheapest  but the view was of about   flat roofs and only had a nice very distant view  the rooms were very quiet except for the slam of the heavy doors shutting  downstairs could have been any of the large hotels   wall to wall slot machines  everything was very expensive  we ate at the hotel buffet for     one evening but we had to queue for an hour before we were shown our table  hotel guests did not get precedence over other guests  you could not book and many people jumped the queue in a separate line for complimentary guests  we presumed they had won a free buffet whilst betting  the pool area is beautiful  they have   pools  large complimentary towels and plenty of sunbeds  overall a beautiful hotel  shop around for a good deal  but i wouldn t like to spend more than a couple of nights in Vegas 
P =>  Stay here to escape the vegas madness We stayed here in y and I would recommend it to anyone   it has the great combination of being in the hustle of vegas but allowing you to step out and relax in the clam and tranquility that pervades the palce outside of the main reception area The rooms were great we had one overlooking the pool area  which is beautiful and has a real feel of an Italian villa  The breakfast buffet was fantastic   even if noodles for breakfast took a bit of getting used to  and the noodle bar  just to show I have nothing against noodles   was very good I also visited the spa   which is huge very serene and just absolute luxury If I ever went back to Vegas   i would stay here 
P =>  The Bellagio is luxury Everything about the hotel oozes class and style  I don t know how anyone could have any complaints about it  It is a huge hotel but every member of staff you meet greet you with a smile and say hello  The rooms are spotless  I would recommend the hotel with no hesitation my whole stay was a pleasure  Thank you 
P =>  Beyond our wildest dreams for Luxury  The most luxurious hotel on this planet    We came to vegas for   nights after staying in New York for   nights We had fairly high expectations for the Bellagio   and were not disappointed  there were eight of us travelling   girls and   boys  not one of us had any complaints and we can t wait to return The rooms were breathe taking      queen beds in our rooms and the most stunning bathrooms  All immaculately clean and luxourious Concierge Desk was very helpful they assisted in booking beauty treatments in the hotel    its a must girlies even just getting your hair done  We had help from the desk getting us to the Stratosphere Restaurant   must experience that  and the Grand Canyon helicopter flight  they also helped us to get reservations at the Smith and Wolenski Steak house    must go to the food is amazing All of the hotel is quite a vision  The swimming pool area is magnificent numerous pools to choose from  the hotel is nicely positioned  you have easy access to the strip and it hotels so you can explore The restaurant options are fab highly recommend the buffets  so much to choose from We spent quite some time in the Yellow tail Bar newly opened at the time fab drink options the fountains really do live up to the hype they were mezmerizing  must have watched them for hours  Overall the best hotel I have ever stayed in   for the extra it costs to stay here its a must  
P =>   th Trip to Vegas   Bellagio so far the best This was my  th trip to Vegas and my first stay at the Bellagio  I have not stayed at the Wynn  yet   but I can tell you that Bellagio was easily the best hotel I ve stayed in for my style and taste  Rooms We had a great room in the Spa tower  I know that other reviewers had complained about the rooms being outdated and old  but this was not the case for us  Our room was classy  clean and appeared quite new  I can only assume they are in the process of renovating  did not see any evidence of that so I  m only guessing   If you can afford the  quot fountain view quot  then go for it  Pools The pools and garden area are simply stunning  There are two types of pools  large heated rectangular pools and smaller square pools with very cold water  The cold water pools were greatly needed to cool you off from the intense     degree heat  There were lots of chairs and umbrellas and if you wanted to go down to the pool area at  am  you could save a space under an umbrella with ease  Restaurants Amazing restaurants and yes they are pricey   but what do you expect when you are staying at hotel like this  The Bellagio Buffet was my favorite with unlimited Champagne  Nothing starts the day off right then a glass of champagne with first class food Location Bellagio is located right in the heart of Vegas  Unlike the Wynn and Mandalay Bay which are located at either end of the strip  whether its walking or taking a cab  everything is close from the Bellagio  Like most people visiting Vegas  they are shopping  seeing shows  checking out other hotels or simply going for a walk  the location of the hotel can suddenly become quite important  Bellagio is in the perfect spot Overall When picking a place to stay in Vegas you have to match the hotel s features with your needs  Bellagio is normally one of the most expensive places to stay and so the type of people who stay there  the ambiance  the decor  the restaurants  etc     are all going to reflect that  If you want to party  stay at the Hard Rock  If you want an up scale hotel that reflects that type of personality  then Bellagio is for you  I don t think it s for everyone  but from my experience it is the first hotel I would actually go back to in Vegas  
P =>  The Bellagio was great with a discount I have been to Las Vegas several times in the past few years  I travel with various family and friends  depending on the trip  I try to stay at different places on the strip  I had always passed the Bellagio and watched the fountains  I had been inside the Bellagio to sightsee and to attend the  quot O quot  show  I wanted to stay there  but thought it was a bit pricey  This year  I received a discount offer to stay at the Bellagio  I decided to give it a try with a small group of my extended family  We range in age from        so I thought there wold be something for everyone  Although there were constantly long lines at check in  there were numerous people at the front desk  I waited about   minutes to check in  which wasn t bad at all  I had printed out and brought my reservation paperwork with me  which made it easy  Our group got the two rooms that we booked without any problems  The rooms we selected were the Partial Lakeview Deluxe  We were in the Spa tower and overlooked the parking lot  a side view of the fountains  and the Las Veags strip  Overall  it was a nice view if you didn t look down at the parking lot  The rooms were decent  When they were new  I m sure they were beautiful  However  they look like they need to be freshened up in some areas  For example  we found an empty Mountain Dew bottle on the floor and a huge stain on the carpet that looked like the soda spilled on there  Apparently  nobody noticed or cleaned it up before we checked in  In general  the carpets in the rooms looked worn as did the beds  They weren t the worst  but they weren t the best beds any of us had slept in  Honestly  our beds at home are much nicer  The bathroom was great  It was probably the best part of the room  There was plenty of space with double sinks and a double vanity  It was nice having a tub and a shower  Maid service and turn down service was adequate  In general  all of the service at the hotel was decent  The pools were beautiful and relaxing  Even though it s a huge hotel  there was enough room for everyone  We ate at the Bellagio Cafe for breakfast and lunch during our stay and the food was very good  The quality and price was what you d expect from the Bellagio  In my group of six  everyone had a good time  We all agreed that we d stay here again if we received the same offer that we did this time  If we had to pay full price to stay here  I d probably go somewhere else like the Venetian  Palazzo  or Wynn  While the decor and amenities are beautiful  the rooms really are lacking for the full price and the   stars  
P =>   Bellagio absolute luxury We stayed for a week in a penthouse suite for a week and it was amazing  HUGE is an understatement  The staff were extremely helpful  The spa is great and I had the best massage had anywhere in the world  Such a place of tranquility in a busy place  The pool was great although I did feel I should have put full make up  hair and high heels just to go down there as it was pretty glamorous  The Executive Suite lounge we had access to was fantastic and took care of everything  The snacks and drinks they have are great especially the huge strawberries in chocolate    I ate a fair few  One of our best meals was at their restaurant the Prime Steakhouse  Wonderful food looking out on the famous fountains  I would definately reccommend this hotel for a luxurious stay  
P =>   Must see stay once My husband and I just returned from a five day stay at the Bellagio in Las Vegas  We travel to vegas once a year  This was the first time we ve stayed at Bellagio  We have stayed at Venetian  Mirage  Treasure Island  Flamingo     so I think we can rate this hotel as one that you should visit for the right price  We received a good rate        a night  which made it affordable and we couldnt pass up that price  Although it is a beautiful hotel  I must say that the rooms are tired old  We stayed in the Spa tower  Asked for an ugrade  but there was none to be had  I guess I could have complained about the pealing wall paper or the rug  but we are not in our room long so I just let it go  The bathroom was big  but the shower would not drain and the sinks were the same  We enjoy the sun and relaxing at the pool  The bellagio has a beautiful garden setting and about five pools  We never had a problem finding lounge chairs  The music was soft and although there were lots of people of all ages  all were very respectiful of others  There are signs that prohibit drinking in the pool which is nice  We ate at the buffet for breakfast         and lunch          The food was awesome  We also ate at the chocolate store which made crepes  approx       They were delicious as well  My only big complaint  for myself  was that this hotel is spread out and to get from one point to another is a long way to walk  We are walkers  however  by the time you get to the strip you ve walked quite a bit  The internet is pretty pricey     but we asked the concierge to print our boarding passes and she was very pleasant and accomodating  Would I stay here again  No  Its just too big and spread out  The rooms at the Venetian are far better and the distance from room to casino strip is much better at the Flamingo  I do think it is a must see once and if you get the opportunity and good price  go for it  Good Luck  
P =>   A Fabulous Experience at Bellagio Just returned from a   night get a way to Vegas    a promotional package which included hotel  air and show tickets  reason for the   rating in value   This is our  th trip to Vegas and have stayed at Venetian  Mandalay and Paris previously  Check in     mins  and check out was a breeze even though there were lots of people when we arrived  Staff was very friendly and helpful in the entire hotel  The resort as a whole is by far better than the others we stayed at  Rooms    Splurge for the  quot fountain view quot   Our room was on the   nd floor and had a spectacular view of the fountain show every night and a great view of Paris and the Eiffel Tower  Nice view of the sunrise over the mountains as well  The room although not as roomy as Venetian s but much nicer view and as comfortable  Be aware of the mini bar  on sensors and will charge your room if you move anything  Food    Good selection of restaurants  We ate a dinner buffet   night and the food was as expected for a buffet with a good variety from chinese  sushi  pizza  pasta  seafood  good desserts  etc  advice  either go early or later to avoid dinner rush   We also ate at Noodles  which had very good Asian food  the duck was excellent  and also good for a quick dinner or lunch  not much of a wait usually   Many of the other restaurants also offer a  quot fixed quot  price menu which may be a good option  Jean Phillippe is a very nice place to have coffee and fresh crepes in the morning as well as sandwiches and pastries at a very reasonable price Pool  amp  Spa    Pool area is beautiful with plenty of chairs  Went every morning  opens at    and loved the fact that   large pool is shaded by the hotel until about   ish  If you prefer the sun  the other pools are completely unshaded  Pools are much more relaxing compared to Mandalay which has a wave pool and a lazy river and much more crowded  The spa is very nice as well and pretty comparable pricing to other spas Casino    Dealers are very friendly  Servers come around very frequent and in some cases brought another drink even when you didn t ask for one  excellent service   Some areas are pretty smoky but do have numerous non smoking tables  Must walk though casino to get anywhere   Attractions    Lobby is beautifully decorated with fresh flowers and glass flowers on the ceiling is stunning  Botannical Garden is very nice  nicer than Wynn s IMO     go early morning when less of a crowd and get some pretty pics  Try to see O if you can    our package included tix to KA at MGM  which was amazing    A prime location on the Strip but I would still recommend buying an all day bus ticket     day  and beat the     degree heat  Take a trip down to Fremont Street at nite and enjoy lights and music Bellagio was our best Vegas hotel casino resort experience and quickly became our favorite  
P =>   FAULTLESS We visited there in mid e and had a wonderful time   The staff were always freindly and helpful  The hotel itself was amazing   The pools were of a good size and the Buffett is the best on the strip   I would go back there again in a heartbeat 
P =>   Mediocre We had to wait in line for    minutes and received a room in the back  I guess these were older rooms with    in  TVs and closet size room  The service at the hotel was non caring and when I complained to the service manager at the end of our stay she just shrugged us off  After Steve Wynn sold the place  its gone downhill  
P =>   Upgrade to the Fountain View  Stayed here in e with my Fiance in e and made the right decision to upgrade to a fountain view room  The show plays throughout the day and night and you never get sick of the fountains going off to clever accompanying music greats The rooms are nice and big and well serviced  This is a very big property and you never get bored  There is easy access next door to Ceasars where there is lots of shopping to do  The Buffet is also an experience you should try while you are there  although you have to line up like everyone else even though you ae a guest  The Casino downstairs if fantastic with all the old favourites available to play  The casino and hotel are always very busy with guests  tourists groups and people in general wanting to see the famous casino and the fountains never fail to draw a crowd Other drawcard for this property is that it is situated right in the center of the strip with Ceasars and a new development on either side and Bills and Flamingo across the road  All other casinos on the strip are in good walking distance 
P =>   great   it is a great place in the great and crazy Las Vegas   the view from my room at   th floor was incredible it was like to be into a movie  
P =>   Probably as good as anywhere else in Las Vegas I stayed here on a weekend trip  We had one of the Salone suites  which are on the corners of the building  This was my first trip to Las Vegas  and the city as a whole was not really my kind of place  That said  the coolest thing in the city was the Bellagio fountains  and our room had a spectacular view of them The first day we arrived in the afternoon  went out to dinner and walked around the city  and returned around  PM to find that they had opened the window in our room  dimmed the lights  and turned on the television to the channel with the fountain music  Watching the fountains was really fun  This hotel is nice  ultimately  a hotel is just a hotel   its in a good location  and it has a view of the coolest attraction  If you are going to Las Vegas  I recommend it  
P => 
P =>  Highly reccomend  We are repeat guests    While some of the  quot guests quot  are full time residents  we found the resort to be a refreshing change from the noisy  casino atmosphere  The food was excellent  the staff friendly and helpful  The pool and jacuzzi were maticuasly maintained as well as the whole place  We are staying there again this week  
P => 
P =>  A Loud No Frills Motel    We stayed at the Best Western for one night while en route to Utah  We needed a motel that was close to the highway and a room where we could park our car in front of  After spending a fun night on the strip  we headed to the motel  It is far from the strip and is located in probably the worst part of Las Vegas  There are about         homeless people living in tents in the same neighborhoods  We got to the motel around midnight  Check in was quick  The room was decent  and clean  nothing fancy  Just as we got into bed  we heard garbage trucks picking up the garbage  We heard these loud garbage trucks for another    minutes  When your tired and leaving early the next morning you expect to hear no noise  There is a McDonalds not far from the motel  Your right there by the highway which was a nice plus  Overall  this is a no frills motel that serves basic accomodations  I would not stay here again  
P =>   Basic Accommodations   No Frills but No Surprises If you are looking for a glitzy place on the Vegas Strip   this isn t it  But if you are looking for basic  clean accommodations that will get you out of town fast  then this property might do I would best describe this as a  quot contractor s hotel quot    a place where working guys stay that are looking for clean  functional  nothing fancy and close to transportation routes  This hotel fit that description and the main clientele seemed to be contractor types  It was a basic  clean and quiet hotel room at a basic price  The hotel restaurant provided a good breakfast  not included in room price  and for those so inclined  the hotel bar is open      The only negative aspect to our stay was the night clerk photocopied our ID at check in saying it was management policy to do so  At   AM and after    hours of travel  we were not in the mood to argue  The next morning when asked about the above  the manager just shook her head and returned the photocopy to us This is the sort of place you stay at when you are really going somewhere else  
P =>   Nice clean and quiet  This is a very nice motel for the price  The room was big and comfortable with many amenities and there was a nice Italian restaurant and    hour mini casino right on the property  The desk clerk was extremely nice and welcoming  The exits leading to this motel have been temporarily torn down  through      and we had to backtrack through a bad neighborhood to get there  but this place is fenced and secure and quiet  You can easily walk to the downtown Fremont Street area  but the strip is a long ways off  A good place to relax  
P =>   Best place to stay for the price Stayed at this Best Western for three nights Sun  Mon and Tues in mid ust  Service was good and room was very clean and quiet  The price was    a night   Not bad for Vegas   It is located on the corner of Main and Washington  I traveled with my wife and two kids on our way to the Grand Canyon  We had stayed here three years ago on a similar trip  It was great then and still is today  It s out of the way of the hustle and bustle of the strip  It was an easy drive to the strip and parking is free in several places if you use their outer parking lots  
P =>   Good Hotel But has some drawbacks Good Motel  clean  quiet  economical and has all the services you need for a short stay I had a   night stay for the purpose of attending a conference at the Hilton and was simply looking to save money on the hotel and was not looking for a luxurious Las Vegas experience My colleagues and I also wanted to have some fun as you should in Vegas and felt the Best Western on Main Street was close enough to Fremont Street to walk to and from  which it was Positives  Cheap  Clean  Good bar and Restaurant  Staff is helpful  Close enough to Fremont Street to walk  Day Time Only   Only a         cab ride from FremontNegatives  If you have business at any of the strip hotels  what ever money you save on your room you spend on cabs    Cab fair from Airport is fairly high        Not a great part of town   Don t walk around at night and even during the day you should walk in pairs  In my opinion  this motel is best suited to those who are passing through town on the way to somewhere else  It is close enough to Fremont to have a fun night out in old Vegas and then move on the next day  
P =>   Loved the Staff and the food was awesome   Las Vegas  Best Western Main StreetDate  Almost a year laterAdvisor  A TripAdvisor Member  Dallas Texas My best friend and I stayed at the Best Western  mainly for the price  We travel all over the United States for the bowling tournaments and boy were we surprised what this little Best Western had hidden inside    We arrived earlier than expected and found that the room that we had booked was not available as yet  We were there at   am  no surprise our room wasn t ready  but the staff worked on getting us a room  We went in for breakfast  to our surprise it was just like Texas   not only was there a large serving of food  but it was the way it was presented on the plate  very appealing  Before breakfast was over a room was available for us   first floor   Great for two old ladies  no climbing steps this trip  And do you know how hard it is dragging those bowling balls up all those steps   Of course you bowlers know  Our waiter was so friendly and charming  he and his girl friend took us out on the town the last night we were there  By time we said good bye to our new friends  including the bartenders  it was   am and our flight was at    who needs to sleep on vacation  The food was so great that we made sure that every meal was at the Best Western  The staff was so nice we made a promise that we would never stay anywhere else when we traveled to Las Vegas  Watch out Best Western  we re booking our date for the tournament   we ll see you soon   Phyllis  Travis  and the rest of the staff   you are the BEST at Best Western   Oh  the room was great too  P S  Travis and Carla  you don t have to ship our bowling balls back to us this time  Thanks for going out of your way to help us  
P =>   They Take Pets It was a clean room  The beds were fine  and the room was a typical BW  simple and basic The front dest staff are unfriendly  except for a lady named Phyliss It is a   minute drive to the strip  and about   minutes to the Downtown area  We did have some noisey neighbors  not sure if they were working girls or just serious partiers DOGS  they allow pets  and this is the reason to stay here  Pretty much the only reason to stay  other than a cheap deal  We paid     dollars plus     for the dog  Quite reasonable if you ask me  
P =>  Good value basic hotel This basic hotel was clean and comfortable  It is away from the strip and casinos with a nice pool  The price was a good value  
P =>  For last minute reservations only Motel style  For a low last minute price  you can have a weekend room just to spend a quiet night away from the Strip  Don t expect too much amenities  
P =>   Bien  
P => 
P =>  Clean Cheap and Cheerful This motel is popular with people from LA and so we saw some beautiful Harleys and Trucks  It is cheap and cheerful and the beds are the most comfortable I have ever had  we slept and after walking the Strip all day we were always glad to come back to rest  This is the good thing about this motel  it is off strip on Paradise Road  There is a shuttle that drops you off at Ballys but if he isnt busy one of the drivers will take you to Flamingo s  The only think that spoiled it was the breakfast  its cotly and greasy served by a surly male  But MacDonalds is   minutes up the road and so is a seven eleven where you buy cheap you water before going to town where it is three times the price The pool is small but there is always room  there is a hot tub and a quiet area above the pool area to lie and catch the rays if its not tto hot    when we were there There is a laundry room so buy your soap powder at the seven eleven as the dispenser is costly The reception staff are helpful and always know whats going on  There is a little casino in reception and the bar is a great place to watch the football  American of course Because of the size of the rooms I would recommend this place for families as there is two queen size beds and room for cots Also leaflets for take aways were always in the door making eating cheap after seeing the prices at the strip we ate either at Downtowns  The original strip  or got take away I liked it because I found the need for peace and quiet after a dat at the strip as the noise becomes a pain  Vegas never closes  
P =>   Best stay for Vegas Great hotel  close to the monorail which brings you to  the carnival  within   minutes  If you book a hotel at the strip you ll have to take a cab to get to the other side of the strip  Monorail has tickets for      or   days  You can on and off as much as you like Hotel has always plenty of parking space and it s free  a fridge in the room and a bar which is open for    hours If I go again I go for this one again 
P =>   very relaxed Very good value for money a good base for the strip found the rooms to be clean and towels changed every day nice pool area slot laundry very handy plus dryer no complaints at all staff very helpful 
P =>   Great location    Mile from the Strip  A small hotel in  quot Vegas terms quot  but perfectly adequate for visiting the sites A good clean pool to chill out and spacious well cleaned rooms This hotel is always busy so it speaks for itself OK if you want all the trimings go stay on the strip but you will pay for it big style   
P =>   Stuck in the   s  Skip it and stay elsewhere in Las Vegas  Remember those drive up motels your parents used to take you to on vacation as a kid  Well this is one of those from the     s only it s since been eclipsed by the high rise hotels and convetion centre that have been built around it I booked this after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor and I have to say I was fairly disappointed  It really is an old property badly in need of renovation  and some of the staff are extremely surly  On the upside it is walking distance to the convention centre and the monorail  which will take you to the strip   Don t rely on the hotel shuttle to the strip unless you want to get fried by the heat  It s an old broken down van with no air conditioning and hot air blowing through the back The rooms and pool area are kept failry clean but it is made up of a long maze of stairs and outdoor hallways so if you have a lot of luggage you will be doing some lifting and hiking back and forth The lobby is smokey and filled with very strange characters playing the slot machines  Now this might just be a vegas thing  but they seemed stranger than in some other parts of town  We had breakfast included with our stay  normally     per person  and I had no complaints about the food  Good usual hot breakfast fare Even if you re on a budget I d skip this hotel  try Hotwire or Priceline to get somewhere nicer at a cheap rate  or splurge and go for a nicer property  Honestly I think Best Western is going downhill  They own some really old properties and don t seem interested in fixing them up  they just keep them running as is  
P =>   Close to Conv Center The Best Western di Gras is a decent hotel and I like it since it s really close to the convention center  I ve stayed here at least   times over the years and have had no problems  It s the closest  quot budget quot  hotel near the Convention Center  Also  since it s much smaller than a mega casino you can quickly get in and out of your room and out to a cab  The rooms are quite large and have a free fridge that you can actually put stuff in unlike at the Wynn  The food at the coffee shop is fine and the mini casino is fun  As Arnold would say   quot I ll be back quot   
P =>  Nice affordable accomodation  My wife  amp  I spent   nights at this motel  It reminded my wife a little of Butlins back in the    s however do not take this as a negative  The rooms are extremely spacious with   double beds  extremely comfy  bathroom and kitchen area as well as TV with good choice of channels  Air conditioning was loud but essential as it was    oF outside  The pool was small but perfectly formed and more than adequate for the number of users loungers and pool towels were provided free of charge The  casino  consists of a couple of dozen fruit machines and is a bit on the small side  Free Internet for   mins a time was just perfect to check on e mails etc    The bar was great  with   TV screens showing different sporting events  amp  a good choice of reasonably priced drinks  my wife and I had  sex on the beach  each night costing just    each  they were cocktails by the way    The menu did not have a fantastic choice however we tried a number of things during our stay all of which were lovely especially the rack of ribs which I had on our last night The location of this motel is not great however the strip is accessible by free hourly shuttle bus provided by di Gras and the Monorail which is a five minute walk away  has   stops along the strip and costs     dollars for a   day ticket which is advisable to save your legs  A taxi costs about     each way Taxi from airport is approx         and is by far the best way to transfer to this motel All in all we had a highly enjoyable stay at this motel and would suggest it as a good place to stay for a friendly  homely atmosphere away from the hustle and bustle  
P =>  Good Hotel Very Unfriendly Staff The hotel was nice  close to the strip without the crowd  The staff on the front desk were very rude and unfriendly  each time I had to deal with them  Guest services were uncompetent  had to call several times for items because they never arrived  We had two adults and two teenagers in the room  but only   towels in the room  no hand towels and two washclothes  Maid service was terrible  they did an awful job of cleaning the room  did not clean the coffee pot or leave new supplies  had to call for supplies that took forever to get to us  Again only left two washcloths and still no hand towels  I usually have very good luck with the Best Western hotels  but this one was a big disappointment  
P =>  FANTASTIC PLACE   ONE OF THE BEST  It has made my blood boil reading some of the reviews on this hotel  jeez  what do some people expect from a budget hotel  the Ritz  This is THE friendliest hotel I have ever stayed in  nothing was too much trouble  unlike some of the bigger hotels that we visited on The Strip We were two ladies  aged    and     travelling alone and never once did we feel unsafe at this hotel  the rooms were clean with a double bed each and I have to say  that we both agreed that they were the most comfortable hotel beds we had ever slept in  The pool area was clean and had ample sun beds As an example  my friend and myself wanted somewhere to go and dance and listen to some decent music  i e  not rap  r amp b or hip hop   the owner Philippe spent about an hour on his mobile phone phoning just about every hotel on the strip trying to find us somewhere to go  unfortunately there wasn t anywhere    try to get that service from the owner of the Bellagio After an exhausting night on The Strip  it was nice to come back to the bar and have a friendly evening with the bar staff  it felt like coming home after a night out Don t let these reviews put you off staying at this hotel  yes it s off the strip  but we used the monorail regularly and also the shuttle bus from the hotel  A taxi only cost between         dollars too Thank you Philippe and all your staff for a wonderful stay  
P =>  Excellent stay I ve just landed back from a week in Vegas where we stayed at the di Gras   had a very enjoyable stay The staff are friendly  although reception is normally manned by   person so can take time for you to to be seen  and food was very nice  Jerry  Jason and William provided us with an excellent  friendly service Location wasnt great but the shuttle took you to strip between  am   pm and the mono rail is     dollars per day which is handy The only thing I d say which is a negative is about the surrounding area is slightly dodgy so just make sure if you miss the shuttle at night  you pay around    for a taxi as it s worth it Room was clean and cleaned for us daily  they have a handy man who cleans the pool each day and although the pool was a wee bit on the cold side  it was a blessing in the     degrees plus heat Would recommend to all that are looking for a budget hotel  don t have too many aires and graces and are prepared to stay around a mile off the strip 
P =>   A VERY FRIENDLY HOTEL THAT GIVES GREAT VALUE FOR MONEY This was our first trip to vegas and like many others was a bit aprehensive after reading some of the other reviews HOW WRONG THEY ARE  This is a great value for money hotel The rooms are clean tidy and spacious and all the staff are very friendly  especially JERRY who works the bar and was so nice to us and JASON don t sit at his tables until he seats you   he goes nuts but is a great bloke   We travelled with family who had   small kids and nothing was a problem  The pool is freezing but once you get in out of the sun it s a blessing We got married on the Monday and went back to the hotel later with family for drinks and looked after by all the staff very well The only down side is the location to the strip  monorail is    each per trip no matter how many stops  free bus to the strip is great  but only stops at Bally s and goes once an hour Menu fine for evening meals but not enough choice for a light lunch All in all a very enjoyable trip Thanks to you all at the hotel  
P =>   Basic but good value After six trips to Las vegas this was the first one we stayed at several years ago  We got a good deal in il so went back for another week  Apart from the first trip all the hotels we have stayed at have been on the strip whereas this one is not  It is a small motel style hotel just off the strip with a shuttle bus every hour to one of the strip hotels  This is good and if the bus is filled the driver will return  It is also handy for the new monorail but this is extremely expensive and should be avoided until they see sense and drop the price  The hotel has good largew clean rooms with fridge and kitchen worktops  A small casino and an excellent swimming pool with sun loungers  The bar is cosy and the food first class  Turn left out of the door and it is a short walk to the excellent Encore and Wynne hotels and then onwards up the strip  Getting around is easy on foot or using the excellent and cheap  The Deuce  double deckers  All in all Las Vegas is brilliant and the di Gras is a great place to start  
P =>   Excellent Value for Money     Well what can I say about my Stay in the di Gras Best Western To start with I was a little apprehensive about the visiting having read some of the reviews on this site  However after my visit between  rd e  amp    th of e I kind of wonder what the majority on here were looking for Best Western cater for the  quot lower end quot  of the market and are the equivalent to a travel lodge holiday inn type thing in the UK The hotel was located just off the strip about a mile out and cost between          in a taxi depending where you were going travelling from  The hotel also run a free shuttle bus on the hour that will drop you off at Bally s and from there you have a short walk    m to the main strip were you can head either left or right and take your pick of many of the attractions ths strip has to offer   remember and tip the driver a few bucks I seen so many people get the bus daily and not give the driver a few bucks for the service  Anyway back to the hotel  it was clean   maid service daily although they never got nto our room often as we were out every night and not returning til around    am so sleeping at the times the maids were on duty The bar area although small was superbly stocked and the staff were absolutely class big praise to Chris  Kelly  Jerrie and Cheryl  The food on offer again for what you paid was really good  I think I tried most of the chicken dishes   all very good and the       breakfast is a must have when you hit the hotel in the wee small hours  The rooms again were basic but they had   beds  shower bath sink and shaving area and we had a fridge as well as tea coffee making facilities  Also had free wi fi access in the room which was great The pool area was very quiet nice sized pool for the number of users and there was also plenty of beds  the hot tub was class too  There was a garden area and also a sun lounge area which was on the  st floor  My only criticism of the pool area was there is no bar or waiter service so if you wanted a drink you had to leave the area and then come back   bit of a pain that one  I realise this review is a bit all over the place  I am not long back only been back in Glasgow a few hours but wanted to get this done as soon as i could as i felt some of the reviews were very harsh  
P =>  Clean and basic Parents stayed here for two weeks with Thomas Cook  clean and basic  pool area nice with padded cushions  shade if you want it  Small bar and restaurant  bar service excellent by Jason  Good value snacks after   pm  Small slot machine area  Payouts in cash not tickets  Shuttle bus service once per hour  but not guarenteed to be on time The two male drivers were excellent more or less on time  the female driver was unreliable with an attitude problem  always leaving the Best Western late  and considering there is only one shuttle an hour this is unacceptable and inconvienient to all guests  Many Thomas Cook guests complained about the female driver being late including my parents  She thought it was her own bus and not interested in providing a scheduled shuttle service  thus Thomas Cook guests did not tip her  but tipped the guys who provided a good service  Drops off at the side of Ballys Casino on Flamingo  MacDonalds ideal for breakfast one block away  Visited the Desert Rose and the Gold Coast while we were there for future reference  would stay there instead of the di Gras  
P =>   Convention Center Bargain Suite Hotel I have stayed at this hotel annually due to its    minute walk proximity to the Convention Center  See my past reviews every il  Once again  I had a great stay  The Good Stuff  If you get a   bed room  you will have a living room with couch    bed rooms put  nd bed there   Room has frig  and large in room safe  I usually can get an early check in  Parking is free  Nice outdoor pool  And I always am given a     OFF Next Stay coupon when I leave  which they allow me to use even though it is usually expired a year later at my next visit  There are also numerous restaurants just a few blocks to the south  The Bad Stuff  There is no free Continental Breakfast   the breakfast buffet costs        but is full breakfast hot table   I usually just buy a bag of donuts a Speedee t a block south and use the in room coffee maker   No free Internet PC in the lobby  but there is free wireless Internet in the rooms  and a Kinkos a few blocks south that has PC s  Within the past few months they have stopped their shuttle to and from the airport  Booo    but they still run an hourly shuttle to the Strip   Airport is only     cab ride   I booked the room   months early on the BW com chain site  but you should also check the hotel s own MGI com site  The rate varied night to night  but the average was      With tax it was      then minus my     OFF coupon it was     night with all taxes and fees  If you are attending a convention and can t get a room here  check the hotels on Convention Center Drive  I would recommend this hotel to anyone attending a convention  but it is not near the Strip  
P =>   excellent value for money much better than being on the strip  Having stayed in vegas on the strip before  we were nervous to be away from the nightlife  However  we were more than pleased with this hotel and it s friendly cosy atmoshpere and returning to it at night was a relief after the hustle and bustle of the strip  some nights we preferred to stay in the hotel which offers lovely food at all hours and excellent bar service from mark  jerry  cheryl  jason and chris  Mel the shuttle bus driver was very accommodating and gave us useful tips about vegas  we felt part of the family  the room was pleasant enough and always cleaned if you got up early enough and we just loved the pool  overall a very good honeymoon and we can t wait to go back to mardi gras again next year just hope the same staff are there   
P =>  good enough The front desk lady at the Best Western A Wayfarer s Inn and Suites in Kingman booked us in here for a very favourable rate  The lobby is in the casino so is smoky and noisy  However our nonsmoking room was fine  Unlike other BW s at which we have stayed  there is no free breakfast here  too bad  We stayed on the ground floor facing the parking lot  the room was quiet  The wifi worked fine  There is a nice pool in the enclosed courtyard but only the spa was heated when we visited in uary  You could suntan by the pool or on the large raised sundeck in warmer months There is a complimentary shuttle to the Strip  but to only one stop  Bally s   so no matter where you go from there  you have to return there if you want a shuttle ride back  
P =>  Fantastic fortnight at the di Gras First of all I should mention that this review is based on a holiday I took almost three years ago now  The holiday was meant as a cheap getaway with a mate  just to relax for a fortnight and enjoy all the pleasures LV had to offer  note to other half  we didn t take in all the pleasures    The deal we found was unbeatable for the money     weeks for     pp  I would have liked to have stayed in the Bellagio or one of the other luxury complexes  but as I said the deal was too good to beat  If you re expecting Bellagio refinement  you ll be disappointed  but if you re a proper traveller looking for a comfortable and affordable stay  then the Best Western is it The Best Western di Gras is located on Paradise  the main road that runs parallel to the strip  It s approx a       min walk for a young fit person to the crossroad at Wynn  Treasure Island and the big shopping mall shaped like a flying saucer  Alternatively you can catch a monorail shuttle from the LV Convention Centre which is a   minute walk along Paradise Road towards the Renaissance and Hilton hotels  I can t recommend enough buying the   day unlimited travel card for the monorail at a cost of          price   It will save you so much money in the long run  especially if you re considering taking taxi s  The gates are patrolled during the day by security but quite often at night are unattended  so single travellers and females might feel a little uncomfortable walking across the convention centre car park at night  back to the hotel  Please don t let this put you off  rather be cautious  Also  if someone approaches you while you re buying a ticket from the machines  offering to let you through the barriers for the   dollars it would usually cost for a one way ticket  be warned that if security catch you  you ll be in as much trouble as the  tout   Just so you know  the Convention Centre stop for the monorail also has a free wifi suite  so you can go and hook up while you have a coffee  The coffee costs however    Anyway  back to the hotel  It s worth remembering that the hotel offers a shuttle to the strip and airport at regular times  check with the front desk   It was free  although the rather butch lady driver did expect a tip from time to time  what American tourism s built on     She did give me some good advice while traveling with her though  if a woman comes up to you wearing clear i e  transparant heals on her shoes  she most probably is a sex worker  Got me out a heap of trouble that one    The lobby of the hotel houses the  Casino  which in reality is a few rows of fruit machines  I think you sometimes get non patrons coming in to play  some Mexican  there is a poor neighbourhood a few blocks away so be security minded when playing the machines and keep hold of belongings On the subject of security  the rooms in the hotel each have a safe  but you need to pay the front desk a deposit for the safe key  Rather frustratingly the first few nights they didn t have any spare keys and when they did finally have one  it didn t work   Eventually though I managed to get hold of one  Very advisable to store your valuables in one as I said above there are some poor neighbourhoods near ish The rooms are incredibly spacious and we were lucky enough to have a sort of kitchen area with fridge and sink and kettle  It would have been really handy if we had a microwave too  but it was still handy to have  If you re staying for more than a week and are on a bit of a budget  this next bit will save you a bundle of cash  There s a local supermarket a few blocks away near a large mall  Go left out of the hotel and down Paradise until you reach a gas station and then head left  I think it s called Vons and it s part of Safeway  You have to walk through a few neighbourhoods that we were advised to stay away from by the local Police  while we re talking of Police  don t try to hail a Taxi like you see in the films  it s not allowed in LV and especially frowned upon when said Taxi turns out to be a Police car   but during day time I never saw a soul walking around there  I would advise however to not walk around this area from  pm onwards  when the schools are out or at dusk  The mall is worth paying a visit too as it has a lot of shops not featured on the strip and also more competitive prices If you sign up and pay for a clubcard type scheme at the supermarket  you ll be eligible for all the discounts  multibuys ect  We stocked up on cereal  banana s milk  yoghurt s  bread and water  which is very expensive in the hotel  so we could have cheap snacks in our room  Be warned that it s at least a       minute walk and if you buy a lot of stuff you will need to call a Taxi  which you can do from the front desk at the super market  Be sure that when you put the stuff in the boot or trunk  of the Taxi  he doesn t attempt to drive off when you get out  Be warned that some taxi drivers will try to sell you  VIP  passes to some of the nightclubs  These are not VIP and will not let you gain entry for free  The drivers will expect you to pay for these tickets The maids are all Mexican and extremely poor  Some speak English and some don t  We had a lovely lady come in to do our rooms and she did an excellent job  Everyday I left a dollar bill on the pillow for her and at the end of the week she thanked me so much I almost had a little cry  A dollar will mean so much to them and it shows that you care     p folks  that s all it costs  And remember they re on less than the legal minimum wage The pool area is smallish and if you had a few families in it  would be too noisy and cramped  but pick the right time of day and it s really pleasant  Mid day is SCORCHING  so fair skin should cover up  If you get too hot then pop down to the bar for an Orange juice  There s also an ice machine next to the doors into the lobby casino which can be handy We were booked into the hotel on room only basis so I can t comment on what the breakfasts were like  We did however have dinner in the restaurant bar one evening which was ok  although I m a vegetarian and found the choice very limited  everywhere was limited  not just here   I think I lived on SubWay for a good portion of the time Would I go back  Yes  absolutely  Unless the hotel has gone down since I last stayed  I would say that it s a fantastic base because it s away from the crowds  but not too far away  It s location is far enough back from the strip to give you a break from all of that  The local transport links are great and not overly expensive either  There s a lot to see and do in LV  don t forget Freemont or the Grand Canyon Hoover Dam  Just for reference  avoid taking a flight over the Canyon  take a proper tour where you actually get to go on the canyon floor If you do decide to stay  be nice to the Mexican ladies    
P =>  Great holiday Bit dubious about the hotel before we arrived as we had been told that the American s called it the  di Grot     Arrived on Christmas Eve and the rooms were very clean and comfortable  The bar was great  Very friendly staff who go out of their way to help  Our room was cleaned each day  including Xmas Day and clean towels were left each time  The food however  wasn t fantastic  We had no problems at all with this hotel  The Monorail was a   minute walk away from the hotel and for    dollars per day you could travel on it as much as you liked  It runs until  am  There was a courtesy shuttle bus operated by the hotel to take you to the strip and back hourly  So easy to get around  We had a few drinks in the bar late at night after a busy day out and there was a great atmosphere  I wouldn t think twice about staying there again and I wouldn t stay just anywhere  I would recommend it to anyone who likes the smaller  friendlier and more personal hotel  We stayed in Aladdin last time  now Planet Hollywood  Eventhough this hotel is not a patch on Planet Hollywood  it was much friendlier  Absolutely fab holiday  
P =>  Clean and comfortable When we read reviews about this hotel we were very worried  but when we got there we were pleasantly surprised  the rooms were large and recently redecorated  the beds were clean and very comfortable  with the added bonus of fridge and coffee maker  It was very close to the monorail which got us to the strip quickly and cheaply  if you didn t want to do that there was a free courtesy bus every hour to and from Bally s  There was a small bar which we retired most evenings which had good beer and the best vodka and coke which we needed after a hectic day on the strip  Food wasn t brilliant just ok but the staff were helpful and friendly  there is a small casino with only bandits but a welcome change  form the noisy large casino s  We would stay there again

P =>   Loved the Ribs We met our family from Australia at the di Gras and what a great time we had  We have no complaints at all  If you dont like Posh then this is the place to go  Very clean and very friendly staff who couldnt be more helpful And close enough to the strip  Mono Rail just a few minutes walk from the hotel  Plenty of taxis and not expensive to use  Looking forward to our next visit and staying at the di Gras again  And the breakfast was good  as much as you can eat for        If you have a evening meal there try the ribs Wonderful  Thankyou 
P =>   Nice place to stay My friend and I were given a corner room in the back of the motel and it was nice and quiet  The only disturbance was the housekeeping crew on the first morning  We were close to the laundry area and could hear a little of the goings on  Not much though  The room was nice and clean and the half wall between the beds gave us some semi privacy  We left a tip for the housekeeper in the morning and when we came back that evening it was still there showing how honest they are  We would definitly stay here again  The pool area was clean and the spa was a nice retreat for weary muscles in the evening  
P =>   Okay for the price Hotel is off the strip and not somewhere I would walk around at night  Rooms are very spacious mini suites  though the furniture is dated and could use an upgrade  Staff is average  learning more towards a bit surly  Casino is very small with only a few tables  Usually only of which   or   is open  Trying to get a cab is near impossible  so only stay here if you have a car and know your way around  I would only stay here again if I really couldn t find elsewhere and the price was right  A lot more negatives than positives  Pool area looked a bit grimey and did not venture over there  though they do have a nice sun deck area to lay out on  
P =>   great for the money my wife and i spent   weeks here in sept     and after reading some of the reviews we were a little worried about this hotel but the place was fine its not a   star but your not paying   star money  the rooms are quite big and ours had   queen size beds inside  the pool area is small by vegas size but we never had any problems getting a sun bed and the hot tub is hot  there is a free shuttle bus that runs you to the strip from  am until   pm just give the driver a     the rooms were cleaned every day and fresh towels whenever you wanted them  the location is a    min walk to the strip and there was no problem on a night time  i have no negative things to say about this hotel and i would certinley go back  as four vegas the place never sleeps and there is allways something to do  there are far to many shows to mention but there is something for everyone  
P =>  A good stay  Very nice hotel The frontdesk was helpfull  the restaurant served good food morning  evening and dinner  the rooms where very clean and very big with big refrigerator  Nice beds  A C worked well  and you need that in LV  cause its always hot The pool was a good size  temperature nice cool  a waitress can serve you cold drinks at pool side  good prices on food beverages Located just off the strip its perfect      max for a taxi to LV Downtown We will stay here again for sure  
P =>  Clean Comfortable No complaints at all   We stayed in the Best Western in y       Our room was large with two double beds which were extremely comfortable  The AC worked fine but a bit noisy  Had a few noisy neighbours the first few nights but with the aid of ear plugs we both got a good night s sleep  The cleaners were brilliant  We had fresh towels every day and the room was always left spotless with replacement soap and shampoo plus shower caps every other day  We also went to LA for a few days but we informed the staff and our room was cleaned but left secure for the   days we were away The shuttle service is fab but as others have said it gets busy at peak times   they would actually need a bigger bus as getting in and out of the back seats takes some manoeurving    The bus drivers   Kyle and Bob were friendly and courteous This is a great budget hotel which is close to the convention centre for the monorail  Would recommend using the bus system as its cheaper and runs every    mins As before breakfast after     am is a losing battle  We just went to the bar for breakfast but the hotel was extremely busy so we had quite a wait but it didnt really bother us as we were on wind down to go home anyway  
P =>  Very good value for the price OK  so the dis Gras isn t your top of the range hotel with spa  wave pool etc   however it does not come with a top of the range price tag so what do you expect We stayed there for    nights  and I couldn t really fault the place   rooms were clean and comfortable and of good size with a fridge  and were serviced every day  The pool was reasonable size  clean and was not too crowded like you find in some of the bigger hotel complexes Although the hotel is off the strip  there is a monorail station within   minutes walk of the hotel   this serves the whole of the strip from MGM grand all the way the the stratosphere with   stops on the route from  am to  am   am Friday Sunday   A taxi from MGM Grand to the hotel is only about    too so getting around isn t really that expensive The hotel also has a complementary shuttle service too from the airport If all you want is somewhere clean to sleep with the availability of a pool if you want it  then I highly recommend the dis Gras  
P =>  ent Option I did a last minute trip to Vegas  and most rooms were either sold out or very expensive  I found this hotel from Kayak for about     night  The room was actually quite large  and it was clean  The AC didn t work very well  but they got it fixed after the first night  The wireless internet wasn t working well at all during my stay  It was easy in and easy out  but definitely a trek from everything  If you just need a room and don t care about location  this is an OK option  
P =>   Quiet cheap  We ve been staying there   nights  when starting  amp  returning from our    days Western trip The motel is quiet compared to many other ones  and that are generally more expensive  where your hear everything  from your neightbour s shower to the people coming back and talking out loud in front of your door  Rooms are huge  amp  beds are comfy but would need some renovations deco wise  The pool is always nice after a long day walking on the Strip  The fridge  amp  the tea coffee set are a plus  Breakfast not included I would say a nice place to stay in Vegas  not far from the Strip or Downtown  especially if you don t want to spend      per night  On top of it  it is always nice to escape from the busy Vegas and get some rest at night  
P =>  Wouldn t really bother try somewhere else first The hotel rooms were ok and kept clean but looking very old and tired and the door had to be kicked open to get in  The whole place could do with a makeover  The pool is a good size and warm  but that may because of the time of year we went It also has a good shuttle service that takes you to the strip which we used a few times  That gets packed at peak times so the driver has to make multiple trips That s about it with the ok things and yes I know its not the Hilton but theres really nothing else good to say about the place  terrible if you have kids with you  The bar is connected to the resturant and they get annoyed if you sit down just for a drink  We were asked how long we would be sitting there and got moved down a table  You can t go anywhere else because most of the lobby area is filled with slot machines and kids can t go in there The staff are not very friendly most of waiters seem tired and are a bit short with you  probably as most of them can be spotted at the slot machines gambling their tips all night The biggest problem we had was we went to Los Angeles for a couple of nights and came back to an open door  probably the maid had left it open  I don t know how long for but I would highly recommend using the room safe Food not that great and expensive  If you go for breakfast after about      the buffet will have run out of food and the waiters are not too keen to restock Wouldn t really recommend the place  
P =>  I have pity for the front desk staff I have stayed there approx   times over the last       years The rooms have aged a bit but it happens  I did find the night shift clerk or the  quot Night Auditor quot  a bit surly but I under stand as I was a Night Auditor for over    yearsmy self  My real simpathies are with the evening desk staff  The hotel has Karaoke in the lounge that is right next to the lobby and no wall between them  If they can stillfunction with all that off key wailing they have my respect  
P =>   Viva Las Vegas After reading some of these reviews about the di Gras you really CAN T please everyone  Just back after a fortnight staying at the di Gras and I certainly can t fault it one bit  Seven of us went away and not one complaint  We all had a fantastic time and will certainly be back that s for sure   Rooms clean and tidy worth the money  food great even though we re sick of looking at burgers now ha  Staff were great very pleasant and helpful  Plenty to do and see  The worse part of the holiday is actually dragging yourself away to come home    
P =>   Dingy looking Hotel We had booked    days in another hotel casino very close to the di Gras but the travel representative informed us we had to stay at the Best Western di Gras  This hotel casino is a tired looking motel type property  with a small bar cafe area and    old fashioned slots in a arcade area  the rooms are dingy and very noisy and lack privacy and security being on an external walkway with access straight from the car park  This hotel need lots of money spent on it to bring it up to date  The staff are friendly enough  I will not be staying at the di Gras again even though I will be holidaying in Vegas again  
P =>   Convetion Center hotel on a budget We had   days at the National Hardware Show on  th   th  amp   th of   We checked in on Monday the  th and check in was smooth and pleasant experience staff extremely helpful and professional  Lobby is part of small slot based casino and bar  We were given a top floor room on the front of building room       I would not advise anyone to take this room in the future until it has been refurbished the nicotine coated walls  amp  ceilings gave the room a pungent  amp  fusty smokey smell I don t think the room is a smoking one anymore but the years of nicotine were clearly evident  bathroom was very clean but basic  The room had no sound proofing from the   lane motorway which is only about   ft away you can also see daylight through the room door the curtain only just covers the single glazed windows  If you have a sleep mask and ear plugs you may get some sleep The main reason we booked this hotel was to get us close to the convention centre and what an excellant location  mins walk away  I would recommend the Holiday Inn on Polaris Avenue its a lot further away but a far superior hotel  
P =>   Pretty good experience The motel has really large rooms with either a living room and bed or two beds  I recommend asking for an inside room  The area is ok  but after dark it gets a bit sketchy  The tram is within walking distance  but there were a few times we felt unsafe after we got off  The hotel has a free shuttle that operates till   pm  Only issue is that it gets full fast and then you have to sit around waiting for another one  we waited a half hour and ended up taking a cab  Shuttle takes you to and from Ballys  I recommend taking a cab over the tram because the cab is the same price  Pool area was nice  pool was clean  I felt comfortable in the motel and it was clean and maintained with a fridge in the room  The casino is very very small  but fun if you just want to play a few coins  They have a free computer you can use  The restaurant is inexpensive  and we enjoyed the food  One comment  from the site we were under the impression it was close to the strip  Define close  We love walking  and I would not recommend walking to the strip  It s far and probably not so safe    but good value at the price we paid via CAA  
P =>   one of the better places i have been in As other have said i to read some reviews how mistaken we found the accomodation to be spacious and cleaned daily if clean towels were needed then all we had to do was leave the dirty on the floor complimentory toiletries were left daily and the maid was only to pleased to give more if asked for  There is a free shuttle that leaves on the hour that goes first to BALLEYS hotel then to the airport  Only had two problems one being that the pool was freezing and another was that we had to give up      as a deposit for the room returned on departure which the travel agent did not tell us on booking the safe in the room only costs    a day very reasonable bar stays open    hours as do most places in vegas the mono rail is just a few meters up the road right of the main entrance its the conference centre stop we bought    hour passes    each you can ride up and down as often as you like we stayed in      very nice room second floor bottom end of the complex two places highly recommended to eat one being TERRIBLES about a       min walk left of the main entrance       buffet breakfast and if you pick up a leaflet in the hotel you can buy one get one free with it  The other place if you want good food is the buffet in HARRAHS hotel        more food than you can shake a stick at def recommend the CANYON tour and do the SKYWALK We are def going back next year as there are still some hotels we have not seen esp in the downtown area all i can say is GO SEE AND ENJOY 
P => Don t stay at the di Gras  We found BED BUGS in our beds   My husband  daughter  son in law  infant grandson  and I went to Las Vegas in        and stayed at the di Gras Hotel and Casino  We had booked this through hotels com  so we had never been there  Upon sight  the room looked nice and clean  but the second night  our daughter woke up  feeling something crawling on her  We found a small  quot tick looking quot  critter and put it in a bottle  The next night   the same thing happened  This one was larger than the first  We captured it also  and took the first one to the hotel desk  told the desk clerks what had happened and left it with them We brought the second one home and the next day I took it to the State Home Extension Office  where an entomologist examined it under a microscope and told me it was a bed bug and that it was quite large because it had just had a  quot blood meal quot    It had feasted on our daughter   She gave me the phone number of the Public Health Dept  in East Las Vegas and told me to report it to them  which I did  They said they would send someone out to examine the room and would call me back  It s il and I still haven t received a call from them I have Googled  quot bed bugs in Las Vegas quot  and was amazed at the list of hotels that have been reported to have bed bugs  The report started with the Stratisphere and went on and on  I don t think I am ever staying in Las Vegas again  The entomologist said   quot Well  I guess what happens in Vegas  doesn t stay in Vegas  does it  quot  NO  it certainly DOES NOT quot   You can back bed bugs home with you  We had to wash and re wash everything we had taken with us  but you have to wait    days to see if you packed them home with you  I recommend anyone planning a trip to Vegas check the  quot bed bug list quot  and see if your hotel is on it P S  Two years ago I contracted Norwalk Virus in Vegas  too   Be careful what you eat  
P =>  Don t stop here Where do you start about this hotel  This is our third visit to Las Vegas and due to our usual hotel been fully booked our agent put us in this hotel which should be renamed the  quot Worst quot  Best Western We were booked in here for five nights they offer a pick up service from the airport we phoned them but they didn t pick us up  The safe in the room didn t work when asked what they could do about this the answer was nothing  The room was dirty and smelly and the outside and inside apperance of the whole place was run down  It states in the advert that it is near the Strip and Monorail this is true if you like a Long walk  Due to the state of the place and their attitude towards us we only stayed there about an hour then checked out and went to stay in another hotel on the Strip Remember the movie Psycho do I say more    The best thing for this hotel would be to demolish it  
P =>   friendly and great vaue having read reviews of this hotel  arrived with some trepidation  However fears were unfounded  the Ballagio it is not  but it was clean  friendly and great value for money  Hotel shuttle worked very well for the strip and airport  remember to tip driver   this was our fourth stay in Vegas and will be our fifth next year 
P =>   You probably DO NOT want to stay here unless you are broke  Reading some of the favorable reviews here  I must simply declare that I could find no evidence of their truth  and so I question their veracity  I trusted them to my detriment It s a scary place    the door locks are shaky  and it s a typical old style motel  with the door opening into the parking lot or a concrete platform leading to stairs  and the platform rocks and sways when a laundry cart rolls by or more than a few people walk together The oddest thing happened my first night there  The bathroom fan and light  typically on a timer to save energy  were wired in reverse  so they came back on after    minutes  All night long  At first it had seemed I d failed to turn off the light  but after three trips in an hour  I could not imagine why this was occurring and finally figured it out  which didn t solve the problem but somewhat eased my mind  I simply closed the bathroom door and ignored the noise and the light emanating from the room Look  this place is not terrible  and nothing bad happened to me  and perhaps you could do worse  But I doubt you really want to stay here  though I confess your finances might make you need to stay here As for me  I chose it because I over relied on the reviews filled with false praise  and because the city was largely booked when I need a room  Never again  
P =>   Geat Place New Renovations The di Gras Hotel is next to the Convention Center in Las Vegas off the strip  The check in was fast and friendly  the young lady gave me early check in and said there was no problem in getting my airline boarding pass when I was departing  I stayed   nights and the room was perfect  They have completed new renovations  new tile in bathroom  completely new bathroom  small refrigerator in kitchen and coffee maker  Two great beds with firm mattress  great sleeping  Heating system works automatically when you put your room key in a slot by the door They have a shuttle service that runs to the airport and one that goes to the strip on the hour  Very nice if you don t have a car I had a car and did not use the service  They have a little casino and a restaurant  I did not visit either place  All things considered I will spend a few nights there on my next trip to Vegas  
P =>   ent priced value sub average location if ur here for the strip I always enjoy Best Western Great room  huge  and well furnished  great quality bedding  I slept like a baby  A little loud at night on the weekends  with the people coming in at all hours from the casinos and such  but hey  that s Vegas for u Customer service was friendly  and knowledgeable  pool was beautiful  my room looked right down at it  though I didn t actually get in  The room I was in was set up realy cool  it had two beds  and between them  there was a lil semi wall decorative thing  that gave us some privacy in each bed  It was my date and I  and another couple  so it worked out well  as we each had privacy in our beds  and yet  could talk to each other as if the wall wasn t there  cuz it wasn t really a wall  it didn t go all the way to the ceiling  the kitchenette was great too  with a lil wet bar and stuff  it was awesome  Great place for Vegas visitors Very near to the Hilton Las Vegas  and the convention center  though a bit away from the strip  not quite walking distance  in my opinion   but hey  if ur gonna be drinking or anything  stay here  take a cab  it s worth it  
P =>   Not so good    Rooms are huge and clean but location is not so good and this hotel is very expensive   Warning   Several rooms contains wireless unit which make a lot of noise all the day and night    
P =>   Great value for price  We booked this hotel for a one night in Vegas just because we knew we weren t going to stay inside our room for long  We chose it of course because comparing to the prices of other hotels for just a Saturday night  this one was quite affordable  To our suprise  the room was impeccable  very nicely furnished and very clean  Despite the outside look of the building and that it was a budget hotel  they had very comfortable beds  very nice pillows  modern and new decorations  nice clean kitchenette with coffee pot and free coffee  small but modern bathroom  etc  A small detail which is common in most expensive hotels  the blanket in the bed was covered by a white clean sheet  The only thing that we didn t like was the breakfast on premises which was rather expensive and not very good  I think this is a great budget hotel that gives you a lot more for your money that most motels out there  Highly recommend it  
P =>   Filthy carpeting in room The room that we stayed in was in need of new linens  Bed spread was old and dirty looking and one of the pillow cases had an imprint of a shoe on it  Carpeting was so dirty that I would not walk bare foot in the room  I stood on a towel while getting dressed as I felt so uncomfortable with the filthy carpet  Ice bucket was filthy also  I feel at the very least a room should be clean and ours wasn t  I don t think that a customer should have to start cleaning a room when they arrive  I have to admit that the van drivers were decent and the front desk people were helpful but this hotel is in need of some serious cleaning  I don t think they believe in wash cloths as we never received one in the week that we stayed at the hotel  I would have rather spent another     per night and stayed at a clean hotel  We woke each morning to blue laundry carts wheeling past our room  The laundry area is at the end of the hotel past the rooms  We mentioned this issue to house keeping and they informed us that they were working on the problem  
P =>   It s not the Mandalay but thats not a bad thing Great alternative My wife and I stayed here for two weeks  As everyone says  bigger than average rooms  clean and comfortable  Big bed  couch  fridge  TV  TV channels weren t great but you would have to be mad to watch TV in Vegas  right   Pool area was clean and tidy  free towels for guests  Bar and resteraunt were OK  better places could be found but for a quiet alternative then the food was good and plenty of choice at the bar  Mc D s is a two minute walk away if thats your bag  The strip is fantastic no question but for two weeks holiday this was ideal for us  A little quieter  being on the strip for two weeks would have been too full on  Being on the strip with a car would have been a nightmare as well  constantly jammed  The monorail is a few minutes walk away or you can take the free hotel bus to the Bally  Basically you can take it or leave the strip as your mood takes you  All in all we would go back  If you want the bright lights      then hit the strip  if not this place might just be perfect for you  
P =>  Worth to stay My wife and I we arrived at the hotel on late afternoon from Switzerland  Enven though we were disappointed that our airlines  Delta  forgot our luggages in Atlanta    the hotel gave us a very nice and big room  two king size beds   The room was clean and cozy The hotel is not so far away from the  quot Strip quot      min  walk   The swimming pool is also nice If you plan to stay some days  you can choose this hotel without problem and the price is quite affordable  
P => Great Staff real taste of Vegas This is the third time we have stayed at this hotel  It s the staff who really make the stay special  The rooms are more like small appartments  could do with a lick of paint  but adequate  It gives you the true taste of Vegas  away from the lights of the  quot rip off quot  Strip  Here you pay local prices for your drinks in a small but frindly atmosphere  The food in the restaurant bar is good and reasonally priced  The hotel has a curtsey shuttle bus that runs from the hotel to the Strip every hour  don t fortget to tip the driver as they will also take you to most places  between the runs to the strip airpot  for a fraction of the price of a taxi Yes it isn t the glitz and glamour of the Strip but a true taste of Vegas and the locals  Staff that remember your name  which you rarely get in one of the larger hotels on the Strip We have made a lot of friends from comming to this hotel  and now know people who we go back to see every year  making it a base to travel around the rest of States If this is your firt time to Vegas  yes do the Strip  and Downtown  if you want to play poker go to the Tuscany Suites and Casino  on Flamingo  for a small stake you to can play in a small and friendly atmophere  Shoot a machine gun at the Gun Shop and best of all rent a Harley or just visit the largest Harley store in the world  you can get a free shuttle from Baliys side entrance  also a free shuttle to the Rio from here  My final tip for the more adventurous  nip accross the road from Baliys drop off point  there is a small Iron workers Bar  called the Stage door  this is the real Vegas   
P =>   Great hotel Great location Great memories This was my  st visit to Las Vegas  And will not be the last I rushed into booking my Air tours  My travel  Virgin amongst others also provide accommodation at this hotel holiday at the  Best Western di Gras Hotel and casino  which I later regretted due to some reviews that I saw on the internet How stupid I was thinking this The hotel is great for the money  in a nut shell all you do in a hotel room is sleep and wash The service in all departments was greatFast check inOur room was ready early      The room was big and clean  The advertised mini bar is   bottles of water  if required We required a  roll out bed  for the teenager in our party it was in the room within    minutes of requesting  And there was no charge We had a problem with our in room air con unit maintenance was there within    minutes and when we got back after a day out a brand new replacement was in place All though the size of the casino is like a mouse hole compared to the big hotels this was not a problem to me  I am not a casino addict  every where you look in Vegas has a casino  if they could fit them into the toilets they would ProsAll staff was friendly and nothing was a problemLarge room Comfortable bedsFree coffee and maker Fridge Cheap in room safe    per day     approx  No hassle getting to your room  like the big hotels  this hotel has only   floors and     room s approx Less traffic than on the strip Free mini bus to the strip on the hour  Also a service to the airportVery ideal location if you have a car  with easy on site parking Drinks not too expensive in the bar free soft drink top ups with a meal Free local phone calls from in room   See below for a great phone card deal ConsNONE REALY BUTDo not expect the Ritz  but as stated above I had no problem the comfort cleanliness and the service was there what more do you want Stated as     miles from the strip again not a real problem as a free mini bus is provided  Or use the mono rail Other Valuable informationGot a great phone card deal the my travel phone card            approx  gave me over     minuets to UK land lines via a toll free number Food is a plenty in Vegas  Started off with the Buffet at Circus Circus equivalent to about    per adult for evening meal incl soft drinks thought great not bad value until we found Arizona Charlie s hotel and casino on the Boulder Highway   miles from the di Gras a much better quality and Value at       per adult approx special days it was    when rib steak or steak and shrimp was an added choice but still astounding value Want to go on the helicopter over the Grand Canyon book early these fill up quick  This was an unforgettable experience Are you a thrill seeker go on the Stratosphere tower top rides the Xscream ride that puts you facing down to the ground was the most terrifying experience and thrill of my life Got a child not a problem plenty for them to see and do the lights and entertainment  free shows and attraction at the hotels in air conditioned comfort Blackpool in not a patch on Vegas  Kids can walk through the casinos but not loiter or watch We went in ust and saw Temperatures high as     degrees Shopping   go to Wal t They have plenty super centres around the area  not on the strip though There are also   outlet centres one either end of the strip  Do not miss The Freemont street experience this free spectacular is a must with the world largest LCD screen in the roof  This is every night  There are regular busses every few minutes Also look out for the free shows put on by the hotels like the fountains or loins  MGM Grand  etc Some hotels on the strip are linked together with either walk ways or even free tram monorail linksA great holiday I would recommend  
P =>   nice basic hotel Just got back from staying at this hotel and had no problems  Check in took no time and we were in our room before  pm  staff were friendly and helpful  rooms were basic but were cleaned daily  The pool area was nice  pool was clean  The restauraunt food was lovely and quite cheap  and it wasn t too smokey at all as you can only smoke at the bar and the  casino  is across the other side so this causes no problems  as for transport  we used the free shutttle to take us to the strip which took  mins and we would get a taxi back  and the location is fine as it is quieter han the strip  i would stay again  
P =>   ent Hotel but Awful Checkin I was a little dubious about this hotel based on other reviews  I will start by saying that those who complained about the long wait for check in were absolutely spot on  Quite simply  the worst check in experience I have had at any hotel  anywhere in the world  ever  They absolutely will not let you check in until  PM  by which time a very long line has developed  Rooms are allocated at check in from those that are clean and available   do not expect to get the type of room that you booked  Aside from the ghastly    minute check in procedure  this hotel isn t too bad  The room was clean  comfortable and very large  Not the most recently renovated and could probably do with some updating  but as a cheap base for Las Vegas tourism  you can t go far wrong  The monorail is a leisurely walk away and makes getting to the strip very easy and if you buy a   or   day pass  this is cheap too  I did not try the hotel restaurants   as the hotel is also a small casino  the public areas are quite smokey  Cheap  cheerful and quite a pleasant stay if you live through the check in process   
P =>  Good value A bargain for Las Vegas  The room was very clean  free wireless  Not too far from the strip  but you probably would want to drive over when it s hot  Just a couple blocks to the south  then right on Sahara and park in any casino lot for free  If you don t have a car  the monorail is just down the street  Large pool  but no hot tub  We ll probably stay here in the future  
P =>  Depend on what you want need  Vegas glamour or luxury this is not  If you need a room with out frills and want to be in easy walking distance to the convention center for aound     a night this is not a bad place  I would not recommend for anyone other than a conventioneer on a budget  I also suggest the Embassy Suites   doors down  It somtimes can be booked for as low as        and is world above the BW  
P =>   Seen better days how soon before its rebuilt  I ve stayed at this hotel on and off over the years  its proximity to the convention center was always the main selling point  Since I stayed here last   years ago it appears nothing has been fixed  Some of the concrete stairs were even broken  half the lights in the room worked  the safe was broken and the carpet coming up  towel bars falling out too   It was still somewhat clean but clearly had seen better days  The staff just shurgged about the broken items  this is always a busy week for nearby hotels but their lack of care was greater than usual  I asked if they were not fixing anything because they planned to renovate and rebuild and was told that was likely but its up to the owners I would avoid this hotel form now on unless it is rebuilt or remodelled  try some of the other nearby hotels such as the fairfeild inn or Villa Roma both of whihc I checked and appear in much better shape  
P =>   We Always Stay Here We like this little oasis near the strip in Vegas  The   story hotel is built around a central courtyard which has a pool  spa  grass  and trees  and a nice covered patio with tables and chairs  At     per nite  before tax etc   its a good deal  close to everything  Rooms are large and clean  maybe a little dark  be sure to ask for a room on the courtyard  There is an OK bar and restaurant  and a micro casino  
P => Never again I d sleep at the airport first The only reason I cannot add photos to this review is that the memory card on my camera was full and I didn t wish to delete anything on it  The only good thing I could say about this hotel is that yes  it could have been worse  but also with a little care can be much  much better  The feeling of dread began at the approach  this hotel s comment card brags about    years and it looks like it s been around that long with very little care given  The clerks were less than friendly  making it to my room with briefcase  garment bag  and roll on was difficult in the tiny elevator  set of steps up  aisle  then steps again down  The room had an odor  after opening the fridge  which would have been nice to have  I discovered the source of the smell  The coffee maker also should have been nice to have  was missing the top which meant the coffee stayed in the basket rather than hitting the pot   I ran hot water through it twice before using it Must have been that way for guest before me because there was still coffee on the counter top when I moved it to plug in  The remote did not work  Tv reception was poor  maintenance man who came to replace remote blamed the city cable company   Found that interesting as the hotel I moved to the next day had the same cable provider and their reception was excellent The  quot safety quot  chain lock had been pulled from the door frame so many times that it was ineffective to put into use  the lone screw came out in my hand  After washing out the shower so I could feel comfortable using it I reached for a towel only to have one side of the towel rack fall because it was not anchored into the wall effectively dumping the dry towels into the toilet below it   the mattress sagged so badly I was glad this was a solo trip because the center of the bed is where you re going to be no matter what  At check out when I told the clerk how poor my stay was and why she just shrugged her shoulders which makes me think hearing what I said must happen a lot  Yes  I realize you re not paying strip prices here but come on  the owner or manager should stay a night in this place then decide if they would pay for it  I stayed the rest of my trip at a well known strip hotel and only paid double  for the money the strip hotel is by far the better value I am a frequent stay diamond memeber of this brand  I hope someone who can make them clean up their act sees this review  
P =>   Stay here at your peril We checked in after an extremely long wait in a queue with only   people in front of us  When we arrived at our room someone else was already in there  we were given another room and that key would not open the door so we checked out and went to the Royal Resort where we have stayed for the previous    years  The hotel is    Not Secure   anyone could walk in and wait on the stairs or wait around a corner  Landings were dark    The rooms were smelly   my brother managed to get in their room and the maid had left a dirty cleaning cloth on the bathroom floor    The staff on the desk were not very friendly or helpful with our complaint in fact I felt as if we were putting them out    The restaurant is in the bar and reception area so it is on view to everyone  People were smoking and it was very noisy    Too far from the strip    The lift was very small and it was smelly too    Room door not very strong   one kick and it would be open  I add we do not stay in posh hotels and we are not snobbish but there is a limit to what you can put up with  
P =>   MARDI GRAS GOOD VALUE I notice that this hotel has had some bad reviews  We stayed there for   nights in ember  A spotlessly clean  comfortable room    queens   lots of room for us   adults  Washbasin outside the bathroom which was great as others could shave  put make up on  without holding the bathroom up Yes  there are no utensils  etc in the kitchenette  just a fridge and coffemaker   but who wants to cook in Las Vegas  The reception staff were very efficient and welcoming  Yes  the public areas are quite dark  but we were up the strip or shopping most of the time Despite the dark restaurant area  do have breakfast there  It was fresh cooked for us  plentiful and reasonable priced  Real tea and good coffee  We had a waitress  ia  who was very friendly It was lovely to be able to park right outside our room door  unlike the large strip hotels where you park and then have to walk about   miles to get in the hotel and another   to your room  We had a bit of noise early one morning  young football team staying  and we complained  Without asking  we were given complimentary full breakfast for the four of us What more can you ask for       in total for three nights for four of us  including tax  booked through reserveahotel  We would stay there again  
P =>   Bottom of the Barrel I had to give the di Gras a   because they took our reservation after the Riviera would not  Its a long story    Other than that and a couple of nice shuttle drivers front desk clerks  the customer service at this place stinks  The  quot casino quot  is about a    x    ft smoke filled room and the restaurant  quot area quot  is about    tables  The restaurant staff must be rejects from the big casinos   we even got to witness one bartender s boyfriend   husband threaten another employee by bashing his head against a wall  Lovely  I saw lots of foreigners here   heed this warning  pay more for a room on the strip where employees wear clean clothing and have some sort of customer service training  Also  you have to wait at least    min for cab service from this hotel    As for the room  well  although old it was clean  ours had a sleeping area and a tv viewing area  Very noisy in the morning  I suppose if you had a car and didn t need to use anything but the room  this would be OK  Don t expect too much though  
P =>   Perfectly Acceptable Knowing that we would be arriving fairly late on a Friday night  it was hard to justify spending hundreds of dollars for a few hours sleep on the strip  We booked this hotel as an inexpensive Friday night stop over before moving to the Aladdin the next morning The motel is an older property located near the Convention Center  It contains a small  and smoky  casino with a bar and restaurant area The rooms are quite large and include a kitchenette  The bed was adequate and we had a quiet sleep  Our only complaint was the extremely noisy fan in the bathroom that ran anytime the light was on  Free wireless Internet was available in the room which was a nice perk The motel is within walking distance of the Convention Center monorail stop  For those who enjoy longer walks  the Hilton is the closest large entertainment source  There is also a reasonable mall within a       minute walk The casino itself was quite smoky  but not atypical of smaller  off strip gaming halls Perfectly adequate for the low cost  
P =>   An OK Stay We stayed at the di Gras on a Friday night as it was a reasonably priced hotel in Vegas for a Friday  Location is convenient and the room was OK  The room was big but the kitchen was rather useless as there were no dishes or utensils  No microwave  just a coffee maker  Beds were comfortable and the room was clean  There is a small casino on the property  The elevator is very small  so the stairs are a better  and faster  option  This is an average place that we would use again  
P =>   Stay Away Ok  I wanted cheap and purchased from Hotwire  but this was a dump for its rating  Don t ever come here knowing in advance  There were beer guzzling characters out front  The hallways were dark  the tiny elevator had seizures on it on the way up and the soundproofing was poor  To add to the indignity  the room wasn t clean  Lest you think that I am a whining  chronic complainer  I have never written a negative Trip Advisor review before  
P =>  On a budget  This is the place to go  Me and a friend stayed at the Best Western on Paradise in  for   nights  and as far as a base is concerned  this was perfect    minutes away from the main strip     m from the mono rail  which drops u off at about   different hotels if you didnt want to pay for taxis  The staff were friendly  especially the   bar maids  Check in was a bit of a slow process due to there being only   receptionists but we got there in the end  The rooms were very large with a good amount of storage space  The bathroom was tiny  and when your e      you need all the space u can get  I ended up getting dried in the main room due to the vast amount of space there was  The views are ok if u get an internal room  That faces the pool and gardens  if your not so lucky  as we were  you get an outside facing room and i can tell you that you wouldn t want to really be walking round that area late at night  It s a bit seedy   The food was very good and i can recommend the T Bone steak and everything was reasonably priced  Overall  if u want somewhere that s cheap and to lay your head and get freshened up  this ll be fine  If your after luxury  get a hotel on the strip  
P =>   Not at all worth     when cheaper alternatives are better This hotel ranked lowest out of   hotels my wife and I stayed at during our honeymoon week in the US Without having done proper research  I randomly booked a hotel for a Saturnight  What a mistake it was  On arrival at   pm  we found a few individuals outside the front door sitting around drinking beer   not a welcoming sight  and my wife would have had us leave if not for the fact that we had placed a credit card guarantee for the     room rate Once inside  we saw that Reception was located right next to the casino  which explained the type of people coming and going through the front door The reception staff were cold  insincere and never smiled  They mechanically processed our registration and handed us our keys  We rushed out of the noisy lobby as quickly as we could The room itself was acceptable  with a nice large counter top and ample space  It was curious  however  that the phone wasn t next to the bed  and that the TV was located in the lounge area of the room  not at the foot of the bed  HOWEVER  within minutes of settling in  my wife and I were both being bitten by bugs in the lounge area  Fortunately  they didn t bother us while we were sleeping The pool looked inviting  but we didn t bother trying   we were out of there the next morning and rushed ourselves out to America s Best Value Inn  half the price  and ranked  rd out of the   hotels we stayed at   
P =>  Stay away from the di Gras    Watch out  This place will charge for a  quot no show quot  even when you stay there and pay for your room  Very unfriendly staff who really don t care about their customers  
P =>  Place is Cheap for surerather pay more or find other inexpensive place As others have written the Staff is largely Unhelpful  harried  and almost downright rude They get this  quot vibe attitude quot  from the Ownership who are by the way Australian  If you are not an Aussie  look out  The rudeness unfriendliness will extend from the guests as well as from Mgmt  Most peeps are very uptight there  Yes  the rooms are OK but the pool is actually kinda small with Aussies rude ones all around being very ridiculously obnoxious  arrogant  and downright unpleasant  I would never stay here again no matter how Cheap it is  because the place itself is Cheap and Unwelcoming  
P =>  Cheap Option away from the Strip We chose this hotel as it was a cheaper option to staying on The Strip  Our first impressions when we walked in were  quot what a dump quot   The downstairs reception and gaming area is tired  tatty and could do with refurbishing  Our room  however  was large and clean with a good sized lounge area partitioned off from the bedroom area  The bathroom was clean and the small kitchen had a fridge  bonus in the heat  but no utensils and our air conditioning unit  thankfully  was efficient  modern and quiet  If you opt for   queen beds you lose the lounge area  There was no concierge when we were there and the front desk staff were harried and unhelpful  Guest Services turned out to be the front desk and getting any information was akin to pulling teeth  The girl I was asking just wanted to get rid of me so she could presumably get on with her front desk duties  We stayed here for   nights and without a doubt  it was a much cheaper option than staying on the Strip  You are very close to all the entertainment and if you can overlook the considerable lack of interest displayed by the staff and the very run down public areas  it is an OK place to stay  The pool was well used and kept in good condition and they also had a laundry room which was very useful  
P =>  Recommended only for the Budget Conscience Well this place certainly does not look like the Bellagio   nor does it have the ambience of the Luxor or the other cool Hotel Casinos on the Strip  Some of us were a little embarrassed upon arrival but had a sense of humor about the hotel after a while  We stayed here because of a wedding that was to be held in the reception room  and there were several of us that booked under a special reservation  After arrival  I called the bride to be and warned her it was only so so and some of the guests may be compelled to stay somewhere else  The bride to be  who only did research on Vegas wedding packages and never really saw it in person  called several members of the family and apologized in advance  She arrived  not impressed  and only stayed one nite in di Gras and relocated to the Hilton down the street  But all in all  we agreed that there were probably worst places in vegas than this and overall  my stay wasn t bad  We had no trouble finding a cab just wait outside off the main road and lots of them will stop  This hotel served the purpose of providing a less expensive stay  and it was located only a couple of minutes from the Strip  The lobby as you walk in  is smoky and small  And I d like to thank the little punk who let off the stink bomb as we were checking in it was awful  The casino consists of maybe    slot machines and that s it  The bar was pretty informal  but Jeri the blonde bartender rocks  She made us feel welcome and make us awesome drinks  The rooms were big  mine was very clean and smelled ok  but I checked in early  Other family members that arrived got keys to rooms that hadn t been cleaned yet  And the keys to the rooms  they give you cards with magnetic strips and almost all of us had problems getting in our rooms  Frequent swipes is what is required and some of us had to go to the front desk and ask for another card to get into our room  Another less than desireable feature is some of the seedy looking characters that hung around the hotel I noticed this too and not sure if they were guests  or just locals  Lots of foreigners stay here since it s cheaper  Like I said  the rooms are great size with a sofa and a table  but they have those noisy old A C units in them  If all you want is a clean place to stay that s really affordable  this may do the trick but do not expect anything fancy  
P =>  NEEDS IMPROVEMENT  YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR I have to agree with the previous reviewer about the poor cleanliness of the roooms  My review is similar  I had a large block of rooms booked here for a weekend in y  Me and the groom only had the misfortune of staying   night since we booked the Hilton down the street for the following   nights but our families were here so this did not make me happy  The hotel is located right off the strip  in an older section  It is obvious from looking at the hotel that it is older and needs renovation  The check in process was a fiasco  Numerous mistakes made in booking the group reservation  so it took us an hour to check in  When we did get to our rooms  both were dirty  Had not been cleaned so we went back to the front desk and got   more rooms  I was really hot and in a bad mood so I just wanted my room  I proceeded to take a shower and the drain was totally clogged  and the little knob on the shower button came off  Since it is older and a motel  you get one of those wall mounted A C units  Ours was loud and noisy but some of the rooms did have newer quiet units  My parents room was also dirty when they checked in  so had to get another room  My friends room had sunflower seeds on the floor and some sort of grease spot on the table where the TV sits  Somebody was sitting there and noticed they had grease on their shorts  It is obvious the maids do not clean everything in the rooms  as the grease spot or whatever was there  tanning oil maybe  from the previous guest was not cleaned  The breakfast buffet is        Selection is so  so  no pancakes or french toast but you could make your own waffles  This hotel does not attract the classiest of clientele and there were alot of wierdos hanging out at the hotel along with some sleazy looking women                    The only positive things about this place were the big rooms  they are nice size  and the banquet room was set up nicely for my wedding reception  food display was great  The catering manager and the florist was very helpful  Although the hotel itself is not very nice and I would not stay there again  the reception and the food were good for a reasonable price  We only paid     night here on the weekend which is a steal for Vegas  but still  spend a few more     and stay in a nicer hotel  There are nicer hotels right next door to this one  I am really surprised Best Western attaches its name to this property  It is pretty obvious nobody from Corp  has done any QA on this recently  I do not see how they can pass QA with cleanliness problems of the rooms  Always remember  you get what you pay for  
P => 	Danes going all the way to lovely Las Vegas A good place to keep cool in Vegas  We where   adults and   kids travelling to Vegas for   nights and this hotel is absolutely recommended is you want away from the circus at the Strip  The hotel has a free shuttle to the Strip  so we left the car at the hotel  We got an upgrade for USD   pr night for a large room next to the pool    large beds and a small kitchen without  hardware   but a fridge to keep the drinks cold  a necessity   Rooms  pool and hotel was nice and clean and a good place to stay for a fair amount of money  There was also a self service laundry  The restaurant served a good portion of ribeye under USD      and a frozen garita for only a dollar  Wow  The kids loved the pool  
P =>   Don t Stay Here    Problems    They are not wireless in the rooms  They told us to go to the lobby and sit and use the laptop    Pool said open until      PM  They lock up early and find excuses    Maid steals the water in the room that the hotel charges for and the hotel tries to charge you for it     Maid service daily    Nope  it s whenever they want  The hotel knocked on the door at      AM  Probably to check if you were there  If not  come in and steal    Had a package overnighted to the hotel  and the owner signed for it  The idiots checked for it for   days until they found it    Plan on waiting in line to register for at least    minutes  The delay is because of all the guests complaining about the rooms and service    When taking a shower  the tub didn t drain  so it became a lake    Bathroom door doesn t latch    Police had   men spread eagled in the parking lot  It definately isn t safe in that area     Over priced for the breakfast     Rooms are old and not maintained  mattresses lumpy  super small bathroom     TV didn t work  it was faint screen with lines across it  The maintenance man  Willie  brought up a different TV  He was wonderful  a good employee  Probably the only good employee they had My advice to all is avoid this hotel like the plaugue  
P =>  Great Friendly Hotel We had mixed feelings about the di Gras after reading some of the reviews from this website  but were pleasantly pleased by this place We found the hotel easily from the airport  we hired a car  and found check in staff friendly and co operative This hotel only has slot machines  there is only a small section filled with the machines  The bar is small and personal  much better than the larger hotels on the strip  We found it easy to make friends with the staff and fellow holidaymakers who we saw on a day to day basis  The pool is small but it was never over crowded  we always found a sunbed The bar staff are great fun  food was great we did not have cause to complain about anything  Bret and Jason were very entertaining guys who really looked after us Overall if you are looking for a personal  fun stay in Vegas away from the      strip  we would highly recommend this hotel  We will be staying again next year  
P =>  Clean Good Food and Cheap Beer   My company booked this hotel for a convention in        Let s just say it s average  It is better than some and not as good as others  I had room      which is a king poolside on the  rd floor  The room was very clean with a loveseat chair  end table  and coffee table  and there was a nook with a sink  dorm sized refrigerator  a sink  and a   cup coffeemaker  The food in the restaurant is very good and very reasonable  but service is a little slow at times  A huge club sandwich is       and is larger than most typical restaurants  The beer is cheap compaired to everywhere else in Las Vegas  A large draft is       there is a happy hour every night from  pm  pm and some nights it was from   am  am as well  The bar is open      and the restaurant is open from  am midnight  The shuttle takes you to Bally s  Near Caesars Palace Paris  and to the airport  This is every hour on the hour until   pm  Take advantage of the shuttle to Bally s as this will save you at least one way of cab fare to from the strip  They will also pick you up at Bally s if you call and let them know  It is also only about     yards from the Las Vegas Convention Center and the Las Vegas Monorail station at the Convention Center  I ll reiterate what other reviews have said as well  It s definately not a   star property  but overall it s safe  clean  and not to out of the way  Visit their website directly at      where they have web only specials that other sites can t beat and that includes      
P =>  would not recommend i stayed in the mardi gras with my partner in may      for a week  i arrived on the sunday the following morning we went out for breakfast  and on return to the room i noticed my mobile phone had gone from my bedside table and that the cleaner had been in the room which if you put   and   together i believe either the cleaner took my phone of somebody went in the room while she was cleaning which is not very good   the staff when i reported this were not helpful at all and were sometimes very rude i found they were not helpful at reception and didnt really know what they were doing the hotel is probably a    minute walk from the centre of the strip however ther is a free shuttle service which takes you to the ballys hotel however this was always full as it only holds    people so you were waiting sometimes up to an hour for your turn the drinks at the bar were reasonably priced while staying at the hotel i also had two towels taken from off our sunbeds so if you do decide to stay here just becareful with your personal possesions  
P =>  Worth the Price Service lacking For the price  the room is defnitely worth it  Large room with a small kitchen area with fridge  Housekeeping is lacking to say the least  Staff only works till    so after that you re outta luck  Location off strip is perfect if you frequent vegas and know your way around  Staff is definitely hit or miss as previous poster said  One person can be extremely friendly  while the next is very rude  So if you get a good price  room is definitely worth it as you will not spend much time there  
P =>  Convenient Location   VERY nice place I stayed   the di Gras Inn il        MGI is excellently located on Paradise Road just south of the Hilton  Convention Center  and Monorail Station  The VERY large bed I had was very good  though i spent most of the time out on the town  Room      was very clean and quiet  If you get a room near the pool area  it might be noisy  Some teenage sports team was there and they did make lotsa noise  MGI does have a restaurant which seemed very nice  I did not eat there so I can t attest to the food quality  Make sure you call once you arrive for the hotel shuttle  It runs every hour until I believe midnight  They will take you to Bally s on the strip during their airport runs  I bought it through Priceline for      a night   taxes  weekend  Check through Best Western for better pricing  however I was there during the NAB convention and rooms were hard to get Definitely worth it  Really NO complaints 
P =>  Fantastic value for money and closer to the strip then you think We recently stayed at this hotel and I was pleasantly surprised  the rooms are massive and clean which is a BIG plus for me  The staff were helpful and the shuttle buss which runs from  am to   pm was a god send  It takes you into Ballys  which is a hotel we had never heard of but from there you can get to Paris  Caesars palace and more  The monorail station is literally   mins down the road and from there you can get to ANYWHERE on the strip  I would defiantly stay here again  why spend hundreds of dollars on a room which looks like an old French hotel room  which will take you    mins to get to your room when you can spend a lot less on a clean  large room  moments away from the strip  You can go and visit all the hotels and see the d cor   don t pay for it  This place gets a    out of    for me  Thanks guys for a great holiday  
P =>   Great for Conventions Rooms are really mini suites with seperate bedroom area  small kitchen with coffee maker  sink  and small frig  Ask for one bed instead of two and you will get a sofa also  Food is good for price and steaks are USDA Choice  A short walk to the convention center and Steve Wynns shuttle to his hotel make this a good location in spite of being off the strip  Bottom line    if you don t need to impress someone or be where the action is  this is not a bad place at all  I like the fact that you can get to your room in a snap  You can t do that at a big mega resort on the strip  Ask for an inside room facing the pool or courtyard  Tip      Budget minded Europeans are known to frequent this place and some tend to go topless on warm days by the pool  
P =>  For self employed convention goers I keep coming back to the di Gras  six stays so far  on business because I m self employed and this is the cheapest hotel within a five minute walk of the Convention Center   It is never one of the  quot official quot  convention hotels   The rooms are big  reasonably clean  have a bar and fridge area for fixing snacks  and I like a cool pool  The tacky lobby casino restaurant area is to be avoided  as it easily can be  Prices are creeping up here  as they are everywhere in Vegas  but it s still the best value anywhere nearby  
P =>  OK If You REALLY Can t Afford To Stay On The Strip My friend and I stayed here for   nights over Valentines weekend for his brothers wedding  the bride and groom wisely chose to stay at the Bellagio  We on the other hand were on a strict budget and for that reason booked into the di Gras Service and staff helpfulness varied drastically  Depending on who was managing the front desk we were either pleasantly suprised or left open mouthed at the incomptetence and rudeness of some staff members After an    hour trip we arrived to find they d booked us a double room with only   bed  My friend and I are close  but not that close  We rang down to the front desk who were polite but insistant that that s what we d booked   we hadn t  After a miserable night  with me on the sofa we were allocated a more suitable room   the one we had initially booked and profound apologies  The domestic staff were extremley helpful taking our bags to the new room and providing us with various toiletries which we d forgotten to bring with us The rooms themselves are surprisingly spacious  although the same cannot be said for the bathrooms  Basic  average and no frills are a fair description Location wise you re fairly out of it here  The Strip is a       minute walk away  Although cabs vary from      dollars and the mono rail is   mins walk away However  the hotel does provide a courtesy shuttle bus to Ballys on The Strip and to the airport  which is useful Food wise  you re best off heading on to The Strip for all meals where you ll get a better deal for you re money  That said we had breakfast at the di Gras a couple of times and it certainly wasn t terrible All in all it s fine if you just want somewhere to lay your head but by the time you ve added cab fares mono rail tickets to the price of your trip you re probably better off taking time to search for something a bit more interesting and well located on The Strip  
P =>  Good Hotel   Shame about the Check In We had problems on arrival with the check in  We were told we weren t expected till I pointed our names out on their arrivals sheet  They then allocated us a room  already occupied  After    hrs travelling from the UK  it is not the sort of hastle you need However once sorted and in a room  we were pleasantly surprised  The rooms are well laid out  with the bedroom area  separated from the living room by a open screen  with the kitchen area separate again  The living area is quite large and gives a good impression The outer side just looks onto the car parks  but the inner side over looks the pool and a grassed seating area The bathroom was well decorated and clean  with the towels changed when required The room was cleaned everyday without exception and the coffee topped up The downside is breakfast  The resturant is far to small for a hotel of this size and queues can be rather large  Unfortunately there was no crockery in the kitchenette  so you couldnt have cereals etc  Its just as quick to walk up to the Hilton     mins away  and have a    dollar  eat as much as you can breakfast We didnt use the pool  so cant comment to much  although it is on the small side The bus runs on the hour to the strip  Ballys   although I believe with a little monetary incentive  the driver will go a bit further The strip is a    min walk away The convention centre is    mins walk and also the nearest monorail stop  if its working  which it wasnt for the week we were there  There is a small shop on site  with a petrol station and other shops about    mins walk away Overall  if you want a reasonably priced off stripHotel then this is a good choice  They just have to get the check in sorted out Remember though  this is a   Star hotel  If you want   star luxury  try the Bellagio  at    times the price   And its Vegas  you aren t going to be spending a lot of time in the room  
P =>   Avoid this hotel My company booked rooms in this hotel for a convention  It is easily the worst hotel I have ever stayed in  The room was very large but filthy  The carpets and furniture didn t look clean  there was mold in the shower  and the kitchenette was nothing short of disgusting  The area around this hotel is run down and since no cabs stop here  there is no way to get to restaurants or entertainment without a rental  or a long  probably dangerous walk   The desk staff were friendly but that doesn t come close to making up for this hotel s problems  
P =>  Very good Deal Definitely not a luxury hotel  but  at the price  a great place to have a clean  comfortable  very roomy place to sleep conveniently off strip  Terrific room layout  with the wall separating the beds  Coffee maker and fridge a welcome touch after the    coffee and    waters of the strip hotels Bottom line  a great way to save money on weekends  I paid     with tax  or long stays if you don t need pampering  
P => Great location for off strip budget holiday Visit   years ago stayed at the Luxor this visit on tighter budget but love Las Vegas The di Gras is basic but rooms are good size fridge amp  Coffee maker great asset could be cleaner but I guess huge turn over in staff Pool area you could be in the sun all day if wanted to  amp  only   minute back to your room  likewise when returning to hotel you can be in your room in   minutes  took   mins at the Luxor Best part    minutes to Monorail station running until a m or got free Wynn shuttle bus across from monorail could be on the strip in    minutes Hotel shuttle available  amp  Bus stops near as well Would definetely stay again for price  amp  access  
P =>  grim and grime Dull and jaded decor lousy area  poor service should be renamed The Pits 
P =>  excellent value we stayed at the mardi gras for    days in may we found the staff very helpful and friendly the rooms were large clean and comfortable with clean linen and towels daily supplied by very friendly housekeepers coffee making facilities fridge tv and a much needed air conditioning unit worked well pool area and sun deck well maintained and never overcrowded the times we used it  food and drink was very reasonably priced  the strip was about       minute walk away but with the new monorail  mins away and running every  mins you could get anywhere on the strip within    mins although not as grand as hotels on the strip not as expensive either we would recomend the mardi gras for anyone looking for a good value mid range hotel and we would certainly choose to stay here when next in vegas the shuttle service ran every hour which we used on several occasions and had no problems ran on time gina and kevin  
P =>  thought it was great stayed a week  it was just finerooms were very clean  large and relatively quiet  It is a great place if you want to be close to the strip  via the monorail  but need to unwind out of the husltle and bustle Monorail is about three blocks  timely and drops you off on some hotel on the The Strip    dollars  tickets are cheap and a trip on the monorail is a great way to meet people  you are dropped off on the back side of various casinos  If you want to go point to point  take the monorail to the first stop and then take the bus     dollars  cash Room was cleaned above average every day  the staff was helpfull  the pool area was great  the size of the rooms was more than I hoped  the elevator was always quick  there is a security guard checking the area  the casino and bar restaurant is pretty small by vegas standards  but seemed to be a favorite local hang out  Most of the guests I met  who were all very friendly  seemed to be from Europe or Asia  Local take out food delivered in a reasonable amount of time Convenience stores just down the block  a really interesting guy runs the  quot gift shop quot   If you want to stay in Vegas and have a home base this is the place  didn t see alot of families  but why would you bring a family to Vegas  
P =>  Great place to stay It was my first time visiting Las Vegas  I stayed at      Paradise Road  It was Christmas  and I had a wonderful Christmas  I had a clean room  maid service was great  Staff was great  I will be returning there this week  and will be staying at this same hotel  I have no complaints  except the breakfast was a little slow in coming  otherwise  nice place to stay  Lita  the lady at the desk is very nice and helpful  and she tries to give you the best room possible for the money  I will be visiting Vegas again this Christmas  and plan to stay there again  
P =>  Yuck Our travel agent suggested this place because most places were full  what a scary place  On Paradise road  not paradise by far  there was road construction and lots of traffic  the people hanging around the casino were very shady  The room is large with a frig bar area  tv s don t work well  hasn t been updated in years  poor maid service  dirty sheets  dust among other things under beds  most maids don t speak english and nosiy fan in bathroom  wouldn t stay again  BEWARE 
P => Big room  little price   wonderful staff We stayed for   days in        VERY freindly staff     Rooms were HUGE  They need to update the TV   You can t be in bed and see the tv  too old  and too small  and the location in the room is not great  The Pool area is nice   but it was cold  we were told it was heated  NOT   But the spa was great   It would be a great NON gambling family place   at night I was impressed with the security guard walking around checkin on cars    the parking lot is dark  I have to say over all it was nice  and great PRICE   I have stayed in the mirage and Venetian and I was treated NICER her than either one of those AND the BIG BOUNUS   The have a   star dining cafe  the staff was the BEST IN VEGAS  and the deal for the food was AWESOME  My husband is a very picky eater and well  needless to say  he won t eat in a buffett anywhere  and we were so happy with the food and service we ate there every meal    and managed to still have money left  unlike ALL the other places in vegas  Older NOn  flashy place but at least I didn t charged for all the glitz  It was CLEAN and NICE  WoULD STAY THERE AGAIN     
P =>  Great value Not the newest or the smartest  but if you re on a budget  this could be the one for you  The  mini suite  was clean and spacious with a wonderfully comfortable bed  The pool was clean and tidy  The desk staff were exremely helpful when I presented them with a minor personal crisis  which they managed to resolve with a little internet detective work  The shuttle to the stip airport runs every hour on a complimentary basis  tips are in order of course  but my advice is to invest in a    day pass for the bus service      connects with the stip near the Stratosphere  My one reservation was that the Hotel s own Restautrant was too close to the noise of the inevitable slot machines  If I go back to Las Vegas I would certainly use this Hotel again  
P => Don t waste your time or money here Save your money stay somewhere else  Our stay was the week of            The rooms were dingy  they had bugs in the rooms  the staff seem like we were imposing on them  the  quot casino quot  is two rows of slot machines  the big feature of the hotel was the pool  but in talking to the staff in the days before checking in no one mentioned that it was being resurfaced and was closed  We had   rooms with adults and children with us for a wedding and we requested that the rooms be reserved near each other  we got   by the front elevator small box     at the rear courtyard and   outside the courtyard opposite of the construction site  not real close to each other  The shuttle bus leaves around   in the morning and you better be back by the last run around     As for being   blocks off the strip  i can see the two blocks to the strip  you just can t get there  If you plan on walking to the strip its more like     long city blocks or about       minute walk  If you do plan to stay here i highly recomend getting the safe and use it  The Place would be good if your going and don t care where you sleep and are just going to party  but anyone traveling with a family should steer clear of this place  The best part of staying here was leaving as early as possible  
P =>  Good place to get some rest The hotel is a little of the strip  but close to the monorail  My room was very large and had a fride  Nice and cool when it s     degrees outside Although the neigbourhood is not very friendly I found the di gras excellent to get some sleep after gambling in the casino s I stayed here on july    for   nights  
P =>  An Off Strip Gem  The ad took a little liberty saying the hotel was located  quot two blocks from the strip  quot  As the crow flies  yes  but one way streets and construction make it a tad longer to drive  and even longer to walk  However  this is probably the best little find in Vegas or anywhere else in the  quot motel quot  world  They were definitely not fibbing one bit about the comfortable and clean mini suite room  You open the door to nice little parlor with a pull out sofa  The queen size  in our case  bed is separated from the parlor by an attractive divider  and the wet bar is complete with a fridge  sink and coffee maker  Closet was equipped with an iron and ironing board as well  and  by motel standards  the towels were unusually generous and fluffy  One thing I don t like but which seems to be rather standard in econo priced accommodations is the split bathroom setup  i e   toilet  amp  tub  quot water closet quot  style and hand washing sink out in the open  Not quite private enough for me when the window to the street is directly across the room  Nevertheless  the friendly staff  inviting pool  and small but pleasant casino restaurant bar make the Best Western di Gras a great value for the budget minded traveler  
P =>  Viva Las Vegas  We went the weekend of the Tarver Jones fight and although the hotel is a   star    at best  we gave it a   star  excellent rating and here s why      the staff  The staff was courteous  helpful  and friendly      location  Just a few minutes from the Strip  The hotel is on Paradise Road and if you want to beat the traffic on the Strip  Paradise Road is the street to take  Also  it s conveniently located down the street from the Wet N  Wild  water park for families who want fun in the sun      little cafe in the hotel  All you can eat ribs for    bucks  We didn t eat there for the ribs but had breakfast there and was very satisfied      pool and jacuzi were clean and crowded at some times  Finally  the rooms  although they were not spotless  the rooms were decent and for the price  less than a     bucks per night for a weekend  you can t beat it  Besides  for folks on a budget  this room is great for crashing after a fun day and night and taking a shower or two  The beds aren t that great either  OVERALL  STAY THERE IF YOU RE ON A BUDGET AND LOOKING FOR A DECENT PLACE TO STAY     NIGHTS  
P => been to blackpool  this is luxury We stayed at this hotel in il  we were a little worried after the reading the reviews  but our holiday was fantastic  the hotel has had some very bad press on this site  which I am about to put right    The hotel was very clean  very comfortable and very cheap  The food and drink was very nice and reasonable compared to the strip  Getting to the strip was made very easy by the handy little bus every hour  even without the bus a cab is only around     The little casino inside has everything the large casinos have  except obviously really huge pay outs    or a theme    The pool is clean and well kept and most of the hotel staff were very friendly and accomodating    so like I said in the subject  if you have ever stayed in a Blackpool B amp B you will love this palce it s great and if we had stayed out on the strip we would have been broke in   minutes Obviously this hotel is not the flashiest or most glam hotle in Vegas  but atleast you can find your room with ease and get a good nights sleep in a nice air conditioned  basic but clean room THUMBS UP TO THE MARDI GRAS     I d go back anyday  
P =>  Great Time      il      We arrived after having read the other reviews on this hotel  and were dreading it  What a lot of nitpickers is all I can say  The room was visited by the housekeepers every day  and kept spotless  The coffee supply was kept going throughout the fortnight We had a full size ironing board and iron  full size fridge  cable tv and nintendo games to play  Mickey  behind the bar is a nice man full of info and very friendly  as were all the staff  The shuttle drivers were prepared to take you anywhere  within reason   The only downside was that the roads leading to the strip were being dug up  but it was quite a pleasant       min walk in sunshine  A very friendly and welcoming place to stay and we will definitely be back  so to the nail lady of the shuttle bus  keep your eyes open for us   l 
P =>  Mediocre Motel This hotel is exactly average  and for the pricing you can definately find a hotel on the strip that has the whole Las Vegas experience  It was fairly clean  and very large  The lobby has a  quot few quot  slot machines and a bar restaraunt that was small but really fun  You can get a free continental breakfast  below average  for free  or use their coupon to get a hot breakfast in the bar  The hotel staff I found to be not very friendly but average competent  It wasn t bad  but for the price I d go for the strip first  
P =>  Stay on the strip Basic rooms  but the location is poor  best just stay on the strip  even in a motel  
P =>  Outstanding   I thought the di Gras was quite good actually  For some reason we just got the nicest cleanest and most comfortable room  The driver really is extremely nice  he is quite a pleasant gentleman  While we stayed one night  we will surely return  As a hotel worker in Key West  I will give the informed opinion that this was a just fine place to stay 
P =>  Look elsewhere The first day was pretty nice I had a restful sleep  The next day everything went down hill  I take it that the management had a bad day  I would look elsewhere next time I visit Vegas  
P =>  ent hotel good value for money

P =>  Would Stay Again     And Probably Get Better Service Next Time We chose this hotel because we were transiting Las Vegas overnight and it was so close to the airport    mins by Best Western hotel shuttle   This is basically a budget hotel that serves its purpose and is reasonable value  The reception and other areas of the hotel are quite tired looking but the rooms appear to have been recently renovated and were comfortable  clean and quiet and had all the expected facilities  Breakfast was quite good for a budget hotel  Our only complaint is that the service of the check in staff when we arrived at   pm was poor and unresponsive   for example  our access card did not work for    mins after check in but the staff were very slow in trying to resolve this  Overall though  we would stay here again  
P =>   pretty quiet near airport We stayed here one night before catching an early flight out of Veags  The room was your average hotel room  It was clean and the bed linens were nice  For being so close to the airport I thought it was quiet  I didn t hear any planes  just some people doors in the hallway a few times  The man at the desk was very nice and even offered to print our boarding passes for us  I would stay here again for the value  
P =>   Service Location Convienence at a moderate price  Staff is knowledgeable  enthusiastic and willing to assist with all your needs  Rooms are clean and well presented  simple yet roomy  Hotel is quaint and friendly  
P =>  After stay service    TERRIBLE    Left   sport jackets and   shirts  on top of the jackets  on the bed in my room  my error   Called hotel upon arriving home  and lady said we found both the jackets and shirts  She promised to send articles to me via FedEx   However I only received jackets    no shirts  Called about missing shirts and received nothing but a lot of rhetoric about how honest the housekeeping people were and was told that the housekeeper only found the jackets  I asked the lady how they could have possible only found the jackets and not the shirts since the shirts were on top of the jackets  More token rhetoric with no results If you make the error of staying at the Best Western McCarran  be sure to watch your valuables and whatever you do      DON T LEAVE ANYTHING BEHIND    
P =>   I couldn t recommend this hotel We stayed here for one night because we had an early flight out of Vegas and wanted to be near the airport  What we failed to realise is that the bottom end of the Strip is near the airport  there s no need to stay at an  airport hotel   The room was nice enough  but the ice machine in the hallway was clearly audible all night  as was a loud buzzing from the hotel sign in the parking lot  For the rate  it was not good value and I couldn t recommend it  
P =>   Personable genuine helpful prompt attentive Catherine  il and Mike were probably the most personable  genuine staff members I have had the pleasure to do business with while staying at a hotel on business  Vibrations were not that vague  shallow politeness you so often feel from staff members at other hotels  Staff members who has seen to many guests come and go and have become callous and indifferent  Not here at this Best Western  These people showed real interest in a conversation and all were intune to the most sutble of humor  they laughed at my jokes   To misqoute the great Ed Sullivan when talking about Elvis   quot  These are nice kids quot   And the rooms and breakfast were nice too   
P =>  Good for family   Accessible Indian Restaurent Staff was cooperative Breakfast is good  amp  sufficient Very near to airport  Very near to las vegas public transport  Bus number      This bus goes to airport  Statosphere  India Palace on E Twain ave Good for family I got it for     pd on AAA Shuttle service to MGM grand is good Wireless internet connection was also good  also they have one computer in lobby Cons   Hotel Shuttle from airport is not avaibale after    am till afternoon some time  Out flight reached at    noon  so we have to pay for airport shuttle  This is not mentoned on BW website Another option from airport is take bus      buy a day pass for     Get down at Tropicana St  and walk towards Paradise rd for   mins  This is a cheaper option  This bus pass can be used for any bus route in las vegas   If you want to go to India Palace Restaurent  catch Bus     on Swenson St and get down at E Twain Ave and walk   min towards paradise rd  You will find India Palace on left side  Overall satisfied with Hotel  
P =>   Comfortable but noisy My husband and I spent one night here on arrival in Las Vegas  I chose the hotel because it was close to the airport and offered a courtesy shuttle  Our flight was       hours late arriving  so I was a little worried that the shuttle might no longer be available  but apparently it runs till quite late in the evening  We waited about    minutes for it to arrive at the airport  the ride to the hotel takes only      minutes There is no restaurant in the hotel  and there doesn t seem to be anything within easy walking distance  but there is an order in service  Menus are provided in the room  We didn t try this  but we did have the breakfast included in the room rate  It s all self service  with pre prepared items like waffle batter from a dispenser and partially cooked french toast waiting to be toasted  along with staples like cereal  bread and pastries  It s an okay start to the day that would be better if it didn t involve so much styrofoam  Time to switch to something more environmentally responsible The bed was comfortable  as were the pillows  but we were woken early by departing aircraft  Our room turned out to be very close to the end of the runway  Given that the hotel appeared relatively unoccupied  I can t understand why the front desk would give anyone a room so close to the runway  Clearly  there are other rooms quite a bit further away  so if you consider staying here  be sure to ask for a quiet room  We passed through Las Vegas a week later at the end of our vacation and spent the night at the Candlewood Suites  just a couple of blocks along Paradise  and we heard no aircraft at all  so perhaps the Best Western just doesn t have much soundproofing  
P =>  Very nice We stayed here on the night we arrived in Vegas and another night the day we left the States two weeks later  Both experiences were fine  The staff here is very friendly  even in the early hours of the morning  The breakfast was a nice standard hotel breakfast and included a waffle maker  which was a nice touch although I didn t have one  Juices  coffees  fruit  bread for toasting  a few cereal options Our first night was on the side facing away from the airport and facing the pool  Toiletries  which the hotel website doesn t mention  lovely fanned out towels and flannels  I m impressed by little attentions to detail like that   they don t have to  but it makes a difference   We heard no planes The second night we were on the airport facing side where you can see the tails of the planes moving round  We could hear planes   lots of them  and later saw the hotel from the plane    but I guess they fly out in different directions at different times  Hearing planes can t be a complaint  The hotel is literally at the end of the runway   what do you expect   It doens t keep you awake either  They run a shuttle service to and from the hotel aiport  which we didn t use  but it s easy to get to the rental car place from this location  so it was well worth it I reckon we had a better room as well with faux suede foot thingy at the end of the bed  better mattress  better shower curtain      faux silk valanace and a headboard I don t know that I d want to be based here for a week if I was just seeing The Strip  but  again  they have a shuttle  which was explained to us  and it seemed very easy I ve stayed in another Vegas hotel and it was nice to be in one where you can t hear that wretched ching ching ching noise  
P =>   Nice room nice breakfast The room was nicely appointed and the breakfast better than most hotel breakfasts  The staff was friendly  I appreciated the free shuttle service to and from the airport and the MGM Grand  the Strip   The only downside was the too soft mattress  but it seemed like replacement mattresses were just off the corridor A great place to stay the departure or arrival days in Las Vegas  when you re there mainly for the airport  
P =>  Quiet and friendly hotel We stayed   nights in this little hotel  not far from de Strip and we loved it  It is just   minutes from the airport  but we did not hear one airplane and slept very well  De rooms are very clean and good and the staff at the reception is very helpfull  Fine is the free shuttle service to and from the airport and to and from the Strip  untill midnight   The quality of the breakfast is good too  Walking from the hotel to the Strip takes    minutes  If you like to go to downtown  take bus       the busstop is   minutes by foot from the hotel  Busstop for the local bus to the strip is   minutes by foot from the hotel  So it is very easy to go around without a car  Should stay there again  Recommended  You have a lot for the price you pay   
P =>  Good hotel Good value for Las Vegas  nice decorated rooms  perfect working air condition  huge comfortable beds  huge parking  small but well located swimming pool  with sun beds  and sun since  am  Tasty continental breakfast  computer in lobby  Worth spent money  Definitely will come back  
P =>  Good Motel I stayed at this motel during a major convention based upon price  reviews  and the fact that this motel offered a free shuttle service to the convention center  The motel was clean  the rooms were nice  the staff was good  but if you re counting on the shuttle for transportation  it might be more at their convenience than yours and depending on the number of users  times might vary  The pool was unusable two of the five days we were there  But all in all  it was a good stay and things worked out  
P =>   Good price We stayed in this hotel for one night as we had an early flight to catch the next morning The free shuttle to the airport every    minutes is a great service The rooms and beds are large and very clean and comfortable The Continental brekkie in the lobby is perfect and very tasty Overall a very good experience One note though   I wouldn t stay in this hotel if my main objective in Vegas was to be on the Strip  Stay in one of the hotels there if that is the main reason for your stay  It ll make things a lot easier to be in the middle of things  
P => desert jewel I stayed at the BW over the New Year s weekend  The price was unbeatable  and the   mile walk to The Strip was not bad  There is a free shuttle that drops you off at the MGM or the Hard Rock  up until  pm  It will even pick you up  w  just   phone call away  The continental breakfast was perfect  Nice juices to choose from  and the bagels  muffins  and croissants really hit the spot  The room was clean and comfortable  This was a great hotel for some one wanting to go to Vegas on a budget  and doesn t mind staying off the Strip  I would stay here again BTW   just a little background on my stays in Vegas    I ve stayed at the Wynn  Flamingo  Caesar s  Bally s  Mandalay  Terribles  Planet Hollywood  Aladdin  Stratosphere  Paris  Veneitan  Rio  and the Bellagio I ve seen rooms at Imperial Palace  Treasure Island  and the Orleans  
P =>  Not a bad option near the Strip I chose the Best Western McCarran as it was reasonably priced  for a Saturday night   and had free shuttles to the airport  amp  the Strip Both of the shuttles work on a  request  basis  whereby you need to call and let them know that you need a pick up  That said  it probably only took    minutes after my call from the airport  which wasn t too bad The hotel is a good       minute walk off the strip  along a busy highway  so the hourly free shuttle is the best way of getting to the action  It drops off outside the MGM Grand  which is also the pick up point for the return trip On a busy night like Saturday  it did seem a bit unnecessary to have to call for a pick up to and from the Strip  as I m sure that there were people waiting every hour  and phones are few and far between for us overseas visitors without a local mobile cell phone  The room was a good size and clean  and check in was efficient and cheerful  I m glad that I had booked in advance  as  Sold Out  signs were plastered over the entrance Given the proximity to the airport  double glazing would have further minimised any exterior noise  but it was not too bad The self serve continental breakfast  free  was good  with several choices of cereals  juices  pastries etc  Unlike some chain motels  there was also a good sized area in which to eat On my departure  I caught the shuttle to the airport  and the driver kindly dropped me very close to the hire car shuttle bus  which saved lugging my bags across busy traffic Whilst it would have been nicer to be a bit closer to the Strip  the Best Western served me fine for an overnight stay after a long flight from Australia  I d have no problem staying there again  
P =>   Low Cost This was a low cost hotel  and as such I had low expectations  I was right  you get what you pay for in Las Vegas  Stayed on   occaision in a family room   great value in vegas for   of us  but the place was a little run down and had the feel of a hostel  It would be a cracking hotel for people looking for a cheap room if they were wanting to go partying on the strip   but as we started a   week vacation on the west coast  this was not a great start It is nicely located and cheap  but pay a bit more for a proper hotel  
P =>   great value near airport pleasantly surprised My husband and I stayed at this property for   night  For     per night  this hotel was fantastic  They offered a hot breakfast every morning  a small but nice pool  clean rooms and a great location  I noticed that they had a shuttle that ran to the strip and back several times per day  as well as an airport shuttle  both complimentary  I would definitely stay here again  
P =>   Good hotel bad location The hotel is good  it s clean  free internet  nice breakfast  all was ok and I might come back  but    the location is bad  If you don t have a car  and you don t want to pay for parking in vegas   going to the strip and back will cost minimum of     each direction  so if you re thinking on going to the strip in the morning  then rest and go back again in the evening you are looking at     with tip taxi expanses  
P =>  Good airport location This is an okay motel when you are looking for something close to the airport in Las Vegas  You can call for the free shuttle when you arrive and get a fairly quick pick up  Note the shuttle only runs until   PM  You can also get a free shuttle to MGM Grand on the strip on the half hour and can call for the return trip up until   PM  The rooms were clean and the continental breakfast adequate  One drawback is there is no restaurant close by  They do offer a take out room service  We ended up walking several long blocks down to an intersection by the Hard Rock Cafe where there are several choices  but I wouldn t want to do it on a hot night  I would stay here again if Vegas was just a one night stopover enroute to another destination  
P => Basic and reasonable This is an economical choice for staying near the airport  The rooms were clean and the staff friendly  It is a    cab ride to the hotel   just be sure to mention which Best Western you are staying at  There are three in Las Vegas and the cab drivers are known not to listen too closely  
P =>  Oh dear  Stayed a night after flying from UK and before collecting car  Rooms are typical Best Westernm  clean and comfortable enough  breakfast and pool just OK and staff were very helpful  All else is tacky and not to be recommended  Since most Vegas Hotels have some form of airport shuttle you would be better off on the srtip  
P =>  I ll be back The McCarran is tops for the budget minded  Our two days left us wishing we had spent the whole week of our stay in and around Vegas at McCarran  It s friendly  It s clean  It s close without being close  The amenities are  st class  Our granddaughter loved the pool  Our week was spent at several BW s in Vegas and Arizona  This was tops  A real pleasure  I don t say that about many accomodations  
P => 	Good Value    We decided to stay just off of the main Strip in Vegas and this was a nice hotel  The rooms were spacious  and very clean  Had everything you needed considering you probably are only there to just sleep  You ll be too busy sight seeing  or gambling  You re      minutes walking distance from the strip or a  minute bus journey  The staff were extremely friendly and very helpful  You free phone them when you arrive at the airport  and they pick you up  They drop you back to the airport   all included  Every hour on the hour til  pm they drop off and pick up at the MGM Grand hotel casino for free  Or you can just get a   hour bus pass from the Deuce buses that run up and down the strip for    which covers the CAT buses all around the area or for         hour pass on a CAT bus which picks up right next to the petrol station next door  the CAT only pass you have to pay   cents every time you ride a Deuce bus on the Strip  so a   hour Deuce pass is great value  Breakfast at the hotel is ok   fresh fruit  bagels  toast  cereal  danish s etc    But if you want a huge breakfast just go to the buffet breakfasts they have in every BIG Casino Hotel on the Strip   you don t have to be staying at them to eat at them  So for a very cheap stay   compared to staying on the Strip   it is well worth it   gives you more money to Gamble  Good Luck  
P => good value Good value basic hotel  clean but a bit dated  They run a shuttle across to the Strip and the airport  Wireless internet available and an excellent complimentary breakfast  Good value for off the Strip accomodation  
P =>  Not bad at all    We stayed here for part of our Vegas trip in y of this year  We were here for   nights  a friend of ours who was travelling with us got us a room for         night as she is a Best Western employee  The rooms were always clean  it was quiet  there were coffee pots in the rooms  and the continental breakfast was always nice  Not a large resort on the strip  but we had our own vehicle with us  and so driving to the strip or the Fremont area was not a problem  We didn t spend much time in the rooms at all  and so only used them to sleep and shower  It was more than adequate for our needs  the staff were friendly and we enjoyed our stay immensely  
P =>  Very convenient We have used this hotel for two years  It s position is ideal for people staying overnight after a long flight  last year our flight was delayed and we had been awake for twenty four hours by the time we arrived in Las Vegas   We pick up a rental car the following morning  using the hotel s courtesy bus to take us to the airport and the rental company s bus  
P =>  good hotel stayed at this hotel for one night  It was a clean hotel and the bed was comfortable compared to the high priced strip hotel i stayed at the night prior  It is a great location if you are attending an event at the thomas  amp  mack centre  I would probably stay here again for the cost  My only problem was being woken up bright and early by the garbage truck emptying the bin directly below our window  It is across the street from the post office so im sure the traffic could get a little loud  Would definantly need a car if you are staying here  
P =>  good for the right price We stayed here during a busy weekend  Jimmy Buffett concert   We were able to get a military rate         but I overheard them quote      and up for a night  I certainly wouldn t pay that price  The hotel in itself is pretty good  The rooms were clean and they did provide a shuttle to the airport and the strip  Make sure you make note of the times of the shuttle though  We were on the strip on Sunday and called to get a pick up and were informed that the last shuttle ran at   p m  The pool was also closed for repairs  The only real problem we encountered was the shower  The temperature would fluctuate if you flushed the toilet or I believe if someone else near by was showering too  So be careful  especially if you have youngsters taking showers  
P => Absolutely fine We stayed overnight at the Mccarren Inn on the   th y       We arrived late at night  very tired after a long flight  The reception area although clean was dull and needed a makeover of more seductive colours  However the room was more than adequate  with two queen beds  good sized bathroom  coffee machine etc  Everything in the room was clean and tidy and more than suited our overnight stay  Complementary breakfast was also good  however the eating area  which is part of the reception area also needed brightening up  If you are looking for an overnight hotel near the airport then this one is ok  Don t be put off by the dull reception  
P => Good Inexpensive but you should have a car to stay here We stayed at the McCarran Inn upon our arrival in Las Vegas  we were on our way to Bryce Canyon National Park in Utah and NOT remaining in Vegas for a long visit  On a Saturday night there are no cheap  good rooms in Las Vegas close to the airport  our plane landed at near midnight on Saturday night at the beginning of e        This was the least expensive place we could find    at     a night  I was expecting a flea bag motel    instead it was very nice and clean  comfortable and had a great free breakfast buffet  juice  coffee  milk  cereal   including instant hot oatmeal  muffins  danish toast fresh fruit and peanut butter packets  The only drawback is  if you are staying to see Vegas for a while     you need to have a car because the motel s location is away from the Strip and the Casinos  But everyone should know that if you have a car you can drive to the free lots at any of the big hotels  the Luxor is a good place to park and walk   and tour the Strip as late as you want  This makes the McCarran Inn a great bargain  I hate the long walk in and out of those huge casino hotels    at this motel you are out and into your car in a minute instead of struggling across the casino floor with your luggage or if you forgot something in your room  it can take a half hour to get to your room and back outside in one of those huge hotels   I know some people love to stay in the lavish casinos  and there are some great package deal bargain rooms during the week     but some people like us only needed a nice clean safe place to sleep on their way to a glorious week out in the wilds of Utah  In that case    this MacCarran Inn is a really good choice  I hope this information was helpful for any of you planning a trip to Bryce and Zion with a late flight into Vegas

P => Good for a short stay Stayed overnight after a late flight arriving in Vegas  and were leaving vegas  Just off highway  comfortable room  reasonable free breakfast  I do not think this is a good location to  quot see quot  LV but for other purposes it is fine No trouble with hot water  cleanliness  etc  
P =>  Liked It   Good Value I m usually travelling through Las Vegas on my way to the Southern California coast or returning to Denver  This is my third stay at the Best Western Nellis  I used to stay at a Hampton Inn at Tropicana which is     more and has the a full service bar and an In N Out Burger across the street  The BW Nellis has a Memphis Championship Barbeque across the street  This is not a Las Vegas rendition of Memphis barbeque  but a barbeque that has been World Champion four times and Grand World Champion three times at the International Memphis in  BBQ Cook Off  otherwise known as the  quot Superbowl of BBQ  quot  It s good  In addtion there is a Super Wal t  the traveler s best friend  a few blocks away  The room is good sized clean and doesn t smell of disinfectant  They ve been recently remodeled with granite counter tops  refrigerators and microvaves  Oddly  no hair dryer  There s down duvet on the bed over a blanket and five big feather pillows  Outside it looks like a    s motel  which means parking right outside your door  There s a second floor with no elevator  Each room as it s own heating cooling unit which pretty much drowns out any noise  I originally stayed here because they have the waffle irons that use batter and turn over  A special favorite of mine  Much better than frozen waffles in a toaster  The rest of the breakfast is very light  cold cereal  juice  and coffee  
P =>  Average There s nothing special about this place  but there s nothing bad either  The front desk isn t especially helpful and they don t speak English especially well  or understand American expectations about service  There is wireless internet but it s only available from some of the rooms  Our room was on the first floor in about the middle of motel and we did not have wireless  The front lobby is where the breakfast is located and it is small and crowded in the morning  Basically  this is an older motel built before continental breakfasts were common and standard  Wireless was available in the lobby and out in the parking lot  The room rate was     when we stayed  and I would say that it s an average place for that rate   but don t pay more  
P => 
P =>  Nice Clean hotel Nice clean property  Friendly staff  The room was comfortable It is in an area that is a bit run down  but it appears that the city is trying to improve that  It is near many museums and the Cashman center  If you are wanting to be in the down town area there is a city bus stop nearby  or you can walk but it is a bit of a walk They have a complimentary continental breakfast and a small lounge with gaming on site  
P =>   Had a great time We recently stayed at the Best Western Parkview Inn in Las Vegas  Nevada The hotel rooms have recently been completly renovated In my opinion  the beautiful clean rooms and great service match any Strip Hotels accomodations at a fraction of the price you have to pay for rooms on the strip  This is a very clean and well maintained Hotel with great customer service We will definetly stay with them again Ron VanlandinghamLa Habra  California 
P => Scary If By Yourself Make no mistake about it   this is an off the strip motel where you look over your shoulder to ensure your safety The accommodations are cramped  so if you re used to rooms with lots of space  it s not here  Small flying bugs like the place  I smashed a few on the wall  Room service cleaned it up the next day There isn t sufficient lighting around the outside room doors at night  so watch yourself if traveling alone I brought my laptop to work in the room because one of the amenties is supposed to be free  wireless Internet access  It didn t work in my room  I had to cart my laptop over to the hotel s main lobby and work on a table there  Not convenient at all The main picture of this facility is deceiving  It s a seedy place in a seedy area  Watch yourself  
P =>   It s not bad at all  Nice breakfast I stayed at this hotel from    to          The hotel is located at a rough neighbourhood  I didn t like the neighbourhood at all  But it s very close to the strip and fremonte street The hotel was nice itself  The room was small  but clean The manager was nice and helpful The breakfast was much better than what I expencted for the room price  I paid     for saturday night    tax The free wireless internet was very convenient  
P =>   propre et sympa

P => Perfect Strip location You cannot beat this hotel for the price and location  On the Strip  on the corner across from Caesar and Bally s and caddie corner from the fountians of Bellagio  We watched the fountians from our room for about     a night  This hotel use to be the Barbary Coast  It is about   stories tall and one of the oldest on the strip  The rooms have been updated since Harrah s took over in       but it still has that antique feel  The casino is small  three tables located at the front door is their  quot poker room quot   Waitresses came by constantly with free drinks in the casino  even at the cheap machines  We prefer larger casinos but had some luck at their casino  It may not be a great casino  but it has a great location and is a great place to stay  The breakfast is good too  
P => Brilliant location     loved the place  We planned our Vegas trip over a year ago and started sifting through pages and pages of hotel reviews to try and find the best place to stay  We looked at the highly priced options  my partner really wanted to stay at The Venetian  but we couldn t get a good deal for the time we were visiting   Then we started looking at the highly rated options  and Bill s came to the top  time and time again  We checked the prices and couldn t believe how low the cost would be for a hotel located in the centre of the Vegas Strip  opposite Caesar s  Bellagio  Bally s and The Paris  It seemed too good to be true  but we couldn t resist  Bill s did not disappoint  Obviously Bill s does not have the grandeur of Bellagio s lobby  the amazing shows of Caesar s or the magnificence of Paris  ornate buildings  charming Parisien streets and the half size replica of the Eiffel Tower  However  Bill s is only a few steps away from all of this   you can have it all  Our room was a double queen sized and we upgraded at check in to get a Strip view   which was the best     a night we could have spent  We overlooked Bellagio s fountains and it was a delight everytime they danced to a variety of different musical styles  We also had a great view of the Eiffel Tower from our room  The room was clean  and regularly serviced  For those who need it  the    quot  plus sized TV is hung on the wall with all the tv and pay per view you need  we didn t switch it on at all   the Eiffel Tower and fountains were enough for us   Bill s is famous for their Steakhouse restaurant  they even have a       Steak  amp  Eggs deal from midnight to  am     we never got the chance to try it out  but we spoke to several people who had been to the Steakhouse and loved it  these people came from some of the big hotels on the Strip   We did eat in the Victorian Restaurant  which is very popular   basic quick meals and a Chinese menu on top of that  We enjoyed our food before strolling over to Caesar s to see Cher in concert  No need for a taxi  There is a coffee bar  Seattle s Best  open long hours   I managed to get my much needed java before our early start for The Grand Canyon   at     am  Drai s after hours lounge was highly recommended to us by our Red Rock Canyon tour guide as being one of the best in the city  we didn t have the stamina to try it out though   Caught one of the Big Elvis shows  a     pound Elvis impersonator    he was awesome  Later the same day we heard a guest belting out a Phantom Of The Opera song in the Karaoke bar   he was amazing and it was hard to believe he wasn t professional   the atmosphere there was electric and good fun was had by all  In summary   as you have probably gathered   I am a big fan of Bill s Gamblin  Hall  amp  Saloon  If you need a swimming pool and or fitness centre you have to walk to the neighbouring Flamingo hotel  I have stayed at some of the finest hotels around the world  and yet me and my fellow travellers agreed we would stay at Bill s on our next Vegas visit  By the way  for those of you who wrote about poor service at Bill s I don t know where you got that from   everyone was so welcoming and friendly  It can be quite noisy at night  lots of sirens and car horns all through the night  so if you are a light sleeper you will need earplugs  If you want a great location and a great deal I would definitely recommend Bill s  
P => Choose Bill s if you re on a budget   I stayed here from              Here s the deal  If you can afford to stay at the Bellagio or Caesar s   do it  Both are perfectly centered on the strip and absolutely beautiful inside  However  if you are like me and can t afford a room for       a night  definitely choose Bill s  It s not beautiful  but it s really chill with an old Vegas kind of charm  And of course  it s an amazing excellent location  I had a room with a partial strip view which was the top of the Eiffel tower  some of the fountains and some of the strip  very cool  And we didn t have ANY street noise  room      and they didn t charge us extra for this room  Big king bed  very roomy  nice little vanity I claimed for myself and a huge flat screen TV  I would MUCH rather choose to stay at Bill s than the Flamingo  Harrah s or Imperial   their prices location are equivalent but they are SOOO tacky  I mean  basically just ugly and lame  There s not much going on inside and they seem old and weird  Similar to Excalibur  Circus Circus  etc  They are all just tacky and cheap  There s a difference between  quot inexpensive quot  and  quot cheap quot   Bill s is inexpensive  Plus  at least with Bill s it s got a nifty charm  you can get to your room in a snap  location is brilliant and Big Elvis headlines during the week  A few cons     we couldn t get the temperature too warm  had to keep fiddling with the thermostat     no real quilt on the bed   bring your own and you ll be fine   although  you can probably ask for a thicker blanket     water in the shower tends to not go down the drain very well BUT the water pressure and cool window in shower totally make up for it  The Victorian restaurant had GREAT breakfast for cheap  Yum  We didn t eat there for dinner but I highly recommend the breakfast Really  people  choose Bill s if you can t afford the pricier hotels  You won t be disappointed  
P => Perfect location a great time had by all  This was our  st visit to Vegas and we stayed here along with others for a week   in ober having looked at several other Hotels  We made a fantastic choice in that the location and service were even better than expected  We were booked into room     which has a great view of the Eiffel Tower and a very good view of the Bellagio fountains  The size of the room was more than enough for us    adults and   child  and the bathroom layout worked perfectly for us with the separate dressing room with sink  We did also up grade the last couple of nights to a   bedroom suite  which is highly recommended  In between we stayed in a Penthouse lake view suite at the Bellagio  this was booked from the UK prior to our departure as a celebration  but still say that the intimate feel of Bills would be where we would return to  The  award winning  Victorian restaurant is exactly as others described  as are the constant references   with fair quality food and not overpriced The casino staff  on the whole  were extremely pleasant  no  I made a loss   and the reception   concierge service was first class As for noise  if you have a room overlooking the strip expect some   but it isn t much of a problem as long as you expect it and certainly doesn t warrant anybody complaining  Like any major city  if you stay in a room overlooking a tourist site it won t be perfectly quiet For the price and the location alone I would recommend Bills  throw in the rest and I would say this is a real bargain  
P =>   The best location for a low price   the rooms aren t bad either  The location is absolutely wonderful  Bill s is situated across the strip from Caesar s  kitty corner from the Belagio  and pretty much on the center of the strip  However  the rates for this hotel are about half what you would pay at Caesar s  and a much smaller fraction of Belagio s rates  Therefore it makes a perfect base for exploring the North or South ends of the strip The rooms are nicely appointed and clean  The beds are comfortable  The shower was one of the best hotel showers I have experienced   excellent water pressure and temperature  There is even a stained glass window in the shower  It is not your typical hotel shower by any means  It is a great way to wake up after a night on the strip The Casino and restaurants at Bill s are not a reason to stay there  I recommend checking out  quot Big Elvis quot  if you can though   but it is so close to many  quot mega Casinos quot  that it is not a long walk to almost any restaurant casino on the strip The hotel staff aren t wonderful  but at around     a night  I m not complaining  Overall  it is a great value  You will pay         or so  but will not feel like you are staying in a     hotel  
P =>   Great location old but clean Pros Room was spacious  flat screen TV very nice  beds and pillows were very comfortable  Check in out was simple and quick  I asked for room with a view at time of booking when I arrived was told this was        night extra  I paid it   Was it worth it   not sure  The staff was very gracious  Self parking  free  was a breeze  quick access to elevator  Cons  The room faced the Bellagio fountains  IF the window had been clean would have been able to see them   and the noise of the strip was annoying   we were on the  th floor  The bathrooom lacks an exhaust fan  but at least there is a window that will open  The building is out dated  carpets clean but worn  Not sure if I would stay there again  but for a place on the strip great location  and in comparison  cheap rates it is worth it  
P =>  Can t be beat  I just returned from a Vegas trip with my mom  We both liked Bill s  It is the perfect location and a great price  The casino can get very smokey but they usually leave the main doors open and once you get to the rooms we didn t notice it at all  Our room was large and faced The Flamingo  It was a bit noisey at night but we ran the heater so that drowned out some of it  It is great to come back to your hotel at the end of the night and not have to walk miles to get to your room  We did take in part of the Big Elvis Show   free   and wished we could have stayed longer  He was wonderful   The    cent garitas were small but strong I am a travel agent and would reccommend Bill s to my clients  Depending on what they were looking for  If you are wanting a great location  great price and are wanting a clean room  this is the place  
P =>   Excellent Beautiful room  great views  and inexpensive  They also make the strongest free drinks you will find on the strip  I highly recommend Bill s  
P =>   Budget Hotel in the expensive part of the strip Bill s Gamblin Hall   only found this place thanks to tripadvisor and booked with expedia  I paid      for   nights which was a bargain for the centre of the strip  when you consider that Caesars is opposite and your looking at about      a night The hotel itself is fairly simple  the rooms are a good size but not huge but the    quot  tv is a nice thing to have in a budget hotel and the interaction we had with the staff was always polite If you are looking for a movie like vegas experience then you wont get too much excess here  for the price you pay you get a comfortable clean room and a hotel with a small casino which is nice for those of us who aren t experience gamblers  Obviously the key ingredient with any hotel booking is the location and this place is the top dog for location  opposite Caesars and The bellagio  we had a room facing Bally s so we didn t get much of the noise from the strip Make sure you try the all you can eat chinese restaurant in the hotel  for     we had a fantastic sweet and sour meal which filled me up after one plate  and I m no lightweight when it comes to buffets  Book Bill s   you wont regret it 
P =>   Great Location Great party environment Great Value  your not going to get comped much  but this place is about value  Its a fun place  good drink service  decent variety of games considering the size of the casino  The poker there is just terrible  but considering location  quality of rooms you just cant beat this place on a budget  
P =>   Value for money We stayed at Bills for   nights  The hotel is great value for money  the rooms were bigger then I thought and very clean  The plasma telly is a great bonus too  The service was great and they were very friendly  Bills is right smack bang in the middle of the strip and it is within walking distance of all the major casinos  We had a lovely time and would definately stay there again  
P =>   Great location Bills is in a fantastic location on the strip opposite Ceasers Palace  We got a fantastic deal  A    a night  which was value for money for this location  Rooms were spotless  good size but bathroom a little small  The only negative staying at this address was the noisefrom Flamingo Hotel next door  Would definitely return but ask for a room on south side near Ballys  An added bonus was having half tix in Bills  
P =>   Good Value But     I stayed at Bill s from               I had booked a room a month earlier and requested a room with a view of the Strip  When I arrived  they indeed had a room with a view available if I upgraded for an extra     a night  I wasn t happy about that but decided to pay the extra     per night  The room on the third floor near the Strip did have an incredible view but it came at a cost  The noise from traffic was constant and kept me awake all night  Running the AC helped with drowning out the traffic noise but not completely  The room was nice and clean  Bottom line  you cannot beat the location but if you stay there  request a room on the back side of the hotel away from the street noise or bring ear plugs for rooms with a view  
P =>   Great Place to Stay in Vegas     I travelled with my partner to Vegas for the first time in ober and we managed to get a room at Bill s for   week for approx         money worth spent  Bill s is has a great location situated between the Flamingo hotel and Bally s  My partner and I love to walk around  mind you we take our time  and it took us approx   min to walk to MGM Grand from Bill s The staff were very nice and accomodating   we had a third person stay and we paid for a roll away cot for an extra      The Bell Desk will help you get tours taxi s etc The room was very nice and we had an amazing view for  quot Paris quot  and the Bellagio Foutains  We were also able to use the Flamingo s Gym       and the pool jacuzzi  free  Bill s is very simple   just a casino downstairs with kareoke each night band elvis performances and   cent margaritas   They also have a Half Ticket Booth   you can buy show tickets for half the price if you go on the same day  We saved so much money on shows  eg cirque de soleil was      each but we bought them for     each at the Half Price Tix place  The line can be a bit long so its better to get there early on opening time    am  or later in the pm   ish   There is also another Half Price Tix place at the  quot Hawaiian Place quot   just after the harley davidson cafe  which was never busy If you re not too fussed about where you stay   Bill s is an inexpensive way to stay in Vegas   You are able to go into each of the different Hotel s anyway to have a look around We enjoyed our stay at Bill s and would definatly come back   
P =>  A very good hotel conveniently placed right in the middle of the Strip The rooms at Bill s are large and very clean  Ours had a view of the fountains of the Bellagio which is opposite  We didn t gamble as we were only staying one night prior to flying out from Las Vegas the next day so can t really say anything about that  We did have a    cent margareta at the bar after exhausting ourselves walking up and down the strip  We also didn t eat at Bill s so can t say anything about the food  The desk sorted out transport to the airport for us which arrived reasonably promptly the next morning  Bills has an excellent location on the strip and is very good value for money as you could pay a lot more without getting anything better  
P =>  Amazing value hotel at a prime location on the Las Vegas Strip This was my third visit to Las Vegas and I thought I would give Bill s a shot  having heard good things about it on Trip Advisor and noticing it s great location at the centre of the Strip on my previous trips to Sin City  I was not disappointed  The room was clean  spacious  included a bath and overhead shower  large walk in wardrobe  and nice    inch large flat screen TV  The bed was huge and very comfortable  I asked for a room with a partial view of the strip  not a strip view room   As you can see from my video and photos  this was excellent  especially for the low price I paid  around     per night    it was possible to see the Bellagio fountains and the Eiffel Tower across the road at Paris  The rooms included double glazed windows so the street noise was not a distraction  Nor was it possible to hear people in the other rooms  The location of Bill s is perfect   it is mid Strip so easy to explore either way  Importantly  it is a lot cheaper than the surrounding hotels like Bellagio  Paris  Caesar s Palace and the Flamingo I would certainly stay at Bill s again  especially considering the room rate is at least half of what is for any other hotel in the same location  
P =>  Love this place  It had been several years since we stayed at Bill s   back when it was The Barbary Coast Hotel  We liked it then and now that it has been renovated  it is even more cozy It has the best spot on the strip   right in the middle of everything   and nice  large rooms  We like the separate shower toilet combinations and the views of the strip  including the Bellagio fountains  There are no gimmicks here   just a nice clean place to stay with several great restaurants on site   we were a little chargrined at having to pay more        per night   upon arrival for  quot a room with a view quot    that did not happen previously We were there for five nights this trip and will definitely return when our next trip to Vegas looms  You cannot beat this place for comfort and reasonable prices  even though we had to pay for a view    The staff was cordial and we felt well taken care of and safe  
P =>  Just average  Oh  Bill s Gambling Hall  Check in was pretty quick and painless  There was virtually no line  I checked in super early at   am  I had just finished a drive from LA and overestimated my ETA to the hotel   but they had no rooms available and told me that they had placed a rush order for my room and to come back at     pm  I came back at    pm after picking up my sweetie from the airport and sure I was speedily given a key to my room  Btw  parking was a breeze  Lots of ample parking spots when I arrived I had originally booked a nonsmoking king but they gave me two queens  Hmm   is something wrong here  Better yet  there was a caulking gun and paint bucket in my room  It looked like someone was in the middle of doing some touch ups and forget to take their things away  I called the front desk and explained the problem  and after a brief shuffle  they moved me to another nonsmoking double queen room  which smelled heavily of smoke  Our beds did not have the same consistency  one bed was rock hard and the other bed was averagely average  We didn t bother calling the front desk again and decided to grin and bear with it  as we were only to stay for just a night  I was pretty worried about the noise level outside of the hotel because it is right next to Harrah s  but I was surprised how quiet it was  We were situated on the  quot  st quot  floor  which was  in reality  the  th floor of the hotel  I slept pretty well on our average bed  so I was happy about that  Overall  the room was decent and designed for th budget minded  The bathroom was divided a bit weirdly  but the basics were covered  towels  shampoo  soap  cups  hairdryer  and a clothes rack  what the heck    The large flat screen TV was a nice addition in the room  but hey  it s just a TV  The casino was very small  which I kind of liked because you can never got lost in it  It is a lot smokier than other casinos because the ceilings aren t that high and aren t well ventilated  However  the casino is right next to the two entrances of the establishment  so that s basically the only ventilation for the casino  I m torn  It is a decent  budget hotel  save for a few inconsistencies in my experience  in an excellent location  right in the middle of the strip   but it really needs to be renovated  I can t say much about customer service  but I can say that I was treated well and the people at the front desk were friendly and accommodating upon check in  Overall  this establishment is just average  I don t think I d stay here again  I d rather pay a few bucks more for a smoother check in  better beds  and amenities  
P =>  Great Value and Location You can t beat the location of this hotel  right in the middle of the strip and there is a walkway over the road to Caesar s  It s also right next to the Flamingo  where apparently Bill s guests are allowed to use the pool facilities  We didn t test that out but we did walk around the Flamingo grounds and they are lovely  What I really loved about Bill s is that it is small  You don t have to trek through a giant lobby and casino  just walk in and the elevator is right there  and the parking garage is a short walk too  Our room was clean  comfortable  and surprisingly large with a huge flat screen TV  We even had a partial view of the Bellagio fountains  All the staff we dealt with were friendly and helpful  We never had to wait more that a couple of minutes at the front desk The only real down side is that the hotel is on a very busy intersection so the traffic noise could be a problem  I slept with earplugs but at least a couple of times a night I would hear sirens going past  be the rooms at the back on the Flamingo side are quieter  Anyway  it wasn t a big deal and it wouldn t stop me from staying here again or recommending it  Make sure you check out all the beautiful stained glass  There was even a small  functional  i e  it opened  stained glass window in our bathroom  
P =>   great locationhuge rooms stayed here for   nights and the location is fantasticas its in the middle of all the action  we used the flamingo pool which is huge but does get a little crowded  the rooms were large and the beds very comfortable  The casino has a rustic charm of casinos of yesterday  it was great being in a smaller casino where you could get in out of your room quickly  Free parking was included  
P =>   Amazing mid week room for     Great room with a view of the strip  I wanted to stay for the weekend too  but due to late booking the rate went up to       and I moved Super location  absolutely central as much as Bellagio or Caesar s Palace  Book early and you ll be very happy with this hotel Not going to impress people like the Bellagio  but are you made of money or something       I don t know why people would spend      at the Wynn when you can have this for      I guess they have too much cash  
P =>   Can t Beat Bills Read a lot of reviews on here before booking and was not dissapointed one little bit  everything exceeded our expectations and will definately stay there again without hesitation  Very clean  very friendly and a nice small hotel so it was never crowded We checked in around   am and they had a room ready we didnt have to wait till the official check in time  i asked if they had any south strip facing views available  she said they did and explained a     per night charge for it but because i had requested it on my booking they gave it to me for free  the desk staff were very friendly and helpful all throughout our trip Our room was on the  rd floor room      right on the corner of the strip facing south and overlooking Ballys and the Bellagio fountains a prefect view  the room was very clean and spacious  although the bathroom sink area could have been a little bigger  the best thing about the bathroom was that they had a stained glass window that opened out so you could hear the strip  this was especially nice when the Bellagio fountains were on as we watched a few times from here and could hear the music  The bed was comfy and we had clean sheets and towels everyday  a large plasma tv on the wall was nice also and plenty closet and drawer space  We had a little noise from the strip due to being right at the front of the hotel on the corner but nothing that really bothered us The casino is nice and small not too big like the other huge hotels so you could easily just go up to your room in no time at all  That was the biggest plus it literally took   minutes from our room to being down in the casino and out onto the strip All in all i would choose Bills again in a heartbeat  amazing experience and if you want location location location then it cant get any better   
P =>   Love Bill s not the suite We started out in room     from      till the   th      is a nice standard room with a great view   no pic  After having some success at the craps table  decided to upgrade to a jacuzzi room        we got the one pictured on Bill s web site The Photos on the web site are spot on  regarding the room  IT IS still a    s room  The couch is frat house quality  No flat screen in this room  just an old     quot  on a swivel between the bedroom and living room  There is a mini fridge in the room below the wet bar The jacuzzi tub is as old as the couches  and has a slow leak issue  We had added bubbles to the tub and were unaware of the gradual water loss until one of us moved away from the back massage jet  The water from the back jet  hit the wall at the foot of the tub  because the water level had receeded below the jetThe view IS NOT what they show on the web  Limited views if the eiffel tower and Limited view of the Bellagio  Remember you are on the second floor I still love Bill s       The upgrade was a a very cheap upgrade and gave my partner and myself a couple of smiles and laughs for the rest of our stay   now I know why it was a cheap upgrade Bill s Is still the best choice for a center strip inexpensive stay  All room have    quot  tv s  Except for the black and red room apparently  We will be back to Bill s  just not the  quot featured quot  suite 
P =>   What a SHINING STAR in a city of lights      I selected Bill s for its location in relation to the location of the conference I attended at The Bellagio and for the great rates  I was NOT dissapointed  the room was large with a large bed  Nice flat screen TV and cute western decor and very clean If you d like a view of the bellagio fountains just ask for the strip view upgrade  hotel staff was great and upgraded me for free    If I had one complaint   I sort of knew this in advance  it would be the city noise on the strip side and the sounds of the fountains  they are rather loud but great to watch Hotel staff was VERY friendly and helpful  The casino was pretty smoky but the room was not a bit smoky and i was on the floor just above the casino  If you aren t into frills and love a great deal and frindly people  give Bill s a try you WON T be dissapointed      Ohhh and my husband joined me a couple of days into my stay and he loved Bill s too         
P =>   Appropriately named  Cheap and roomy but very loud and smoky  even on non smoking floors  The staff was courteous but not necessarily helpful  Bottom line  it s a bargain right in the middle of the strip  If you re goal is to stay cheap on the strip  this is your place  If it is to experience luxury  then you shouldn t go for a place with a name like  quot Bill s Gambling Hall quot  
P =>   What a jewell   will definitely stay here again  A group of about    of us travelled to Vegas mid tember to celebrate a Bachelorette party   approximately half the group were Vegas virgins  We chose Bill s based on price and location   and what a choice  We all loved Bill s   it has got so much going for it We all stayed on the  nd floor and most of us had rooms overlooking the Bellagio Fountains  One of us had a suite which was just spectacular  see a previous review    so much room and a great place for us all to gather for a few drinks before a night out We loved Bill s for the convenience and location   you are centre strip so it s walking distance to everything either north or south of Bill s  We loved the reasonably priced drinks     c garitas and jugs of Bud     hotdogs were also fantastic  We loved the kareoke and would have loved to catch Big Elvis as I had heard he was great but we just didn t get the time  Also would have loved to had some craps lessons in the morning   I did see them there but again time was precious  We also loved the Tix tonight booth located at the front of Bill s   so convenient if you wanted to check out discount shows The rooms were big and comfortable   large screen TV was fantastic  We ate in the Victoria Room a few times and always had a great meal  We also used the Flamingo Pool every day   your Bill s room key allows you access to the Flamingo pools which are huge and well worth it You just get a great feeling when you walk into the place   it s laid back and relaxed and as Aussies we loved that  So I can highly recommend Bill s to anybody considering a trip to Vegas  We will be back for sure  
P =>   Great location and winning slots  My husband and I stayed at Bills for   nights  We decided to stay here after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor  The location is perfect  Check in was hassle free  Our room     had a great view of the strip and the Bellagio fountains  Rooms were clean and the beds comfy  Plenty of parking available  Lucky me I won       on the slots at Bills but as the reviewer said before me as an Aussie I was taxed     but still ended up with          
P =>   Great value for money and location you can t beat so worth     a night  what a bargain       great location  half price ticket booth in the foyer  and join score a free tshirt your whole family can fit in   haha     just don t eat at the Victorian  food is crap and cold  go across the road to serendipity and share an entree  enough food for   people    ask for a room with an even number   we had      and you have views of the Belliago fountains as no extra cost  
P =>   Nice Hotel What can I say  this was my second time staying at this hotel  The hotel was a good choice  Location was excellent  Only ate breakfast at the hotel it was ok  Housekeepers were wonderful  left my cell phone and the housekeeper call to let me know she had it  The beds were wonderful  and the hot water in the shower was excellent  I have no complaints about this hotel  Will stay there again  
P =>   Highly recommended if you want value for money but want to be in the centre of the action  We spent   nights at Bills in early tember and found it to be an excellent value for money  comfortable and exceptionally well located hotel  We were so happy with Bills we actually cancelled part of our booking at MGM Grand to stay longer at Bills  We did spend our last   nights at MGM and still prefer Bills for location and value for money  Check in was fast and friendly  although don t expect to find a bellman waiting to take your bags  although there actually is one   When checking in ask for an even numbered room as these are the ones with the best views  We had a large room with two comfortable queen sized beds overlooking the Eiffel Tower and the Bellagio Fountains  The room was clean and had a huge flat screen TV  The bathroom was quite small  but clean and functional  The room was quite noisy during the night but nothing a pair of earplugs couldn t fix  Room service was fast  affordable and friendly  Drinks at the bars are reasonably priced in comparison to other hotels on the strip  You can also get   cent frozen garita s and    hotdogs   some of the best value on the strip  We ate at the   award winning    which they don t mind announcing over and over again  Victorian Room a few times and found the food good and reasonably priced  If you like  Americanised  Chinese food  make sure you ask for the  special  Chinese menu as it offers a banquet style meal for much cheaper than the regular menu  There are almost always waitlists to eat at the Victorian Room  however it never takes too long to be seated  If you are staying at the hotel you can call down from your room and they will call you when your table is ready  There is also a steakhouse but we didn t eat there  Don t miss Big Elvis  although you only need to see him once as the spiel begins to get cheesy after a couple of shows We felt safe and secure at Bills and did not see any dodgy characters hanging around  There is a tix for tonight booth inside Bills which is very convenient when planning your day  There are ice machines on every floor and a bottle shop just down the  side  road if you like to BYO drinks  Bills  is perfectly located on the strip at a bargain price  It doesn t have all the bells and whistles as the big resorts  but it is clean  comfortable  and walking distance to almost everywhere on the Strip  providing you are wearing comfortable shoes    At the end of a long day  you can afford a drink at the bar and can be in your room in less than   minutes from the Strip  I highly recommend Bills if you are on a budget  looking for value for money  but want to be in the centre of the action  Finally  a quick tip for any Aussie s reading this review and planning to play the slots in Las Vegas  Be aware that all wins over  US     are taxed at      Despite the common assumption in Vegas  this tax is not able to be  claimed  back upon return to Australia  Not to worry  the odds are against you anyway  But good luck and have fun  
P =>  We Love Bills     First time to stay at Bills  but have gambled there before  You can t beat the location and the rooms were actually very nice and spacious  Did not have any problems with noise either  we were on third floor   Since the location is cental and a short walk thru the casino to the rooms  it was nice to be able to go back to the room periodically throughout the day as needed  We found the gambling there to be affordable and the table crew were always very helpful and alot of fun  And you can t miss the BIG ELVIS live show  We loved it and it was quite poplular  Overall a great experience and we plan on staying there again next year and any other time that we go to Vegas   
P =>  Always good at Bills Stayed at bills   times in the past year  always look at bills first when traveling to vegas  Cheap drinks  great location and nice comfy beds  
P =>  Perfect Location for Girl s Weekend in Vegas Bill s Gamblin  Hall  amp  Saloon  formerly the Barbary Coast  is right smack dab in the middle of the action on the Las Vegas Strip  On the corner across the street from Bally s  amp  Caesar s Palace  next door to the Flamingo  Bill s is convenient to everything  We could even see the Bellagio fountains from our room  Las Vegas has newer and more elegant hotels with more amenities  but for the price  Bill s is a great deal  
P =>  Old and Nice Clean and a Bargin Its an old hotel  But for     per night right on in the middle of the stip its a bargin  Rooms were clean and very nice big TV s in the room  We had a perfect view of the fountains at the Beliougo   Misspelled but who cares  You can use the pool next door  but we did not have time  Walking distance to it all  We have done Vegas a few times and you can catch the Tram or the double decker bus and travel from one end to the other for just a buck or two  This hotel has a dinner  but its very expensive and you can go half a block down the street and eat very reasonable  Plus there is a burger king   doors down for that late night munch  All in all it was a hooot to stay here and we may again  Worth the money for some old time fun and gambling   
P =>  Get a Suite  Travel back in time to a     s bachelor pad  photos attached   Black  amp  glass furnishings  black jacuzzi bath in the living area  glossy red feature wall  grey formica wet bar and TWO toilets vanity spaces As Vegas virgins  we researched tripadvisor so there were no surprises with our selection  Thanks  tripadvisor Pluses   Location  location  location  Value for money  Ease and cost  zero  of parking  close to the rooms  Helpful  tolerant croupiers for beginners and revellers  Historic Old Vegas  TWO toilets in the suite  with opening windows and  if lucky  a view plus sounds of the Bellagio fountains from one   No In your face hotel staff Minuses   the Old Western theme  tired old amenities  in the casino lobby  the annoying karaoke singers and the incessant PA  calling for  quot name  party of x to the Award Winning Victorian Room quot   perhaps wear your iPhone    the suite had scuff marks on the wallpaper and layers of dust on the fake pot plants  the floor on the second floor vibrated  from the monorail  perhaps    no In your face hotel staff 
P => Great value Just stayed   nights at Bill s  Great central location  room clean and large  Slots did not pay at all  so don t spend money there at that  The    cent margaritas were great  Staff friendly  helpful  Had originally planned to stay only   nights and then the third night in a fancier place  but decided Bill s was just fine No hidden charges either  
P =>   Excellent value for money On the middle of the strip  the location can t be better  No queue at reception  Nice large rooms  good bathroom  flat TV  view on the fountains of Bellagio  All this for an excellent price  Just   small cons  the free garage could be cleaner and no free wifi in the rooms  
P =>   fair Bill s Gamblin  Hall  amp  Saloon in Las Vegas is one of the smaller Casino Hotels in Las Vegas  although still large compared to most European hotels  To go to your room from the garage  you actually have to walk through the Casino  The rooms are alright  but as the name suggest  the emphasis of this place isn t on the hotel  it on the casino  Most people come here for gambling and more staff are occupied with this  then with checking inn and checking out the guests resulting in long waits and a lack of interest  I haven t seen a swimming pool  there was no free internet and breakfast wasn t included in the room rate  Bill s Gamblin  Hall and Saloon is quite central though for walking the strip and soaking up the atmosphere of Las Vegas  And don t forget to visit the Boulder Dam when you are there and want to get away from the noise and crowded streets of Vegas for a couple of hours  And the Red Rock Canyon is definitely worth a visit to  Las Vegas though is a tourist trap and overpriced  It was nice seeing it once  but I will not return  
P =>   Ok I might have been expecting too much from this hotel after reading other reviews  It was pretty much exactly what I should have expected for     a night  The accomodations were adequate  the hotel seemed clean enough once you got upstairs  It was a good value for that part of the strip  I guess  The room was large  We had a view of the strip and the Bellagio fountain  However  the windows did not keep out the noise from the strip  it actually was noisy enough that it was hard to sleep  I have stayed in the Flamingo right next door and never had that problem there  I won t stay here again  
P =>   Fantastic Value  I was on a    week sabbatical and heading for Vegas  so budget was very important as well as location and i have to say that Bill s didnt let me down in either department  The location just across from Cesears and the Bellagio is fantastic  its right in the centre of the strip  so plenty going on as you walk out the door  This is by no means a plush hotel but if you want a clean room  with air con  en suite and a   inch plasma and helpful staff for     a night then this gets my recommendation everytime  
P =>   Fantastic Location Great Price Bills is located right in the middle of the strip couldn t be in a better location  Check in was easy with no line up  Staff were always friendly and able to deal with all requests Although as most people have stated not a five star hotel the rooms were large and clean  I had no complaints  Housekeeping came every day and did a good job The best part of Bills is the ease of getting from your room to the strip which takes no more than   mins but in the larger hotels can take       mins which is quite annoying after the first few days of walking the strip and then having a long walk back to your room when you get inside your hotel and also the very reasonable price you pay to stay in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip  Also on offer   c garitas and jugs of Bud Light Although Bills does not have its own pool or spa you can use the Flamingos facilities next door which are great and only a short walk Myself and my friends have stayed at various other hotels in Vegas including MGM Grand  Luxor etc and although we enjoyed these hotels we would definitely stay at Bills again before either of these hotels due to Bills location  ease of getting from room to Strip and the price  
P =>   Great Hotel greart Location Located in centre of strip Took   minute to book in  and was in our room a minute later unlike big hortels where booking in is nightmare  Room overlooking Bellagio fountains at no extra cost  This was our third visit and we would go back again  Catch Big Elvis show daily  And   pitchers of beer for      At     per night you cant go wrong  
P =>   Best value on the Strip Bill s is located at the heart ov the action  Under   minutes to check in and the same to check out  You could get from our room on the first floof to the strip also in under   minutes  Wit a room that overlooked the Bellagio fountains we were more than pleased Excellent value for for money  We would highly recommend this hotel  
P =>   nice little hotel in the middle of the Strip We stayed   nights at Bill s   very nice hotel  We had a giant room with very comfortable beds and a nice bathroom It was our first stay in Vegas and the hotel was perfect  great location and view  moderate prices  no waiting at the check in out there is a nice restaurant i nthe hotel as well  
P =>   location location location   and price So long as you walk into Bills knowing that its not a   star resort property  you will not be disappointed  Yes  the hotel is old  Yes they have a fat elvis impersantor  no really  they call him big elvis  gt  Yes their clientele is um   unique  And yes their rooms are a cross between old west and Tony Montana   s formica gangster style  But  for this price  at this location  and with this helpful of a staff  you really cant go wrong at Bills Now for the details Location  perfect  enough saidPrice  see locationRooms  i upgraded to the suite  which was still a great deal  After adjusting to its flashback   s style  red walls  black furniture  grey formica countertops   it actually turned out to be a very nice room  Comfy bed    bathrooms  in room mini fridge  jacuzzi with a view of the strip  full living area  nice bar area Staff   Extremely helpful and friendly  They may not go overboard a la   star resorts  But  if you ask them they will do what needs to be done to keep you happyRoom Service   standard fare  nothing fancy  but very quick and not too expensive  by vegas standards  Know what you are and are not getting at Bills  save a ton of money  and be right in the center of the strip at this little ol throwback hotel  
P =>   Good price great location  I stayed at Bill s end of        when I visited Las Vegas  The location is great  within walking distance  it is easy to access all major hotels for games  restaurant and shows  The price is incredible with its great location  The room is comfortable for two  I strongly recommend this hotel to budget travelers  
P =>   Great little dump with an excellent location and loads of character Yes  I said it s a little dumpy AND gave it   stars  This is what old school Vegas casinos are supposed to look like    lots of obnoxious neon all over the place  right in the middle of everything  and with a theme  This one is supposed to be Old West but the   s Shabby Chic shows through  Everything about it looks kind of tired  from the first blast of stale cigarette smoke when you walk into the lobby  But that s what gives this place so much character  The way I see it  you get the charm of the old Vegas downtown places  but you re in the middle of the strip I would happily recommend the place to a friend    but maybe not a fussy friend  It is located smack in the middle of the strip  and is surprisingly clean and quiet  Despite the noise and lights of the strip  sleeping in as late as you want is no problem    the room was nice and dark  and the air conditioning adequate even in y  Once you rise from your slumber  you can easily walk to just about anything  and Paris  Caesar s  and the Bellagio are all very close if you want food or more refinement   My friends who ate at Bill s said their Chinese food was  quot the worst meal I ve ever had  anywhere  quot   The casino is thick with stale smoke  but our room  and my friend s rooms  were clean smelling and not smoky The staff are reasonably helpful and friendly  and they have plenty of TVs and    cent frozen margaritas  You can t miss their free house act  Big Elvis    he s an obese Elvis impersonator with a decent voice  My favorite perk was that staying at Bill s gets you into the pool at the Flamingo next door  which was lots of fun  The free parking was nice  too Bill s is a Harrah s property  and kind of a redheaded stepchild one at that  I wouldn t be surprised if they tore it down or gutted it to build something fancier because the location is so great  I would stay somewhere nicer next time if I could find a better deal  but Bill s was a hoot and I would happily stay there again  
P =>  Brilliant hotel fabulous location on the strip We stayed at Bills last october        and I had meant to write this review and then just realised I hadn t  We came to Vegas as our friends were getting married by Elvis     but thats a seperate story altogether Anyway we had a great time in Vegas and if you are looking for a good clean hotel that smaller than most in Vegas but centrally located on the Strip then this is the hotel for you Bills I liked because unlike most of the other hotels in Vegas it was easy to find the exit and get straight out onto the strip  Particulalry if this is your hotel youjust want to get out and about  You basically got out of the lifts and could choose to walk through the casino or go straight out onto the strip  Also Bill s   c margaritas were a great bonus and   c corona every day Vegas is such a huge awesome place and Bills is right in the middle so when touring you can go either way but then the bonus is that on a night you are near all the night life    check out Jimmy Buffets margaritaville it was fab and had live bands most nights and is just along from Bills Bills rooms were great we had a room overlooking the Belagio fountains so watched them daily from the comfort of our hotel room  The bed was huge with a flat screen tv and huge sitting area by the balcony  It had a dressing room attached to the side of the bathroom it was fantastic and for one of the cheaper hotels on the strip I must highly recommend it  
P =>  Great Hotel Great Location and FAB price  We stayed here for   nights and can not complain  The price is very cheap so we were expecting a grotty hotel  its not the newest hotel granted but the standard rooms are large and very clean  all the staff are very friendly and the free entertainment can not be beaten  The location is slap bang in the centre of the strip  we could see the beliagio fountains from our room  Dont go here if you want   star luxury and a swimming pool  but will be a great place to rest your head  The rooms are rather noisy so take ear plugs  
P =>  Great Location easy to get around Have stayed at Bill s quite a few times mostly when it was the Barbary Coast  The location cannot be beat as you can easily walk to numerous casinos and restaraunts  It is also extremely easy to get around the property itself   this is not one of the mega properties on the strip that takes    minutes from casino to room  If you have a car  there are several levels of free parking between the casino and hotel rooms  The rooms are large and  while a bit dated  they have new flat panel tv s a good quality bedding  Staff is always accommodating and we found a favorite bartender that was pleasant and quick  Sometimes the rooms facing Flamingo can be a little loud but we have taken to travelling with a white noise machine and that  coupled with running the AC full time  takes care of all but the worst Generally always try to stay here unless it is sold out or have to stay elsewhere as part of an event  
P =>   A little old but great view and fantastic value  We stayed here for   nights after staying at the Luxor a week earlier  We decided we wanted somewhere very central to all the action for our second visit   and this was definitley it  The location is fantastic for this price  as is the amazing view  We were able to watch the fountains at Bellagio from our bedroom window  Not only is the hotel great value but the Victoria room restaurant was also great value and very nice too  The down side of the hotel was the lobby  which is more or less the casino area  It was very smokey and the smoke filtered into the lifts as well  Not very nice  The room hallways are fine though  The room was old  probably late    s or early    s style but very clean and spacious  It also had a huge flat screen t v  I would recommend this hotel if you want a fantastic location and aren t planning to spend much time in the room  it s vegas after all    It s ok as a pit stop on your Vegas trip  
P =>   run down old good location The only thing good about this place is the central strip location  Regarding everything else  expect a late    s style rundown placewith leaking faucets  dirty carpets and dubious figures hanging around the hallways  
P =>   Fantastic  central cheap and friendly I chose Bills after a lot of research and review reading  And I was glad I did  They were really friendly  checking in and out was quick and hassle free  The room itself had an amazing Bellagio fountain view  and was perfectly clean  The decor is a little dated  but not too much and that s hardly a complaint at     dollars a night    cent garitas were great  and the Victorian room was great for when you need    hour dining  We also used the Flamingo pool  which is available free to Bills residents  and it was great  The location couldn t have been better  across from the Bellagio right mid Strip  I would certainly return to Bills  highly reccomended  
P =>   Fountain view If you want to experience the Bellagio fountain view  or  even without the view  the best location on the Strip  paying just a small fraction of the rates you find at the luxury establishments next door  this is the place  Convenient parking  easy check in and an excellent restaurant definitely make up for the smoky lobby  which at first doesn t seem inviting at all  The gamblers here are not the ones you ll meet at the Venetian or other similar upscale resorts  or at least this is the impression I got on a very busy Saturday night  when the fact that there seems to be no control whatsoever on the access to the hotel rooms from the main lobby made me slightly unconfortable  Having said this  if I ever go back to Las Vegas   which I doubt   I ll definitely stay here again  
P =>  Bill s Gamblin Hall and Saloon It was EXCELLENT  A good size room  the bath wasn t big but served the purpose well without disturbing the other roomie  You could see and hear the Bellagio Fountains  not the music  street noise was no more than at home  The flat screen tv was great  the wallpaper and furniture in good shape  the bed comfy  It was a snap to park  check in and get up to the room  You could even get a chair massage and the bar was within sight of the elevator  There is a lovely steakhouse restaurant  Big Elvis to entertain  table games  poker  new slots  goldfish  woz  monopoly  and a discount ticket station all on site a   minute walk from any point  Pool is courtesy of the Flamingo next door  that s a   minute walk     Log in using your Harrah s rewards card for discounts on your room  Here are some recent photos    Can t wait to go back   
P =>  Recommended   well worth the price  A good hotel for a reasonable price  Staff efficient and business like Room was lovely and although we were in the centre of Las Vegas we had no problems with outside noise  Our room also had a lovely view of the  quot Eiffel tower quot   A problem with the internet connection was quickly resolved  
P =>  Totally good value I looked at this hotel from Tripadvisor  and found variety of reviews and decided to stay here because of the good price  The first impression was not so good as I could smell lots of cigarrette smoke in the lobby as there are a lot of gambling going on  However  it turned out to be a good decision as the hotel is located right in the center of Las Vegas strip  and the room is clean  Will definitely comeback  Great service as well as it is not a large hotel  And the restaurant is very good as well  
P =>  WOW     Best place to stay in Vegas  we  mom dad   years old  just got back from Vegas and stayed at this great hotel for   nights  I did lot of research before I decided on Bill s  and it was worth it  Let me start by saying that  Bill s is in the middle of everything and the view is to die for  Here is the review of the Hotel  Check in    stars  checked in at  pm on Saturday and did not have to wait   second to check in  The check in lady was very nice  friendly and even hooked us up with a room with the strip view and the Fountain view at no extra cost   usually these rooms are     extra a night   The room had two queen beds and was very roomy and nice  Hotel has that older theme but is very nice and the elevators are fast and roomy  The walk to the room was not that far   see my pictures for visual review   The hotel has no pool so they let you use the Flamingo pool which is the best and soooo nice with waterfalls etc  The casino is nice but the payout is not that good  If you want the good payout and game  try Wheel of Fortune at the  quot Orleans quot   I started with    and ended up winning       The restaurant at Bill s is very nice and the all you can eat Chinese is very good deal  The coupon book they gave us at check in was somewhat nice with few coupons that were worth using  Bill s also have the half price tix koisk in their casino so before buying any tickets from ticketmaster try this place out for some good deals on dinning and shows ticket and NO TIME SHARE CRAP TO WORRY ABOUT  Bill is the middle of the strip so it is very easy to walk around  don t buy the monorail pass instead get the bus pass   MUCH CHEAPER TO BUY BUS THAN MONORAIL  
P =>  Absolutely Fantastic Cannot fault Bill s  Location centre of strip  rooms spacious and clean  Service with a smile and the place as a nice character Restaraunt Bars also good and great value     for steak  amp  Eggs at daft o clock at night Pool is actually in Flamingo s hotel which Bills shares  
P =>  Cleanno frills hotel bargain Stayed at Bill s Sunday thru Thursday       Check in was quick  Had requested a king upper floor and got what I asked for  The room was in the rear of the hotel facing Famingo  Very clean  not fancy  For     a night in this part of strip  I was satisfied  Maid service was very good and everthing in room  Air  electric  plumbing  TV  was good  Being in the rear of building  room was very quiet  There was a party going on at  AM one evening in a room across hall  two doors down   never heard a thing with the door closed I go to Vegas every two years or so to see the new resorts  eat baffets  see shows and people watch  I don t gamble or drink so can t comment on all that For clean  inexpensive lodging  I would stay at Bill s again  even though I try to stay at a different hotel each time I hit Vegas  
P =>   Will stay here anytime we are in LV  I don t see how you can beat Bill s Gamblin  Hall  amp  Saloon  It has a great location  prices are extremely reasonable for LV  esp on the strip  and we have absolutely no complaints  Spent a bit of time in the casino there as well  Very nice  
P =>   Bill s made our stay in Vegas nearly perfect  My husband and I were thrilled with our room at Bill s  The staff downstairs was friendly  and our room was awesome  Very clean and very comfortable  The location couldn t have been better  as Bill s is smack in the middle of the strip  Our room was fairly quiet  and from the window we could see a little slice of the fountains at the Bellagio  We slept ridiculously well that night  and were very pleased with our entire stay  I would be delighted to return  and at     a night it is well worth twice the price  Our only quibbles  and these are small   would be the slow tub drain and the fact that one has to pay for internet access  
P =>   Couldn t be beat Was flying solo this trip and wanted a convenient place on the strip and no need for extras  This is the best location by far and the room was clean  neat and had great water pressure  My room overlooked the Belagio fountains and the thermostat worked great  Like the room cold and it got there  Had the Filet and Dom special in the steakhouse and it was good  Great value and they even let me substitute a glass of wine instead  Enjoyed the       Steak and eggs special too and it was very good  I am thankful I made this decision to stay here and I will return again  
P =>   Great Location Great Stay This hotel was recommended by a co worker who had stayed there on a previous trip  We decided to give it a try even though it was one of the smaller hotels on the strip  Well  we were very pleasantly surprised and very happy with our   night stay First of all  the location is probably the BEST on the strip  It s on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd   amp  Flamingo Rd  The Flamingo Hotel is right next door and is just a few steps from Bill s  There is a walkway from Bill s that will take you across the street to Bally s Bellagio and then another walkway across the other side of the stree to Ceasar s Palace  This hotel sits in the very center of the strip so it is very accessible to everywhere you need to be Secondly  the check in out was a breeze  After seeing the gigantic lines waiting at the larger hotels to check in out  we were so thankful for Bill s no hassle check in  There was no line at any time that we noticed in the four days we were there  Also  the elevators to the rooms were right inside the side door making for easy access  Most of the other large hotels have a very long walk through the casino  amp  hotel before you can even get to the elevators to the rooms  Thirdly  the food in the Victorian Room as fantasic and so convenient  Now  if you want to eat the       steak  amp  egg breakfast  you better get down there early between    amp    am or there will be a    min  to an hour wait  It s a small restaurant so a couple of the days we were after  am trying to get in and didn t want to wait  However  it s just a very short walk to the Flamingo which is where we had breakfast  We did eat at the Victorian Room for our dinner meal and the        prime rib dinner is fabulous The staff was always very helpful and our rooms were very nice  Now  it s not the upscale fancy stuff that the larger hotels have  but  the rooms were plenty big the beds were very comfy and we had plenty of towels  etc  I would recommend you bring your own shampoo soap as there was not much provided  Our room was located on the lst floor  just above the lobby  and it was on the side facing the Flamingo Hotel  It was very quiet at all times  If you want a view of the Bellagio  I recommend Room     in which our friends stayed  It has the most perfect view of the fountains I would defininately stay at Bill s again if we are ever back in Las Vegas  The location and convenience is the key to Bill s  It s a great little place to stay because you actually don t spend that much time in your room anyway      
P =>   Bill s was great My husband and I just got back after celebrating my   th in Vegas  After reading reviews on TA and checking out the rates etc  we choose Bills and were very happy that we did  Our friends who met us in Vegas stayed elsewhere and were really sorry they didn t stay at Bills with us  Everything was great from checkin to checkout  I would stay at Bills again on our next LV visit  
P =>   A great room for a nice price A good location in the middle of the strip The room was very clean  quiet and large  I liked the old style  The hotel is more  quot familial quot  and cosy than the others  The only thing is you have to pay for internet but for        The Bill s Gambling has a free parking too  
P =>   steak house   Bill s is fantastic Well hidden  this restaurant is a surprize you won t want to miss  We got   for   tickets at the Tix   Tonight stand out front of Bill s  Everything was delicious and the service is top rate  
P =>   Pleasant Suprize I was excited when my friend and colleague annouced she wanted to celebrate her   th in vegas but nearly fainted when she said she d block off rooms for family and friends at Bills  I ve only stayed in Casears the times I went to Vegas  Ultimately since I was flying in early and basically solo  I decided it would be easier for me to just stay at Bills  I actually got a better price online than the relatively cheap one my friend was quoted fpr a group rate  Trip advisor had such great things to say about the place and seeing that we could use the Flamingo pool  I was looking forward to the trip  I got some tips from Trip advisor for checking in  I ended up checking in  which was a breeze and I did get a room with a view of the bellagio fountain which was great  All here that say the halls and rooms and dated  its all true  But at the price  I almost felt like i was stealing the room  I wish someone warned me to bring conditioner  they only supply one small shampoo  In these days of carry on luggage  I often depend on the shampoo conditioner from the hotel  Its very basic at Bills  Use of the flamingo pool was easy and convenient  I don t recommend eating at Bills  The flamingo is just next door  Bills  givesy ou a coupon book with many     off for buffets and resturants at Flamingo  harrahs  ballys  IP  all right next to Bills  Food  water  etc  is still pretty expensive at the hotels Unfortunetly I always felt like something was nibbling at my ankles when I was in Bills lobby  casino and room  And I did have bites  I know that is disgusting  but I would stay at Bill s again  I love the flat screen  The rooms were big  My side of the hotel  on the strip was very noisy   but my friends who faced the flamingo had very quiet rooms  You cannot beat the location  Its the center of everything  
P =>   Bill s Gamblin Hall   A Reliable Favorite   This was our second stay at Bill s Gamblin Hall in the past   years  We stayed at the hotel a few years back  when it was still Barbary Coast  It has not changed over the years  and that s a good thing  This hotel is centrally located on the strip and with only      rooms  you don t have to walk   miles to get from your room to the sidewalk strip  The hotel was very clean and the staff was very friendly  The food was excellent at both the Victorian Room and the steakhouse  They have a very hot after hours club in Bill s called Drai s  It s fun and the music is good  but  quot working girls quot  and their  quot employers quot  are all over the casino floor and in the club  Things can get a bit rowdy  so steer clear of the club area if this type of activity upsets you  But  I can say that I saw this type of activity in every casino I visited late night  At least Bill s has a very efficient security guard posted by the elevators all night  You can not even get to the elevator without showing your key and ID  This definitely makes you feel more secure The room was very clean and nice  The king size bed was very comfortable  and the flatscreen TV was nice  Many people say the noise from the strip is loud  but we were happy to be on vacation and actually found the noise inviggorating  Since  we were only in the room long enough to get a couple of hours of sleep each morning and evening  a shower  and change of clothes  the room served mostly as a storage area for our personal effects  The bathroom was bit small  but unless you plan to be in there for hours  still not a problem  The only complaint I had is that the tub drain was very slow  I did not like standing in water above my ankles by the end of my shower  But  since this is the ONLY thing I can find wrong with Bill s  it definitely was not a deal breaker  Overall  we have no complaints about a centrally located  comfortable room that we spent approximately     night on   in the middle of the strip   in Las Vegas   Big Elvis is a  quot must see quot  in the afternoon in the lounge  He is very good  and has lost weight over the years  so he s not that big these days I really wish all of the  quot picky quot  people would stay at more upscale hotels  as opposed to nitpicking everything at Bill s and then posting bad reviews  For instance  how can a hotel be responsible for a urine smell in a parking garage  Everyone knows that when people are drunk and carousing in Vegas  they sometimes forget to use formal bathrooms  
P =>   It s my favorite It was our second stay at this Hotel  Since our first stay they changed the name  but it s still the same good deal No waiting line at checkin and the best position to walk the strip  The rooms are clean  large and quiet and we had a wonderfull view to the Bellagio  If you want a good value i can recommend this hotel  
P =>   Bill s No Frills  With so many casinos  hotels  and venues to choose from  what makes Bill s stand out   Centrally located  pretty much dead center of the strip  Table games with lower min  bets than most other casinos  Friendly  casual atmosphere  good drinks  Old West themed architecture and decor  if that s your thing  Hotel rooms are on the cheaper side price wise  but don t feel old or ratty  I would even say they re nicer than some of the other more expensive hotelsThe hotel set up is AWESOME  You can park in the garage  and be in your room in  lt    mins  In many other casinos  getting to your car or the check out desk from your room entails an epic trek across the entire casino and or shopping eating areas  Not fun if you have large bags to carry  IMHO  the best feature about Bill s is precisely that it doesn t have many of the  quot extras quot  of the other casinos  If you want great shopping  more restaurants  or a more extensive gambling experience  Bellagio  Caesar s Palace  Bally s  Flamingo  and Paris are all a   min  walk away The only major downside is that the only pool available to Bill s Guests is the Flamingo pool  which takes awhile to walk to and inferior to many of the other hotel pools  
P =>   Great stay great location  I travel a lot and stay in hotels two three times per month  which makes me very picky  On my last few visits to Las Vegas  I have stayed at Mirage  Harrah s  Excalibur and Treasure Island  Of those  I liked Treasure Island the best  On those trips  we have stumbled into Bill s Gambling Hall  a fun  old school casino right on the strip  They have    hot dogs        margaritas and    pitchers of beer  Despite not really being a big drinker myself  I do appreciate a cheap beverage  Why pay     for the same thing across the street at Caesars  This trip  I decided to be adventurous and book a room at Bill s  It s a small hotel above the casino with only four floors  I was so happy I did  This is not a big mega resort  There are only two restaurants  no gift shop other than a souvenir counter  no day spa and no pool  Guests are invited to use the Flaming pool next door  which is only a     minute walk  This walk is considerably shorter than the walk through most of the larger hotels to the pool  The Flamingo pool is gorgeous and has numerous water features  not to mention the flamingo and bird habitat adjacent to the pool The elevator to the rooms is right next to the check in desk in the back end of the casino  The steakhouse and Victorian Room cafe are literally steps from the desk and elevator  Convenient internet access is right there as well The hallway to our fourth floor room was clean  as was the elevator  The room was spotless  The bathroom was a bit dated  but clean  The room was huge  Very spacious  with new bedding and modern touches  There was also a brand new huge flat screen TV on the wall  Other than typical Vegas street noise  screaming middle aged women  drunk frat guys and sirens   the hotel was a quiet as can be on a Saturday night  The bed was comfortable and the mattress looked relatively new  I always check for bugs before crawling into bed  We paid just over      for Saturday night  and     for Sunday  What a bargain  The location could not be better  There is a bridge right outside the side entrance of the casino that takes you directly over to Caesars  It is a two minute walk to the Flamingo for taxi service  shows and the pool  It is also a less than   minute walk to Bally s  Paris  Harrah s  Imperial Palace  Mirage and others  The Venetian  Treasure Island and a host of others are also close  Also within a five minute walk are O Sheas and Casino Royale for cheap food and cheap gaming  You save a ton on taxi service  For casinos further away  there is a monorail stop next door at Bally s or down the street at Imperial Palace There is a small bar and lounge in the lobby that is packed all the time with fun bands  karaoke and a big fat singing Elvis  Upon checking in we were given coupons for restaurants and attractions in other Harrah s properties  We were given two free passes to the Auto Collection at Imperial Palace in which we spent and hour and a half  I am so glad we chose Bill s Gambling Hall  The room was perfect and we were able to spend the difference in money on food  tours and souvenirs  I would stay here again without hesitation  If you do not care about staying amidst the glitz and glamour  this is one of the best hotels on the strip for cleanliness and value in my opinion  
P =>   Bill s Gambling Hall is a great place to gamble I have not stayed at the hotel but am writing a review of the casino  We visit Las Vegas      times a year  Bill s has become one of our favorite casinos  It is small with a casual feel  the slots are looser than most other places on the strip  the drink service is excellent  and the location is great for visiting other casinos  
P =>   Definitely will stay again great location great     My family and I just got back from our stay at Bill s and we were quite pleased with our stay  The hotel is right in the heart of the strip  but at a fraction of the cost  The amazing Flamingo s pool is a short walk away and Bill s guest s are welcome with your room key   The    cent margaritas at the bar were good but the bar service could be better  The cocktail waitresses fly past you if you are playing slots but come by often if you re playing table games  The front desk service is awesome as well as the cleanliness of the rooms in the hotel  The rooms are in good shape with nice plasma TV s  but small bathrooms  The views on the Flamingo Blvd  side are nice and worth the extra     
P =>  Best value on the Strip My wife and I stayed at Bills in mid e for roughly     per night  This hotel is much smaller and cheaper than most on the strip  and after walking the entire strip during our stay and seeing the inside of most of the other hotels  this is a very good thing  The hotel has a western theme  flat panel tvs in your room  and access to the pool next door at the flamingo hotel  There is also a restaurant on site  but we didn t make it to the hotel due to the wait  Hotel is right in the middle of the strip  with the flamingo next door  and Ceasars Palace and the Bellagio   see the fountain show  directly across the street   Our only complaint is that the slots didn t pay out more  haha  
P =>  Good for the price and right on the strip   This is a good hotel on center strip  Everything is within walking distance and you are right across from the Bellagio and Ceasars for under     a night  This is not a luxury hotel  There is no refrigerator  but the rooms are nice and right on the strip  Our experience was fairly good  I reserved online and requested a strip view  refrigerator  and King bed  Upon checkin we were told there were only    refrigerators for the whole hotel  standard rooms  and most were used for medications  The lady was very nice and upgraded us to a strip view for free since there were no more frigs left  Good to me   we just used the sink and filled it with ice every night  We were on the second floor and could see the eifel tower and the Bellagio fountains  It was beautiful at night  The bed was comfy  but I got cold so a few more blankets would have been nice  The airconditioner defintiley works here  Flat screen television was nice  there was a balcony but the windows are locked shut  There is plenty of room for two people  and for under     a night  center strip  you just can t beat it The only bad thing I could say was just don t eat from the Victorian Cafe  It is horrible  The room service pizza is awesome though  There is no pool  but you can use the pool at the Flamingo which is right next door  
P =>  gritty  I was drawn in by the       steak and eggs  I was met by the stench of beer and urine as I stepped out of my car in the parking garage  As I stepped off the elevator into the casino  three thuggish looking characters were standing there  The casino has a very strong cigarette odor  so stay away if you can t handle that  So I finally get my table after a    minute wait  The waitress walks past our table about a dozen times before stopping to take our order  The steak was like a tire  It was chewy and almost impossible to cut with a steak knife  It also tasted like rubber  At least it has some low limit tables and is in the middle of the strip  Other than that  stay away 
P =>  excellent hotel My husband  amp  i have visited Las Vegas many times and stayed at most of the  quot big quot  hotels but not again  We both found Bills excellent  the location superb  the rooms big  amp  clean with an opening window which was quite novel with warm  fresh air coming through  The staff were very helpful  amp  suppied a fridge for medication free of charge  Our room was on the  rd floor and quite often we were the only ones in the lift which was a major bonus for me after staying in the Flamingo with the lifts always broken We went to the pool in the Flamingo  amp  took a tip from another review  amp  walked through the staff car park which was much quicker than going through the Flamingo itself Bills is old quaint but after staying at Caesars a couple of years ago I would put the rooms on a pretty similar par with the standard rooms at Caesars  but much quicker to actually get out on to the strip I really cannot fault this Hotel and will definately be staying again next year  
P =>  Good Value I stayed here with my niece and nephew  The Victorian decor was rather gloomy for my taste  but the other two  early   s  liked it  Large rooms  comfortable beds  good restaurant  we only tried breakfast   at a reasonable price  Plenty of parking space  All clean and well maintained  Staff pleasant and helpful  I had a room at the back of the hotel which was subject to a constant whirring from the kitchen flues  but it didn t keep me awake  and I m a light sleeper   Otherwise  sound proofing between rooms was excellent One great advantage of this small hotel is the speed at which one can leave one s room and be at the centre of the Strip in   minutes  
P =>   Excellent location good value Liked just about everything  especially the central location  Very quick check in outSmall casino  easy to find way around Large  clean room and comfortable bedNo coffee maker in the room but there is a Seattle s Best Coffee downstairs  
P =>   Great location great value great hotel After booking flight to Las Vegas I turned my attention to where to stay  I had originally planned to stay at one of the bigger more well known hotels  After checking the reviews for some of these hotels I found that bigger does not always mean better  Then I came accross the review for Bill s  I was not sure at first but the location and the reviews appeared to be good so I decided to give it a go  I am so glad that I did  The location would be difficult to beat  accross the road from the Bellagio and Caersar s Place  next door to Bally s and Paris  in other words right at the heart of the strip  Step out of Bill s and immediatly you are IN Vegas  The reception staff are very friendly and helpful  also we were checked in and in our room within    minutes of arriving at the hotel which I understand is not always the case at many of the larger hotels  The rooms were of a good size and very clean  We had e mailed the hotel in advance to request a room with a view of the Bellagio fountains which they were able to provide  The casino is small compared to some of the other more modern casinos but once you are at the gaming table all that matter is the table in front of you not the size of the building you are in  The       steak and eggs served between midnight and  AM helps keep your energy levels up while gambling into the small hours  The only downside was the lack of a pool however guests are able to use the pool at the Flamingo next door  I will be planning another trip to Las Vegas in the near future and will definitly be looking at staying at Bill s again  
P =>   Great hotel  Don t hesitate to stay here    The rooms are much nicer than the casino area  and no big queues for lifts  Easy to find  Location   perfect   slap bang in the middle of the strip  We could see the Bellagio fountains from our room Rooms   Large  clean   everything you needCheck in   effortless   No queues  and believe me  some of the bigger hotels had enormous queues Casino   Just like any other  Only smaller so you don t get lost so easily Price   FAR cheaper than the other hotels nearby   great budget hotel in a perfect locationPool   You have use of the Flamingo pool next door  which actually means that you probably have less of a walk to the pool than in some of the bigger hotels  
P =>   Bill s vs Bellagio       and some tips We came to Vegas for our   th anniversary in ember and you can read the reviews about the Bellagio and Venetian  So  how on earth can I compare these with Bill s  To be honest  I am getting very tired of  quot business quot  and so called luxury hotels  In general they are varying standard and take about    mins to get from your room to anywhere  I read a lot of the reviews   in the UK we have the travellodge and it is very comparable  We have stayed there now for two periods of a few days and will be going back for our last week  Tips     Park yourself  Third floor is once more round the spiral and saves scrabbling for spaces on   which is where everyone else goes  There is no valet parking  but the distance from self park is the same as Bellagio s valet parking to the front desk   so long as you park close to a lift       Short Distances  Bring your cases down to the lobby and take another elevator up to your room with perhaps   mins walking  Compare that to a walk through the casino in almost every other hotel   yes you are still in the casino   and have to pass perhaps   slot machines on the way       Bring Slippers  Beds are reasonably comfortable and  being very fussy  I have not had any issues with cleanliness in the rooms except for the carpets  Yes the furniture is old  but bring a pair of    slippers and have a look at them after   mins and you will be glad you wore some  Honestly though  do you ever walk without slippers   I don t regardless of the quality of the hotel  It is cleaner than several of the rooms in the Flamingo next door   and I will never stay there again      Wallmark coffee machine  about      The booze is cheap but coffee on the strip is expensive  These machines pay for themselves after   or   cups  Although Bill s is right on the middle of the strip and there is lots of booze around  coffee was harder to find  except in buffets  though you can get some in the cafe downstairs  Having said that  we also bought one when we stayed at Bellagio due to the distances involved  Things I wasn t so keen on     Noise   from Flamingo s on the Friday and Saturday   but not in the week so much   We were on that side of the hotel and it was fairly annoying  but then you get what you pay for  I would imagine that the strip rooms are also fairly noisy with the road works at the moment  but that would be true of any hotel with strip rooms       If they overbook  they take you to Flamingo s  I would never stay there   see my review why  Things I Liked     Helpful and friendly staff  Never had any issues  even when we left a phone charger I read some derogatory comments in some of the reviews but I can honestly say all the staff we encountered were excellent and very pleasant  I think that some of them may have a reserved nature  but if you are nice to them  they certainly are nice back        Short checkin lines     of precisely us  We looked over at Bellagio s to see what their new garden display was  and to be honest  every checkin was open and if I had just got off a plane  I am not sure I would have liked to join a queue of    or so people  I was shocked  but someone I was meeting booked into another large hotel and waited about    mins         quot Reasonable costs   read cheap  I always booked through their site as I have some particular medical needs which are very easy to annotate         Very short queues  except for the main bar and cafe at peak times       Cafe  The special steak and eggs is ok   also comes with hash browns  coffee and toast  Miracle mile which is close also do breakfasts  There is a good range on the menu  but top prices are about the same as some of the buffets  Good or bad  you will always find I am very honest and sometimes a tad blunt  I write it as I see it  My wife and I were very happy at Bills and will be going back for another week before we fly out  We thought of trying TI only because it has a buffet and is also cheap  but then the Bellagio is about   mins across the road and that has the best buffet on the strip  TI buffet is also good  but the Luxor has gone down in quality when we went there a couple of weeks ago   We will be booking Bills again for the final week and might go to Bellagio s just because    for one or two nights before we go  Of course   might in Bellagio costs about the same as a week in Bills  
P =>   who s bill  bill s ain t no glitzy vegas hotel  but you only get what you pay for  after reading many reviews we decided to give it a try  found it great value for money   read cheap   right in middle of strip  found staff generally accomodating and friendly  yes rooms decor abit dark and retro victorian furniture abit off putting at first but room clean and tidy  great big flat screen TV although the american tv obsession with adverts and weather every  mins does your head in  and good powerful shower what more do you need   you do get some strip noise but what do expect  yes air con noisy but it always is   only gripe i found loo paper rough as the stuff you had at school   take your own   its a small    s era vegas hotel with no pretensions and maybe all the better for it  checkout sin city brew co in planet hollywood miracle mile mall  great bar great beer   
P =>   Location Location Location Bill s is in a great location  It may lose out on some facilities because it is a small hotel  but makes up for it in spades because there was no queue for check in  on Friday afternoon   or for check out  Some of the other queues we saw in other venues had     people waiting But back to location  It is right on the cross roads with Bally Bellagio and Caesars  but wins out as it is only a minute from your room to the strip  Hotels like the Bellagio have the lobby way back from the strip  with the rooms even further away From Bill s you can walk over half of the strip easily  which was a real bonus Steak and Eggs for Breakfast  served from Midnight  was a bargain at     although there was always a     minute wait to get a table  seemed like most of the time  Just put your name down and grab a beer      They announce tables on the casino wide PA  We had a view of the car park behind Bill s but you don t go to Vegas to stay in your room  Otherwise it was the best value hotel we stayed in during our    day break in West Coast USA Only regret was we never made the free Craps lessons at       in the morning  
P =>   Pretty Much Perfect Just got back from Bill s and I have to admit I was a bit fearful before I got there  The price and opinions of some people on the forum   who thought the place was a dump   had me worried that the hotel might have a negative impact on my holiday    Well  they must have ridiculously high standards Besides from being clean  and I have big cleanliness issues  The room is huge  The shower was amazingly hot and powerful  The bed was probably the comfiest I ve ever slept in  I got a partial view of the Bellagio fountains without even asking  The staff were nice and friendly  There were a fair few channels on the    quot  TV which I didn t watch much  but it was nice to have there Check in was fast  I was the only one at the front desk and check out was almost as fast with   people behind the desk and about   customers including me checking out  Although the room was pristine when I checked in  the maid must have been in and out of my room in under a minute every other day I was there      seconds of that time was spent on picking the tip up  At the end of my stay there was a layer of dust on the bedside table that was so thick I could ve written a short story in it  The location is the best on the strip  Takes       seconds from walking in and getting to your room  Didn t play in the casino or eat there but as far as the room goes it s great  especially for the price  
P =>  Nice  relatively  small Hotel in the middle of the strip We had two nights here en route between the Grand Canyon and San Francisco  Good hotel at a bargain price and in the middle of the strip so well placed to wander from  
P =>  Double surprise   First with Vegas   our first time in this wird and one of a kind city  Loved it Sencond with Bill s Hotel  All people I know who has ever been to LV never had heard about this hotel but knew everything about the Flamingo Bellagio Caesar Ballys  etc  Bill quot s location couldn t be better  in the center of Strip and sorrounded by the Bellagio Caesar and Ballys  Cozy  clean  big double bed roon decoret in Britain style  A    quot  flat TV gives a touch of modernity to the roon  Easy check in and out  Very good prices if you book in advance as we did  Bill quot s Hotel is for those travelers who priorizes confort  cleaness   location and costs rather than the fancy and well known hotels Vegas has to offer  Very good indeed  
P =>  The location on the  Four Corners  is the best  I stayed here a few times     years ago when it was Barbary Coast and it was clean and the staff friendly and you do not have to walk for miles to your room  My girlfriends and I did not need luxury just a place to crash that was safe and clean  The location on the  quot Four Corners quot  is the best  I decided to take a chance and book it for our trip this   We arrived for   nights and I asked for a view of Paris and the Bellagio fountains and we got it  The rooms are identical to the old Barbary Coast and quite large and CLEAN  They have    quot  hd tv s on the wall   Victorian Restaurant is open       We ate there a few times as it was convenient  the food is excellent and the prices great   Try the        Special Prime Rib   For the best location in Vegas and a reasonable rate this is a older but clean hotel with a wonderful staff  
P =>  This one is a sure bet What a fantastic experience   we were first time visitors to Las Vegas and spent    days at Bill s  We were really pleased with the location of this small hotel   right nextdoor to its big brother the Flamingo but with only     rooms it offered all the benefits of the bigger outfits at half the price If you want to be right where the action is   Bill s shares the intersection with Bellagio  Bally s and Caesars   so you can t get any more central than that Checkin and checkout is a breeze at Bill s   there were always   people on the desk   we didn t ever notice a queue  in the larger casinos with over      rooms we witnessed incredible queues at registration  maybe they were giving something away   All of our questions were fielded promptly   help and advice was given   requests were filled   all with a smile Our room included an oversized king bed  a desk and chair  a table and chairs  a dressing room and walkin robe and a separate bathroom  And the window of our room overlooked the fountains of Bellagio We were on the top floor   and although the traffic noise was audible   we were suprised how little we actually heard  We were sleeping easily until    and    in the day without any external noise disturbances Bill s has some great restaurants   the chinese food menu was excellent and we enjoyed the don perignon and fillet mignon special at the steakhouse for mother s day   silver service and scrumptious On the downside   and these were minor   the bath shower didn t drain quickly so you were standing in ankle deep water  picky I know   we could have used a fridge in the room because of the lenght of our stay  the internet was available but was an add on charge so you had to  quot register quot  each    hours  and avoid the dry cleaning service   sooo expensive But would certainly stay here again  Have the best memories of Vegas   thanks in part to Bill  
P =>   Great location right price  Stayed   nights at bill s right before the Memorial Day Holiday  The place hasn t changed much since it was the Barbary coast   that s both good  amp  bad  The good is a great location  very friendly  amp  efficient staff  a decent room and a good price  The bad is the hotel needs updating and the walls are fairly thin   you hear all the hallway noise   Don t go for the pizza they advertise in the room it s just not that good It lacks a lot of the special amenities that other hotels surrounding it have but if you are just looking for a convenient hotel in the middle of the strip for a good price it s tough to beat  
P =>   Only one word to describe Bill s  AWSOME  Bill s is truly the best bang for your buck in vegas  Check in was so quick and easy  upgraded our room for     a night  Our room was on the first floor with a veiw of the bellagio fountians and the effiel tower  Even on the first floor there was NO problem with noise  The rooms were spacious and VERY clean  Stayed at the Luxor last trip and it doesn t even compare to bills  Bills doesn t have all the bells and whistles the big guys do  but the flamingo next door gives you access to all of their amenities  pool spa   Loved this hotel and would definatly recommend to all  
P =>   Best little secret in Las Vegas  This was an unexpected very pleasant surprise  A little gem of a place right in the middle of the strip  Got a great deal on Priceline com and was just a bit skeptical at first because of the very low price  I normally stay at Bellagio  North Strip in Hilton Las Vegas  or South Strip in Grand Resorts  I wanted to mix it up and spend more on shows and other stuff  figuring that I spend very little time in the room Pros  Center of the strip  Right next to Flamingo on the corner of Flamingo and Las Vegas Strip  Connected via walkway to Bally s and across the street to Bellagio and Caesar s  View of Bellagio fountain out the corner was actually much better than the view I previously had in the Bellagio  out the back of the hotel  facing the Palms and Playboy Hotels  Small boutique hotel that used to be Barbary Coast  it s four stories which was great because you didn t have to walk miles through the casino to get to the elevator  In fact  I checked in quickly  and the elevator was right there next to an exit door  the cab pickup area  and the reception desk  There was easy access to everything  Nice shampoo and soaps from London  Ironing board iron and hair dryer in the room  Large plasma TV  Room service was fast and fairly reasonable  but was only because I got in late and was hungry  Steakhouse downstairs was     for filet  salad  fresh strawberry dessert  and a glass of dom perignon  Don t forget the coupon at the front desk for     off your bill Cons  Well  no real big ones  Queen sized bed needed replacing  as half was decent and half was squishy from use  If you re a light sleeper and are bothered by Vegas noise  bring ear plugs  Better yet  don t stay on the strip  Had one morning between      and      AM where the clubs were closing and the  quot beautiful people quot   LOL   were in their drunken stupors trying to hail cabs  running out in the street and blocking traffic  and overall being pains in the butt  Really didn t spend much time in the room except to sleep and shower  Shower was nice and the stained glass window in the shower opened outside  good touch  and let the steam out   Room was way bigger than I expected Did some great shopping  off the strip   Signed up for rewards club and got some real bargain prices on food and shows  Whenever I got thirsty  I d slowly stick a few quarters in the slots  get a free bottle of water from the runner  and move on  Tip  go to Fremont Street  Golden Gate  Hit up the       shrimp cocktail at the deli counter  and you ll get the biggest shrimp cocktail for the best price  Don t miss the free stuff like the Bellagio dancing fountains  the Mirage volcano  and the Treasure Island pirate fights  yes  it s now sexist     instead of pirates beating the Brits  it s women beating up the men     with plenty of comments from my fellow tourists about wanting to see the women lose in their wet t shirts    Went to a free concert in the park  which was a nice evening picnic and way to relax  Another hint  get your        minute reflexology foot massage at the Hawaiian Village  It ll do your dogs good  especially with all the walking on the strip  
P =>   Sweet Suite on  th Floor Second time at Bill s and I was wowed again  Suite on  th floor overlooked Bally s and Bellagio fountains  roomy  clean  and spacious  Easy to park  check in  and get to your room  Aracely was very pleasant and helpful at front desk as we arrived early  She called housekeeping to have our room ready in an hour  Very much appreciated  All staff we dealt with were exceedingly polite and friendly Entering through the double doors  the suite had an L shaped sofa and flat screen tv  bar area with sink  refrigerator and chairs  and a full dining room table with chairs  very nice view out that window  Half bath off to the side  Then into the bedroom area  king bed with armoire with tv  wing chair  night stands and lamps  glass block wall separating large jetted tub and sink area  then another window to the world below  Through another door to the stall shower with the stained glass window that opens Since we just wanted a quick lunch  picked up a pizza at the Flamingo and brought it back to the room  We originally wanted to go to Battista s Hole in the Wall for dinner  but we could not get a reservation until  pm and figured we d try something different  We took some advice and went to the Rio on the free shuttle outside Bill s to the Gold Coast  and walked next door  We enjoyed the Rio World Buffet with it s vast array of appetizers  main dishes and wonderful desserts  In fact  we had a coupon given to us at check in at Bill s which was a plus  We walked after dinner back up Flamingo Road  instead of the shuttle  to Caesar s Palace for a while then back to Flamingo  Bill s  Bally s and Paris  Bill s has a Seattle s Best Coffee stand in the casino Perfect location  right on corner between Flamingo and Bally s  across from Caesar s and Bellagio  The fountains again were beautiful  and we went up the Eiffel Tower during the day  You will see in the photo how small Bill s is in comparison to the other giants  but you get a great room at a great price  easy to navigate and friendly staff  Hats off to you  Bill s  once again  We ll be back  
P =>   BEST VALUE ON THE STRIP I cannot say enough good things about this hotel  it is opposite the Bellagio  amp  next door to Flamingos  literally smack bang in the middle of the strip The rooms were huge clean with a massive plasma in each of them  the decor is old style vegas red velvet everywhere  real saloon style The Victorian Room downstairs had fantastic food  amp  get this    c margarita s all day everyday We had the Bellagio water show view from our bathroom window which was lovely  amp  all hotel staff were great I had my   yr old with me  amp  they were very strict about me being anywhere near the gaming area with him which is fine  Probably not the best hotel for little kiddies  we went to Adventure Dome in Circus Circus for him  but I think Vegas is definetly more for adults  so wherever I would have stayed would have been the same  
P =>   A little overrated but the service is excellent  I ve stayed at    hotels in Las Vegas  and this one is nice  but     in town  That seems high The staff has to be the friendliest and most helpful in town  however  Management has to be commended for bringing such a wonderful group together What makes this place special is it s location  It s right where you want to be  and cheap compared to it s neighbors  although like other hotels in the heart of the strip  they charge extra for more than   people in a room  which is a joke You get free access to the fantastic pool next door at the Flamingo  although it s not convenient to get there Very limited food options  One steakhouse  but also a    hot dog stand  Hard to find a good deal like that on the strip  My family has stayed in various places in Vegas  and my kids didn t like it here  because everywhere else in town is so over the top  But the rooms are very nice  the staff is great  and the location can t be beat  
P =>    st time visit to las vegas Selected Bills hotel after reading reviews on trip advisor and was not disappointed Used the airport shuttle bus       and from leaving shuttle to entering room took   minutes  receptionist very helpful and friendly  Room was huge with view of Bellagio fountains and Eiffle tower Bills is centrally placed on the strip with MGM    minutes comfortable stroll to the left and Treasure Island the same to the right The in house casino is not large by other hotel standards but is very easy to wander through   the strip being   minutes from the hotel elevators   very handy  No safe in the room but a safety deposit facility in the cashier s cage in the casino  ALL staff were very helpful and friendly throughout  my visit  During my trip I visited all the hotels and while most were more modern   they were too large for comfort  taking    mins or so to get from their reception to the strip     give me Bills any day Use the Duece bus for travelling further along the strip to Las vegas outlets   stratosphere and downtown     a single trip or    for a    hour pass Over    s get a discounted entry and ride at the Stratosphere        for entry and   ride Most hotels have buffet breakfasts around     and are very similar although each hotel has a different theme   I liked the Paris best   themed as street cafes   very atmospheric If interested in the Gun store  have a buffet breakfast at MGM   then cross the road to the Tropicana and catch the bus     which drops you off ouside      all day pass   better than     taxi each way    package deal was     for  pistols     shots and   sub machine guns     magazines  with a free T shirt   big boys toys but well worth it Ths shopping is overwhelming and different in each hotel  Within    mins walk either way along the strip is a Walgreens store   useful for everday items  pop  chocolate etc    also a Buirger King and Dennys     mins towards Treasure Island Don t miss the free slot machines     beers and marguaritas at the Imperial Palace to the left  along the strip  Overall a fabulous  st time visit centered on Bills gambling Hall  I will definitely come back to Las Vegas and will certainly stay at Bills again  
P =>  LOCATION  LOCATION  LOCATION  We have been staying there every summer for several years and wouldn t stay anywhere else  View from our room on  th floor was of Eiffel Tower and Bellegio Fountains and strip  It is just   minutes from room to strip and they have shuttles to go to places off strip  Staff was great and gambling even greater  We ate almost all meals at the Victorian Room and loved all of them  It is everything we want plus very reasonable price and very clean  We also enjoed Big Elvis in the evenings  
P =>   Excellent Location   Excellent Price   No Need To Spend More  This hotel is perfect for the budget traveller and the location is pretty much unrivalled being opposite the Bellagio and Caesars palace  The selling point for us was the free parking which is situated within the hotel  This car park is free to everyone and not just hotel guests but has plenty of spaces  Bill s Gamblin Hall is one of the less fancy casinos but still has charm  The room was very nice  with views of the strip  and a     LCD TV  breakfast is not included but the hotel does have two restaurants however food is not far whichever direction you head down the strip  I would stay here every time  Unless you really want to splash and out and live it up then stay here and spend the money you save enjoying yourself  
P =>  A worthwhile place to stay Bill s is a great place to stay if you want great value and excellent location  We paid        night  It is easy to get around in and has some of the  quot old Las Vegas charm quot   Beautiful wood and stained glass is evident throughout including in the rooms  It was wonderful to not have to get a map to figure out how to get to and from your room  As well  the very quick access to the strip and it s central location are bonuses  It doesn t have a pool but you can use the Flamingo one  hotel next door  which is beautiful and large  A word of advise  many of the nicer spots are taken by      a m  at the pool so if that s important  go early  The Victorian room restaurant isn t that big but certainly is busy  The service is usually fast except when they are really busy  The wait staff aren t overly friendly but the food is quite good with reasonable portions  It isn t cheap but reasonable compared to other places on the strip  They have breakfast specials before   a m   amp  a prime rib dinner for        that runs    hours day  The rooms are exactly as you see in their advertised pictures  The bathrooms do have a stained glass window that opens  The window in the room is like a patio door but does not open  Air conditioning worked great  Bed and pillows were comfortable  Our only complaint was that housekeeping did a poor job  We called the supervisor one morning to complain and there was only a slight improvement after that  Our ice bucket was left full of water each day with no new ice bag  No soap was left as well as the dirty cups were not replaced  The mirror in the bathroom as well as the hairdryer needed some cleaning  One day  our air conditioning was turned off and the heat turned on  The temperatures ranged in the high    s on our visit so we didn t appreciate that much  We requested a coffee maker and got one but I wouldn t bother  I had to clean it as it had old coffee grounds caked inside and the coffee they give you is beyond disgusting  The front desk staff were very helpful and accommodating  When we mentioned some noise from service elevators next to our room they moved us to a view room  that is usually        night extra  without our asking for a change  The view was from the far side of our window  amp  looked out at the Paris tower and the Bellagio fountains  It was nice to see but I wouldn t pay the extra money to see those things unless it is something that is very important to you  How long would you stand at the side of your window looking at them to warrant that extra money each night  There is a good amount of slot machines  amp  tables for gambling  amp  also a few bars  Seattle s coffee is at front of the casino  Coffee tastes better  amp  is more reasonably priced than most places on the strip  They have a small assortment of squares cookies too  If the housekeeping had been better I would give this hotel a   star  Hopefully that is something they improve upon in the future  
P =>   Good choice for weekend getaway  Excellent location  We booked this hotel over the telephone  Their direct line rates were the same as their online rates  No AAA discount anymore  No other offers  specials  discounts  even though Vegas is supposedly hopping with them  We chose this hotel based on location and what we saw during a visit and stay at the Flamingo  Inext door  in       Bill s has no pool  but guests have pool privleages next door at Flamingo  Great location on center strip  We arrived in Las Vegas at      a m  and walked around until       a m  making our way from MGM to Bill s  we had backpacks only   No rooms at       a m  Were told to try again at      or      p m  One lady at the front desk was nice  the other girl was not very friendly  Called back from garitaville at      and our room was ready  The registration desk is very small and next to the line for one of the restaurants inside  It made the Flamingo check in desk look glamorous  Bill s is a very smoky casino  but you can enter exit  very close to the registration desk elevator which is nice  Our room overlooked the corner of Flamingo the strip  You could watch the fountains at the Bellagio  BUT  we were just a couple of floors up so it was VERY NOISY  Especially Saturday and Sunday evenings  Lots of horns honking  construction sounds  sirens  people yelling until      a m  Slept with ear plugs those nights  Monday night much quieter  Our standard room was MUCH BETTER than our standard room at the Flamingo in       bigger  better style  newer looking  Our rate was about     average over the   nights  which was more than were were hoping to pay given all the  quot hype quot  in the news about  quot vegas deals quot   Even when we checked in we tried to get our AAA discount but no luck  This did work for us at the Flamingo in       they wouldn t give AAA over the ph or online but at the front desk they did   Sign up for the Bill s Players Club to get discount at garitaville next door in the Flamingo  We had room service one night  Pizza and salads  It was so so if you didnt  want to go out  We had a window that opened in the shower  Nice  
P =>   Perfect if you want the full Vegas experience             which includes great location  big  comfortable room with views of the Bellagio fountains and no sleep  I booked this hotel for its great value      total nt on priceline  and because I wanted to experience what Vegas is  And I did because Vegas is a city that doesn t sleep and neither did I  A strip view room has a great view  but remember that construction on the strip goes      and even my trusted earplugs couldn t block it out  If we were staying longer  I would have asked to move to a different room So  if you want to party and sleep is the last thing on your mind    this place is perfect for you Service in the hotel  just like everywhere in Vegas  is all about tips  And internet costs extra too  
P =>  Here for the Beer  I didn t actually stay at this hotel  but found it a great place to drink if you just want to hang out for a while and not gamble  You could get a pitcher of beer for        Anywhere else on the strip is    a bottle for domestic  
P =>  Great value Great location Stayed for   nights  Asked for a strip room and got a great side strip view for no extra cost  high floor as requested  visible   Eiffel Tower  Bellagio fountains   Quiet enough  Very clean  V nice staff  I agree with all the positive comments from other guests I would add  The furniture  fittings were much better quality than I expected at these prices  around     for a big double queen   Nice big  solid looking wood cabinets  chairs  table etc  quality mattress  flatscreen tv etc  V pleasantly surprised I thought it would be motel basic at these prices but the room was quite plush We ve stayed at the Bellagio before and to be honest  there s not a lot of difference in the actual rooms  Ok  it lacks the glitz and glam  but this is a clean  decent  well run place  with a relaxed atmosphere  I would stay there again  
P =>   Great location on the Strip Read reviews before bookings  The hotel has a great location on the strip  The casino is too smoky for me but if you re a gambler who cares  Our room was on the back side of the hotel which was ideal for us as it was quiet  Large size with two queen size beds  desk and table  Bath and toilet were in a seperate room from the sink  or was good Two elevators provided quick access to floor  Didn t notice any undesirables wandering the halls Check in and out were a lot faster than the major hotels on the strip We didn t eat at the hotel restraurant so can t comment on them  
P =>   Best value on the strip The best thing about Bill s is the location  Not just that Bellagio and Caesar s are right across the street  at a central location on the Strip  but the hotel and casino is small  really small by Vegas Strip standards  so it doesn t take you half an hour to walk from the casino door to your room  Beyond that  you get a decent room for a very reasonable price  The place is essentially a throwback to the days when Strip hotel casinos didn t necessarily take up several square miles  This was a real place for regulars back in the day  and it has retained some of those elements even in its current corporate ownership  Also  if you re driving  the parking garage is also very conveniently located It s not a five star hotel experience by a longshot  but if all you need is a clean and comfortable place to flop on your Vegas weekend of gambling and partying  this is your most economical option  
P =>   Great value and perfect location  My boyfriend and I stayed at Bill s for two nights in ruary this year  We wanted to stay on the strip but not spend too much money on a room  Bill s is perfect for anyone wanting the same We had breakfast downstairs once which was ok  I would recommend heading to some of the buffets at nearby hotels though The rooms looked exactly like the pictures on Trip Advisor  The room was very clean  as was the whole hotel  The casino downstairs is not the best but it is in such a great location that the best is only a short walk away    
P =>   A little Treasure A party of    of us stayed at Bills for a week in ch    This hotel is in an excellent location with hotels such as The Bellagio  Ceasers Palace and the Flamingo for neighbours  The rooms are large clean with a very large comfortable bed  The plasma TV is a bonus  Our room was on the  th floor with a great side view of the Bellagio fountains Breakfasts were good value and the    hotdogs were ideal for a snack on the run If you enjoy a beer you can buy a bucket of Coors light for     this holds approx   pints Big Elvis is really good if you like that kind of thing  every one of his shows were packed There is a TIX ticket office in the entrance of the hotel where you can buy discounted tickets for shows  We went to see the Cirque Du Soliel show  quot KA quot  at the MGM Grand  it was superb  well recommendedWe found this hotel to be informal and welcoming which made for an enjoyable stay even some of the croupiers helped us novices enjoy a game of roulette or two There are some fantastic hotels in Vegas   great to visit and see the sights  but we are delighted we chose Bills as a base  This hotel really does what it says on the tin  Looking forward to our next visit and yes  we will stay at Bills 
P =>   Wow   I love BILLS    If you have stayed at any of the Boyd properties  you know how the room is laid out at Bill s  Nice oversize rooms  these have flat panel tv  nice touch  and small sitting area  The bathroom is split with a sink dressing area  which tends to be the only problem as the counter space for the sink is not large and a bit cut up due to the split  but still it works  and then a tub shower combo with toilet  Plenty of clean towels  Rooms were quiet  unless you left the window in the bathroom open   since we had a strip view room and were not really high up  we got to listen to all the partying  Closed the window  no problems  However  since some people are REALLY picky  I will say that even with the air on and the window closed  we could still hear the sirens when they went buy  but hey  we were right on the strip  If you don t want the noise  don t get a strip view  and or bring ear plugs  The coffee shop is just ok  The casino is kinda ok  not very big but you can walk to all the big expensive ones  We love Bill s and recommend it highly  
P =>   GREAT LOCATION   GREAT SIZE Bill s is the best location for your buck  It is directly across from Bally s  next door to Flamingo and diagonally across from the Bellagio  This allowed us to get to all the nice sites and casinos in good time considering all the foot traffic and stops at the many shops in every casino  It is also the location of Tix   Tonight which sells discount tickets to shows for that night as well as discounts to different restaurants  They post the schedule at     am and start selling at     The line starts forming around     ish and things do sell out so get there early for best options We preferred walking up the strip toward the Venetian and Fashion Show Mall as opposed to the other direction   MGM and Luxor  It was a much nicer walk toward Venetian  The walk toward MGM is not nearly as nice  lots of construction and cheap looking places   although maybe there were bargains to be found My husband and I arrived late on Thursday night and had no wait to check in to our room  The first room we had was on the Flamino side and was quiet  but it was equipped with a handicapped restroom  room       which my husband was not comfortable with  We asked to change rooms and for our trouble we were upgraded to a room with a view   Bally s   This room        was quite a bit different than the previous  It was not renovated and was a little weird and the view was not worth the added expense if you choose to upgrade  The one plus was that the shower had a steam vent in it and it worked very well  This room was very noisy due to the street noise as well as the room next door  To enter this room  you had to go through a common door that lead to   rooms and this exterior door made a lot of noise when the people in the other room came and went  The next day we asked to be moved again to the quiet side of the hotel  Once again the staff was extremely accomodating  We were put in room      a few doors down from     on the opposite side of the hall  This room was renovated as you can see from the pictures I ve included  We were told that you can hear the fans from the Flamingo at all times  This did not bother me because it was a low hum   similar to white noise and I believe it probably helped me to sleep better  however if you think this will bother you  stay away from this room and inquire about the room you do get to make sure you are away from the fans  As far as the size  the rooms were spacious and the size of the hotel is not overwhelming like much of the rest of Las Vegas is  You can get to the street from your room in less than   minutes  which I hear is not the case w  the larger hotels          min   I don t know about you  but I like to maximize my time and that does not include taking       minutes to get to from my room out to the street  The other benefit is check in and check out time was seemless and quick  Again  maximize your time  We went to use the pool at the Flamingo and couldn t believe the excessive check in line at the reception desk  I m sure people would be in that line for at least       minutes We took advantage of the       steak and egg special in the Victorian Room  It came with   eggs  hash browns  toast and the steak  Everything was good except the steak   to be expected for        We can now say we were able to take advantage of one of those unbelievable great food deals  but you do get what you pay for and there are so many good restaurants to choose from  why waste your calories on mediocre food Some of the great free things to do while you are there are     Bellagio fountains   these are shown every    minutes in the day and every    minutes at night and they are played to one song     Bellagio Conservatory   this is a changing exhibit and is well worth your time     Sirens of Treasure Island   this is a Risky Pirate show in front of Treasure Island  get there early for a decent view  This show          minutes  starts at  pm and then is shown every    minutes after  It was well done  but may not be suitable for children     Volcano at Mirage   hourly shows starting at   pm  There are many other free things to see and do  but these were our favorites  
P =>   home from home just returned from a weeks stay at fabulous Bill s Gamblin hall in the heart of las vegas  Have to say although i was blown away by the sheer scale and opulence of the hotels surrounding Bill s they were nothing like as warm and cosy  After a long day s sightseeing coming back to Bill s felt like coming home  the staff and facilities were fantastic and although there were no huge malls or gyms they were just what we needed i e accessible  immaculately clean and with a personal  friendly touch that i felt was lacking in some of the bigger resorts  If ur looking for opulence and all the facilities you ll could need not to have to leave a hotel then Bill s is probably not for u but if it s a clean  friendly hotel with quick and easy access to comfy  cosy rooms without having to battle through a check in queue that goes on for days then look no further  I haven t even mentioned the location yet  talk about a lucky break when us tired and weary travellers pulled up at our hotel and found it slap bang in the middle of the ideal base for discovering vegas  with Caesar s palace  the Bellagio  Bally s  Paris and The Flamingo literally on the doorstep not to mention the ease of access to the monorail we couldn t have picked a more perfect and not to mention reasonably priced location to explore this amazing city and so I d like to say thanks to Bill s for being my home away from home whilst i was a long way from mine  
P =>   Great base for Vegas explorations I really enjoyed staying at Bill s  It s bang on the middle of the Strip  has clean rooms  friendly staff and a much more intimate atmosphere than some of the other hotels I ve stayed in   also due to its smaller size  It s also a nice and relaxed place to stay for a drink  e g  while listening to Big Elvis  I m not that much into the Vegas trip  went there for a conference   so this hotel made it a much more pleasant experience Btw the hotel does not have fitness pool facilities  but you get a card to use the Flamingo s facilities right next door  
P =>   Excellent value I stayed here for   nights in ch       Pros  Clean and comfortable rooms  very cheap  great locationCons  The traffic noise from the strip was pretty loud overnight despite the double glazing It was by far the best value of all the hotels I stayed in while touring the USA  You can t go past this one if you re looking for a low cost  good quality hotel  
P =>   Definately Plan On Staying Here Again  Bill s Gamblin  Hall and Saloon is probably one of the best values for your buck in Las Vegas We arrived at the hotel long before check in time and they were very accomadating with storage for our luggage and then checked us in at noon instead of the standard   o clock check in  The hotel is an older one  and was not meant for the traffic that they get in the lobby  The front desk isn t situated in the best place  but the desk clerks were very pleasant as were the bell boys  The one bell boy in particular was very pleasant and remembered us when we needed to store our luggage at check out as we had a later flight Once we got to our rooms  we were very pleased  The beds were newer and as comfortable as our bed at home  A large plasma screen tv  which was only turned on once   Spacious storage in the dresser for all of our clothes  The bathroom is older  but clean  and i particularly liked the stained glass window in the bath You couldn t ask for a more central location than Bill s  across from Harah s and Ceaser s and kiddie corner to the Bellagio  There is a discount ticket desk  tix tonight  right in the hotel  a      Corona bar  and a     garita right in the hotel  This hotel was very convenient for all amenities The best thing about this hotel is price  For our party  our view on things is that you are only in your room to sleep so you don t need to be in the lap of luxury  And when we returned home  my husband was curious and had to calculate how many hours we actually slept  and we ended up spending a mere     of our time in our room  with a total sleep time of    hours in      
P =>  Clean and comfortable and conveniently located rooms  My husband  amp  I stayed at Bill s ch              The casino is a bit smokey but it is not as bad as some casinos in Las Vegas  The smoke does tend to travel up with the elevator  we were on the second floor  but even though I have some bronchial problems I did OK when we were not in the casino for too long  We don t gamble but we did stay for the  Big Elvis  show and that was fun  Bellagio view  We arrived at the casino before noon and they had a room ready for us  We did not ask for but were given  at no additional cost  a room facing the strip where we could see the Bellagio fountains  But you really can t hear the music too well from the room due to all the street noise so it was not that enjoyable to view from the room  I certainly would not pay extra for a Bellagio fountain view because it is not that far to walk to get the whole experience which is so much better to be right there with the music and the power of the fountain waters  Sound resistant walls  It appears that all the doors to the hotel rooms have about a one inch gap at the bottom and because of that  noise would filter in  amp  out of rooms  But I am more adverse to sound coming through the walls and we had no problem with hearing anyone through the walls from the rooms on either side of us for the whole duration of our stay  I just used a towel to put at the bottom of our door and kept it in a drawer to use each night  The drapes on the window were heavy enough to keep the room dark after the sun came up in the morning  Outside  across the street  off to the left of our window was a large LED screen with rotating pictures and the drapes were helpful in eliminating that light as well  Some have mentioned that there was a security guard at the elevator but we never saw one and we were in and out a lot  But  I never felt insecure about my safety except for the not so secure looking door lock when we first arrive  I guess I got use to it  Also  I never found any employees at Bill s that were friendly but I never encountered any who were rude  A little indifferent maybe  but not down right rude  Roomy and clean rooms  The rooms at Bill s are a nice size to move about in easily   a king bed  desk    side tables  a double dresser and a small round table with   chairs  There is a big screen TV on the wall that we could view while sitting in bed  It came in handy for the news  There is no weather channel available though  The carpet was very clean and I felt comfortable walking in my bare feet  The bedding was clean and neat and nothing in the room was tattered looking  And the pillows smelled free of odors  The bathroom is a bit small   one sink with maybe   quot  on one side and   feet of counter space on other side  We were able to scrunch both of us in at the sink counter at one time  it was doable but cramped  With a little cooperation between us we were able to alternate sink times  The closet area  in the bathroom  was maybe   or so feet of space  The toiletries were minimal but enough for our stay  There is a hair dryer  an iron and ironing board in the bath room  On close inspection of the caulking around the tub I found only a couple small mildewed stained areas  All the tile grout looked very clean  That was our room experience Well  I think I pretty much covered the rooms of the hotel so the following info is about a few other experiences at the hotel and then outside on the streets of Las Vegas  I hope our experience will be helpful to you Bill s for breakfast  We ate breakfast one late morning in the hotel restaurant  It was about       am and we had to wait for    minutes to be seated  We shared an omelet which was just so so  The service was slow and our server was not very attentive  The    cent margaritas are in the back  straight back form the elevator  with elevator on your left side  at a small bar  They are small margaritas and there isn t much alcohol in them  They didn t seem worth it to me  Free Big Elvis show  We kept missing the Big Elvis show because we did not realize that the small number of seats get taken    mins or so before the show begins  If you don t get a seat then you have to stand and I found myself in the way of people trying to move to and fro so we left  After learning when the show times were we managed to get a seat on the last day of our visit  He really does a good job of sounding like Elvis  I am not a very big fan of Elvis  music when he was into the Las Vegas scene and that is primarily the songs that Big Elvis sings  But  it was the showmanship and his interactions with other people and how much others got into the show that made it so much fun  Before he came out we were told that he had lost     lbs over a few months sometime during this last year  Sorry  I don t remember the amount of time  The show is free Convenience store  If you would like to purchase your own alcohol for less money then you can easily walk to a handy little convenience store nearby  When you walk out of the entrance to Bill s  entrance closest to the elevators   make a left and walk about   blocks  approx      Flamingo RD    there on your left around the right side of the building next to the parking lot is the store connected to the back side of a store front casino  The prices there were better than some places along the strip  This being      in Vegas  you can walk with your own drink down the street or into the casinos  My husband  amp  I share our meals so going to the Buffet for us is not a good enough deal  I thought that an awful lot of restaurants along the strip were too expensive so we ate in some of the indoor malls at the food courts where the prices were better  We would have driven off the strip but we were without a car We walked nearly everywhere we went because there is one place after another to stop and see  Also  it is great when you have to find a restroom because they are all right there in the casinos for anyone to use  Deuce Double ker bus  We did get a    hour pass one day to ride the Deuce Double ker bus down to Fremont Street Experience  downtown for the evening light show  amp  then later back to the hotel  The next day  we road the Deuce all the way to it s transit center but for the return trip ride everyone had to disembark at the transit center and board another bus  The Deuce bus does not stop just anywhere you want along the line  There is one stop in Front of the Flamingo Hotel and to learn of the others just do an internet search on The Deuce Las Vegas  It cost us       each for a    hour pass or       one way  A    hour pass only got us   good rides  You still have to walk in between bus stops and sleep sometime during that    hours  If you have a group it might be better to take a cab  The Deuce will also take you to the outlets mall City bus to and from airport  My husband and I flew into Las Vegas airport and took the city bus to Flamingo Rd  where we then walked to Bill s  about a   mile walk  but you can stay on the bus until you get to Desert Inn Rd  and then take the monorail to the MGM and then walk to Bill s     min  walk   On the return trip to the airport it is much easier  You walk about one mile east on Flamingo Rd  toward Paradise Rd   and catch the city bus off of Paradise Rd to the airport  The bus was only       per person   that is much less than any other means of transport back and forth  Just make sure you have the correct change because the bus driver does not have change to give you  You could also take a bus east on Flamingo Rd  and get off at Paradise Rd  for the bus to the airport  This mode of transport is customary in a lot of other countries we have visited and we look at is as part of the adventure and good exercise for the body and mind  For times and bus schedules just do an internet search for Las Vegas transportation  Also  google maps provides public transportation information for where ever you need to go  if transport is available there  Fremont Street Experience  Last year I was in Vegas with   girlfriends  we drove  and the Fremont Street Experience  a    foot LED graphic display canopy and         watt sound system  was really cool but this year they were not showing the same light show and I did not like it at all  Also  this year the center walkway in this downtown location was full of street vendors with their carts and the atmosphere was not as festive  Pasta Pirate Restaurant  That evening downtown looking for a place to eat  my husband and walked out of Fremont St  and took a right on East Ogden Ave  We walked about   blocks     East Ogden Ave   to the California Hotel  amp  Casino and found a restaurant there named  Pasta Pirate   there were others also   We did not have a reservation so we had to wait about    mins in the lounge which was comfortable and the beer was only       ea  We shared the Chicken Portobello for     and it was wonderful and a lot of food  They also include a glass of house wine  it was not to my liking  and a salad  They split it for us at no additional charge  It also comes with white rolls but we don t eat white flour products so we asked if they had any bread that was whole wheat  They did not but our waitress immediately asked the bus boy to go next door  without our suggesting  where they had whole wheat rolls and gave us those at no extra charge  Even when we first entered the restaurant the hostess was very friendly as well as the bartender in the lounge  Nearly every patron there was having the   oz  filet with the baby lobster tail  including glass of house and house vegetables and pasta or rice with bread and soup or salad for      It looked amazing and the next time I go that is what I will order  From the demeanor of the other patrons  I gathered that quite a few of them were locals  If you want to see their menu  do a search online   it s all there  Oh  and the atmosphere was cozy  I have been in some very swanky places on business trips and I must say that our experience with the employees at the Pasta Pirate was top class  I hope that is the rule there and not the exception The M  amp  M store on the strip is my favorite store because there are so many cute products to purchase or just look at  Some are very expensive and some are very inexpensive  Free show at Venetian  We also happened upon a free show in the Venetians Grand Canal Shoppes in St  k s Square  It was   women looking like statues  referred to as The Living Statues  with water coming out of their finger tips and hair tops  When the music started they began making slow and graceful movements  I don t know what time of day it generally occurs but I would imagine that the Concierge would know Antique Car show  Bill s gave us a coupon to The Antique Car Show at the Imperial Palace  We we able to go for free and there are some really incredibly bizarre looking old cars there  There are   or so very large rooms full of old cars and other old items that are interesting to see since it is free with the coupon  I would not pay more than a few dollars to see it but my husband would probably have payed more since he finds that sort of thing more interesting than I do  If you have not been to Las Vegas in quite a long time or never  then you might be surprised at how much skin is displayed on big screens and billboards that travel up and down the street  all in BIG view of little eyes  This is no longer a decent environment for a child s formable mind  
P =>  Great value nice rooms and simple casino with low tables Hotel does not look like something WAUW when you see the other hotels on the Strip  but hey  they also charge     times what Bills s costs  It s just across Bellagio and next to the Ballys and Flamingo  Very central located and this is the best part  Rooms are actually quite spacious and nice   nothing flashy  but still with large plasma tv and comfy bed  Going to Vegas again in a couple of weeks and booked again Bill s for   out of   nights  Other two days are to try the Bellagio and then we ll see if it s worth to pay a bit more than double per night  Pool   non  but you can use the Flamingo s pool next door  but is not a nice pool and owercrowed  
P =>  BIRTHDAY TRIP UPGRADE  Check out my Video  In Vegas for special birthday treat  First time in USA to see Tony Bennett at the Hilton  Luggage decided to stay on plane to next destination so arrived at Bills a wee bit upset  Staff at reception were extremely helpful as were the security at the elevators who ensured you had room key before you were allowed on elevator  good idea   Basic room we had booked turned into a super suite with stunning views of the Bellagio Would not fault this place in any way  I actually liked the fact it was so much smaller than the other hotels around and had a cosy atmosphere and friendly staff who you could recognise after a day or so  If Big Elvis is there they please go see his super show  Also the Diaquiris at the little bar just along from the reception were sooo cool  
P =>  CHOOSE BILL S I would stay here again without question Cannot recommend it enough We had a girlie holiday in ch and stayed for   nights  I have been to Vegas before and I would pick Bill s every time  unless we had a big win and then we might have treat ourselves   The location is perfect  the rooms are old fashioned  but very clean and unlike most of the big expensive hotels  they are very close to the lift and you can be on the strip in minutes  If you are lucky enough you can pay a bit extra and get a view of the Bellagio Fountains  I found reception helpful there is no conciege as such  but and extremely friendly bell man  The Casino itself was fun  Nobody really taking it too seriously  helpful bar staff karaoke and bands in the lounge  including Big Elvis the impersonator   Atmosphere was fun and relaxed  the girls played roulette I stuck to the slots  If    no when I go back Bill s will be my first choice  
P =>   Good enough For the price  this place was fine  The location is the best part  The rooms are spacious  However  the heater in the rooms was very loud which doesn t seem like a big deal until you are up  wide awake at  am because of it  The showers looked dirty to me  the caulk was brown not white   If you are all about the price  and don t plan on being in your room much  this place is just fine  
P =>   Bill s is great  Will definitely return   I stayed at Bill s for the  quot vacation quot  portion my trip  Three other days were spent at the Bellagio for a business conference  The rooms are VERY clean  the TV is amazing  the bed was comfortable  The view  for a     upgrade  of the Bellagio fountains was well worth it  If you want the view  but not the noise  try to get a room on the  rd or  th floor  The  nd floor can be a bit noisy with people yelling on the walkway below  amp  the traffic noise  amp  sirens  But if sleeping is not a priority  don t worry about it   A couple of the light bulbs in the room didn t work and the remote control to the TV wasn t working  but since I was hardly ever in the room  I didn t complain about it  Breakfast at   am in the Victorian Room was the fastest EVER and very very good  I m not a big gambler and only played a few penny slots  As usual  I lost  The location was the best  being right in the center of the strip  I would definitely stay at Bill s again unless I had a really good reason to stay somewhere else  
P =>  Bill s Gambling Hall and Saloon Location  location  location  This was our first  but definitely not our last trip to Bill s  Right on the heart of the strip  but with  downtown  room prices and a very friendly staff  If you want a decent room at a bargain price  this is THE place  Only     rooms and you can see from one end of the casino to the other  No huge crowds or long treks to get to your room  You can visit all the other glitzy hotels that others are paying for  then come back to your room at Bill s  We had a view of the Paris Hotel Eiffel Tower and the Bellagio fountains  If you want it quieter  you can opt for the side not facing the street and towards the back of the hotel  My wife loved the    cent margaritas  but eat elsewhere  Bill s food is mediocre at best  Grab a Seattle s Best coffee and a toasted bagel with cream cheese in the morning then head out for better fare  And when you head out  use the Deuce  We bought a   day pass for     and took it everywhere  As long as you don t venture from the Strip or downtown  the Deuce is all the transportation you need  Once last thing  Bill s is for adults  There is absolutely nothing there for kids to do  
P =>   Best Value On The Strip This was our fourth stay at Bills and again we were not disapointed  We arrived at     pm and there was no queue at checkin  Five Minutes later we were in room     which had a great view of the strip and the Bellagio fountains  The room and bathroom were clean  the bed was comfortable  If you spend anytime in the room there is a    quot  TV on the wall All the staff were very friendly housekeeping were excellent one morning when we were walking from our room down to the casino we passed a room that was being cleaned and the bed and furniture had been pulled away from the wall so that it could be cleaned properly The Victoria room is always busy even at  am we had a    minute wait but the wait is worth it for ribeye and eggs for       between midnight and  am Big Elvis is a must  im not an Elvis fan but always enjoy the show and there is always audience participation  There are a good selection of slots and table games at reasonable prices To summerise the good point are location price clenliness Negatives are that on a weekend it can get noisy if you have a strip side room  lots of sirens on a Friday  amp  Saturday night morning  Its much quieter during the week 
P =>   Don t gamble with your hotel  Go to Bill s  My wife  amp  I were visiting friends in San Antonio  Texas for two weeks  So we decided to take a   night break in the midle of our trip to Vegas and chose Bill s on Trip Advisor members comments  So we booked a   night flight hotel package with Expedia  and were not dissapointed  Booking in and checking out  via your t v  menu  were a breeze compared to the surrounding luxury hotels were they seemed to have day long queues whenever we passed through them  While the gaming rooms were a bit smokey and worn the service was excellent and you could not fault the overall cleanliness of the accommodation  Also  as mentioned many times the location of the hotel  right in the middle of everything  is excellent  Make sure you check out  Big Elvis   we thought it would be really corny  but we were singing along in no time  without alcohol  Superb Can I also recommend an excellent locals brewery casino  Ellis Island  Go left out the side entrance and about     yards down to the lights  turn right and it s on your left  Very entertaining locals and beers for    brewed on the premises  happy days  
P =>   super location Great location  large rooms  great beds  good value  The slots seemed to pay more when we were staying in the hotel that night and using Bills reward card  Visit Flamingo next door for free use of the pool area and towels    not be a year round offer Dissadvantages to Bills were that we had a lot of traffic noise and when the Fire engines are heading to the strip  the noise comes straight into the bedroom The reward programme was not as it seemed  The    free slot play and t shirt had to be earned in points play 
P =>   Awesome vacation My spouse  amp  I recently spent   nights at Bill s  While I had some qualms about booking our stay there  I doubt we will ever go to LV again without staying at Bill s  unless we inherit a fortune   Cleanliness is my    priority  They excelled at that  Location is a high priority  Couldn t be better than being in the middle of the Strip  We walked north one day and south one day and just strolled the other days  That way we were able to walk through most of the casinos  Last but certainly not least  the morning coffeecake  free  in the Victorian Room is the best  
P =>   A great location and very affordable I stayed here during the NBA All Star weekend  It was during the time that the hotel was changing over from the Barbary Coast  The hotel is smack in the center of the strip and we could see Las Vegas Blvd as well as the Bellagio and Ceasar s Palace from our window The room was a decent size with two queen beds  and I thought the beds were quite comfy  There were four of us lady s traveling and we did not feel cramped at all  I do however wish that the bathroom was a little bigger  however it was clean and neat  and served its purpose  I did however love the fact that the room had a plasma TV Since it is a smaller hotel we were able to get our needs met quickly  Whenever we requested extra towels  toiletries  etc   they were brought to us immediately  There is also room service that is quite affordable  and we did order food to our room throughout the weekend The casino is smaller and quite smokey  however it did not bother me  I love the low table limits  and played a lot of Black Jack and Roulette  The cocktail service is great    After playing in the casino you must go to the night club there  We had a great time If you want to be on the strip and not pay a lot for your room  this is a nice place to stay  Just keep in mind that it is an older property  however it is well maintained and quite clean  
P =>   Great Location Value  We have stayed at approximately fifteen different casinos in Las Vegas  While Bills is not the classiest in town  the rooms are clean  the service friendly  and the location terrific  We were in town for the Shelby     NASCAR race  then took an overnight trip to Death Valley  and returned to Las Vegas and Bills because we had tickets to Cher s show at Caesars  We chose Bills because it was across the street from Caesars and also because we had not stayed there before We ate in the restaurant twice for breakfast and dinner  All four meals were a value for the price paid We had an  quot upgraded quot  room with a view of Las Vegas Blvd and Bellagio s fountain water show  The only reason I did not give Bills a perfect five rating is because the bath is tiny and because the hotel is older and only four stories  the road noise is extreme  It really didn t subside until   or   in the morning  The noise may not be an issue in the regular rooms which do not front Las Vegas or Flamingo Blvd  
P =>   Brilliant location and great value Right in the centre of all the action and for a fraction of the price of the bigger casino s  The staff are all friendly and even the small rooms are massive  The casino is also one of the few that have    blackjack  Would recommend this place to anyone  
P =>   Convinient Clean Value Stayed two nights in early ch       Had a room with two queens on the third floor facing Flamingo Blvd but very near the Strip end of the building  Parking is free and the reception area  parking elevators and room elevators are close together and very easy to manage  There are only four or five floors  No long hauls through the casino with baggage  This is a real plus  The room was large  and clean with a private area for sink and toilet  Beds were comfortable  Only downsides are street noise     very loud the first night  manageable the last night  I don t know why  and        for internet access  Probably rooms further down Flamingo away from Las Vegas Blvd  the better for noise  We took advantage of the        roast beef diner at the Victorian Restaurant and it was delicious and a real value  We are not big Las Vegas fans but we liked this hotel  Great location too  
P =>   Perfect in everyway    of us stayed for   nights  Room was very clean  nicely decorated  Bathroom was large and the shower was nice  big and lots of hot water  Free coffee pot with coffee brought up to room at no charge  Nice casino area  Friendly staff  Victorian Room rest very good  but usually a wait of   mins or more  Would reccommend again and again  
P =>   Great place to stay I spent   days at Bill s and it was great   it was excellent value for money       for the room  Ballagio would have been       and the location is absolutely ideal  I was at a wedding at the Bellagio and Bill s is on the strip  I could see the Ballagio fountains from my room and it takes you about   mins to get to there  another    to find anyone inside it as it is so big  My room was huge with a very large Plasma tv as well  Granted if you want total luxury then Bill s isn t for you but if you want a great size room  lovely staff and really cheap beer  jug of beer     then stay here  You can visit the insides of all of the other hotels and who spend any time in a hotel room in Vegas anyway   
P =>   Fantastic hotel can t recommend it enough  I spent a week staying at Bill s and can t praise it enough   it was excellent value for money and the location is absolutely ideal  We were at a wedding at the Bellagio and Bill s is right in the middle of all the action  right across from the Bellagio    min walk   next to the Flamingo and Ballys and the monorail station on the other side  While the rooms are nothing fancy  our room was bigger than expected  clean  quiet and with very comfy beds and a huge plasma screen TV  I also liked the fact we could be out on the street in just a couple of minutes  rather than having to walk for miles in one of the more expensive and lavish hotels  and there was no queue to check in or out  For the money we paid it was brilliant and I would absolutely stay there again  
P =>   Loved it and very clean Great Hotel  felt so very safe and secure Had to go to the drinks machine with only white socks on and expected dirty socks but got back to the room at the end of the corridor with still white socks  
P =>  Just What We Needed    We got a great deal and stayed at Bill s for   nights           for about       including taxes and fees   Just for the record  Bill s is not The Bellagio or The Venetian  so please don t expect those types of accommodations or amenities   But for what we paid  Bill s offered above average    star  accommodations at a great location  in the middle of the Strip  The staffed at the front desk were very nice and got us to our room very quickly  Upon entering the room  we thought the room was very clean and well kept  The room looked just like the photo on the website  The bed was firm and comfortable  My wife and I slept very well  On a guy note  the flat screen TV was wonderful  The heating and AC worked very well  To our liking  the cleaning crew comes early  We hate leaving a hotel room in the morning   ish  and coming back to an unclean room  The cleaning crew at Bill s does a great job cleaning the rooms in a timely manner  You can hear noise in the hallway  when people come in late intoxicated  and from the strip  but it s not unbearable or loud enough to wake you when sleeping  For the most part  the hotel is pretty quiet The bathrooms are in need of remodeling  but they were clean and fitted our needs  However  we did encounter a drainage problem in the tub  I called the front desk the next day to notify them and they said they would dispatch a technician to address it  They had three days to address the problem and never did  Getting out the shower with about foot of water in the tub  as it slowly drained  was a bit of a nuisance  But we considered the drainage problem a minor irritation and it didn t ruin our view of the hotel RecapIf you re celebrating an anniversary  or something of that nature   I would suggest that you just pay the extra          a night and stay at a nicer hotel with more amenities  But if you are looking for a decent hotel with clean rooms and a great location so you can get a taste of Vegas  Bill s is the place  We would definitely stay at Bill s again Couple of things to note  For those renting a car  Bill s has a free parking garage that always seemed to have plenty of parking  We had not trouble finding a space   days we rented a car  The   price show tickets booth located at Bill s seemed to always has a huge line  I would suggested going to Fashion Square mall or further up the strip to another   price show tickets booth for tickets There aren t many cabs waiting in front of Bill s  I guess because it s a smaller hotel  The Concierge can call you cab  but we needed to get to the airport and didn t have time to wait  So we took the short walk to Bally s Hotel across the street and got a cab right away  
P =>  Best value best location best secret of Vegas If you re going to Vegas to enjoy the gambling  nightlife  and people watching  this is the hotel for you  Why  There s no line up to check in or check out  it literally takes seconds   the rooms are just fine  they all have new flat screens  and the showers have WINDOWS so you can hear the sounds of the Strip while showering   neat    it s affordable  there s    cent margaritas  and the best part of all  Bill s is literally in the centre of the Strip  Why pay ridiculous sums of money to stay in some massive hotel where it s going to take    mins  to get to your room  when you can take the elevator at Bill s and get to your room in   mins   My GF and I were a bit hesitant at first  cuz the name of the hotel is stupid  but we were surprised and incredibly pleased with our stay  I m heading back in a couple days and you d better believe I m staying at Bill s  OH   and for an extra     or something  we got an AMAZING view of the Bellagio fountains  Worth the upgrade  
P =>  A Little Piece of Old Vegas on the Strip I love this little hotel   I was a little sad when it changed over from the Barbary Coast  but that s just because I m a nostalgia freak  I have stayed here   times and have always had a good experience  I was even upgraded to a huge suite once  at no charge  The price is outstanding  considering it s prime location and the much higher costs at the holels surronding it  Now  don t get me wrong  this is not a fancy place  The rooms are nothing special  but they are clean and provide a great place to crash after a long night out  The casino is fun and comfortable  compared to the more pretentious Bellagio and Caeser s across the street  The dealers were very kind and patient  I almost never play table games and had no idea what I was doing   If you are looking for a cheap place to stay but still want to be mid strip and close to the action  this is the perfect place for you  
P =>  Bill s is the best Value on the Stip I ve been reading these reviews and people complain about the dumbest things  Come on   quot not enough soap quot   We stayed here for three days and it was great  I dropped my shampoo out the window onto the locked balcony and the Staff was getting my soap within minutes  Bed was comfortable  room was clean  We had a great view of the fountains and the Strip from our room Great location  minutes to the strip  The Victorian restaurant was ok  The only thing that sucks is the drinks given while playing slots or tables are small  It is a little noisy from the street but I had no problem sleeping  
P =>   Central and clean This place is smack bang in the middle of everything  Sure  it s a tiny bit dated but really how much time do you really want to be in your room  There is a restaurant downstairs that has reasonably priced meals and breakfast   Pancakes are good  The casino part had    margaritas when we were there  If you have a choice  I d recommend planning your stay for mid week as the prices come way down  You can pretty much do everything you want mid week anyway  
P =>   Bill s Was Perfect  We chose this hotel for our   night stay based on reviews on TA  This turned out to be the perfect choice for our group  First of all  location  location  location  We walked virtually the whole strip during our stay and having Bills centrally located made that so much easier to do  One day we d set out for the northern part and the next the southern  Plus it has the easiest acces of any hotel resort I saw on the strip  Main reception and elevators to the rooms are at the front of the casino so check in was a snap and coming back at night after a long day of walking it was so nice to walk in the door and head right up the elevator to our rooms  No casino maze  We arrived early but our rooms were ready within    minutes of arrival  They have security staff that checks for key cards at night so that only guests may go up to the other floors  The rooms were a great steal and as advertised  Huge tv on the wall  nice decor and decent bathroom  We were in room     and had side view of the Bellagio fountains and good view of the Eiffel Tower  Bathrooms showed their wear but were clean  This isn t a luxury resort but we were in our rooms so little that it was more than comfortable for us  
P =>   Don t Do IT  A Reservation isn t a reservation  I give Bill s no stars because after having a confirmed and payed for reservation for   month I didn t get to stay there I was there at       A M  to see if my room was ready and the women at the desk confirmed my reservation and said to come around    and a room should be ready I bring in my luggage for myself and my    year old mother and they tell me   hours later that they cannot accomodate me They tell me that they switched my hotel to the Flamingo next door and to go there They said they could not help me with my luggage so I had to struggle down the street with it by myself At the Flamingo they give me a old dingy room that needed updating badly I will never gamble or stay at Bill s  I m sure that someone staying longer and paying more than me got my room  
P =>   It s Bill s  In planning our trip  I went to their website and found the best price      night   I did have to call to make sure we got a king room  because on their website it books your reservation as either a queen double or a single king room  On arrival  our room was ready on check in  but one of our friends s rooms was not ready   The room is decent     inch flat screen TV  Wired internet connection available  Pay per use wi fi  The bed was okay  We had to ask for more pillows  all feather and kind of flat  and the blankets were kind of thin  The shower was very nice   excellent water pressure and very hot  There was a stained glass window that could be opened which was nice for venting in between showers  The room comes with standard issue soap  body lotion  shampoo and conditioner  An ironing board and iron were also in the room  No coffee pot The Victorian Room restaraunt is just okay   but nothing fancy  It was good for breakfast  For coffee or a quick breakfast I would hit the Seattle s Best Coffee instead  That coffee was much better than the Victorian Room stuff  We did not eat at the Steakhouse Bill s is centrally located on the Strip between Bally s and Flamingo  The gambling was well above average on both the machines and table games I would stay there again  but I do have one lean beef  We got a letter stuck under our door the second day that said they would be turning out all the electricity the following morning from    am  They also gave us a complimentary glow stick to use  We were out partying and when we came back we had to hike up   flights of stairs and into our very dark and quiet room  A minor inconvienience that probably could not have been avoided  but an inconvienience the same  We did not get any compensation for the     hours without electricity  
P =>   Fabulous   a little treasure Just returned  yesterday  from an   night stay at Bills with friends  We booked this after a lot of research and reading the reviews  Well  we were not disappointed  Fantastic rates   far cheaper than the  big glossy  hotels  Our room was a King   very large  Bathroom was great and seemed to be a constant supply of hot water whatever time you took shower bath  The casino itself was very friendly   we played on the slots mostly  Highly recommend signing up for the  players club card   its freee      we didnt gamble enough to gain many points on the card but when you sign up you are given a book of vouchers for money off food and  buy one get one free  tickets for various top attractions  Bills is in an amazing location   previously stayed at the Luxor but you are a long way from the centre of the strip  with Bills you are very central although the deuce bus is fantastic value   ride for    hrs for     We also drove to the mountains for   days ski ing   approx   hr drive from the strip  returning to Bills at night  Can recommend Brooks car hire just down the strip  Collected us from our hotel and great service  We were struggling to hire a car from the usual big names as apparently there was a big conference on but Brooks were able to sort us out with an hours notice otherwise our ski ing trip would not have happended  Can recommend Grand Tours for a Grand Canyon trip to the west rim  sky walk       compared to many charging in excess of      for the same thing  Again great service  In summary Bills is friendly  small and has everything you need  Big Elvis is worth a watch  and the karoke nights entertaining  As a previous reviewer commented   returning to Bills after a hectic day on the strip was like coming home  
P =>   As advertised  There is nothing I can say about this hotel casino that others have not already  Its location is awesome  The price is very affordable  Rooms are decent and comfortable  The view is great  The shower drains slow  There is Big Elvis    c margaritas     hot dogs  and old school charm  The Victorian Room serves big  affordable portions  but it is not much better than a glorified diner I would not take my wife here  But for a group of guys or girls looking to party in Vegas  this is a great place to stay  
P =>   Great location and price but cleanliness an issue My boyfriend and I stayed at Bill s        and paid a total of         for three nights for a non smoking  two queen bedroom  We were only in the room briefly during our trip  just to sleep and take a shower  so here s my brief list of the pros and cons Pros   Great price with an average of      a night on the weekend    Location  It is located on the Center Strip right across from Caesar s Palace and the Bellagio    Very friendly service  We had an easy check in and out process    Comfortable beds   Nice flat screen TV Cons   Cleanliness was average  The room was clean when we first walked in  but for the rest of our stay  the floor was not vacuumed and the tub was not cleaned  Also  the used water glasses did not get switched the entire time   The aging of the room was very noticeable   The tub does not drain well   Air conditioning is loud  I slept with earplugs  so this wasn t a big problem for me  Overall  it isn t too bad  The cleanliness was the main reason for the lower rating  
P =>   A bit noisy but excellent value Stayed at Bills for   nights because of the reviews on here and it s location  As far as location and value for money it was excellent  For half the price of   room at a lot of other hotels  we got   rooms at Bills  meaning we didn t have to share with our teenage boys  Worth it just for that  Don t expect big flashy reception areas because they are non existent  You check in at a desk at the side of the casino and in the doorway of the restaurant  As another reviewer wrote on here  there is no security at the elevator nor keycard access to use the elevators  so anybody can just go strolling the halls  The traffic noise was quite loud given the hotel is right on the street  where a lot of newer ones are set back from the road  I used earplugs so problem alleviated  Admittedly  I m a light sleeper  as my sons said that this was not a problem for them  Beds were huge and very comfortable  Rooms were very spacious  Huge flatscreen TV  Bathroom was fine  Shower took ages to drain  but who cares  it meant that your feet got extra clean  Aircon in room was very loud  so we just kept the bathroom window open and didn t use the aircon  Overall  would I stay here again  Yes  The location was great  the rooms were great  We didn t spend much time in there anyway so if you want a mid strip location at a great price  it s definitely worth it  
P =>  superb hotel for little money right on the strip I would really recommend this place for a vacation in Las Vegas  It is right  nearly  on the strip for a price half of what you pay at the      hotels on the strip  the Bellagio fountains are across the street  which are really fantastic to watch  The room was spacious  clean  with a nice bathroom and big TV  we stayed there just one night with our family of four for only     USD  which was the cheapest hotel of our whole journey  And it was by far one of the best nights  It was a pity that we couldn t stay longer  but we would defenitely book this hotel again   
P =>  disappointed in changes We stayed at Bill s last year and decided to do it again this year        It has changed There was no security posted at the elevators at any time  day or night  We asked the front desk about it  amp  she shrugged  quot dunno quot  There are amenities I will live without  but lack of hotel security is not a luxury it is a necessity  No savings on a hotel room is worth risking your safety  
P => Bills Gambling Hall and Casino Staying here at Bills put us in the middle of the Strip among all of the Hotels and entertainment and a lot less expensive as it was excellent accommodations with no frills like swimming pools and fountains  Just comfortable and clean rooms to bed down in  casino if that s what you wanted to do  two restaurants and even a place at the door to buy discounted meals or entertainment for that day  Buses stop next door at the Flamingo and that is the best way to get up and down the strip or you can just walk  and walk and walk as we did  Getting checked in was hassle free so that we were up in our room in no time at all  Also if you have a car  parking was very convenient and you could use valet service or do your own parking  Would always consider this hotel if we ever return to Las Vegas  
P => Totally Awesome Really great hotel  half the price of the big players  situated right in the centre of the strip  Comfortable  clean rooms  and the best steakhouse in the world  as well as the best breakfasts in the world      
P =>   Great Place to stay  Don t get me wrong  I love the Vegas super resorts  they are outstanding and have their place  But these days  one of my big pet peeves with respect to Vegas it that it takes allot of time to do anything  Traffic and endless walking to your car room etc  cuts into your valuable limited Vegas time  So  what if you could stay in a clean  comfortable  older but nice room at a great price  and literally be   minutes from everything  Well  that is Bills  Again  the room is pretty basic  except for the     plasma TV on the wall  but the Stripside room views are amazing and you are   minutes from the lobby    minutes from the parking garage   minutes from the casino    minutes from restaurants and   minutes from the corner of Flamingo and Las Vegas Blvd  And  the location is the absolute center of the strip  so you can easily walk to most of the big strip hotels Another thing  no pool  but you can use the one at the flamingo  And  I would wager that the elevator ride walk from your room at bills is shorter than that from many of the rooms within the Flamingo So  if you are looking for fancy and new  look elsewhere  But if you come to Vegas for getting out and enjoying the action  consider Bills  
P =>   right down the Strip  small  Great location  great rooms  be it noisy at the back because of airconditioning    too big LCD       in the rooms  clean  cheap  comfortable  easy access to all the hotel and Srtip amenities  Skip staying at the       rooms hotels  and enjoy this small gem  
P =>   Awesome place great value great people I loved Bill s  everything about it was great  the location  the price  the staff  the restaurants      I would recommend it to anyone  The staff were so friendly and helpful  If you re staying in Vegas  you must stay at Bill s  Thank you for making our stay so great  Laura 
P =>   Central clean and inexpensive Vegas hotel This is a great place to stay for the price  The rooms are clean and up to date  The hotel is located almost dead center on the strip  so it makes a good home base for wandering  It is very small but I found this a plus  as it took only about a minute to get from the street to my room  We also caught part of the Big Elvis show which was decent  The only negative is that the hotel is themed as a wild west drinking saloon which can sometimes be a little obnoxious For roughly the same price or less you can stay at the Imperial Palace  but from what I ve heard it is not worth it  If you are on a budget  or don t plan on spending a lot of time in your hotel  stay at Bills  
P =>   Fabulous Value Hotel with great parking access   free If you are on a bit of a budget this is a great hotel  newly renovated  massive flat screen TV in room    good resturants  right on the corner of the strip and Flamingo Rd and best of all  excellent if you have a car  free multi storey car park with access straight out onto Flamingo Rd minutes from I      no negociating with one way back streets  Yes I know what everyone says but IT IS WELL WORTH getting a car and driving in Las Vegas is you are staying more than a couple of days  Driving on the strip is FINE and Fashion Show Mall and Town Square shopping etc have FREE car parks  Valley of Fire is about   hour away  Mount Chaleston about    mins and Grand Canyon about   hours  much cheaper than taking trips  Also if you stay at BILL s you can collect your car from Hertz desk in the FLAMINGO hotel next door  Don t forget to check out the Flamingo garden and pool s very posh and MYSTERE at Treasure Island is amazing  
P =>   Best Kept Secret We found Bill s on Trip Advisor and was very satisfied  Smaller is better when it comes to Las Vegas  Bills is right smack dab in the middle of everything   reminded me of the little old lady that wouldn t sell  The rooms were very clean and our view was great  Throw in Big Elvis  not so big anymore  and a good place to eat and you have it all  I cannot recommend it more    
P =>   Best value mid strip We ve previously spent a lot of time in Las Vegas with work and have stayed in quite a few on strip Hotels When we came to book a few days in uary in Vegas we were looking for somewhere cheap to stay on the strip and the rates at Bills Gambling Hall looked good I d previously visited the hotel when it was known as Barbary Coast and so knew it as an  quot old school quot  hotel compared with the likes of Paris or Luxor but it always seemed friendly and accommodating so I wasn t worried about booking  It s always a popular place as the parking is free  unlike some casinos The hotel is located right in the middle of the strip  next door to Ballys and Flamingo and opposite Bellagio  You can walk to any on strip casino within    minutes  location wise it s the most central of anywhere on the strip  Additionally  Rio and the Palms are only   mile up Flamingo  the road to the side of the hotel The check in staff were super efficient and our room was very clean and spacious with a large TV and king size bed  I had no complaints about the facilities other than I couldn t get a wifi connection as advertised  There are a couple of eating establishments in the casino  but given the central location you re never far away from somewhere to eat anyway  Apparently they also sell    frozen cocktails in the hotel  although we didn t see where The only complaint I would have is the noise  the rooms  in common with a lot of Vegas hotels  are not well soundproofed and given that the hotel is opposite the Bellagio you will hear the fountain music every    minutes until midnight if you choose to go to bed early  If you ve never been  Las Vegas is a noisy place and the weekday traffic will wake you at  am with horns and loud engines  As I said  this isn t a criticism of this hotel as such  I had the same experience staying in a top suite at New York New York Overall Bills Gambling Hall is a bargain for a few days in Vegas  Central location  good rooms and easy parking  
P =>  Location location location and nice hotel We stayed here in t     The location cannot be beat  You are right in the heart of the strip and within walking distance to most anywhere you want to go  We had an incredible view of the strip from our window including a partial view of the Bellagio fountains  the Eiffel Tower  and Paris balloon  Very cool The hotel itself is older  but it is very clean and updated  Our room had a nice flat screen tv and a very comfy bed  This hotel also has room service and that was very good and reasonably priced  The staff were nice The casino could be hit or miss  One night we had an excellent waitress and we had drinks every time she went by us  which was fairly quick  On two other nights though  we had to wait a fairly long time for drinks  You cannot get bottle beer here  but the mixers were pretty good  For gambling and drinks  I would suggest popping around the corner  towards IP  and checking out Casino Royale  The drinks there were cheap and strong with a choice of bottle beer  Michelob  for     which is    elsewhere on the strip  The waitresses were always on top of things here too  Also  you can get in on the free play promo pulls outside the casino that were fun You can use the pool across the street at the Flamingo too  which is a very nice pool garden area to visit  When we went to their  we just vegged in loungers most of the time and enjoyed the yummy slushie drinks that the waitresses brought around  It was probably the most  quot vegged quot  we were while on our VK  Overall  this is a very nice hotel with a very reasonable price and it is located in a great spot on the strip  I would definitely stay here again and recommend this hotel to family and friends 
P => Comfort at Bill s Bills had the best comfy beds ever  Very big room although the drainage in the bathroom  amp  toilet was fairly slow  Smaller shower area  This wasn t that big of an issue since we weren t in our room that much  Nice big screen television Check in was a breeze   in and out of the hotel with ease   and there was always security by the elevators in the evening so felt super safe The casino was smaller than most but we didn t spend much time in there  It was sometimes fairly  quot warm quot  but they did serve good hotdogs and    cent margaritas  Also Bill s is the location where the shows go on sale in the morning for     price so was really handy to be able to grab tickets Extremely central location   we walked everywhere  Wonderful restaurants nearby   PF Changs  Planet Hollywood   Batistas Hole in the Wall  Italian   all the wine you can drink included with your meal   Jimmy Buffet s garitaville Volcano Nachos are the best  
P =>  Great location good rooms The hotel location is great  right at the center of the Strip  Rooms are also very neat and clean  Overall it was a very good stay for couple of nights at the hotel  best value for the money  I checked in on Friday evening no big lines at the front desk   The bathing tub was clogged  they sent over service to fix it but even after spending more than half an hour he could not clear the clogging  Mattresses were very comfortable but were making little noise  
P =>  Bill s is still pretty good Bill s is small and very old school and since Harrah s has taken over  the rooms and housekeeping have continued to go downhill  I was told it was  quot budget cuts  quot  I thought that the room needed a deep cleaning  The front desk was nice and helpful  If you re the kind of person that gets lost trying to the find the elevators or have trouble remembering which wing of the hotel you re in  this is a great place  This is a good hotel for convenience and location  If you don t mind it being a little run down it s great  
P =>  A real gem on the strip Bill s is a must stay  The location is fantastic right next to Bally s  near Caesar s Palace and the Paris and I could see an angled view of the Bellagio fountains from our room  It was about a   minute walk  with stops  to that Fashion mall at the top of the strip but you could always catch the Deuce We had a room with a king size bed and have no complaints whatsoever about the room it was fantastic  Big tv  comfortable bed  no noise  no smoke smell  we stayed in a non smoking room   shower had great pressure and was warm  The only minor problem was that when you had a shower all the precipitation caused the floor to get really wet so I recommend leaving a window open As for the casino we only did the penny slots which weren t fantastic and only got offered free drinks twice  I d go elsewhere for gambling Don t stay anywhere else  Bill s is perfect and you ll save lots of money because the room is cheap compared to others and you re close to everything Oh and on a side note  if you are going to the grand canyon book it online because it is cheaper  And another thing get an all day pass and ride the roller coaster at New York New York it was AWESOME  
P =>  Definitely not the joker in the pack  We have just returned from a   night stay at Bills over New Year and are convinced that it is the Strip s best kept secret  I booked on the strength of reports here and because it is small and low rise and mid Strip  It was perfect for us  It was our eighth trip to Vegas and we have stayed in various hotels including the Venetian and Aladdin  Bill s is not in the themed luxury bracket but there is absolutely nothing wrong with the rooms and we will be staying there again  The only things which would have improved it would have been an in room safe and coffee tea facilities  We used the safety deposit facility at the Cashier s desk which is free but they ask for a     cash deposit which is refunded when the key is turned in  We were lucky enough to get a side view of the fountains at no extra cost  but New Year s Eve was triple the price anyway    from room      The room was bigger than I expected with plenty of space for storage  The bathroom space is small but adequate and I was glad to see a bath as pacing up and down the Strip all day needs a bath to soak in at the end of the day  Something we didn t get at Excalibur  The window in the bathroom was great but obviously made it noisy when left open  Generally we did not find it too noisy to sleep  The TV was huge  Parking was easy too as we arrived on Flamingo Road from the Hoover Dam direction and there is a multi storey car park which is clearly visible  Check in and out was easy with no queue which is rare in Vegas  The staff were all courteous and friendly  The carpets in the casino part have seen better days but that didn t worry us as we are not gamblers  Big Elvis is worth watching and there was another live band who were very good  The   c garitas were also very nice Couldn t fault it despite my initial reservations that it may be a bit tatty and attract the wrong sort  Sadly the nature of Vegas attracts all walks of life   some undesirable  but we did not encounter any hookers or obvious  low life  We did not use any other facilities there but will definitely use Bill s on our next visit  assuming the price is still competetive  
P =>  Perfect location good value for money Bill s Hotel sits right opposite the Bellagio and Caesars Palace  but is much cheaper   we paid      tax for a night  Room was standard business hotel type  but with a large tv  Car parking is free  and right next to the hotel 
P =>   Great Stay for Rodeo Finals We read the reviews for Bill s and decided to take a chance  It was great and priced affordably  Our room was spacious and had a view of the fountains across the street  Location made everything accessible  Our trip was to attend the Rodeo Finals and a taxi was right there at the door for use  The    cent garitas     Hot dogs  and Elvis Entertainment add to the experience  We did find catching the bus to Fremont Street was a best bet for souvenirs which are half the cost or more of those in the strip area  also you can eat for less and there is a great light show  We would go that route first before buying down around the large Casinos  Being our  st trip to Vegas for   of us we felt Bill s was a good deal  The only dislike I had was the push for the Time Share Tour at the door  which we took but instead of the   hours stated it took about   hours  not worth the tickets we received for attending  Way too long and to much of a sales  quot I won t let you go sales pitch quot   Other then that we enjoyed our stay and the National Rodeo Finals  Would stay at Bill s again for sure  
P =>   Great Location but    We have been staying at Bill s since it was Barbary Coast  LOVED Barbary Coast  but since Harrah s has taken over  the rooms and housekeeping have gone downhill  We were just there   days  tipped housekeeping  and still only got   shampoo     had to go to the front desk and ask for another bottle  Was told it was  quot budget cuts  quot  Felt that the room needed deep cleaning  The front desk was so nice and helpful  Another thing that Harrah s has added are timeshare people right by the guest elevator  I don t like that On a positive note  we love the fact that you can fly in  take a cab to the hotel and be in your room in about    minutes  There is never a line to check in and the elevator is maybe    feet from the front desk  This time we rented a car and parked right by the elevator which brought you into the casino and was just a few steps from the elevator to take you to your room  If you re the kind of person that gets lost trying to the find the elevators or have trouble remembering which wing of the hotel you re in  this is a great place Bottom line  this is a great hotel for convenience and location  If you don t mind it being a little run down  we think they re letting it go and plan to tear it down and add to the Flamingo or something   it s great  We will continue to stay there as long as we can  
P =>  Excellent location and value  I travelled for   years with GM and stayed in Vegas many times at the better hotels  Now I am retired and paying my own way The hotel is excellent for value and second to none for location The room was very  very clean and while we were facing Bally s we could also see the fountains at Bellagio  At night there were sirens but this was not an issue  We slept the whole night uninteruppted  We were there   nights The food in both the Victorian room and Bill s Steakhouse were excellent It was no issue to check in and there was plenty of free parking Next time we go  this is where you will find me  
P =>  Great location Just returned from    days in Vegas  This was our first trip here and we trusted tripadvisor for its reviews for all aspects we decided on Bills Gamblin Hall due to its largely positive reviews for price and location and we were not dissapointed The hotel room was very spacious and we had a large LCD TV on the wall  not that we used it much   The view from the room lokked onto the Eiffel Tower and we could just see the Bellagio Fountains  as a note they now ask you if you wish to upgrade to a  view  room for     a night  Used to be free  All in all you can t beat this place for location and after walking round some of the bigger hotels i was happy we chose Bills as the big hotels must take half a day for check in The staff were friendly and helpfull and i would definetely stay here again  
P =>  Best bargain on the Strip If you re looking for a hotel that s smack bang in the middle of the Strip  without the fancy name and price that goes with it  then this is the place  We heard about it through some friends  and we can t stop thanking them for their advice Bill s is located on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd and East Flamingo Rd  On the other corners are Ceasars Palace  the Bellagio and Bally s  and they are all joined by overhead walkways The rooms are huge  compared to some  and are clean and tastefully decorated  While most rooms have a great view of the Strip  ours was on the Flamingo side  but hey  who spends most of their time in a hotel room in Vegas  unless you re on your honeymoon    There was also a security guard at the ground floor elevator  to make sure that only guests are given access to the rooms  A great idea While the hotel may not be huge  no  of rooms   it makes up for it in service  Check in was quick  and we didn t have to wait long for a table in the Steakhouse Restaurant for dinner  All of the staff were friendly  and more than willing to answer any questions  All guests have access to the pool at the Flamingo next door  and the monorail station is also located behind the Flamingo  There is also a Duece bus stop close by  This bus allows you to travel up and down the Strip for       over a   hr period  Great Value When we go back to Vegas  we will definitely be staying at Bill s  
P =>   Fantastic absolutley loved it I stayed here for   nights and it was fantastic  the room was large and very clean and the staff helpful and friendly  especially Donny the bellhop  As mentioned before this hotel is in a great location and easy to get to and from the room  Check in took   minutes  I played only the machines in the casino and whilst playing the cocktail waitresses came round frequently  The    hotdogs are good as are the   cent margaritas   A bit too good   I would definatley reccomend this hotel to anyone and will stay again next time I am in Vegas  
P =>   great spot to stay We booked this location through Allegiant Air  out of Bellingham  WA  The price included air and hotel  We were not disappointed  Yes  it is an older hotel and small compared to others on the strip  Some of our group stayed at the Imperial Palace and had a    minute walk from their room to get to the strip  where we only had a   minute walk from our room to the strip  We also could see the Bellagio fountains from our window Another bonus is that we were central and the overhead walkways to Bally s and Caesars are right at the corner where Bill s is  As others have mentioned  it is noisey at night  but we just turned the fan for the a c on and it was fine Best deals are the    cent margarita and the       hot dogs  Don t miss them We didn t eat at Bill s We had read about the food at Ellis Island Casino and went there for their excellent breakfast        for   oz  steak and eggs breakfast special was a deal We also went up to the Peppermill Restaurant  just before the Riviera  for breakfast  Great food and large portions  but not quite the deal as Ellis Island We were going to try the Battista s Hole in the Wall  just behind Bill s  but never made it there  Again  I had read that it was a great value  The price is now        for spaghetti which includes soup and salad and all the wine you want  Other pasta dishes were        and         again including soup  salad and wine  We will try it next time we are in LV We would definitely stay at Bill s again  
P =>   A great comfortable hotel Discovered Bill s casino last year on a girl s weekend and enjoyed the atmosphere of the casino so much we decided to actually stay at Bill s this year Rooms were comfortable and clean with plenty of space  Casino staff were friendly and helpful  Any request we had were efficiently handled by pleasant staff  Donny  the bellman  was most helpful from storing our bags  hailing a cab  giving advise and especially with a friendly  quot How are the Ladies today  quot  Use of the Flamingo s pool was a nice bonus  Walked through many of the big hotels and were shocked at the lineups at the registration desks  Bill s was quick and easy  The hotel is small enough that the staff knew you and we felt safe  After a long night it felt like coming home We would not recommend the Victoria Dining Room though  food was terrible and the staff was less than keen to do anything about it  I guess they figure at     AM they can serve anything and people will eat it  Will be staying at Bill s again for our yearly pilgrimage to Vegas  
P =>   Great location great value As with all the hotels on our American Tour  Bill s Gamblin  Hall  amp  Saloon was chosen after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor We were not disappointed and the hotel lived up to its highly recommended reputation  On previous visits to Las Vegas  I ve stayed at really big hotels like the MGM Grand and Caesars Palace and of course they are very impressive  But does one want to queue in an airline style line of    people or more to check in  No  Bill s is big enough to be fun but small enough to be able to walk a few paces from the entrance to the reception and be checked in immediately We arrived by rental car  Dollar   very good   and drove into the hotel car park where the guy in charge was most welcoming and said it was no problem to leave our car right there with him till we had checked in and then gave us directions to the Dollar car drop off  which was very conveniently situated immediately opposite  at the Bellagio Hotel The check in staff were courteous and friendly and our rooms were excellent  Furnished in heavy Victorian style in keeping with the theme of the place and very large and comfortable  We were also able to see the amazing fountain performances on the lake in front of The Bellagio from our bedroom window The location of this hotel is first class   right on the strip with The Bellagio opposite and The Flamingo next door  Also useful that the nearest station for the Strip Monorail is at The Flamingo and it s well worth buying a day pass for this as it takes you to seven hotel locations along the strip  Each hotel is also the dropping off point for several other hotels but don t be fooled       they are NOT all close by  We got off for example at The Sands which is the station for The Stratosphere and it s a good half mile walk from there   The rides at The Stratosphere are awesome   as the locals would say  We ate both in Bill s Steak Restaurant and The Victorian Restaurant and the meals were excellent All in all  we were very pleased with this hotel and it s great for a few days in Las Vegas   one can lose money at Bill s just as easily as any other place However  if we had wanted a location with a nice pool scene to laze around   between losing money   then maybe one of the larger hotels with those facilities would be a more suitable choice  
P =>   Great for a short break The best thing about Bill s is the location   right in the middle of the strip within walking distance of the well known attractions  It s also much smaller than the giant hotels like the Bellagio etc  and nothing like as grand which suited us  Our room was fine and well furnished if a little small by Las Vegas standards  The staff are generally friendly and the  free  valet parking worked a treat  We had a couple of meals in the cheaper of the two restaurants and found food  amp  service quite good  The rates seem to vary dramatically depending on the day of the week   if you are happy to avoid weekends there are big savings to be made  
P =>   GREAT place for gamblin  We didn t stay at Bill s but spent a few days over our last weekend trip at Bill s playing black jack  It was GREAT   the dealers were nice  the facility was clean  and the table limits were low  It was just a fun  low pressure atmosphere for gamblin  in the middle of the Strip  
P =>   One Night Stand After reading the reviews here we decided to try Bills  Our normal location in LV is the Luxor  but we thought we d try staying closer to the center of the strip  something we haven t done since Harrah s was Holiday Inn  We had gambled at Bills  before it was Bills  and knew it was a small casino hotel  We did like the fact that it was within walking distance of Battista s and Ba Ba Reeba  two of our favorite restaurants in LV We stayed one night and transferred to the Luxor The room was fairly clean  very noisy  and cold  If you know what short sheeting is and are over   feet tall like I am you will also understand that I had a very uncomfortable night  I am a light sleeper and with the amount of noise coming from the street and other casinos sleeping was a lost cause In the bathroom  over one end of the tub shower  very low water pressure  there was a small stained glass window that wouldn t close correctly and it was the reason the room was noisy and cold  Taking a shower was a chilling experience to say the least The hotel was smokey  Really smokey  The filtration system must be inadequate or non existent  and I don t like being in that environment  My wife is allergic to nicotine and was really miserable  A problem we do not have at the Luxor  or other casinos We found both restaurants to be very expensive  especially for an older hotel  We never did eat there  just looked at the prices on the menus and left  When we checked in we asked for a coffee pot  which the young lady behind the counter assured us would be delivered  It never came Not recommended if you enjoy comfort when staying in a hotel The two times I dealt with counter personnel  checking in and out  I was impressed with their courtesy and speed  On a side note  If you like trivia and Irish cuisine visit Mc Mullan s Irish Pub  which is on Tropicana  on Tuesday night  Great food  great fun  
P =>  Great deal old school Vegas We stayed at Bills during the SEMA show  It was ideal for practical people like us  Great Location  cheap drinks  great          hr  prime rib  clean room with big plasma and it was so easy to get to our room  Step off the street  show your key to security and up a couple floors and we were in our room  Our room overlooked the corner of LV Blvd and Flamingo the center of the strip  We had a great view of the Bellagio fountains too    nights with all taxes  and   movies    days internet charge cost us      out the door       The service was excellent  We had a coffee pot in the room that saved us alot of frustration in the morning  all the coffee shops have lines early   There are two great shows close by at the Flamingo that took exactly   mins to walk to from our room to the show  X burlesque and George Wallace   Bellagio  Paris  Balleys and Planet Hollywood were close enough to walk to for a fancy dinner and other shows  But do yourself a favor and get the prime rib special at Bills  It took less time than a fast food place and frankly the steak had the best taste of any we had in Vegas  Oh yes  use the monorail for your longer trips  We used it everyday to get to the SEMA show at the convention center    mins of actual train time   The station is right next door at the Flamingo  total walk time from our room   mins   If you wany opulence and chic chic  Bil s aint your place  But if you want a clean convenient hotel with outstanding service Stay at Bills  Some Bills facts    Canned beer       at the Bar    free entertainment in the open type lounge everyday  Big Elvis in the late afternoon and later in the eve a band     there are    blackjack tables   their coupon book has a two for one drink coupon and a    blackjack bet coupon    there is a half price show tickets box office  you can buy show tickets for about any show on the strip not really half price but about        less than internet prices    wireless or cabled internet costs        a day   movies          don t go for your prime rib early eve because the place will be packed   no fridge in the room   good bathroom stuff   Bring your fancy clothes and go out one night at a chic chic place   but leave pretencienceness at home and stay at Bills  
P =>  Bill s is the place for me  Really enjoyed staying at Bill s  Easy to check in and out  Older but nice rooms  quiet and small enough that you didn t spend your life on an elevator  Right in the middle of the strip close to everything  Can use the pool at Flamigo next door  I d go back  
P =>  Best Vegas Trip Ever We have never really had any luck with our Vegas vacations  We usually get bored or wind up staying at the wrong hotel or try to do too many things  But  this time we did it right  We arrived Monday afternoon and stayed until Thursday afternoon  which proved to be the perfect duration  Bill s Gamblin  Hall  amp  Saloon is right in the center of The Strip  sandwiched between Bally s and the Flamingo and across from Caesar s Palace  It only cost about     night but had a flat panel TV  large room  two comfortable beds  and shares the Flamingo s pool  one of the best in Vegas  It also wasn t a huge trek to get from our room to the outdoors  which has been our experience with past Vegas hotel casinos  The bar had    margaritas  which are pretty rare now on The Strip  and our room had a fantastic view of the Bellagio fountains and Paris Eiffel Tower  We saw Elton John s  quot The Red Piano quot  at Caesar s Palace  so the location was perfect for that  We dined at Ah Sin at Paris for the sushi  prior to the show  and it was a fantastic meal  The whole trip was great and we re looking forward to returning  
P =>  Great price Great location right in the middle of the strip    couldn t get better location   opposite Cesars  Bellagio and Ballys  Great price nice big room with   beds  plenty of rom for suitcases etc  big flat screen tv  Friendly staff   good price on meals especailly breakfast cheap drinks and nice small casino with Fat Elvis singing for free Good choice as you can visit all the other flash hotels without paying the price  lt  lt and flamingo nest door with nice garden with real flamingos if you need to escape the smoke and noise   
P => First time in Vegas Enjoyed Bills but would try somewhere else next time  The room was lovely and quite big  But the street noise at night was pretty bad  Guess it s our own fault for going to bed too early  But on your first time in Vegas like us   you ll walk none stop looking at everything and be exhausted by night time We enjoyed the buffet at Harrahs followed by the Legends Show  Definately see a show of some sort while in Vegas   it was the highlight If i ever went back i d stay at one of the nicer hotels with pools etc and live it up a little  And spend less time looking at everything  
P =>  Love This Place    This is the place to stay when in Las Vegas  Check in was fast and the bellman  Mike  made me feel right at home  As everyone else has said the location is excellent  I stayed in RM      where we had an excellent view of the Belligio fountains and the Effiel tower  It can be a little noisy because of the traffic but I live in the city so it didn t bother me  But I did notice that the air con is very loud   I ate at the Victorian Room  the service was good but the food is OK  I found Ellis Island Casino  that is a block off the strip  sells a   oz steak and egg breakfast until      am for       and it was good  We ate there during most of our stay I love seeing Big Elvis and you can t beat the price of cocktails at Bill s  I gambled at Bill s and found the dealers to be very good and some of them a lot of fun We would defintely stay at Bill s again  
P =>   Great stay for the price We stayed here for   nights in tember We were given a room on the  rd floor  overlooking the Strip  We had a great view of the fountains at the Bellagio  although hearing the same music for the fountains every day gets a little tiresome   The room was large  with a    quot  television and a nice comfy bed  There was also an additional seating area with a table and chairs The location of Bills is fantastic  right on the strip  and no large casino to walk through every day There is a little desk in the casino near to the elevators which sells drinks and snacks  and a Western Union counter which sells stamps for your postcards home We noticed a little noise in the room when we were trying to sleep  but this is to be expected staying on the middle of the Strip in Vegas We ate breakfast one morning in the Victoria room restuarant  the food was good and cheap We would definately stay at Bills again  even if only for a night or two  before moving to a hotel which is a bit more luxurious Before we arrived at Bills  we noticed on their website that the room rate had decreased since we had booked our room  I emailed them and they agreed for us to be charged the new room rate and would refund the difference in the amount we had already paid  which they did upon checkout  Definately asking if the same happens to you  
P =>  Great hotel  What I liked about on top of its super convenient location and good price is that you don t have to walk miles from the strip to reach your room like other giant hotels  You would really appreciate this when you are with your old parents  Also  this hotel has gone through a make over recently as the ownership changed from Barbary coast  which resulted in rooms and hallways so new and clean This hotel would be our first choice if we come back to Las Vegas  
P =>   Top location Can t add any more than what everyone else has put Great location  big rooms  king size bed  big TV  Air con is a bit noisy though Didn t have to queue to check in or out  Free parking at the adjacent multi story  Security guard checks that users of the lifts are carrying keycards If you want a hotel in a top location but don t want the pretentiousness of other Vegas hotels  Bill s is a great place to stay  
P =>   great stuff As most of the revievs suggested this hotel was spot on Ideally situated right in the centre of the strip rooms clean etc Had a couple of meals in the hotel had to wait   mins  but same in other hotels So I would say hotel very good value for the money you pay  
P =>  Great time Bills is what it is  Simple and clean  Excellent location  Large comfy room with amazing plasma TV  We had wonderful strip view of Paris and Bellagio fountains  not that we in room too much Special mention to the    corona stall in the entrance  And Big Elvis  We enjoyed both of these        a bit too much  
P =>   Great place  Bill s gambling hall is a perfect place to stay It t in the middle of the Strip  in front of the Bellagio Hotel and Caesars Palace The hotel has very big rooms with a mega plasma screen  The rooms are clean and you get new towels every day  The hotel has no swimming pool  but you can use the pool in the Flamingo hotel  neighbor hotel  for free  This pool is huge  very beautiful en clean  what an experience  There is a restaurant where you can get a breakfast  not free  this is very good A perfect place for a perfect price  
P =>   It is what it is  We picked this from a variety of choices offered on USAirway s Vacations section after looking at TripAdvisor  The reviews for Bill s Gamblin  Hall  amp  Saloon were good and the USAir price was right  Check in and check out were quick and efficient  The rooms were on the street which has been described as noisy but with the AC on I was not bothered by the outside noise  The rooms were large and of somewhat dated decor but they were comfortable with plenty of room for luggage and we did not feel cramped  The closet was in the bathroom which had a pocket door  There was a separate room with the toilet and tub  My greatest criticism was that the shower head was positioned for a child and not an adult  Yes  there was the smell of smoke but after walking through the casinos and common areas of any Las Vegas hotel you realize that it is difficult to escape cigarette smoke there  Even though the room did not have a refrigerator it had an iron and ironing board and a call to housekeeping brought a coffee maker as well  We ate several times in the Victorian Room  I had only breakfast and even though service was just adequate my breakfast was among the best I have had anywhere  As others have pointed out the location across the street from the Bellagio  Caesar s Palace  Paris etc  is unbeatable and what you pay for that location is a real bargain  
P =>   Great value hotel We really enjoyed staying at Bills for   nights in ober  The check in is quick  no queues   the rooms are a great size with huge plasma TV and we got a view of the fountains too  The casino itself is small so it is easy to get around and get to and from your room to the Strip  Couldn t ask for a better position on the Strip and it is fantastic value for money  We also ate at the Steakhouse and enjoyed the cosy atmosphere and excellent food and service  I would recommend staying at Bills if you are looking for great value and position but not if you want the glitz and extras of the more well known hotels  
P =>   Service Luke warm I think I was more dissappointed because of all the wonderful reviews I read on Trip Advisor  Up until this stay  Trip advisor has never steered me wrong  Bill s is a comparitively small hotel  nestled between the Flamingo and Bally s  I can t complain about the speed of check in or check out as we never had to wait  and I will say that Donny  the bell hop was personable  However  everything else about this hotel was average  at best  The service was poor to average  I don t think anyone  other than Donny  ever smiled the whole time we were there  The room was  quot okay quot  and it wasn t dirty  but it just wasn t spectacular  Our first night when I removed a wash cloth from a shelf above my head  I was showered with cards  those nudie cards they hand out on the strip  which had been carefully placed by someone in the staff  I assume  Since the hotel has only   floors the noise from the strip was continuous  day and night  The dealers and cocktail waitresses were average  If you are looking for an outstanding vacation in Vegas  I suggest you stay somewhere else  I know I will next time  
P =>   Best deal in Vegas I have been going to Vegas for the past    years and this by far is the best deal in town if you do not need all the fluff  I have stayed at Wynn s Paris MGM just to name a few  The price was very inexpensive compared to many other places and the resturant  quot Bill s Steak House  quot  was top shelf in all aspects  The service came with a smile and the rooms were clean and friendly  this is located right on the las vegas strip across from Bally and Cesars   I would stay again in a second  Forget the fluff other places give you   Hey they even asked me if I was a senior citizen when I called and and gave me a discount  the big casinos could have cared less  GO FOR IT  
P =>   Convenient and cheap we wanted a relatively cheap hotel on the strip and thats what it is  it is right in the middle of everything  there wasnt a wait at the front desk our room was nice and clean  big flat panel tv  the ac and heater worked very well  nice hot water  and we even had a view of the bellagio fountain shows the casino is small and the food wasnt great but you can get that elsewhere  
P =>   Biill s is always my first choice I stayed at Bill s            my third stay  Bill s is always my first choice The good news  excellent location mid strip across the street from Caesar s Palace and Bellagio  large  clean rooms  plasma TV  free lounge show  Big Elvis   good friendly service  excellent housekeeping  comfortable beds  small hotel allowing quick access to your room  good security  very reasonable rates  Overall  you get huge bang for your buck at Bill s The bad news  shower drain was very slow  air conditioner was a bit too loud Be aware that Bill s has no pool but if you want to swim you get free access to the pool at Flamingo next door  Just bring your key card with you  
P =>  The Pros and Cons of Bill s in a Nutshell Plenty of good  thorough reviews on this site    enough for you to see that Bill s is a good bet for your stay in Las Vegas  Here s my take on things  from my   night stay in t       The Pros    Yes  great location    you don t have to walk for days to get from your room to the casino or the street    you will thanks yourself for this   Unpretentious    I always felt like I could go and hang downstairs because the crowd was mellow and never too much   Great rooms    for     nt Sun Thurs  you get a big room with plenty of space and great  comfortable clean beds   Room service    found this to be excellent  food was good   TV    the huge flat screen was a plusThe Cons    The room didn t have a coffee maker and there was no mini fridge  mini bar  or other amenities  The soaps and shampoos where nice  but I had to ask at one point to be re filled    no biggie   The cable TV selection was average and the pay per view movie selection sucked  in my opinion    just your usual mainstream fare  The porn was so so  not much variety    Internet connection worked but it was        per day  and was only dial up    you should probably find a way to hook up wireless    The nearest liquor store was a good    minute walk away  but room service does sell over priced bottles On the whole  a very good bet for anyone  could very well be the best deal in town for a solid  no frills  comfortable Las Vegas trip  
P =>  Great hotel great location For the budget minded  this was a great hotel  Great location  You dont have to walk and walk and walk to get to the hotel lobby  Missed the little things like makeup mirror  in room safe  larger bathroom area  Bed was comfortable  large tv and that view    We stayed in room     and you can take pics of The Eiffel Tower  Bally s and Bellagio s fountains  Keep the a c on you can deal with the street noise  Enjoy the Victorian Room for breakfast  They are open      but we chose to have dinner at other hotels for variety Small casino compared to hotels on strip Hotel staff very pleasant  Would stay there again  
P =>  You won t blow all your bill  on Bill s  I know I am repeating the other reviews but the location of Bill s is fantastic  slap bang in the middle of the strip and its great value  The rooms are very large and clean  It s not as big or extravagant as some of the hotels and doesn t have a pool but is a great place to stay  When I booked directly with the hotel I requested a strip view room from which we could see the Bellagio fountains  and a view of the Eiffel Tower  which was great at night The staff were very helpful and friendly  Didn t eat at the restaurant as it was always very busy  The casino has all the same slots and tables as any of the others just on a smaller scale Bill s has a free multi story car park which was a great as we arrived by car and needed to unload the luggage  It was quite busy but managed to find a space ok I would definitely recommend staying at Bill s to anyone and everyone  
P => Great location great value clean rooms I would stay again  My husband and I stayed at Bills for   nights t    to           We paid       for the Thurs and        for Sat  amp  Sun nights  I booked directly through Bill s website about   weeks before the trip  I was very pleased to see that the reviews I read at trip adviser  for the most part were consistent with our experience  The room was very clean  not hugely luxurious  but spacious  clean  in good repair and comfortable  The bed and pillows were very comfortable  The room was quiet  our room faced the back of the hotel   The hotel is small by Vegas standards  but this was nice because you could get up and down from the room quickly  We did not use the pool  so I can t comment about that  The location of the hotel was excellent  very conveniently located in the middle of the strip  close to the deuce  bus  stop and pedways over the strip  The     margaritas in the casino are a good bargain  so are the    hot dogs  We are not big gamblers so did not play at all in that casino  The staff in th hotel were friendly and helpful  The only down side of our stay was the food at the hotel  we ate at the Victorian room and the service and food were very poor  My husband had the beef dip and said that it was OK  I had the turkey burger and it was very bad  the coleslaw was really bad The food in general we found to be expensive and not great during our stay in vegas  Don t go to the buffet at the Stratosphere  the food was not good  The buffet at the Paris was pretty good  lots of selection for        but certainly not amazing  
P =>   Best value on the strip What a location  right accross from Bellagio and cesars Old world style casion  Rooms are spotless and well appointed and absolutely spotless Would recommend this place if you ave a budget  
P =>  Great location on the strip Bills is right in the heart of the strip on the corner opposite Bellagio and Caesars Palace and Ballys  Its not one of the flashiest hotels  but the rooms are clean  well sized  and good value for money Overall I would certainly stay here again   but if youre after a romantic getaway and a bit of a splurge  then I would not recommend  this is more of a cheap option while away with friends   
P =>   Great hotel great deal great location  Bill s is a fantastic little place and is ideally located in the middle of the strip opposite Caesars Palace  It has a great atmosphere and contrasts well against the glitz and glamour of the big hotels  I have stayed in Caesar s Palace previously and much as I would recommend it for the experience  if you can get a good deal   Bill s is much less intimidating and has an air of  normality  about it  The minimum bets are low and therefore makes the gambling more fun and accessible for those who just want to have a  flutter   The drinks are the most reasonably priced that we found and the    hot dogs were delicious  Big Elvis  show happens every afternoon in the bar area and is well worth watching if you have a spare hour We arrived ahead of check in but they looked after our bags while we had a drink and we were able to go to our room less than an hour later  The room was clean and comfortable with a flat screen tv on the wall  The view of the strip was fantastic including the Bellagio fountains  It would have been nice to have coffee making facilities in the room  but otherwise I would struggle to find any fault  It was the bargain of the century and I d definitely stay there again  
P =>   bills gamblin booked threw expedia had a non smoker no problemo  staff very friendly even the bellman     inch tv in the room  nice great food close to everything as said before      enjoyed the flamingo nest store for the breakfast buffet   tried to see it all in   days oh my aching feet    went to fremont street  that place will blow your wig   saw the show girls at ballys very nice show great sets and took in another show forget where had impersonators also very very good 
P =>   Fantasic value for money Bill s is right in the heart of Downtown strip  Ballys is opposite and it is on the cross road with Bellagio and Caesars Palace  Flamingo is right next door  There is a coffee house in the casino and although it is a small casino hotel it is worth the trip  The staff are very friendly  all of the usual table slots are in house and the food drinks are really cheap  The entertainment was quite good with something on everynight which is free to watch as there is no cover charge in the lounge  Big Elvis is a must see as this guy is fantastic  The Victorian room does food   hrs a day and has a choice of normal day to day stuff like chicken with chips etc or they also do a chinese menu which is really good  The steakhouse in Bills is FANTASTIC  Be careful if ordering medium though as in America that is really pink   Again you might pay a bit more for dining in the steakhouse but it is well worth it  They also do margarita cocktails for    and hotdogs   hrs a day for    which is handy for a snack  Since Bills is really central you can walk to pretty much any of the major Vegas attractions but Would suggest that the local bus service is used to go to Stratosphere Freemont experience as that is a good couple of miles away  Only issue we have with Bills is the plumbing   the chain for the flush on the toilet kept coming loose but by the  rd day we knew how to fix it ourself  The baths do fill up quickly and take a bit of time to drain when your having a shower  Apart from the plumbing the Hotel is fantastic      Also be warned you will not get into the lift for the rooms if you do not show your room key to security  Keep it in your wallet  
P =>   Brilliant hotel perfectly situated   Highly recommend I ve just come back from a   week holiday in Vegas  we stayed in Bill s Gamblin  Hall  amp  Saloon which I can not fault in anyway The hotel and casino were very clean  the rooms spacious with comfy beds  Checking in was a dream no queing or hanging around  The staff were in the main friendly  helpful and I couldn t fault the service we received The hotel itself is perfectly placed for exploring the strip or doing any of the must do trips They have free shows on every evening Big Elvis and a band who were on the first week were both really good  Big Elvis is a must for anyone visiting Vegas   nice bloke The hotel do have their own restaurant which is a lot smaller than other surronding hotels but again I can t fault what we had    I had a    oz T Bone  which was under        and I reckon it was probably the best steak I ve  and I ve had quite a few    The beer in the hotel  Bud  Bud Lite and Bud Lite Lime  was the cheapest on the strip and you can get a beer and a hot dog for only       If you want to soak up the sun  you can use the neighbouring Flamingo hotels pool   the pool was really nice  not suitable for swimming but plenty of loungers and they supply the towels  so there s no chance of Germans comendeering all the loungers   I totally recommend Bill s Gamblin  Hall  amp  Saloon if you want a break or a longer stay in Vegas  give this one the once over  
P =>   Cracking location and cheap Chose Bill s because of the reviews on Tripadvisor  and we weren t disappointed  Rooms are very large and clean  King size beds just huge and    quot  Plasma TV  Shame that American TV channels are just rubbish  How many time do I need to see Sarah Palin s speech at the Rebulican Convention     MILF   Had an unobstructed view of the Bellagio Fountains from my room       and the Eiffel Tower  However  there is one problem with Bill s  Becasue of the great location on the strip  it can be noisy if you are trying to get a decent nap but who goes to Vegas to sleep We would stay here again if when we go back to Vegas  
P =>   Nice Place After reading many reviews for Bill s on this site we decided to give it a try  This was our  th trip to Las Vegas  we took our daughter down for her   st birthday  We stayed         Check in was a breeze  asked for a view and got one no problem  The rooms were very comfortable  nice bed and TV  The bathrooms were fine  had read some posts that they were small  not so bad  A little noisy from the street  run the fan and all OK  The best part of Bill s is the size and location  You can be down to the casino or dead center strip in minutes  You have use of the Flamingo s pool  easy walk to the pool which is very nice and was busy Saturday   The casino had a friendly atmosphere with reasonable prices       margarita s were a big hit with the wife and daughter  Drinks were reasonable with   for   coupons handed out like candy  Big Elvis was great  even though Big Elvis is not so big anymore  good for him  Gamblin was fine  crap tables lively and friendly  Food O K in the Victorian room  did not try the steak house  Walk down to Ellis Island for a great cheap dinner  All in all a nice place with very good rates  Will definitely try this place again  
P =>   Fantastic Gem in great situation This was our first time since Bill s had changed from the Barbary Coast The only difference we noticed was the addition of a huge flat screen tv in each room very nice We stayed on the third floor which is the smokers floor so if you smoke that s where you ll be The room was lovely very clean and comfortable especially the bed The great thing about Bills is its right in the heart of the strip No long walk to elevators  and loads of staff so you re not waiting long for much We ate in our room for breakfast the stack of pancakes and syrup is to die for In the evening we ate in the Victoria room which does brilliant steaks and salmon and other tasty dishes While we were there a group were very rowdy keeping us awake and we called the front desk who called secutity to sort it Next day we were upgraded to a suite for our inconveniance which was amazing All in all Las Vegas is a brill exciting resort You can enjoy it all from Bills without being Rockaffella    If you re going don t forget they don t have kettles in the room We took a travel kettle and adapter as we can t live without our cups of tea   
P =>  Bill s is Gold  For our first trip to Vegas we wanted to stay in the middle of the Strip  where the action is  but not pay a fortune for the priviledge The review s of Bill s on here were spot on  Bill s is in the perfect location  opposite the Bellagio and next to the Flamingo  and the newly refurbished rooms were more than comfortable  with a very comfy king bed and   in TV  The room  and bathroom  were spotless and cleaned as such everyday  The check in staff were extremely helpful and attentive and were happy to help in all ways  The only slight negative with the room was the air con was pretty loud  but by the time we got back to the room that hardly mattered Finally  you get access to the Flamingo Pool  which is rated    in Vegas for good reason  All in all  Bill s was great and for     a night on weekends  with    Coronas and    c gheritas  we ll be back  
P =>  First Time in Vegas THE ROOMPositives Very large  Kingsize bed with large plasma TV Great view Negatives The A C made a lot of noise to the point where it kept me awake The bathroom sink was clogged There were little ants in the bathroom Got a little noisy a few times with people partying They unclogged the sink serviced the AC the same day  but that night the A C noise came back AMENITIESIf you are into gambling  this is probably good enough for you  There is nightly entertainment and full out gambling  However  it you are looking for a nice pool  you have to go next door to the Flamingo  If you are looking for a nice restaurant  you are better off venturing out of the hotel I wasn t aware  but you can smoke pretty much everywhere in Vegas  and this hotel is no exception  so be prepared for the smell of smoke  SUMMARYYou are in the heart of the Strip  can walk anywhere  this hotel is very affordable  Would I stay here again  Probably not  but it was fine for my first time  
P =>  Great location We stayed   nights and loved the location of the hotel in the middle of the strip  The rooms were quiet  clean and comfortable  room      handicap accessible  with good security in the evenings to get to your room  Very quick check in and out  no line ups like we saw at the Flamingo  About a     cab ride from the airport Great       margaritas and the    hotdogs were awesome as well  Excellent coffee at the Seattle s best in the casino area  grabbed coffee and a muffin in the morning for a cheap on the go breakfast Loved the    inch TV but it only has basic channels  Played in the casino a bit but were close to so many good spots that we tried a few  Bally s  Paris  Planet Hollywood  Bellagio  Flamingo  Would stay here again for sure  
P =>  Bill s really nice for the money My husband and I stayed at Bill s from Thursday ust   th until mid afternoon on Labor Day  There was no line at check in but it was about eleven in the morning  They did not have a King room available but offered us a Queen room two beds  with a strip view at no extra charge on the fourth floor  We took it rm      and the view was of the Bellagio and Bally s  very nice  The room was clean and well kept  The bathroom is small but has a stained glass window and can be opened and shut for further strip views  The drain in the bathtub was a little slow but caused no real problems  The maids always had the room done by the time we got back from breakfast and site seeing in the morning  We used the pool at the Flamingo which was another story  Nice big pool too crowded most of the time  The water was quite cool but refreshing  Too many people left their garbage around and in the pool  That experience could have been so much nicer  Bill s in really nice for the money  I would consider staying here again  
P =>  Cheap   Location   Perfect    Just returned from a Las Vegas and LA trip  Bills was our choice for Vegas  We stayed there for three nights Tuesday to Friday  and loved it  Yes the property is older  but everything is clean  just a little worn  We were in a King non smoking room on the second floor  right off the elevators perfect   We loved the fact that security checks room keys  and every night security was seen roaming the halls  The room was a good size  Big closet  lots of drawer space  plenty of chairs if you had visitors  There was also plenty of lights  which helped the hotel to fit in with the city I guess  Bed was clean and comfy  Although it really didn t matter because by the time my head hit the pillow anything would have been comfy    Bathroom was made for seniors with no tub and a chair in the shower  as well as rails everywhere  Window opening up was neat when showering  Flat screen TV was great as well  Makes for a lot more room in the room  All in all Bills was great    On the strip in   mins  quiet comfy rooms  good security  and no huge check in out lines as witnessed in the big properties   Also ate in the Victorian room for a late night snack  Interior is dated as well  but all in all it exceeded expectations  Not fine dining but was great midnight food  
P =>  By Far the Best Value for Money on the Strip I spent a long time researching where to stay  almost chose the Luxor  but I am glad I didn t  The best thing about Bill s is your proximity to the strip  You can literally go from your room to the strip in around a minute  This is something that is impossible in any of the larger hotels  While walking along the strip my girlfriend and I found many people toting their luggage to the entrance while checking out  You could see how far they had walked on their faces  we never had such a problem  we knew that after a long day out our room was right there  we could even pick it out from across the street  The rooms are in excellent condition  We had a kingside room facing Bally s  Paris and the Bellagio  If you are going to stay at Bill s book a stripside room  The view is amazing  especially at night  The bathrooms  while small are functional  and we didn t exactly come on holiday to go to the bathroom  All in all Bill s has sparked a love in myself and my girlfriends hearts for small hotels in prime location  Bill s all the real benefits of being on the strip  with none of the drawbacks the megacasinos have  
P =>  Don t look any further The hotel is perfectly located in the middle of the strip  It s much smaller than many of the other hotel casinos which is a good thing because it makes check in out and going to and from the hotel easy The rooms were a good size and were clean and well presented  The beds were very comfy  We asked for a room overlooking Flamingo St  thanks to a good tip from the taxi driver  and could watch the Bellagio fountains out the window The only downside is that there is no fridge or coffee making facilities in the rooms  Having said that  you re in Vegas so you shouldn t be hanging out in the hotel room for too long We loved Bill s and would recommend it to anyone  It s location and price tag make it an obvious choice  
P =>   Bill s is great for the money I you re looking for a good value right in the middle of the strip  Bill s is it  This was our first time to Vegas  and I did a lot of research before settling on Bill s  I chose well  The room was clean and comfortable and the employee s were attentive  The bathroom was kind of small  but fine for my husband and I  When we first arrived we were givin a king room with a sitting room and a large bathroom with a spa tub but no shower  This may sound crazy  but I prefer a shower  The room was kind of out dated  like it hadn t been updated in the last    years  We called the front desk and they asked if we minded a room with   queens  we said no  and they quickly accomodated us  We were moved to a more modern room  albeit smaller  with a flat screen and a shower  It was smooth sailing from then on  The only other issue was the Victorian Room restaurant  There is a reason why the steak is only         We only ate there once  and I ll leave it at that  
P =>   I love this casino hotel  Bill s is a regular stop for us everytime we re in Vegas  about     times a year   We ve been coming here since it was still Barbary Coast  I learned how to play craps in this casino and regularly play everytime we go  The people at the table are really helpful  Roulette is also good here  I ve won on several slot machines here too  The quarter Wheel of Fortunes       il       and a penny machine called  Shake your Booty        two different times in one day in ch        We went to Bill s this year during ch Madness  We stayed at a different hotel but came to watch the games in the lounge area  It was great fun  When you bet in the sports book  they give you drink tickets and the waitresses came around regularly  Our friends came and met us there and liked it a lot too and now they return everytime they re in Vegas We booked a room here in il because we were going to a wedding at the Flamingo and the rooms at Bill s were MUCH cheaper  It was convenient to park  though the parking ramp felt like a roller coaster  and check in and getting to our room was convenient too  Our room didn t have a view  but it was spacious  clean  and comfortable  The TV s are a plus too  Great picture    The best TV we ve had in a room and we ve stayed in suites at Paris  Harrah s  and Mandalay Bay Another plus is the access to the pool at the Flamingo  We didn t use it when we stayed  but I have stayed at the Flamingo and their pool is my favorite  I ve been to the pools at Excalibur  Tropicana  Mandalay Bay  and Bally s and the Flamingo pool is MUCH better  Great pool  fun little waterslides  great drinks poolside  and misters on the trees to cool you down  It s crowded  but not as bad as the crowds at Mandalay Bay s pools The Victorian Room for dining is probably the worst thing about this property  and it s not bad  it s just not that good  
P =>   Great for the price  Stayed here for two nights  was surprised at the inexpensive price for strip hotel with this location  Booked through a travel website  their own website isn t secure  and requested   king non smoking  Checked in no problem at  pm  nobody else in line  but when I got to the room it had two full  or queen   size beds and it was a smoking room  I didn t bother asking for a change since the room didn t smell bad and figured wasn t worth the trouble  Room was clean  but a bit noisy since I was on the Flamingo side of the building where there were a lot of machinery air conditioner type equipment running    hours a day  They advertise having a Plasma HDTV in every room  but this is pretty worthless without any HD programming  Standard defintion picture looked pretty bad on these tv s  Room service was good  arrived both times around    minutes  room service menu was same as their coffeshop without the chinese food  Free hotel parking was convienient  quick from parking lot to the hotel  unlike most strip hotels  Anyway  I would stay here again next time  Location was great  rooms were fine  food good as was the maid service  One drawback is the small  smoky casino which reminds me of the downtown hotels  
P =>   Great location This hotel is at the best place  currently  as Vegas is always changing  on the Strip  right at the junction with the Flamingo Road facing the Bellagio  the Bally s and the Ceasars Palace  Be aware of traffic noise if you stay anywhere on the Strip Bill s Gambling is a great choice if you don t have or don t want to spend to much money on accomodation  Check in and check out was very quick  that is a hugh advantage in Vegas The parking was included in the room price The room was very clean  but a bit old and needs renovation  maybe refurnishment later on  The big flat tv was therefore a big surprise for us   Our room was facing the Paris Paris  great view The breakfast was plentiful but maybe too american for my european stomach  
P =>  Check out Big Elvis We stopped by Bill s Gambling Hall to see Big Elvis  The guy can rock  He gets the audience to participate  Though it was like being in a    s night club  it s really alot of fun  Big Elvis  show is free and its worth checking out While your at Bill s check out the        steak dinner  Soup or salad  steak or prime rib and a potato all for         It was a great dinner Also  Bill s is a Harrah s property so use your players card  We didn t know that it as a Harrah s property and we played a while Big Elvis is worth the time but get there early if you want an upclose seat  
P =>  Great Location  would stay again We arrived on a Sunday around lunchtime and had only a short wait for our room  We were in nonsmoking on the  th floor  and ended up witha a pretty terrific view of the Bellagio water show  Because this is a small hotel  there were no big crowds  and no line for the    cent margaritas  Bill s is centrally located on the strip  with free use of the beautiful pool at the Flamingo next door  You can catch the Monorail from there as well  The room was spacious and clean  and we enjoyed the    quot  flat screen tv Avoid the Sahara s buffet  but try the one at the Hilton  It was delicious  Bring a baggie and an extra loaf of bread and buy a sandwich at the Carnegie Deli in the Mirage  it is embarrassingly large  with enough meat for at least three lunches  
P =>  Best Deal in Vegas Bill s is the best kept secret in Vegas  Don t let the name fool you  Bill s is located directly across from Bellagio and Caesars Palace  If you are on a budget and you are looking for a good clean room  that s not far from strip  then Bill s is the hotel as it s located in the middle of the action  The hotel is a bit dark and looks old when you first walk in  but the room is a good size and the bathrooms are large and look new  The shower area is huge  You even get a flat screen TV Service at the very small check was friendly and most of the staff we encounter were friendly too All in all  this is a great budget hotel  
P =>  Great Location Was at the end of a road trip and wanted to see Vegas for the first time so I read the reviews on the site and was glad I did  The hotel was well worth staying at  The location alone is worth it  Located on the corner of the Strip and Flaming Rd you are right in the center of the strip  Ballys is across Flamingo Rd  The Flamingo is right next door and the Bellagio and Caesars are across the street  The hotel has about   floors and the rooms are very clean and nice  The big tvs are also a nice treat to have  The bathroom was small but not bad at all  Stayed for   nights and I would stay again  The casino was nice  not too big  Had breakfast in the Victorian Room and it was a nice filling breakfast  If you arent looking for a huge big hotel I highly recommend this hotel if you plan on staying in Vegas  
P =>   Great hotel in a central location    The hotel is in a great location on the strip  right where the action is  We didn t need our car once we got to the hotel  All the casinos we wanted to visit were within walking distance or a short taxi ride away  Check in was quick  no line  and we were given a room with a partial view of the Bellagio Fountains on the  th floor  The room was spacious and the    quot  plasma tv was a plus  although channel selection was limited  It was      degrees outside but we kept cool thanks to the powerful air conditioner  The bathroom had a stained glass window that opened up and we could watch the fountain show as we showered I noticed there wasn t a fridge or a safe in the room  but we didn t miss either  I payed about      nt which is a bargain for its location  I d definitely stay here again when I return to Vegas  
P =>   perfect hotel location at bills Perfect hotel and location  Very clean rooms well looked after hotel  First time in vegas and was made even better by bills  highly recomended  
P =>   Ideal for the strip We were looking for somewhere not too expensive and close to the strip  Naturally we looked at Trip advisor and went for  Bills  It s an excellent place  Not expensive  Small  only     rooms  and some of the staff get to recognise you We had a room overlooking the Bellagio fountains albeit at an angle and it s right opposite Caesars Palace  Its very central on the strip The rooms are big and comfortable and clean  An ice bucket can be filled from a machine in the corridor and there are useful things like an iron and ironing board  They have huge flat panel Tv s if you find time to watch them  If you are into gambling then you may want a bigger place but because of the location you only need to walk for a couple of mins to the larger casinos There is no pool but you can use the pool in the hotel Flamingo next door  This is more of a play pool complex and can get busy  but it is quite large and in nice gardens  Food options are not extensive  but again there is plenty locally to choose from We were so happy with the place that we went back for a night after visisting Grand Canyon and would go again  It does not have all the Disneyesque stuff that the other places have but for value for money and compared to what you get in the UK we would recommend it  
P =>   Great hotel and locations  We stayed at bill s for    days and nights last e while we were getting married right next door at the Flamingo  Rooms are great and so is the service  never had a problem with anything  we got room service at   am after a night on the strip and loved it  They had a security guard outside the elevators on the lobby floor checking room keys and we thought that was great  Also my parents came for our wedding last year and they go to vegas about every three months and they stay at Bill s now every time  Great service and good rooms  great views and a great location  How much better can it get  
P =>   Best deal on the Strip We stayed at Bill s from e    through y    We had been planning on staying at TI when we got a promo code from Bill s for weeknights at     and     on the weekend  We couldn t pass that up  Boy  am I glad we didn t  When we got to the hotel  we told them we were there for our anniversary and were upgraded to a room with a view at no charge  The casino  well  the whole hotel  is small  but that actually is an advantage at the end of a long day of walking or a night out partying  We could walk in the doors of the casino and be in the room in less than five minutes  I also liked that a security guard was at the elevators every night checking for room keys  All the staff we encourtered were friendly We were on the first level above the casino in a corner room  if you look at a photo of Bill s at night  you can see on the corner above the round sign there s a light shining on a window   that was our room   We had a wonderful view of the Bellagio fountains and could even hear the music if we opened the window in the bathroom  The room was actually bigger than it looks in pictures  There is not closet  per se  but there is a place to hang clothes by the sink in the bathroom  the sink is separate from the toilet and bathtub   A previous reviewer mentioned something about smelling smoke in their room  but we didn t experience this at all  The room was quite clean and up to date  Housekeeping did a very good job and never woke us up I did notice that there was noise from the street  but I popped in some earplugs and was fine  If you re a light sleeper  you may want to do the same  It s hard to complain about the noise  though  seeing as how it s Vegas  My husband was not bothered by the noise at all Bill s has also added a poker  quot room quot   really it s a roped off area  with very low  and no limit Texas Hold em  Had pretty good luck there We ordered room service several times  The food  from the Victorian Room restaurant  was OK  but service declined as the week went on  Also  the last day or two we were there  the water temperature was a bit sketchy  It would get very hot for a second  then regulate  However  because the  th of y crowd came in over the last few days of our stay  we might have experienced this no matter where we were  so I don t really count these last issues against the hotel We had full use of Flamingo s pool at no charge  which was a plus  However  be forewarned  This pool has VERY COLD WATER  VERY cold  It s also not a good pool for relaxing  though I did manage to fall asleep once on a chair  There was definitely a party atmosphere  
P =>   Excellent find   thanks to trip advisor What a fantastic find   thanks to tripadvisor i looked at the reviews for Las Vegas hotels and booked this one for me and my husband to stay in during a two week usa fly drive  Its slap bang in the middle of the strip we upgraded an extra     for a strip view and paid the princely sum of     a night for the room  Thats about     a night   The room was a good size very clean and newly decorated  Larger than kingsize comfortable bed opposite which was a    quot  plasma TV   The Bellagio fountains were opposite our room and although there is not a swimming pool on site we had full use of the Flamingos pool which is next door  We loved the hotel and vegas so much that we stayed   nights instead of the intended     and played blackjack in the casino at Bills as well as the slots  you get free cocktails if you play and the strawberry daiquiris were excellent  There were live bands playing each night from around   pm and Big Elvis was a definate must see he plays three times nightly    cent frozen margaritas were fab value  Did not eat in the hotel in the evenings just because we were busy sightseeing but the breakfasts were huge and good value with free flowing coffee  Could not recommend this hotel more highly     just go and enjoy  We intend to go back and back and back   
P =>   Best Kept secret in Las Vegas  Shhh  If you re looking for a GREAT VALUE in a GREAT LOCATION  this is the place  First  the location    On the northeast corner of East Flamingo Road and Las Vegas Bl   The other three corners of this intersection have a  Northwest Corner     Caesar s Palaceb  Southwest Corner     Bellagioc  Southeast Corner     Bally s  with Paris Las Vegas next to it    On the north side of the hotel  away from the intersection  is the Flamingo You cannot be more central to the Strip than being at this hotel  Now  let s get realistic  This is a   star hotel    a good  solid property without the WOW of all of the other famous   star and   star hotels  If you want the WOW  stay somewhere else  if not  then Bill s is your place  My room        was on the south side of the hotel  top floor  and cost me      including tax with a AAA discount   Without the discount  the room is    more  I had a view of Bally s and the right half of the  Eiffel Tower  of Paris Las Vegas  peeking out from behind Bally s  I had a king size bed  a writing desk  a little table and two chairs  a dresser with   large drawers and a flat screen TV  which I never turned on   To be honest  the bed was a little lumpy  It took a few minutes  the first night to find a comfortable area on the bed but after that  no problem The bath was modern and had a frosted stained glass window in the tub shower    a nice touch  Water pressure and soaps  etc were good The front desk  reception  personnel were not terribly friendly  They weren t unfriendly but they didn t smile much  I checked in at      pm and there was only one person in front of me  When I checked out  at        after requesting a late checkout  which they gave me with no hesitation  there was no one in front of me The availability of late checkout depends on how many people are checking in for that day so don t get mad if they deny you the ability for this checkout I took a free  craps  lesson at        one morning in the casino  the lessons are given daily  and I have to say  I was almost as confused after the lesson as before but maybe you ll have a better experience   They give you a book of rules but that still didn t help much  The BEST part of the hotel is the free access to the pool area at the Flamingo Hotel that is next door  It takes    seconds to walk from Bill s to the entrance of the Flamingo  they are separated by a   lane driveway   The walk to the pool area takes a few minutes through the Flamingo Hotel but it s easy to navigate  The pool area  which opens at   a m  and has some people lining up at   to claim chairs  is  in my view  the best that Las Vegas has to offer  There are   pools  as I recall  There is a cool  spiral slide that empties into one  then   more pools that are connected by smaller slides  then the main pool which is huge with a waterwall at one end that you can swim under  lastly  there s an  adult only  pool  topless is ok  Adjacent to the pool is a mini zoo of a sorts with  you guessed it  Flamingos  black ones  and some other water creatures  There is also a wing of hotel shops that is adjacent to the pool area  I spent a solid     day at this pool area and truly enjoyed myself  rode the slides  met some nice people in the pool and chatted  and swam  of course  I regretted not having the time to return  There were kids there but everyone was very well behaved  surprising given the scarcity of available seating in thIs GIANT pool area I  too  found the casino a little bit smoky but I found most of the smoke to be in the late afternoon and evening  If you want to gamble and don t like smoke  as I don t   gamble early   There are also  smoke free casinos  and  smoke free areas  in some casinos  The other thing to remember is that the casino is on the corner of the aforementioned streets  The reception area for the hotel is in a tiny corner of the casino that is accessible from an entrance on East Flamingo Road  or you can enter the casino from Las Vegas Bl and walk through it to reception   The hotel elevators are     from reception  So  if you want to avoid the smoke of the casino  come down the elevator  exit onto Flamingo Road  turn right  walking along the exterior wall of the casino  until you reach the intersection of Las Vegas Bl  and then turn left or right onto Las Vegas Bl  and you re on your way    smokeless  As mentioned by a previous poster  the casino  by Las Vegas standards  is small and is a simple rectangle  also  unusual for LV   So  it s easy to navigate from the elevators and front desk area to the Las Vegas Bl exits I visited the hotel at their website and  as a result  made my reservation by calling the     number that I found there All in all  I had a great experience at this hotel  
P =>   The perfect location but not so perfect hotel    I have read various good reviews on Bill s before booking it  After   nights there  I would say that I rather pay        more per a night to stay at Bally s across the street next time  I guess I got what I paid for   The Perfect location on the strip  the middle of the strip   but not so great rooms  Don t get me wrong  The rooms look clean and it s spacious  however there s a strong smell in the hallway  I m not sure if it s because the hotel is one of the oldest  or it s smoke smell  Another thing that bothered me is that you can hear every whisper in the hallway from the room  Also  the coffee maker I got in my room was very dirty  amp  stained inside  However  one good thing I liked about it is that  there is always a security guard in front of the elevators checking your room keys through out the night  My conclusion is that  it is a great deal  but I personally would much prefer newer fresh smelling hotels  
P =>   Double Check Everything I just recently returned from a Vegas trip which was a birthday present for my father s   th birthday  First off   this is NOT a   star hotel  If you are used to hotels like MGM  Mandalay Bay  Rio  etc  this is not the place for you  However  since the trip was for my father   I have to give credit that my parents did like the hotel mainly that you could not  quot get lost quot  in it  They were able to split up and meet up again in the casiono with little to no problems  and since my dad is not the cell phone carrying type   this was a big plus   So here were my thoughts on the hotel The good   Small enough that you could navigate through the casino easily and the table limits during the day were perfect        minimum  for the non highroller  Also the cocktail waitresses visited all the tables very often so you did not have to wait    min for a drink  The rooms were very spacious and clean and the flat screen TV s had a good picture  not that you came to Vegas to watch TV but they looked cool   The location was great  You were in the middle of everything and a literal stones throw away from the Flamingo where you could hop on the monorail if so desired  Bally s and Bellagio were also within a     min walk The bad   There are   sets of elevators here    set for the hotel and another for the parking garage  We arrived Friday morning and Friday night one of the parking garage elevators broke down  When we checked out on Monday  the elevator was still broken  So there were long lines to get in and out of the hotel  if you brought rented a car  and there is no A C in the elevators or garage  The casino is a bit smokey but tolerable The Worst   I have to take some responsibility on this since I booked   rooms  one for my girlfriend and I and the other for my aparents  and the other room was in my mother s name  My mother did not have her license with her so they refused to let us check into the  nd room  However  I showed the front desk clerk my itinerary from Expedia which showed the flight and hotel info with all our names with the same last name  Both rooms were paid with my credit card   yet she still refused  So I called Expedia and they told me that they could not change the names on the account but they would speak to the hotel for me  I offered my cell to the desk clerk and she stated that she could not take the call from my cell  So Expedia called the hotel directly  She even gave Expeida trouble on the phone  This clerk was not friendly  extremely UNhelpful  and in the end said that I was frustrating her  My check in process took over an hour and she was frustrated  poor thing Anyway   had there been no problems with check in  my opinion of the hotel would probably be better  But the hotel itself should not suffer from it s staffs unprofessionalism  
P =>   Great Little Hotel And Casino We booked a hotel flight package through USAIRWAYS  I highly recommend this  Bill s was a great place to stay  The room was very spacious for the wife and I  we stayed from y       We pretty much were only in the room to sleep  The room was kept very clean by housekeeping  It also was a very comfortable room  We requested a coffee pot at check in and it was delivered to the room before we could even get unpacked at no additional costs All the strip casinos are pretty much in walking distance  To the north within a   minute walk was Flamingos  Harrahs  O sheas a great place for the younger crowd   Venetian and Palazzo s and these are all on the same side of the street as Bills  Across the street from Bill s heading North Bellagio Ceasars MGM Grand and Treasure Island We never did eat in the hotel restaraunts no particular reason though I did get coffee from the Seattle sBest coffee down in the casino area every morning very good coffee The   thing that can be very annoying about Las Vegas is the people on the corners going mostly after couples to go and sit through time share speils  This gets very annoying  The trick is to tell them you are leaving that day and they will be more apt to leave you alone  though they try hard to lure people with either comps or show tickets  
P =>   Bill s is freakin  sweet  We had a great time at Bill s  We stayed a week over our fithe anniversery  and Bill s was great  It was clean  centrally located  right on the strip  nice dealers  decent food  intimate atomsphere  and every night retuning to your room felt like going home Oh  and Big Elvis is AWESOME  
P =>  The Price is Right  Stayed at Bill s for three nights first week of y  The location couldnt be better  smack dab in the middle of the strip  The hotel is not large but for me that was a plus  Got to the strip quick  Security is stationed at the elevator doors at night checking to see if you have a room card  ent coffee shop opens at      a m  Rooms are decent  bed was very comfortable  bathroom meets all your needs  get clean and go   You cant beat the price for this  One thing though  the receptionists could be a little more helpful when asked questions  Victoria resturant has basic fare for lunch  The       margaritas are ok  All in all if you want a decent place to stay for a great price and location this is it  
P => Great Stay at Bill s  Finally selected Bill s after viewing the reviews from TA  It was a great place to stay in if you don t have small kids and don t stay in the hotel most of the time as there is not much entertainment in the hotel except for casino  The basics are all there in good shape   efficient admin  clean spacious room  good plasma TV  only that the bath tub has a sluggish water flow so it was often slightly flooded after a shower  but a small thing   Bill s has a fantastic location  right in the middle of the strip and once you step out of the hotel  it s within minutes to the other grand hotels nearby   Bellagio  Caesar s Palace  Planet Hollywood which has great things to view shop  but which you would have to pay several times more to stay in  Bill s is also steps away from the Deuce bus stop at Flamingo  which we took to the Las Vegas Outlet Centre and Premium Outlets for our shopping sprees  It is also a pickup location that tour companies and airport shuttles will not miss as it s surrounded by other popular hotels  I must also compliment the Victoria Room which is the   hrs hotel restaurant  It always has a long queue and the waiting diners on list will be announced via the PA system  The Chinese food served was very nice and in huge portions  and the steam rice  tea and coffee were free and free flowing too  Not to mention that we were served by a very friendly and helpful waiter on our second time there  The only thing is that for the  th y stay  the price is   times the normal rate  as it s a public holiday  Other than that  it s a great fine place to stay in along the strip  if you are not intending to spend a lot of time indoors  
P =>  Great Value I really thought this was a great hotel for the price   We were in a great location  between Bally s and Flamingo  and accross from Cesars  The price was great and the staff were friendly  I wasn t greatly impressed with the breakfast I had the first day in their restaurant  but they had excellent club sandwiches   Anyway  if you re looking for a good  clean hotel for a good price  this is a great place to stay  
P =>  Great stay in Las Vegas Just recently stayed at Bill s Gambling Hall and Saloon for one night in e  My family was there on a Saturday night  after flying into Vegas  We had one quick night  and have to agree with other reviewers that this hotel was perfect  You could be on the strip and in your room very quickly  which was great for us  The room was very clean  The beds were super comfortable  and the flat screen tv on the wall was nice  Our room was actually larger than a traditional hotel room  The location was great  You felt as though you were in the middle of it all  Would definitely recommend this hotel  just know  it is not all about glitz and glamour  it is more about clean and location  
P =>  Great for the price Loved this hotel  Room was not fancy but adequately appointed and quite comfortable for a family of four  two teenagers  and the hotel has many advantages because it s small  quick check in  easy and quick walk from your room to the Strip  an intimate casino  and five minutes or less to and from ample free parking in garage attached to hotel  You also have easy and free access to the large Flamingo pool complex  although if you are staying during the summer  be prepared for large crowds and no poolside seating  unless you come early  Staff were pleasant and helpful  it s inexpensive  and the location can t be beat in the heart of the strip   directly across from Ceasar s and a short walk to Bellagio s  For no particular reason  we did not eat at the hotel  so I don t have recommendations regarding their restaurants  but there are plenty of choices nearby  We booked directly through the hotel s website  which equalled the best price found on other sites  
P =>  Great value and position We decided on Bills after reading reviews on TA and were not disappointed  Location was fantastic  room was spacious with a great view of the Bellagio fountains  Heard virtually no street noise except for sirens  We missed not having a coffee pot and I can never understand why there are no refrigerators in USA hotel rooms when it s     degrees outside  Our only criticism was that the air conditioner was very noisy  For the price I think it is fantastic value and we would definitely stay there again  Oh and they have   c magaritas in the bar near check in  
P =>  Complete Disappointment My husband and I frequent Vegas and we always stay in the same hotel  so this time we decided to stay something new  We were there for a holiday weekend which meant room rates were a little higher than usual  Bill s was in a great location and the price was okay compared to other hotels that weekend  Boy  do I wish we would have just shelled out     or so more to stay at another hotel   The disappointment hit as soon as we arrived  Upon arrival we found the desk  but no one was there  We waited for five minutes then asked someone in the Victorian Room restaurant if someone could check us in  The lady said she would call someone and it took another   minutes or so for the desk lady to finally show up  If there isn t a line at the desk there is no reason for a wait  Even Motel   has someone at the counter The room did look just like the picture  which was a pleasant surprise  but was less than satisfactory after being there for a minute  It stated that there was a safe in the room  but there wasn t  For some reason they put us in a handicap room  unless they are all accessible like that  and the bathroom was terrible  There wasn t a tub   accessible   so there was just a bunch of drains on the floor  Well  the drains were in the wrong places so when you took a shower the whole bathroom would flood and be a sopping mess for hours  It was a colder than usual weekend and the lack of covers on the bed wasn t helpful  There was only a sheet and a small blanket that barely covered the two of us  When I asked for more blankets or a comforter I was told that they didn t have any extra  This was also the worst room for noise I have ever stayed in   There was about an inch gap between the floor and the bottom of the door so everything going on in the hall was heard quite clear  People were hanging out in the hallway all night both nights we stayed  Also  there was tons of noise from the parking garage right outside our window  from the Flamingo  The staff was absolutely horrible  Every time we tried to call the desk no one answered  If we needed anything we would have to walk to the desk and then wait for another staff member to track down the desk person  The whole time we were there I never saw anyone standing at the desk  They could never help with anything   blankets  getting people to stop partying in hallways  etc  At checkout the lady asked us if we enjoyed our stay and when I started saying that we hadn t she totally cut me off  handed me the receipt  and walked away  I will never stay there again or recommend this place to anyone  Stay far away     
P =>  Bill s was a great stay We stayed at Bill s in late e and had room      There was virtually no view from the room  but it was at the end of the hall and was very quiet  The bathroom was plenty big and had a very nice walk in shower  The room was always cleaned properly  and we always had fresh towels  We had no issues with AC or noise from the strip Bill s is an older casino and hotel  It has been re done  but still feels like it is straight out of the    s  The casino is smoky and the rooms are not huge  There is no pool  but you are allowed to use the pool at the Flamingo    min walk   We ate in both restaurants  The Victorian Room is great for a late night breakfast or dinner  and the Steakhouse was perfect for a good meal with food friends in a retro environment  We did not go into the night club  Drai s  but there was a big line of good looking young folks trying to get in  Probably a good place for a late night pick up if you are single Although Bill s is not anything like the other Mega Resorts in Vegas  there is something a bit special about the place  There was a buzz in the casino everytime we walked through the doors  The bar has great specials        Bud Bud Light aluminums    oz  and is a welcome relief from the     drinks we were buying at Mandalay Bay  The table games are usually        minimums and the dealers are much friendlier  Not to mention better looking  than at the bigger casinos  We placed a few bets at the sports book  and although it is smaller than most other rooms in town  the variety of bets that could be placed were matched only at the Hilton  Be sure to join the Player s Club  Overall  we had a very good stay at Bill s  I would stay there again in a minute  
P =>   best view around   great homey hotel we decided to try bills gamblin  hall in las vegas because of the good things we had heard about it  we were not disappointed  the price was certainly priced right for being right in the middle of the strip directly across from cesars  paris  and flamingo  it is a small hotel that can easily be overlooked  i heard it was recently bought by harrah s which would explain the room renovations  the rooms were nice with flat panel tv s and new clean bedding with comfortable mattresses  we decided to pay    dollars more a night for a room with a great view and were so happy we did  we could see both the dancing waters and the lit up eifle tower from the window  it was great  one of the great things about this small hotel is that because it is so small you can leave your room and be out on the strip in two minutes rather than having to walk for a quarter mile from your room to the door like in big hotels  if i had to say anything bad about the hotel it would be that because of the great view we had of the strip that we did have traffic and street noise but it didn t bother us at all  it might bother other people though  i will definately say here again  we were in room      
P =>   what a great place i spent many hours looking for a cheap but good hotel bills can not be beaten we had room     which had a great view of the bellagio fountains and the paris tower the staff were always freindly and helpful the bell men were great the rooms were big clean and modern there are better hotels on the strip but none were in a better location  bills steakhouse is a must we wasnt going to eat there but when we did we booked for the folling night and took my parents there the steaks were the best i have ever had and the king crab were fabulous overall this place cant be beaten for value for money location i will be coming back to vegas soon and will not look any further than bills 
P =>   Wonderful value  This was our second time staying at Bill s Gamblin  Hall and we were pleased then and we still are  We stayed in Room     The rooms are large and well appointed  The location is the absolute best  The last time we were here  we got a  fountain view  room at no extra charge but this time we had to pay     more per day for less view than we had last time  Still  it is worth it to be able to look out our window and see the beautiful Bellagio fountains  Paris and all the activity on the street below Bill s guests can use the very nice pool at the Flamingo next door  The only  cons  were that the sheets are too small for the queen sized beds  there were two in our room  and if you toss about at all at night  you might find yourself laying directly on the mattress  Also  there is no coffee pot in the room We ate at the Victorian Room in the hotel      for two egg toast hash brown bacon breakfasts and it was the worst breakfast ever  Based on this breakfast  we wouldn t eat there again But  we would stay at Bill s the next time we are in Vegas   in a heartbeat  
P =>   Bill s  for Smoke lovin  patrons I might not be too hard on old Bill s  were it not for the glowing reviews that so many people write about it  For starters  the casino is the most smoky one I walked through on and off strip  The smoke is so intense that it leaks into the Victorian restaurant and makes eating there less than pleasant I was on the first floor with a unrequested view of the Bellagio Fountains   Lower  even number rooms are closest to the show   Unfortunately  the smoke from the casino leaked into my room at night  I found that my throat was burning from all the smoke  Some day I dream that Vegas goes smoke free  but alas  I know it will be a long long time coming If you don t mind an older crowd and don t mind smoke  than you may agree with the majority of people who like this place  If you are prefer a younger crowd and are bothered by excessive smoke  do yourself a big favour and stay elsewhere  When I got home all my clothes went into the wash  including the ones that never came out of the suitcase  
P =>   Location location location We stayed at Bill s just one night at the end of a long family vacation  I would say their number one asset is their location We had a room with two queen beds  The room is plenty big with a nice flat panel television  The bathroom is not that big  but how much time do you really spend in a bathroom  It was nice to stay on the strip and be able to step out the door and be right there in all the action  We had spent six nights at the Wyndham a week before we stayed at Bill s and we are torn between on or off strip The staff was very nice and helpful and we had no problems what so ever  
P =>  Bargain I visited Bills for   nights from      to      costing me about      for the week which is a bargain as i m sure some hotels charge you that for a night The hotel is smaller than most and like the casino is basic but promises to be nothing more  As mentioned by others  the location cant be beat  The reception is small and in the corner of the hotel but is sufficient for what it needed to be  I didn t have to wait at all  The lifts are adequate and i never really had to wait long at any time even though i think the hotel was full I stayed on the first floor  i requested  th floor  which overlooked Ballys with views of Paris Tower and Bellagio Fountains  Although you could hear the noise i never found the noise to keep me awake  so unless you are used to peace you ll be fine  The air con was great and much needed although blots out the noise from the strip The room was better than i imagined and for me travelling alone was much bigger in size than i expected and is easily sufficient for up to two people  IMO  The bathroom is small but did you need something that is huge   The shower is a down point as although it was powerful enough with hot water the shower head was low down for me so i had to crouch  Like others have mentioned i do think this hotel suffers with the odd plumbling problem as water sometimes takes a while to clear and once the sink became blocked The hotel is very clean and maids clean the room each day although i did feel they started early and could hear them knocking on doors from       But the doors do lock so dont worry  I didn t eat at the hotel  Big Elvis is fun  the casino is nice  drinks cheap and the poker tables great value  Enjoy your stay   PS i will post a couple of pics of the room and view but i dont think the pics of the room do it much justice  
P =>   On the strip and affordable I have to agree with other travelers that this is a great place to stay in Las Vegas  We stayed for only one night between visiting Zion and flying home  The room was large  clean and quiet  We were on the first floor of hotel rooms in the back  and didn t hear any casino or street noise  Ok  so the view wasn t great  but we didn t spend much time in the hotel  and were there for only one night  I m not sure if other rooms have a better view  The picture on the hotel website looks exactly like the room so I am not bothering to add pictures  As other people have mentioned you can t reserve a smoking or non smoking preference when booking  I was a little nervous about this  but in the end we got what we wanted  We ended up getting to the hotel   hours before check in  We forgot about the different time zones  and were early on top of that   and they gave us our rooms  The only snafu was that one of the rooms had not been cleaned  but considering we were   hours early I can t hold that against them  We put our stuff in the clean room  and by the time we got back the second room was clean as well  Parking was also not a problem  There is free parking in the parking garage  or you can have free valet service  The staff was very friendly  and helpful  My step daughter accidentaly left her cell phone in the restaurant  and she ended up getting it back with no problems  If I went back to Las Vegas again I would consider this hotel as a first choice since the price was reasonable and the hotel was very nice Extra  If you like Vietnamese food there is a restaurant off the strip called Pho Thanh Huong Sandwich Restaurant at      E Tropicana Ave   D that is very good  I will try to add a review but if I can t I thought I would put it here  It s inexpensive  and the food is very tasty  
P =>  Great place great value Stayed here for our first   nights in Vegas  Overall we really liked the place  and will likely stay here again if we ever find ourselves in Vegas again  which we hope to   We got a good rate from the website originally  but the rate went down a couple of times  and I was always granted the lower rate when I called the hotel directly and requested it  We didn t find the road side room to be too noisy  but I live in a city so am probably use to a certain level of noise Pros  Nice clean room  relatively new furnishings and decorating  Good tv with average reception  Liked being able to use the pool at the Flamingo   we found the pool very crowded and a bit too cold for our tastes  but it is a beautiful pool and did enjoy a couple of swims  Loved the fact that our room was easy to access and it didn t take forever to get to the strip  Also loved the easy access to our vehicle  and how easy it was to get our vehicle in and out of the garage  Some of the other strip hotels had parking garages what seemed like miles from the hotels  Great location centre strip  We had a view of the Bellagio fountains but since you couldn t hear the music it wasn t really a big deal  The view of the eiffel tower was nice though  Liked that we could open our bathroom window and not always rely on the air conditioner for air Cons  We found the people working at reception  and one of the ladies working the gift shop rather unhelpful and seemed very unhappy overall  other staff were fine however   Didn t like the smokiness of the casino  or the way it was decorated  personal preference of course   lots of dark wood etc   Would have preferred an in room safe rather than using the casino cashier downstairs  who make you leave a     deposit in case you lose the key   but the cashiers were pleasant and helpful  
P =>  Wonderful  LocationThis hotel is in a perfect central location for access to the strip  situated right on the corner next door to the Flamingo Hotel  You are on the doorstep to everything casino and shopping related  It cost us roughly    dollars for a taxi to the Greyhound Bus Station which was downtown on Main St Check InCheck in was very smooth and straightforward  no problems or queues  The reception and hotel access is actually in the casino itself  was a little confusing when we arrived  but once we found the front desk there were no issues at all  There was an elevator which took us to our room on the  th floor HotelThis hotel is very impressive  For the price I paid      dollars or so per night   this was excellent value for money  The room was very spacious and clean  We had a king bed not suite  but there was certainly a lot of spare space to put a kitchen area in if they wanted to  Bathroom was in great clean condition  we had a bath as well as a shower  Our window faced the Flamingo hotel and the strip itself  At night time you can hear music from the strip  which usually starts around midnight  Not really a nuisance at all  just background noise  Also if you are a light sleeper like me then you will probably hear the external air conditioning outlets from everyone s rooms  This is not really a disturbance  as it is a fairly steady and low noise  just make sure you have earplugs if you are a light sleeper  My girlfriend had no problems sleeping at all My only criticism to the hotel is the internet access  they charge     dollars for    hours internet access  this is the first hotel in the US I have encountered that do this  but for the rate we paid  you can hardly argue  Still free internet access would have been made this hotel  perfect   Another thing that is missing was an onsite pool  but you can use the pool in the Flamingo if you wish  Also worth mentioning there is a huge wall mounted plasma TV in each room  which is great for relaxing in the room and watching some good old Maury or Dr Phil I would also recommend the Victorian Room in the casino for dining  it is fairly cheap and the food is of a good quality  The only thing that let it down a few times was the speed of the service  On   occasion we had to wait nearly    minutes for a drink and nearly   hour for our food  But we did have some luck other times and everything was fine StaffTo be honest we didn t really have much interaction with many of the staff  The lady who checked us in was very pleasant  The staff in the Victorian Room were all friendly and welcoming OverallIf you want a great hotel with access to everything that is Las Vegas then stay here  It is without a doubt the cheapest hotel on the strip and is great value for money  I would recommend Bill s to anyone visiting Las Vegas  
P =>   Great Stay at Bill s  This is the second time I have stayed at Bill s but my  th time to Las Vegas  I like Bill s because of its location and ease of getting to and from your room  I liked the large plasma tv in the room  The room was clean and housekeeping made sure our room was cleaned in the morning and ready for our afternoon return  The only issue we had as a slow draining tub in the bathroom  I called the front desk and the problem was fixed before we returned from our adventure of the day  We had a great room rate and location  
P =>   Could well be a regular place for me The young man who checked me in did not smile once during our interaction  most probably because I interrupted his day dreaming  But it was okay as the whole check in process took   minutes at most I had comp rooms at some of Harrah s properties but as I had to check in and go and Cher across the street I cannot risk standing in line at the bigger hotels The room I had at Bill s was very nice and quiet as it was towards the end and facing the side of Flamingo I really like the fact that I can get in and out of the room quickly  especially in the wee hours of the morning when my head is usually not in it s right place i will definitely give this hotel due consideration on my next visit  
P =>   Great stay at Bills We stayed for   nights for the first time and would definately stay there again The location and price were why we chose it and we were not disappointed It was             for the stay and worth every penny  Right on the strip  we were on the  rd floor facing Ballys and could see the fountains at the Bellagio across the road  You don t need to walk for what seems like miles to get to the street like a lot of the other strip hotels as it is right on the street On check in we requested a fridge  coffee maker and extra pillows which we had when we got to the room  At      pm my husband put the  make up room  sign instead of the  do not disturb  one out by mistake and the next thing was a knock on the door from housekeeping to make up our room  What service Lovely big room spotless and very comfortable bed Other reviews mentioned the street noise by night but we didn t find it a problem  We mostly heard police ambulance sirens which we hear at home anyway as we live near a Police station We didn t eat at the hotel  my husband prefers buffets and they have restaurants This is a personal preference and no reflection on the quality of the restaurants Nice atmosphere in the casino  smaller than a lot but always plenty of people there and plenty of cheering so someones luck was in  
P =>   Best value for money on the Strip There s not an awful lot to add to previous reviews about Bill s   it really  does what it says on the tin    It s not the most glitzy  in fact it s easy to ignore and walk straight passed It doesn t have hundreds of rooms  or swanky suites with every mod con you can imagine There isn t a fancy shopping mall  or a reception foyer area designed by the latest award winning interior designer Nor is there a Michelin starred chef designing the menus for the restaurant But then they re charging only        of the rates of the hotels located within a  min walk radius who do offer all the above    So it really is your choice as to what you want to spend your money on The rooms in Bill s are small ish  clean and comfortable  I was slightly disappointed that our double bed seemed to be   singles pushed together underneath double sized bedding so we had a slight ridge in the middle  but it was still very comfy The rooms have a certain  old time  charm  with new world additions of air con  which is needed   Not the most up to date systems  though  so the units can be a bit noisy  and a     plasma TV fitted unobtrusively onto the wall at the foot of the bed  Everything worked  and everything they promised would be in the room  shower hair dryer toiletries etc  etc   was there Check in was dead quick and easy  tiny desk at the back of the casino  and we got the corner room overlooking the Strip that we d asked for  There was no safe in our room  but with security staff near the lifts to check room keys before you could go upstairs I wasn t too concerned about this   we always keep things like money and passports on us anyway We were on the  th floor and could hear no noise at night at all  with the exception of a bit of traffic going up down the Strip  Not bad for getting a good night s kip in a city that never sleeps The Victorian Rooms restaurant is not bad value at Vegas prices  but it isn t the best food on the planet  Lunches dinners were better than the breakfast  which was perfectly edible but nothing special  The Steakhouse is supposed to be very good but we didn t get a chance to try it in the   nights we were there Last word about Bill s   do go to the Lounge and see Big Elvis   He s a legend on the Strip  and the best Elvis impersonator I ve ever heard  and with a sister who s an Elvis nut  I ve heard a few      he plays late afternoon  which is a great time to just sit down for half hour  if you can get a seat   with a cheap beer  we were getting new style aluminium bottles of Bud for        and relax Now for some general info tips on Vegas itself We went end of  and it was HOT   The dryness of the air can come as a bit of a shock to a pale faced Englishwoman like me   take plenty of sunscreen and moisturiser  as I couldn t believe how dry and itchy my skin went We did the Grand Canyon helicopter trip  and I think it s something everyone should do   By staying at Bill s instead of one of the  big boys  you should save enough money to pay for it anyway   We combined the helicopter trip with a  x  Hummer drive back over the Hoover Dam and an off road desert track part of the way back to Vegas   the helicopter trip was brilliant  the Hummer trip just OK and probably not worth the money Food and drink prices on the Strip aren t cheap by American standards  but aren t extortionate either  Surprisingly the best value  and impressive  breakfast was at the Bellagio   go to the buffet restaurant and  for      you get the largest buffet I ve ever seen   You certainly won t need lunch after you ve stocked up on traditional eggs bacon pancakes  fresh fruit  various smoked fish  cereals  breads pastries  Mexican breakfast burritos  Japanese teriyaki bar etc  etc    And  being the Bellagio  the quality of it is top notch Don t miss the Bellagio fountains either   one of the few free attractions on the Strip and truly breathtaking    Word of warning  don t put off watching a show  normally every half hour from about midday onwards I think  to leave it nearer the end of your stay  especially if you are only there a few days  Vegas gets quite a bit of the desert winds coming through   nothing major  but anything over about   mph and they stop the fountains running The monorail system is very cheap and easy to use   we bought a special   day pass for about     each  Bally s is the best stop to use for Bill s   a  min walk brings you out of the side entrance of Bally s where you can use the pedestrian crossing to get over the road and into the side entrance of Bill s  Using the Flamingo stop seems as if it will be just as close  but you have to walk through the entire casino complex to get out the front   The light canopy show in downtown Vegas at the Freemont St Experience is also well worth a visit one evening   don t go by bus  though  unless you have time to spare    Bus tickets are cheap      but stop at EVERY stop up the Strip and the journey took about   mins  Took a taxi back  cost about      and did it in under   mins  
P =>   Loved our stay at Bill s Gamblin  Hall We stayed   nights at Bill s  We were on the  rd floor which is actually one down from the top floor  The  st   floors after the street level floor are parking  We did hear some noise from the street  but closing the draperies seemed to help a lot  The bed was VERY comfortable and the room very clean and roomy  The location was excellent  we had a view of the eiffel tower AND the fountains at Bellagio  If you don t want to walk thru all the slot machines and tables on your way to your room  one of the doors  the one furthest away from the strip  puts you right at the elevators  A good thing to know  since the place gets really busy at night  
P =>   Great location Great smaller Hotel Great rooms loved it no hassle Could you ask for anything more  requested high floor  corner room on the strip  overlooking Bellagio Fountains  just what I got  no hassle  asked for coffee pot  no hassle  nice small casino  friendly  cheap beer  loved the room  the service  and the location  great stuff  great choice   loved it 
P =>  Great Location friendly atmosphere fantastic value for money Every review on here states how great the location is  and they re right  Its central on the strip  so one day you can wander North in and out of hotels and South the next day  Theres some lively nightlife just past the Flamingo if thats what you like The rooms are large enough with a comfortable bed and great tv  They are a little dated but you dont go to Vegas to spend the whole time in youre room The staff were friendly and informative  especially the bellman mike   There s entertainment at the bar in the evenings which sounded ok from what we saw Ok  its not the Bellagio or the Wynn but after also staying in New York New York during the same trip  and seeing almost all of the other hotels  i d definitley stay in Bills during my next stay  
P =>  Loved it  Loved it here  Can t beat the price and location  
P => All This  Have been a Vegas tourist for years and finally decided to check out Bill s Gamblin Hall while on a    hr stop over  Great value for the location  Rooms are clean and comfortable  staff are friendly and the property can t be beat if you re looking for a place to grab a nap between hitting the action on the strip The  Big Elvis  show was a fun surprise I will absolutely return and recommend to budget conscious Vegas travelers  
P =>  Bills is the best We have just returned from our   night stay at Bills  This hotel is the best  the rooms were spotless  the beds were the comfiest ever  the casino was great  you also have the location  We loved every moment of our stay here you could get to your room in minutes not like some of the bigger casinos also there was security at night making sure you had a room key before you could go up  The staff were very helpful and polite  We will definately be going back to Bills 
P =>  ide on the Tradeoffs We booked into Bill s Gamblin  Hall  amp  Saloon to scout the property for future stays in Vegas  knowing good and well that it is an older property but with a great location and affordable room rates  You ll need to decide what you most want in accomodatations and amenities   this is not the place to stay if you re looking for chic amenities above and beyond a standard  clean room in a great location  Bill s is reminiscent of the old Vegas   lots of exterior flashing light bulbs  a canopy over the sidewalk with announcements declaring Bill s virtues  and in the interior  lots of red vinyl chairs that reminded me of our living room furniture from the early     s  There s a very smokey casino and lounge  so beware that if cigarette and cigar smoke is not to your liking  or of sensitive nature  this is not the place to stay  I smelled smoke throughout the property  including in the hallways to our room  The property has a standard restaurant  with basic  non fancy eating fare  The rooms are spacious  have views out to the stip  our room faced directly out to the Bally s property and partial view of the Bellagio fountains  and clean  Your room is stocked with basic toiletries  and a nice    quot  LG flat screen television  The room rates are affordable  and we felt secure and safe the entire time there  they did room key checks at night before allowing you on the elevator   The location is great   next door to Bally s  across the street from the Bellagio and Caesar s  so we could easily access those proprties without having to walk too far  If you re a guy or a gal with a penchant for old time Vegas  and not much for the Bellagio or Venetian themes  and prices    then Bill s is a great place to enjoy the basics  and perhaps put on your     s attire and take in the fun  
P =>  It is the best deal location on the Strip   There is no better location in Vegas than Bill s  Throw in the room for    th the price of Bellagio and how can you beat it    I arrived just after noon  I was the only person   registration  everything was in order  bing bang   here s your key  I had a very low rate from a website  i Vegas   and had made no special requests  My room was on the Flamingo side  overlooking the lush landscaping of Bally s and the magical Dancing Waters  I watched that dumb show    times over   days  I d head for the bathroom  peek out and      what could I do  watch it again   I could even watch it in my shower The room was fine  bed great  TV huge  The bathroom was a tad cramped and I had come from stays   The Orleans and El Cortez  so I missed my overstuffed sofas a bit  but      its    secs to the elevator  and ice machine      secs to the  quot up and over quot  to Ballys   Paris  Amazing  The      garittas were icy and pretty strong  I d put two in a beer cup     Big Elvis was in good voice and shuttles to everywhere right outside the door  Gold Coast  read  Palms   Orleans  Sam s and even Suncoast  read  Rampart     Its even an easy walk to the wonderfully sleazy Ellis Island and their steak dinner special  How can you not stay there     tables  fun people  amp  staff  good room  great location  I m hooked  Harrahs  Please don t screw it up  
P =>   Exceptional location on the Strip Bill s is very centralled located on the Strip  From this hotel  you can walk to all other casinos and attractions on the Strip  The rooms are very big  nicely decorated and clean  You get nice views of the Strip as well  We didn t hear noise from the street as we were not in a room over Flamingo Blvd  Try to make sure you specify if you want to be in a non smoking room  We specified it during the reservation  but ended up in a smoking room with a very unpleasant smoke smell  In general  this hotel is a very good value in Vegas  
P =>   I loved the acces to the strip and the room We arrived on Friday night of Memorial Day weekend  I asked for a room with a king size bed  The woman said the only room available had a tub jets  If we didn t like it  we could switch to a room with a shower the very next day Our room was on one of the ends of the hotel on the  th floor  You had to walk through some double doors to get to it  When we walked in  we were kinda intrigued by the big room  I guess it is considered a suite  with a sitting area  The bathroom and tub were huge and made of marble The room felt like no one had stayed in it for a long time  I say that because the clock hadn t been changed to reflect daylight savings time  The furniture was very old but had character  If you have been to Elvis s home Graceland  then you will have an idea of the character of the room We tried the tub  and the jets didn t work and the water wouldn t drain  The mattress was very very old and had me worried through the night   I attached a pic of this room We decided to move to another room and were were extremely satisfied  The room is done in great taste  The huge t v  is awesome and the window in the shower was really great to peak out and let walkers on the strip know that I was naked up there Got to see the Bellagio Fountains while I showered I am not judging the hotel on the first night s stay because       of the rooms are not like that  and I actually loved the other room and the price that I was paying for Memorial day weekend THE CASINO  we played slots and video poker throughout the casino and were are thoroughly convinced that the good paying slots and video poker machines are in the back near the Western Union window  We hit several big winning hands on VP in the back of the casino and the Wheel of Fortune video slots where also paying nicely through out the weekend  The newer machines in the front of the casino were very tight For those that have been to Vegas before  they know that walking the strip can take it s toll on you  and the walk back to some of the rooms can be a challenge and tiring  It was extremely beneficial to be able to get to your room for bathroom breaks  drinking water  grabbing things out of your room in     minutes  We  quot ran up to the room quot  countless of times during our trip This is an amazing deal at the best corner on the strip  I will be back for sure 
P =>   cheesy name great hotel After a lot of research online  a group of   of us booked rooms here and were all very happy  We stayed    th   th  and paid     for the first   nights and     for the last night there  Check in was very fast and we got the special requests I had made  non smoking  king size bed  non strip side of hotel   Because it is a smaller hotel you are able to jump on the elevator and be to your room in a couple of minutes compared to the       minute walk with the larger hotel complexes  Bed was very comfortable  shower temp and pressure good  and good size room with nice tv  Room was also very clean  Unfortunately  my husband and I were both sick while we were there so we spent more time in the room than we had planned All employees we dealt with whether in the restaurants  front desk  or casino were all nice and helpful if needed  We ate at both the Victorian Room and Bills Steakhouse  They were both good but the steakhouse was overpriced You cannot beat this hotel for its location  right in the center of the strip  There is a monorail stop next door at Flaminogs  and we were able to use the Flamingo s pool Excellent place to stay for the money  We will definitely return next time  
P =>   Best strip hotel This is the best hotel on the strip  This hotel is old Las Vegas  Real wood and not plastic  Stain glass windows  Nothing fake You shared the pool with the Flamingo which was a four minute walk from your room  Great pool  The rooms were clean and maids great  Not one complaint  I will not stay in another strip hotel again other than Bill s  This hotel is close to everything on the strip  Location  Location Location  Check in was quick and simple and our room was ready early  If anyone says something bad about this hotel I wouldn t know why  Also being near the strip there is some noise at night  I kept the blinds and bathroom window open and loved the sounds  This is Vegas  Enjoy it  Before you know it   you ll be home again  
P =>   Fabulous location  We are LV regulars and almost always stay in a suite at Planet Hollywood because my husband is a Starwood member and PH is a Starwood property  But we have also stayed at MGM Grand  Venetian  Bellagio  Treasure Island  New York New York and Mirage  Last time we stayed at Bill s because a group we were part of was staying there  What a surprise    This has to be the best value and location on the strip  This hotel uses the Flamingo s pool spa and the walk to the Flamingo s pool is shorter than the walk to the pool if you stay at Bellagio  The Victorian Room restaurant is very good  The beds are comfortable  the room a good size  Bathroom is not the luxury type we are used to  but adequate  Best of all  a few steps and you are in the middle of the strip  At the big hotels  you have to walk    minutes on the resort campus just to get to street level  We will return  
P =>   Great Value A group of college friends and I spent an extended weekend in Las Vegas  We stayed at Bill s and loved it  As other reviewers have noted  it s not the opulent luxury of Caesar s Palace  Bellagio  Venetian  or Wynn  but it s a hotel staffed by very friendly people who truly want you to have a pleasant experience We were assigned a two room suite on the north side of the building  You entered the room in a large sitting area with a wet bar  dining area  and     bathroom  The adjoining space was a large bedroom with its own full bathroom  with a window in the shower overlooking the pedestrian bridge to Caesar s  and a king bed  Both rooms had old CRT televisions As many have noted  the location is great  It s convenient to all of the center strip hotels and provides easy access down Flamingo Road to the Rio and the Palms  There s no pool at the hotel  but your room card gets you access to the Flamingo s decent pool  The Flamingo is a short walk out the north entrance to Bill s The casino is nothing fancy    all the standard table games  including poker   It seems the hotel has recently upgraded a number of the slot machines  Ebay  Wizard of Oz  etc   and a lot of people seemed to be excited about that Drink service in the casino is swift and the waitresses are open to special drink requests  The bar in the back of the casino serves       Coors    hours per day  Rail drinks and beer are comped at the bars if you re playing the bar poker machines with at least      If you re playing a single credit  you re only supposed to get one drink  but that rule was only enforced on a crowded Friday night Big Elvis is the standard lounge act  and he s not too bad  assuming you ve availed yourself of the cheap Coors  Go in with the right expectations and you ll have a great time  
P =>   Perfect location small casino large rooms for the price  Wanted to stay on The Strip prior to a work conference at the lowest rate  Wound up paying      for Sat night  which was by far a bargain for the location of the hotel and size of the room I booked about   weeks early  the rate seems to go up     per week  maxing out at      for Sat nite Bill s is on the same side of the street at MGM Grand  Harrah s  Imperial Palace  Casino Royale  Bally s  Venetian  and Palazzo It s is located right at Flamingo  amp  Las Vegas Blvd  and between two Monorail stops    the closer stop is actually the Harrah s Imperial Palace station because it s the easiest walk through the hotel The rooms are deep  but not very wide  The king bed easily fits in the room  and the    quot  plasma screen on the wall allows the room to feel bigger since you don t have a massive armoire when you walk in  But the rooms is so deep that there is some funky wasted space towards the window  but it s a nice place to set your luggage  etc YES  the bathroom is small  and at an odd angle in the room    but the room was very clean  the bed was very comfortable  and the hot water was plentiful If you need a place to flop that s easy to get places from  then Bill s is the place to be  The casino is fairly small and cramped  and it tends to attract a lot of grizzled veteran gamblers that enjoy their cigarettes as much as their slot machines  I spent a total of    minutes playing there  and opted for the much nicer  comfortable settings of the mega properties a short   min walk away From Bill s you can hop the Deuce Bus  Route      along the Las Vegas strip  For     you get a    hr pass to ride it as much as you want  The Deuce runs from the Airport Rental Car center all of the way to Fremont Street    certainly the best  amp  cheapest way to get from the Strip to Fremont  though it is a bit slow since it makes NUMEROUS stops along the way If you re lucky  you ll get to witness a drunk idiot escorted off the bus by the LVPD  but other than that  it was packed with tourists and friendly people  And the drunk was removed before he actually got to a seat   So  Bill s is a great place to SLEEP  close to everything  and worth the price  I did not eat on the property  so can t comment on the restaurants or other amenities  
P =>   Great Strip Location at a Bargain price Stayed for   nights in room      great views over to Bellagio fountains Choose it after reading the Tripadvisor reviews and was very happyLoved the Friendly Staff  Security on elevators at night  short walk to room great location on the strip  views from room  the price   As a base to explore Vegas it was a superb location  easy walk to Ceasars  Paris  Bally s et al Ate in Aquaknox at the Venetian one night  lovely fish meal and a great waitress serving  Had a very good lunch at the Stratosphere restaurant Top of the World  even though it was a bit surreal watching people fly past the window waving at you     ft up   Bill s Casino was also cheaper to play than some of the other larger casino minimums If you are after a pool scene  its obviously not the place but if you want a very decent clean room and want to spend your dollar s shopping and gambling  Bills is a good betThen to top it all  i accidently left a Birthday gift in the draw when checking out  when I rang back to Hotel  they kept it for my friends to pick up later   Fantastic service    
P =>   Best value on the strip I came upon this hotel accidentally and what a find  I was traveling with my cousin  both    somethings and first time visitors to Vegas  We had decided we didn t want to spend a fortune on a room we d spend little time in   preferred to put our money into shows  etc  We wanted to be on the strip  preferably not at the end farthest from the airport  Bill s is about       miles from the airport   We wanted clean  safe  and comfortable  Bill s fit the bill perfectly Our room was spotlessly clean  The flat screen TV was really nice  although we weren t really in the room enough to use it much  We never used room service so I can t comment on that  We ate in the Victorian Room   somewhat pricey  but comparable to others in the area and the food was good All the money I won  and I did go home a small winner  was won at Bill s We had a second floor room that overlooked the Flamingo  It was quiet   no disturbances from outdoors  I wondered at booking about noise from their after hours nightclub  but no problems there either There is a security guard at the elevator and one on the floor  Even though the hotel was nearly full  we never even ran into other guests  much less any  quot undesirables quot   Still  their presence provided a nice sense of security Bill s doesn t have a pool   not an issue for us on this trip   but guests are invited to use the Flamingo pool With only a couple hundred rooms  check in and check out was a breeze  We visited all the hotels   one more beautiful than the next  but at certain times  their registration desks were backed up forever  And the sheer size of the big boys made it clear that getting to and from our room every day would have taken forever  first winding our way thru the casino and then waiting for the elevator Bill s features an Elvis impersonator called  quot Big Elvis quot   He is big  but more impressive is his true to Elvis voice  We really enjoyed his show If you re looking for an exclusive  glamorous  feeling like you re living in the lap of luxury hotel  skip Bill s  If you want to stay at a hotel that provides you with a comfortable  clean  quiet room in the best location on the strip  for a bargain price  Bill s is for you  
P =>  Great hotel and location  The hotel is located in the center of the strip across from Caesars Palace  The perfect location for browsing the strip in either direction  Bill s is a smaller hotel and casino which makes check in check out and getting to your room a lot faster than larger hotels We liked that security at night checked your room key before boarding the elevators Our room was on the fourth floor with a view of the Flamingo  It had a large flat screen tv and very comfortable beds  The shower area had a stained glass window that opened  We did not hear any noise from outside  It was an excellent value for the location and quality of room  The hotel staff we encountered were very friendly We ate at the Victorian Room restaurant for breakfast and the food was very good and the service was quick We would absolutely stay at Bill s again  
P =>   Bill s is the Best Bargain on The Strip We just got back from our yearly one week stay at Bill s  This is the first time we ve stayed there since the ownership change  but it remains the outstanding value it has always been  We used to stay at Paris  but   years ago we thought we d give the Barbary Coast  now Bill s  a shot  It was a great move  If you are looking for high end amenities  this is not the place for you  although you can now use the Flamingo s facilities by showing a room card   If you re looking for friendly staff  and an intimate venue you can t do any better  Our suite was a bit threadbare  but it was clean  comfortable  and insanely large  We usually stay in one of the King rooms which face Bally s  but Bill s gave us an unexpected upgrade  This hotel really rewards frequent visitors with offers that are hard to refuse  Definitely sign up for their players card if you visit  We would not consider staying anywhere else as long as Bill s exists  
P =>   Bills is the best  When planning our stay in Las Vegas we consulted various websites and reviews  Most of them indicated that staying at this Casino Hotel was a positive due to its location on the strip and the quality vs  value for money criteria  I am afraid that we are going to be another couple of travellers that will yet again sing the praises of Bills Gamblin Hall  amp  Saloon  We arrived in the early hours of the morning due to the flight being delayed  We found the check in process to be straight forward and within a few minutes we were up in our spacious and well appointed room  The room itself is decked out with the consistent theme of Bills that being its old world charm  old world d cor and its old world values Some of the benefits of staying here is firstly the location  Situated on the intersection where the colossal hotels  such as Bellagio  Caesars Palace and Paris collide  Bills is diminutive in comparison to these mega casinos  However  when you stay at Bills you can be in the front door and up in your room in less than five minutes The main gaming room is enough to satisfy all your Vegas needs  Again much smaller that the Casino giants but we found ourselves coming back to Bills to gamble because it was a lot less crowded  the dealers friendlier and we were winning   most of the time A must see while staying at Bills or in Vegas for that matter is Bills permanent lounge show   Big Elvis  Big Elvis sings several times from  pm onwards and the   min     hour free show is excellent  If you closed you eyes you could swear that Elvis was in the building  Big Elvis involves the intimate crowd into his show by both getting audience requests and my wife s participation to shake her maracas with Big Elvis to a brilliant rendition of Burning Love  The show should not be missed even if you are not a fan of Elvis We loved our stay at Bills and even though not too many people know of this hotel as when we tell them where we stayed they all say  where   never heard of it   is that off the strip   I am glad that people like to stay at the larger hotels and enjoy spending an hour a day walking back to their rooms as this keeps Bills our little secret

P =>  Don t believe everything you hear or read  With all of the stories in the papers of Hawaii people getting sick from staying at the  quot Cal quot  we were concerned at first  When we got there  the place was so clean  The front desk was friendly and helpful  the housekeeping staff  Lucy you are the best  was excellent  The restaurants were neat and clean and you could tell  gloved hands  bottled water  never shared  opened then left at your table   everyone was doing their part to ensure confidence that things were being done to prevent and to assure that you were there to have fun and enjoy  I am glad we did NOT cancel our reservations and stayed at the  quot Cal quot   
P => Cheap and a great place to stay This hotel isn t on the main strip  However  to us this was a relief from the bright lights of Vegas  By UK standards  okay  I know they are very low   this was luxorious  Staff were helpful and very friendly  Breakfast room service staff were a bit on the young side  and very embarrassed to see two people in PJs  But this is a little quibble  I d recommend this hotel for the budget traveller  
P =>  Dealing Blackjack Policy When the house is winning  the deck is dealt down When the house is losing  the deck is reshuffledimmediately I understand that it s the Dealers s perogative  butI feel that is unfair I have spoken to a pit boss on my last trip and he said that it s the Dealer s perogative The Cal is a great hotel as i have stayed there every year since      I enjoy playing craps and slots but will never play Blackjack there again  My objective is to win   with fair play   like everyone else Aloha Steve Otake

P =>   Home away from home Stayed at the Cancun for   days as the kids were nagging us to see Hoover Dam  Was surprised of the quality of the rooms  When I booked the room through hotels com it stated that the room would sleep five when in actually it only sleeps   noting one room has a king size bed and a queen bed with no sleeper sofer  The room was clean and modern with huge spa baths adjoined to each room  My biggest gripe was that there was no free wireless internet and was expensive at       per day  Great pool facility with waterslide for the kids  Beds were clean and comfortable with each room having a tv which was good for the kids  Free Shuttle bus to the strip was also very handy  Would stay here again  Staff were very courteous and frendly  
P =>   a pleasent stay at Cancun Resort   a time share  my husband and i checked in on a tuesday evening  the room was nice  king sized bed and tv in bedroom   a couch that pulls out and a chair and tv in livingroom  a dinning table for    amp  a full kitchen  stove  dishwasher  microwave  full size fridge  we had two bathrooms  one off the livingroom  with a stand up shower and sink and toilet  the bigger bathroom was off the bedroom it had a two sinks  toilet and huge jetted tub for    everything was clean and tiddy except the carpet had stains in more than a few places throughout the villa  It was too cold to swim when we were there   but the pool looked beautiful from our balcony i do have a suggestion for any single travelers  i would request to be in the main building   no one is at the doors in the parking garadges and we had a problem with a man pulling the door out of our hands cause he didn t have a room key and then proceeded to yell and act beligerant  security was called and never came  i went the next morning to complain that no one even took a reoport about this lt Security was a joke  they didn t seam at all concerned and said i could fill out a report if i wanted to this was free to us   as sister used her points  they tried to get us to listen to the time share pitch  but we declined     sister joined us for a few days  she wasn t pleased with a few things as well  over all   a clean decent place to stay  way too far from all the fun  if you want it quiet and away from the action  then this is the place  but you couldn t pay me to stay there if i didn t have a rental car  the shuttle is a joke AND stops at midnight  and a cab four miles from mandalay bay  is Ridiculous   also they require a      deposit for god only knows what  
P =>  Great Place to Stay Stayed at this hotel fo   days and had a great experience  The staff was friendly and helpful all around  The room was in great shape  clean and comfortable and spacious with a view of The Las Vegas Strip  albeit off in the distance The location about   miles from the Stirp was great for my family away from the hustle of LV  Restaurants  shopping  Oulet Mall and Groceries  close   Courtesy shuffle to The Strip was convenientThe resort is themed like a Mexican Resort and was impressive Parking garage was locked at night and felt very secureFree internet would have been a bonus  Wireless is available but cost of       per    hrsIf you are looking for a comfortable place to stay in Vegas THIS IS THE PLACE 
P =>   Great Resort We had a two bedroom two bath suite  This was fabulous for us   had a balcony  full kitchen  etc  Parking was a little difficult for those renting vehicles  The rooms are comfortable  well appointed  If you are looking for luxury and on the strip this is not it  It is up the strip a little away from the hussle and bussle  We did have a few issues with our room  but maintenance took care of it nearly immediately  Kitchen was a bit small but this suited what we wanted  A fabulous pool  some relaxation and close enough to the strip  You have to get to the pool early if you want a floaty   or cut a deal with someone to have theirs when they are done  Noodles are a plenty also  They have waterslides  pleasant music near the pool   did I mention the pool is spectacularly clean   Great place for friends getaway  family trip  etc  
P =>   So glad we didn t stay on the strip lovely rooms great pool After seeing the hotels with casinos on the strip and the amount of walking and vast lobbies we were so glad we stayed at the Cancun  which was so quiet  with lovely rooms a fantastic pool and parking convenient to each room  We liked it so much we returned for another   nights later in our holiday  The staff were friendly  the room was delightful and the beds comfortable  We had a small apartment  termed a villa   We had a central dining area with small kitchenette off  The small lounge area had a very comfy fold out queen bed for our son and he had his own bathroom whilst next door we had a nice spacious feeling master bedroom with a huge his and hers bathroom with ample spa bath  All in all we felt it a home from home and a retreat from a trip to the strip  We used the shuttle and also drove our car into the strip using I   and found it easy to park in the casino parking  Across the road from the hotel is a good selection of eating places   much cheaper than the strip  plus a useful food store  gas station and pharmacy    everything you could need  Recommend Outback Steakhouse  and IHOP for breakfast  
P =>   Very nice resort My husband and I went to this resort last week       We booked a room through our timeshare and also got one for two of our friends  The rooms were spectacular and the beds were even better  All four of us raved about the beds  The rooms each had kitchens    bathrooms  and the living room can be closed off to make a second bedroom  The pool was great too  although we were so busy we barely spent any time in it  except to try out the waterslides  which were awesome  The only downfall is that the hotel is about   miles from the strip  they advertise a shuttle  but it is VERY unreliable  and it only runs from        I would just rent a car next time  I will definately be back to the CANCUN RESORT    
P =>   Nice resort We were in Vegas for my daughter s wedding the week of           I own a timeshare at Polo Towers but since they were full for the time I needed  I was able to exchange a banked week for my Mom and two brothers for the Cancun resort While it quite a ways from the strip  it worked for us since I rented a car for the week  I don t know how people do it otherwise We got a two bedroom  two bath unit on the  th floor  Love the unit and the view of the mountains  Very happy with the resort all in all We spent more time at the pool than I thought we would  The drinks were not too expensive considering what they charge on the strip  One vodka tonic was        but I WAS charged a        quot up charge quot   What the heck The restaurant food needs revamping  in a big way  They are seriously missing a great opportunity here  Someone from this resport should spend a few day in Mexico and see how they treat their guests and what kind of food drinks they are serving  My goodness    It would be great to have fish taco s  tropical salads  fresh fruit  amp  cheese platters offered to guests as they lounge around the pool  Why isn t anyone walking around the pool offering guests signature drinks  Lovely tropical drinks would be delightful  Instead  they had bar food fare  wings  french fries  nachos  The only thing I could find on the menu that wasn t fried was a turkey sandwich  and it was good We own three timeshares and are able to move them  exchange  to various places all the time  Never ever have we been charged anything anywhere we have stayed  Only this resort charged us a       daily  quot Accommodation Tax quot   Weird To leave this review on a possitive note  the property and the unit was very clean and spacious  Yes  the kitchen is rather small  but still functional  
P =>  Clean resort but would rather be closer to strip  We purchased the timeshare from a friend who very nicely traded her timeshare in New Hampshire for the one at Cancun Resort  None of us had ever stayed here before  and were pleasantly surprised at the cleanliness and look of the hotel  We also liked the rooms and our view of the strip  However  if you are not traveling with kids  this may not be the place for you  Lots of rules  like only   float per room  there were   adults in our room   having to show ID to get horseshoe stuff  You are also charged     per week for wifi  which was unexpected  The biggest negative for us  however  was that the shuttle to the strip only ran from   pm to   am  so the free shuttle wasn t exactly operating at prime times  In the future  I would stay on the strip  even if I had to pay extra  
P =>   Great resort near the Las Vegas Strip  Stayed the weekend here at the Cancun Resort before school started for the kids  There is nothing bad you can say about the hotel itself  The one bedroom villa was very clean  except for the fact that there was a couple of sunflower seeds near the balcony   pool area is very nice  and open amenities and lobby are nicely put together and clean  The only problem is that the pool staff later at night were not very friendly  Seeing as how it was almost   pm closing maybe they just wanted to go home  Housekeeping staff were also a little loud while in the elevator with them  and one housekeeper was painting her nails in the elevator  Another problem that I found at the resort is that it is not very kid friendly  The Caribe Lounge did not except minors into the restaurant so we couldn t eat their and were told to eat somewhere else  Also there was no free internet which was a big dissapointment      Big thank you to Michael at the Concierge desk  By attending the owners meeting we were given   complementary tickets to Steve Wyrick s magic show which was a fabulous show  We were given great seats and moved up toward the front a little too Will stay again  
P =>   Incredible pool terrific rooms nice facilities We planned to stay only two nights but enjoyed this hotel so much my wife and I called in sick to work to stay an extra night  We had a   bedroom unit  It was in excellent condition  new   nice furniture  well stocked kitchen  large master bath  very very clean  The whole place smells good  which is important if you ever stayed in a place that smells funky  Our favorite part of the hotel was the pools  The pools themselves are large  complete with a waterfall you can swim under and waterslides  We especially appreciated the numerous lifeguards on duty who keep the kids from getting too crazy and keep everyone safe  There s also a very nice gameroom with   pool tables  some kids games  and an activity daycare center for kids Close to restaurants  CVS pharmacy but a few miles from the strip so it s nice and quiet The only bad thing about the stay was being asked to attend a timeshare presentation We ll return to this hotel P S  Check out the Pinhall Hall of Fame in Vegas if you re into pinball  All the vintage machines are there and you play them for a quarter  
P =>   Excellent mini vacation The resort is excellent  with only one negative comment which I will address first  They offer a complimentary shuttle to the strip  Hours of operation is good  but the van is to small considering the   of owners and guest that use the service  Plus vans are up in age and should be replace with buses  We stayed in the penthouse  which speaks for itself  we have taken our grand kids on several occasions  and the first thing they want to do is rant and rave to their parents about how good the activities and wonderful the big rooms  The staff and housekeepingwas much more than I expected  Did not see any sales staff  which was a real plus this time  The grounds of the resort are well maintained  Would highly recommend this resort  and would come back here again and again  
P =>   Wished it was closer to the Strip We exchanged one of our timeshare weeks for this resort  Rooms are great though kitchen is a little small  Very clean and bed was very comfortable  TVs in main room and bedroom are kind of small  I needed internet which you have to pay         per week for  The pool was great and water very refreshing after laying in hot sun  Our kids  tweens  only used the water slides once which surpised me  At the towel hut you can check out a float for the pool at no cost which is nice  Lounge chairs under the umbrellas or palms trees are in high demand  We had an  quot owner quot  accuse us of moving his towels from the lounges after we had been sitting there for over       hours  I guess owners guests rush down at      am and put towels on the lounges they want to  quot reserve quot  and then come down whenever they want to  We hadn t moved his towels but offered to move down but he turned really ugly and thank goodness he decided to move somewhere else  Later his wife walked by and made a snide comment to my husband in front of our kids  That experience really turned us off  We have never encountered someone like that on vacation  My husband and kids ate at the restaurant and said it was  quot okay quot  but overpriced  I thought we would utilize the kitchen but other than using the refrigerator for leftovers and making toast a few morning we didn t use the kitchen  We didn t use the shuttle because we like to be able to come and go as we please  Normally we stay in a hotel on the strip but decided to try a timeshare away from the strip  It didn t work for us  The kids really like being on the strip and because hotel rooms are so reasonable next time we will just stay on the strip  There were a lot of families with small children and I think this resort works great for them  
P =>   Good Stay I recently returned from a trip to Las Vegas and my husband and I stayed at the Cancun Resort  Let me start with the grounds  It s a beautiful hotel and a very nice layout  It s located about     miles south of the strip and there is a shuttle that will take you to the Tropicana and back  but that ends at   midnight  There was only one shuttle running and sometimes depending on traffic it was better to drive down yourself  If this is an issue I recommend you not stay here   Our room was wonderful  The apholstery is a little outdated but we don t go to stay in the room so I don t worry too much  There was a kitchen  stove and all the necesities for those that want to eat in to save money  There are two bathrooms  and a whirlpool tub in the master bathroom  DON T expepect housekeeping to come in every day  I didn t realize that when we booked but since we didn t need much we didn t really care  It s in their manual but I had overlooked it no big deal to us  The pool is awesome and a great place to hang out for the day  Get there early if you want a great spot but there were plenty of lounge chairs during our visit  We visited the lounge and the food is ok for the price  The cafe was closed when we wanted to visit for breakfast but they recomended the lounge so that s where we ate  We were not harrased by the timeshare people  I didn t even see anyone there however they are all over on the strip  Overall a great stay would do it again next time we re bringing the kids  
P =>  Very nice stay Our stay was arranged by friends who own the time share  We were checked in efficiently by the friendly staff and were surprised to find that our friends were kind enough to book us a penthouse  It was large and top notch  very clean  spotless  in fact except for the coffee maker which still had a used filter in it   okay  that s a small thing and easy to overlook   Most importantly  the beds were very comfortable and the place was dead quiet  probably the quietest hotel room I ever stayed in    and that is saying something  That s mainly because you can t slam a door if you wanted   they have a mechanism that doesn t allow the door to slam  Now why don t ALL hotels have that   The pool was beautiful and perfect for swimming  We loved going under the waterfall and I even went on the water slides and I am not exactly a spring chicken We didn t eat there  so I can t comment on the food or the room service  And since we didn t pay ourselves  I have to skip the  quot value  rating I really can t fault anything except the location because it is   miles south of Mandalay Bay  but it is normally a quick drive on the expressway to where the action is  and it has a very convenient exit at Blue Diamond Road  
P =>  Shouldn t you get BETTER service than the average hotel if you pay   k  Overall I was fairly disappointed in the Cancun resort  There were a few positive things I can say but they were mostly overshadowed by the poor attitude of the front desk staff PROS Location   Close to the strip but far enough away that it s not so busy and loudPool   Beautiful pool area  We didn t utilize it while we were there but it was obviously popular Room Service   I was very pleased by how affordable this option was and the two times we did order it the food arrived in a very timely manner  Shuttle Hours   Your in Las Vegas    the strip is why many  many people come   your shuttle should run past   AM  It would also be nice if they had     more stops  Perhaps one in the middle or one at the other end of the strip  It s quite a hike in the midday heat Bathrooms   We liked that our room had   bathrooms  One in the Master Bedroom with a shower over a jacuzzi tub  and another off of the living room with just a shower  It makes it great if your traveling with friends you don t want coming through your bedroom in the middle of the night to go to the restroom CONS Staff   The staff in general was my biggest complaint  I work for riott and in the hospitality industry so I know what I m looking for service wise   this staff didn t have it  Half the time they passed us off to the concierge who then told us to go ask the front desk  The morning before we left I had     things to ask the desk agent  Between each of the items  may I have an envelope  may I buy a stamp  can you make this and my Netflix please  the agent left me and went behind a door to continue her conversation with another staff member  The only POSITIVE staff I had interation with was the shuttle staff Shuttle   It was a good to have the option but could be improved Room   Kitchen should be larger  Compared to the kitchen at our home resort in Lake Tahoe it was like cooking in a closet Housekeeping   On the day they were to service our room they knocked  we answered and asked them to return in   minutes so we could put on shoes etc  etc to go out while she cleaned  She said ok but when we returned after driving around for       hours our room still wasn t cleaned  I called the housekeeping manager and explained and told them to forget servicing the room as we were checking out   days early    minutes later the girl arrived with her cart again to clean the room We are returning to Vegas in ch of      for my   th birthday but I ll pay to stay on the Strip instead of wasting another timeshare week  One would think that you would get BETTER service than the average hotel considering what you fork over to purchase a timeshare  
P =>   Lock your valuables in the safe I had a bad experience staying at the Cancun resort  I came with a group of eight we checked in to   rooms penthouse and a one bed room  My wife and I after checking in to the one bed room decided to see if we could upgrade to a   bed room  After a couple of hours by the pool we went to the front desk and they had a   bed room available  We packed up our stuff and moved to the   Bedroom  The next day my wife realizes that she left her engagement and wedding band rings in the bathroom of the one bed room We called security and met up with them in the room  We just missed house cleaning and the rings were gone  We filed a police report and the investigation is open    On a different note the gym was awful with minimal equipment and tight space If you had three people running on the treadmills the power would trip in the room  One of the elliptical machines didn t work which was annoying Front Desk and Security were very helpful but I wish I never had to go to security in the first place The rooms were nice and clean and the penthouse room was large  Unfortunately they assign rooms first come first serve    That means if you are an owner in the time share you can get stuck with a bad view of the construction and a non owner gets the amazing view you should get I will not be going back or recommend any of my friends to stay at the Cancun resort in Las Vegas  
P =>   Very nice except for pool rule We swapped our week for a week here  The unit was very nice  It was clean and since it is located about   miles from the big hotels  very quiet  We had a one bedroom  There was a king size bed and two bathrooms  one of which was very large  The unit was small but certainly plenty big enough for two people  The small kitchen was fine for us  but might be too cramped if cooking for a family  We had a rental car so I don t know about the shuttle  They had a beautiful pool area with slides and a waterfall  However  there was a  quot no outside food or drink quot  rule  It was    degrees and dry so you couldn t be outside without something to drink  My husband doesn t break rules  so this spoiled this area for us   We are too cheap to spend several dollars on a drink  but after all staying in a time share is supposed to be for those of us who are economically minded   Anyway  we are from Florida so the pool wasn t that important  Vegas was fun  Hoover Dam was interesting  and Death Valley was fabulous    spend one night there  We enjoyed our vacation  and I would recommend this as a good place to stay  
P =>   Great Place for a Family to Stay We were in Vegas for our daughters wedding at the Bellagio  Our son  his wife and   month old stayed with us  The Cancun was the perfect place to spend the week where we could  quot get away quot  from the craziness of the strip  It was very quiet  clean  and had a beautiful pool area  We exchanged our Mexican timeshare for this   bedroom condo  As many have said  the rooms are a little dated  but roomy and comfortable  especially great with having a baby with us  We never used a shuttle as our son had his car with him  The drive into town was quick and easy  The airport  grocery store  several restaurants  and shopping were conveniently close  We were happy to find a washer  amp  dryer in our building  Something to be aware of  some   bedrooms have a Queen bed in the  nd room  some have   twin beds  We were NEVER approached about touring or purchasing a timeshare   we were pleasantly surprised about that  If I were to point out any negative  it would be the main bathroom  The shower head was badly in need of a vinegar soak so there would be decent pressure and waterflow  A lightbulb was out in the bathroom   took about   calls to get someone there to replace it  The pool area is probably the biggest plus for the Cancun  There was pleasant music playing  there were several hammocks to lay with the baby for a nap  and ample tables and chairs  We would definitely stay there again  
P =>   Everything we were looking for  My husband and I just returned from a short   day stay  We were looking to relax by the pool and have the option to be in the middle of the excitement if we wanted to  Upon arrival  our check in was very quick and friendly  We were pleasantly surprised at our room  I had requested a pool view  not only did they make sure we had that  it was on the top floor with one of the best views you can get of the resort  Sure  the rooms are dated a little  That didn t matter to us though  The staff at the resort was very nice and we were not approached one time about the timeshare bit  We were kind of on guard about that  One of the resturaunts was closed which also didn t matter much  The Caribe lounge did the trick  Really we just used that for snacks and drinks  We only wish they had a swim up bar  we may not have spent as much time laying in the chairs getting burnt     So  I only have one complaint about the resort and it s not really something that they can control     There is a rule about no outside food and drink in the pool area  they were pretty relaxed about that rule as long as you were bringing your drinks in plastic cups  As the day went on  we noticed one VERY LARGE FAMILY that had staked their claim on several tables and brought in all of their own food  drinks and stereo         The resort has great music playing all the time so I don t know what their deal was  I really wanted to say something to the resort staff because I truely felt that this family was detracting from the wonderful ambiance the pool area had  We were there to relax and have fun though so I decided to order another drink and ignore them        I guess that s what it s all about  One last thing  other reviewers complained about the long wait for the shuttle to the strip  They had   shuttles running the entire time and we never waited more than   minutes    They really did a great job  We really did enjoy this resort and will return again  
P =>   Amazing Family Destination My wife and I and our   children have just returned from a spring break trip here  We stayed in a   bedroom   person suite  It had a   king and one queen and a pull out bed settee  The kitchen was well supplied  No need to bring beach towels as they are provided down by the pool  The resort has   pools and a number of hot tubs  There are waterslides  The staff from front desk to house keeping were very helpful  The place was clean and tidy and of a high standard  I would recommend hiring a car but there is a shuttle bus provided which takes you to the Tropicana Hotel in about   minsThere is a grocery store across the street as well as a CVS pharmacy Your are only   minutes from the Las Vegas Outlet Mall and restaurants and    minutes from the airport Excellent trip would highly recommendThe gym was small for the size of the complex and got a bit crowded and stuffy 
P =>  Great value but timeshare talk was annoying The hotel gets a   out of    from me  About   miles south of the major casinos on the Las Vegas Strip  it s a little quieter but convenient  Great price  very clean rooms  superb pool  friendly staff  The only downside was twice being asked about buying a timeshare  I didn t go there to be pitched  I came for vacation and was treated rudely once when turning them down  Kinda put a damper on the place  So  if you can handle being pitched  stay there  It s a very nice place  
P =>  A restful place in Sin City We booked a package through Orbitz and deliberately picked this resort because it was off the strip and had a bedroom and a kitchen The positives We enjoyed having   bathrooms    with a full shower and the other with a jetted tub  I took a leisurely bath with plenty of hot water  It was great to have a full kitchen with everything provided for cooking  There is a grocery store and Starbucks across the street so we were set  We also enjoyed having a separate bedroom and liked the living room with the couch and the deck  The pool is really nice with   water slides and a fountain  Everything is in Mexican decor  including the pool  Also  we asked for the top floor and a quiet room and received one  It was quiet the entire time we were there even though it was spring break The negatives The pool wasn t heated and there weren t any adults in it  just kids  We tried to go in but settled for the hot tub instead  Some of the furniture was showing a lot of wear  Way too early of a check out time         most places are noon  Beware  it s a time share and they ll tell you they have a free gift for you and some coupons  but it s really an invitation to see their time share presentation and they will give you a gift for your time  We passed on that  Overall  this is the  th time I ve gone to Vegas and was the most relaxing place to stay  I d recommend it to others  especially families  Secondly  take in a show  we saw Cirque du Soleil Love with Beatle s music and it was fabulous  Also we ate at the Fashion Show Mall at the Capital Grille and had outstanding food and service   ask for Stephanie  she s awesome  
P =>   Perfect Spring Break Just got back from a week at Cancun Resort during spring break I booked a  bdr  strip view  through Expedia for about USD    night For this price you probably get a one star motel elsewhere  especially during spring break  so nobody should complain The resort is very well maintained since there are also rooms available for time share purchase The kids had a blast at the pool and slides  we had some very warm days in the middle of the week The room was very large with two bathrooms  both with whirpool tubs Stuff very friendly and helpful Very dissapointed with the shows on the strip  few new shows  very few kids friendly and etremely expensive  such as Cirque de Soleil shows  I would definitely recommend the resort for families with small kids  
P =>   An Oasis in the desert We stayed on the Strip for one week and then wanted to get out of the crowds and the dirty streets so moved here for our second week  What a great move  The whole complex was spotless   which is really important to me  The pool area was just perfect   used the pool every day  Free shuttle service to the Strip and back  until midnight   Grocery store and pharmacy just across the street  Outlet Malls a brisk    minute walk north  Bus service right outside the door   we utilized the bus service daily   easy to use and friendly drivers  Only two complaints   charged for wi fi internet access  should be free  and very  very uncomfortable living room furniture  The mattress in the master bedroom is just about ready for a change as well  Other than that  loved the place and would definitely recommend to friends  
P =>   Great stay but a good distance from the action  Stayed here this past weekend with some friends as one of them had a timeshare here  We got a pretty nice room with two bedrooms and jacuzzis in both bathrooms  I say jacuzzis  but these things were like two person hot tubs  They were big and deep  They had three TVs  full kitchen  etc  The balcony was huge and had a nice view of the strip even though we wanted a pool view room  In any case  the beds were queens  but we could have used more pillows  Since we did not notice this until about   am  we did not bother them with this request   The pool area is beautiful  Although it was a little chilly when we were there  there are two big pools  one with a few large waterslides that looked really fun  I m sure this is overrun by small children in the warmer seasons  There are five hot tubs including one underneath a waterfall  This is relaxing  but loud and not conducive to conversation  There are others with hammocks around them and what not  Very nice groups with a huge replica of a an pyramid in the middle  No outside food or drink as I was told by my nervous    year old lifeguard  because you have to buy theirs from the cafe and or bar  We just brought ours down anyway and poured it in cups  Everyone else did too  so stop cryin  The fitness center was more of a closet  Nevertheless  I managed to get a very good workout in with the equipment that they have  You just have to think outside the box a little  The thing that bother me though was that the circuit kept blowing for the treadmills  so we had to keep flipping the switch in the circuit box  This probably happened every five minutes when two of the three treadmills were being used simultaneously   As for the location  it is about five miles from the heart of the strip  Not bad for a short drive  The shuttle stops at     which pretty much makes it useless as that is when people need a DD  But if you want to avoid the hassles of strip driving during the day then maybe it is worth it  There is not much around  but there is a    hour bar across the street if you came to Vegas for that  Not me  but if you are sick of the strip or don t like people  this might be your spot  There are some food options  a food   less  and CVS for your convenience  If you have no car  this place would be pretty difficult as I hear cab fares are expensive to the action  I heard that the timeshare people were pretty annoying  but I didn t see any  I guess most people that stay here already have them  but some told us that the people still bothered them  Not sure how the price experience would be if you didn t have a timeshare  
P =>   unbeatable We just spent   nights on the Strip and then   nights at this resort  This place was a dream  The rooms were more upscale than our   star hotel on the strip  and they were roomy  which we loved the best  The granite coutertops and two oversized jetted tubs were delightful  Staff were prompt and attentive  We really can t see how anyone can complain about this place  The mountainviews from the eighth floor were incredible  The pool was heated with a lifeguard on duty and they had jacuzzi s outside  more than we can say for the hotel on the strip  Monte Carlo   Its pool was closed although the rooms were three times as much as the Cancun resort  It was so close to the strip  Can t believe what a great deal this was     
P =>   Beautiful resort close to the strip Stayed at this property for   nights in ember  Upon arrival it is very impressive both from the outside and in The pool area with the waterfalls are absolutely beautiful  My only complain is that the large pool is closed this time if year  even though the weather was warm We stayed in a   bedroom suite with a full kitchen  living room  bedroom and ensuite bath with a   persoon jacuzzi  The room also had a large balcony overlooking the strip as well as a second bathroom with shower off the living room The room was very clean and not outdated at all The shuttle service runs very frequently from the hotel to the strip  A taxi costs about        Across the street is a large grocery store with very cheap pricing on all food and goods  We never ate out once because of this Outlet shopping centre only about a    minute walk If you want to get away from the strip and relax  than this is the place to be  
P =>  It is an EXCELLENT place for family  This is a great place for families and friends  I liked the pool area with the lil bar and everything  its comfy  Espicially with the spa bath  Its comfortable to sit down and watch a movie with the family  
P =>  Cancun Resort  Very Comfortable  We stayed at the Cancun Resort for   weeks during the National Finals Rodeo in Vegas  We had a two bedroom suite  and it was great  Very quiet  clean and away from all the hustle and still in a prime spot at the end of the strip basicly  I would highly recommend the resort if you want the quiet time  Also there are kitchens so you can cook etc  and not eat out all the time  Great place to stay  
P =>  Nice Stay My Husband and I decided to stay at the Cancun Resort for the Thanksgiving Weekend  We stayed in a   bedroom condo which I thought was cute but its very small   We stayed in a   bedroom condo at the MGM Signature and that place was very spacious   The Pros  Pretty cozy for two people  the master bathroom was very spacious with a comfortable jucuzzi tub  the bed was very comfortable  the kitchen was fully stock with everything you can ask for  the staff were pretty helpful  and even though it was too cold to swim the pool looked absoultely amazing  Now for the Cons  Though the kitchen was fully stock it was very tiny  Everything seem so cramped together  The bedroom I felt was a little small  you couldn t really move around because everything was close together  I thought the parking wasn t very good  The under ground parking lot could only hold about    cars  and if you can t find parking underground you gotta park outside  Although  the rooms are pretty small my husband and I still had a pretty good stay  We would definitely go back  
P =>  Nice resort  Clean rooms  Quiet I expected the resort to be a bit nicer  given the II rating  We stayed in a   bedroom  which was quite smaller than most we have stayed in  There was seating in the living room for a thin   only and not comfortable  The pull out was a futon type  You could not sit on the balcony without feeling closed in as the stucco wall was at least   feet tall and hence you could not see over if sitting  Although we were on floor   and I did notice that the upper floors had plexiglass  The room was clean  however we were not provided with dish or dishwashing soap  but received promptly when asked for  The kitchen was small and you could not open the dishwasher more than   inches because the door would hit the fridgerator   tacky  In one of the bedrooms  the TV cabinet was on the side of the bed  poor planning for the lay out  The staff was all friendly and helpful  Shuttle service was posted as every       minutes  however it was more like every       minutes  Also  shuttle only holds    so if there is more than that waiting  call a cab    buses Friday  Saturday however  Drop off to Tropicana averages      minutes  One of the drivers drove as if driving a manual transmission  hold steady for him  If you want to head down to the strip prior to noon  out of luck for the shuttle  it does not start service until        Use Deuce to travel up and down the strip from there at a cost of       all day  We did walk to the factory stores one day and took the Deuce from there to the strip  There is a bus stop as well outside the resort  but we did not use  The Deuce will also drop you off at Town Center  very nice shops and restaurants  then short cab ride back to the resort  If your on a timeline for a show  don t wait for shuttle  taxis come around every      minutes and the front will call for one also There is no helpuful information provided in the room  Nothing about the resort at all  nothing about the surrounding areas  recommendations  transportation  laundry  gym  internet  towels  etc  Yes  you could wait for the concierge  but so much easier to have in the room Pool was very nice  Never had any trouble finding a chair  however this is the off season  Gym was very small  Packed into a converted room  I expected something more because they do advertise a spa  Overall  if you are looking for some place quiet  family oriented  out of the way and clean  this is for you  
P =>   Best place we stayed at We chose this place based on the Tripadvisor reviews and were delighted to have picked such a great place to stay We travelled with   teenagers but had   large bedroomsas well as a lounge  deck  kitchen and   large double bathrooms All for a price much cheaper than anywhere else in our   weeks around California We loved the pool which was open great hours and was big enough for training swimmimg and just blobbing and the quiet relaxed feel of the place We didnt eat there as we used the car in and out of the strip which was an easy drive especially as the casinos dont charge for parking The only minor issue was the realatively high cost of using the internet in the games room Most other places have some free service now so this could be looked at Apart from that we would happily return  
P =>  Loved It I read most of the reviews for this resort prior to my vacation  I have to say that there were both positive and negative things said  My husband and I stayed at this resort while celebrating an anniversary  I have to say that I loved this resort  It was clean  the staff and other guests were very pleasant  They had shuttle to and from the strip but  it ended at    midnight  That was my only problem  But  if you missed the shuttle or decided to spend extra time on the strip  the bus stop was right in front of the resort  We were accessible to many restaurants and stores at this location  We even had the bank that we bank at across the street from us  I had been to Vegas many times and this was my first time not staying on the actual strip and I loved it  It was so quiet and people not running in and out all night and day  There were   restaurants on the property and they both had great food  The pool  of my goodness  the pool was fabulous  They also had whirlpools around the property and a hammock section  I am sorry to say that we didn t utilize the spa but  I heard from other guests that it was lovely  Now  we had a situation with our credit card before leaving but the bank fed ex a new one to us immediately at the resort  The front desk called us immediately when the new card arrived  I would definitely recommend this resort to anyone  We really enjoyed our anniversary and the resort  
P =>   Perfection Perfection Perfection WOW and double OMG  The Cancun Resort was Fantastic  We took months to carefully plan our two week holiday in Vegas and we were not disappointed except in one area  which I will get too in a minute  Only one thing was off putting We watched the reviews of the Cancun  here on Trip Advisor  very closely and at one point even wrote to the head office of the resort because we had concerns  Not only did we get a prompt reply of reassurrance from the general manager of the hotel himself  when we got there we were not disappointed with our room or the resort but the reassurance given by the general manager was not true  We had one bedroom apartment in building number two  Room       It was perfect  I will add our video of the room when we arrived so you can see  The quality of the video isn t great because its taken with my point and shoot camera but you will get the idea  The staff there was amazing  We had an unexpected lay over in Philly because of Tropical Storm Hannah  so when we arrive we desparately just wanted to go to our room and sleep  When we arrived at the Cancun  they had just lost complete power on one side of the resort and told us that we would have to wait to book in as their computer systems had lost power too  After we told them how tired we were and that aren t a new check in  that we should have checked in the day before and that I had called to let them know we had to lay over in Philly  they cheerfully found us a room in about   minutes  We got to our room and it was everything we had hoped and more  The concerige desk helped us each and every day with taxi s  info about the area  finding restaurants  walmart  grocery stores and even helped us plan our tours of the Grand Canyon and Hoover Damn  Everyday their was unlimited  knowledgable help with a smile  Our room was cleaned every single day  On the days we left a do not disturb sign on the door  housekeeping would call to make sure that we didn t want our room cleaned or trash taken away or clean towels  EVERY DAY      The pool area is just as gorgeous as it in the pics online  We enjoyed the pool by day and enjoyed the strip by night  We loved the water slides  well our son did and we loved the many hot tubs   Especially the one by the hammocks    They have noodles and really great water beds you can sign out  If you want a water bed get one early about     am  Some life guards only sign one out per room while others sign out as many as a person likes and leaves none for others  Its not very standardised  I just thinks some life guards don t follow the policy of one per room  The water beds were all in great condition The grocery store across the road was perfect to get our breakfast and lunch groceries from but make sure to take a taxi  It only costs a couple of dollars and it is much safer  As for taxi s make sure to ask for a Deluxe taxi  Don t use any others  Deluxe was the only ones that didn t rip us off  By the end of our first week there we knew our way around and stopped some cabbies from taking us the long way around  Food off the strip is so much better then on the strip  Its worth the few extra miles drive  Speaking of driving  The hotel is only about    mintues from the strip  We used the Cancun shuttle most of the time going into the strip  It was timely and comfortable but would definately rent a car next time  Everything is not as close as it looks  If you remember anything about Vegas    remember this  Everything is not as close as it looks  Sooo  to sum it all up  Cancun has th wow facture and is quiet and peaceful  Things do pick up there on Fridays and Saturdays when a lot of day passers come in with their coolers and picnics and kids  The review below about that is true and it was one of the things we wrote to the head office about and while they assurred us it wasn t true  it is  Unfortunately  a fair few of those day passers are less then quality people who respect others space  I do hope I stated that fairly  The only way to improve on our visit to the Cancun would be to stop the day trippers  coolers and picnicers which can make you feel like your vacationing in a trailer park  
P =>   Low end condo We arrived on a Sunday a couple of hours before check in and rooms were not available yet  which was fine  They directed us to another desk to get our parking pass and a temporary pool pass while we waited for our room  We declined and came back a few hours later  This time our room was ready  but they notified us they would be immediately taking out a      deposit from our credit card  OK  fine Proceeding to our room in our car  we first noticed the poorly designed parking situation  There are about   buildings in the complex  and they re building more  and each has a semi underground parking area which holds about       cars  Everyone else has to park outside  During our week stay  we were rarely fortunate to get an underground spot  The real drawback is that if you park outside  you must walk down the garage parking ramps to get to the elevators to your room  This is extremely dangerous  especially at night  Additionally  the resort attracts a lot of families and this is just not a good situation There is a card key reader which allows access into the waiting area for the elevators  This door was NEVER locked  Free access for anyone  The waiting area was always very dirty with loose trash  The   bedroom condo is smaller than many others we have stayed in except for the bathrooms which are very nice and very large  The kitchen is tiny  about the size of a closet  It does have a refrig  microvave  range  and dishwasher  Very little counter space  The living area is the absolute worst I have ever seen in a time share or condo  There is one sofa and one chair  The sofa is so cheap and uncomfortable that we couldn t sit on it for more than a half hour  Chair wasn t much better  Carpet was torn in several places and stained in others  TV was flat screen  but fairly small  Adequate number of channels  but no pay channels Bedrooms were OK  but also on the small side  Only one lamp on one side of the bed  Not enough space for the other side I guess  There was a spacious balcony  but was only furnished with two cheap plastic chairs  A C worked well  and rooms were fairly quiet expect for those slamming their doors in the hallway Families will love the pool area and schedule of activities available  There is a snack bar under the mayan temple which seemed to do a pretty good business  Staff was nonexistent except for the lifeguards and the periodic time share salesmen  Luckily  we were never solicited  Location at the south end of the strip is OK since your away from the hustle and bustle area  Across the street is a grocery store  irish pub  and a few other stores  You re about   miles from Mandalay Bay to the north  about a mile from the Silverton which ir right across I     and about   miles from the South Point casino resort  They do have shuttle service to the Tropicana There s not much choice right now for those looking for a timeshare exchange in Vegas and if you are  I d avoid this one unless you really need a big pool and want to be away from the strip  
P =>  Had a great time  My husband and I stayed at the Cancun for   nights  We had a   bedroom   bath villa  We liked being off the strip  because it felt more restful  The shuttle service worked great for us  but for some the   pm to      am schedule wouldn t work well  A taxi from Mandalay Bay to the resort was about         so it would be a considerable cost if you were out past the last shuttle every night  The rooms were very clean  but the furniture was old  However  the bed was comfortable  and that s the most important thing  I read one review about cockroaches and it scared me  but there wasn t a single bug in our room  I was very impressed with how clean it was The pool was fun  The water slides are fun even for adults  The only negative thing I have to say about the pool was how salty it tasted  Accidentaly swallowing water or even licking ones lips was not a pleasant experience  All that in consideration  the large pool was a much needed thing in the Vegas heat Getting groceries from Food Less was a great way for us to save money  It was just a short walk across the streeet  We ate breakfast lunch in our room and only ate dinners on the strip  Here s a tip for those who are beginning gamblers    Hooters Casino has       minimum blackjack tables and it s right next to the shuttle drop off  We were there almost everyday  Don t expect too much from the dealers in way of personality  it s sort of hit or miss  but the low minimum is a great way to learn the game without risking large amounts of money  Fremont Street is also a great place to play lower limit games  Ride the Deuce    The bus goes from the South of the Strip all the way to Fremont street  A one way ticket is        but a    hour pass is only        Once we learned about this  we didn t take another taxi unless it was an absolute necessity  This is by far the cheapest way to get around on the strip  Walking is often just a little too far  It s not the fastest transportation though  because it makes so many stops    but it worked for us  The bus that goes from the South tip of the Strip past the Cancun resort stops at  am  so it s not a good way to get back to the resort  
P =>   Perfect    I ve stayed at a lot of places in Vegas  but I would never stay anywhere else again   Had an absolute blast  Rooms were great with full kitchens  two bathrooms  living and dining rooms  and private balconies  It s like a oasis all in itself in and amongst the Vegas craziness  Wtih adult billards foos ball room  kids room  water slides  restaurants and louging areas  It provides a free shuttle to the Tropicana to get to the strip  has a grocery store directly across the street and a casino in walking distance  For my family     child  it s the perfect place to stay and be able to enjoy Vegas at the same time  We even hired a nanny service for going out on the strip one night  Watch out  they tried to over charge us   said that kids from separate families are additional  however didn t stipulate that over the phone   They are not part of The Cancun  and they are my only complaint  
P =>   WORKED A TREAT FOR US    adults   young kids  We had a   bedroomed apartment with   bathrooms  each with a jacuzzi tub  It was a really nice apartment in very nice condition   we were very pleased  Cost us      a night The breakfast in the cafe was lovely   really nice french toast and pancakes freshly made  The pools were great   the kids loved them and there was nothing better than to swim at night  we booked it because the pools opened at  am and shut at   pm  The location is about   miles from the edge of the strip  so not too far away at all In all  full marks  
P =>   Never again     I booked this resort directly from the timeshare owner  When our family of four arrived at the hotel we had no problems getting into the poolview room I requested We checked in on Thursday nite  Our room was a one bedroom two bath suite  The bathrooms were beautiful  the one off the master had a wonderful double jacuzzi tub  The room itself was on the small side  barely enough room for the king sized bed in the bedroom  and when the couch was folded out  it took up the entire living room  That was okay though  we weren t there to sit in our room I booked this hotel specifically for the pool  It is huge with   waterslides  Since it is over     degrees in Vegas at this time of year  I knew we would sit by the pool by day and go into town in the evening On Friday morning we went down to the pool   got a nice spot with a hammock  and checked out a couple of rafts from the equipment room  The rafts were completly falling apart  but they were great for floating around the pool and reading  It was so nice a peaceful  all of the pool chairs never filled up  One problem  someone pooped in the main pool mid afternoon and the pool was closed for the rest of the day Saturday morning  we went down to check out the rafts and the lifeguard told me they weren t checking the rafts out  although they sat in a stack on the floor   She said the rafts were in such bad shape they were sending them back and would have no rafts until the replacements came  I informed her that we had used the rafts the day before  and agreed they were in bad shape  but that we didn t mind  we would like to use them anyway  She refused  I then told her that i had brought my own raft  it was in the car  could I use mine  Absolutely not   I was told   NO OUTSIDE toys or rafts allowed  After speaking with the assistant general manager of the hotel  we were allowed to use their rafts for the day Sunday the rafts have left the building  No rafts to be had  I figured that was okay As the day wore on we noticed how crowded it was getting at the pool  it appeared to be local families  all with   or more children and ALL were bringing their own noodles and blow up rings    I couldn t believe how the rules had CHANGED  I felt like I was at a public pool in Tijuana  We payed good money for our room and I know the owner pays a decent maintenence fee for his timeshare  it is such a shame that the management of this hotel would let it turn into such a mess The activities listed on the daily calender  never took place  Our teenagers waited in the rec room to participate in the      ping pong tournament  no one from the hotel ever showed up  Although water aerobics was scheduled that never took place either I really don t know what the full story about this hotel  I just know that we will never stay here again  
P =>   Not Bad At All I used to drive past the Cancun not really knowing what it was all about    with the name and all  But  I did some research and found out it was a timeshare property that had a few other resorts around the west US and one in Mexico  I dug a little deeper and found out how this particular timeshare worked  I really like the concept  so I decided to buy  In a few of my earlier reviews  I wrote about Riviera Beach Resort and Cabo Azul Resort and Spa  Both of these are part of the Monarch Grand Vacation Timeshare Family  This is my first time at the Cancun and it was pretty cool  We were sent to the Tulum building and had a very nice two bedroom two bath Villa with balcony  Our balcony faced the north  and we had a non obstructed view of all the buildings in Vegas  Although  that won t last for long as  One Las Vegas   has   buildings perched on the lot directly north of the Cancun property and it appears they have   more to go  The Cancun itself is upgrading  too  According to the masterplan  there will be   more buildings put up to complete the project  It looked like some construction had already begun  but I didn t hear any noise from it  We had a really nice time at the Cancun and will definitely be back  
P =>   Loved the pool Me and my family enjoyed our stay here so much that the Venetian hotel left us wanting  I booked the   bedroom suite with   King bed   queen bed  and   queen sofa sleeper for      dollars a night  Room included   TV s    bathrooms with jacuzzi tubs in each bedroom  The tv s were small    inch but the seperate bedrooms made up for it  Also there was a balcony for our room nice sun set  Full kitchen so we saved quite a bit by not eating out all the time  I would definitely stay here again  also I  m going to recommend it for all my family and friends  Only drawback is you are on the far side of the strip  But it didn t matter to us because we had a rental car  Also internet is     dollars per night  Still all and all I loved this resort hotel  so did my kids they had   pools one with four slides   small   large  several hot tubs I was very pleased and would definitely recommend for a family  The main plus was it took us only   minutes to get to our room and not    minutes like the Venetian because the resort is not a whole city block  Enjoy your stay at this place  I hate to give resorts a review like this because they rip people off but I was pleased with this one for our   day stay for the money  
P =>   Pleasant Experience We stayed at the Cancun resort in e  I have two small children ages   and   we had a one bedroom which had ample space and a whirlpool in the master bedroom  Our room had a view of the pool which was beautiful at night  Our room had two bathrooms and a fully equiped kitchen it is about   miles from the strip you can drive straight down or you can catch the freeway which is close by  They also provide a shuttle that will drop you off at the tropicana every half hour until midnight  There were a few things that I didnt like they dont clean the rooms everyday and you have to keep asking for extra towels  They provide towels at the pool but you have to return them before you go back to your room  They say the pool is heated but the water was cold for my two year old he kept shaking when he would get in the water  They have quite hours after   pm so you are not supposed to use the whirlpool in your room after that until   am the next morning  Overall though we had a great time the grounds are beautiful and if you have a family the full kitchen really helps there is also a grocery store across the street  The beds are comfortable and I would stay there again  
P => Sweating on the balcony the only place allowed to smoke  No one bothered to tell us  nor does it state anywhere on the websites that this resort is basically a non smoking resort  There is no smoking in the units       fine if you do  or on the groundswith the exception of your balcony  That might not be quite as bad if you weren t in the middle of the dessert at     degrees plus I never would have booked there if I would have known  Come on  it s Las Vegas  
P =>  Great Place to Stay We loved this resort  We stayed in the Penthouse Suite     sq  ft   it was beautiful  The Pool area was great and the kids loved it  They had water slides in the Pyramid  The Bar Lounge was convenient and the Food was good and very inexpensive for eating in a hotel  The Concierge folks where very knowledgeable about anything in Las Vegas  There where stores right across the Blvd  
P =>  Everything I Knew About Vegas Went Out the Door I m much more of an expert than my   times in LV would indicate  The reason is because I read up so much on the city that I could tell you almost anything  For example  my family couldn t believe that I could drive around town  my first time  and know exactly where I was and where I was going Well  I had some opinions about Las Vegas that were totally blown away when I stayed at the Cancun resort for four nights five days I ll put it to you this way  from now on  I m going to try my hardest to stay at Cancun  or similar  when traveling to LV  Yes  you re off strip  Technically you re still on Las Vegas Blvd  but the strip is about   miles to the north  But this didn t stop any of us from seeing shows  shopping  or doing all the tourist things that the strip has to offer  in fact  I d say it was almost easier to do all these things because if you know your way around town  you can get there much quicker  and cheaper  than you can just by going up and down the strip taking a cab or the Duece  bus  One big secret that novice travelers might not know is that you can take side streets to get to the various hotels  In fact  I happened to come across a Las Vegas legend when he was going to his car at one of the hotels  and this would have never happened if I was just out with the lemmings The pool here is the best we ve ever seen or experienced  There are better pools out there  but few would be in Las Vegas and even fewer would be located in a residential setting  In other words  pools better than this cost you money to go    get it  Mandalay Bay would be the only residential pool that I m aware of that would be comparable  but you d have to fight their thousands of guests whereas at the Cancun Resort  it s so tranquil that you can literally lie in a hammock and read in the shade  To do anything similar at any other hotel would require that you pay for and reserve one of their cabanas     but at Cancun  this comes with your stay I used to manage a waterpark  and the water slides here were enough to get me to swim in their pools  The high slide was the fast kind and surprisingly long relative to other slides of its genre at different parks  This is also included with your stay  Many of us rode the waterslide and we ranged from about    yrs old to about     yrs old  This would be fun for kids and adults alike The Cancun is located just across from a grocery anchored retail center  The grocery store is Food Less and I ve generally found their name suitable to their prices A little ways down the street  maybe another block  is a gigantic strip mall complete with fast food  casual dining  Chipotle  Chilis   steak  Outback  and outlet malls  Tommy  etc  You will feel happy that you get to eat well locally  The food is also cheaper than what you pay on the strip    I know this for fact because I did a price comparison at the same restaurants For   nights we were in a basic   room suite  I had the smaller of the two rooms and it was adequate  Our bed happened to be a bit uncomfortable  but the other bed in the suite was nice  The final night we stayed in a presidential suite  It was perhaps about      SQFT complete with large screen TV  Bose sound system and each room was equiped with enormous jetted tubs  The two room standard also had a large jetted tubs  but the presidential ones were larger In fact  the master bathroom had a tub approximately     gallons big  I d guess you could fit   people in it fairly easily    but don t get any ideas  I didn t do that     They have a pool hall  amp  business center  but I didn t really check out the additional ammentities Cancun s poolside drinks were reasonably priced     for a mixed drink  and the whole family enjoyed a board game sitting pool side in the shade  Yes  such a thing can happen at Cancun  but don t try this at your local strip hotel because it will never work  All in all  I think I was spoiled by this experience and from now on  I will be looking to stay off strip  It s soooooooooo much better  You can actually enjoy the best of both words by staying in a place like Cancun    luxurious and quiet  not even the people at Four Seasons in LV get this  and      minutes from the center of the strip via a car     BONUS REVIEW In all of Las Vegas  their pools close alarmingly early   pm   They want you out the pool and out spending money  At Cancun  the pool hours are extended to    pm  There s nothing better than swimming on a warm night  It s my favorite time to swim Second  if you re into waterslides  I ll tell you how to get the most velocity out of them  It s all about body position  Like I said  I worked at one and had a lot of time on my hands in my younger days to figure out the optimal way to ride  To achieve maximum velocity  you want to lie as flat as possible and then arch your back slightly so that your weight is supported by your heels and your shoulder blade area  WIthout that extra friction from your torso  you will absolutely fly    in the pictures  you will see my brother riding normally and then you will see me  The difference is that when I exit the the tube  I m going so fast that I literally launch to the other side of the pool where the steps are  My brother  and everyone else that goes a normal speed  stops about    to    feet from the stairs    Enjoy your stay at the Cancun Resort     
P => Wow  This resort is great  It is on the south side of Las Vegas Blvd  about a mile from the strip  It is incredibly quiet and relaxing  There are about   hot tubs  an enormous pool with waterslides and hammocks everywhere  If you are looking for a relaxing getaway  this is it  After the hustle and bustle of walking through all of the foot traffic on the strip  it is WONDERFUL to come back to the peace and quiet at Cancun Villas  Our room had two bedrooms  two enormous bathrooms  a kitchen  dining room and living area  There is a grocery store down the road  Vons  so it was easy to eat in  I would only make one recommendation if you decide to stay here   you will need a vehicle to get around  Otherwise  your only access to the strip would be the hotel shuttle  
P =>   Loved Cancun      We booked this place through an exchange with my timeshare  I stayed here for a week with my bridal party for my wedding and it couldn t have been any better  The place is fabulous  The room was great and clean  we stayed in a   br suite   They provided a crib for my   year old  The pool was wonderful and really relaxing  It was enough room for me and the   girls that stayed with me  About    minutes from the strip and they provide a free shuttle  So it was close  but still far enough from the craziness  There s a grocery store right across the street which was great for stocking up on food and drinks  Overall  loved the place and would definitely stay here again  
P =>  Best pool   Cancun Resort has a very lovely  large pool complete with waterslides  The water temperature is nice and warm  The pool is huge    you can literally float on an air mattress and not bump into anyone  very relaxing   If you want some peace and relaxation   this is the place  Plenty of lounge chairs  situated in small  private groupings  We never had difficulty finding a chair at any time of the day  The   bedroom room was nice and clean  It had a spacious balcony  My only criticism is the carpet could be replaced  it wasn t dirty or stained  but showing it s age  The master bath had a   person jetted bath tub  Cancun resort also has a shuttle to the strip  we never used this service   In comparison to a larger  quot strip quot  resort  this was much easier to navigate and less stressful  Each building had it s own small covered parking lot  finding your vehicle was super easy  The pool was only a few steps from the elevator  Not all the crazy walking like the larger highrise resorts We had an enjoyable stay  This is a timeshare property   we purchased by the night through expedia  with no sales seminar required  
P =>  Great   Only if you don t want to go to the strip We were excited when we first arrived even with the complete apathy of the staff at the front desk and frank rudeness at the package gift counter  The pool area is very nice  exceptionally well kept  as was our room  old but clean   We arrived on a Wednesday with very few people in house and was the only day we were able to use the shuttle without incident Shuttle does not start until Noon and ends at      am  It is supposed to run every    minutes  It never did   we ended up spending a fortune in cab rides  Our last night becuase of an inept driver it took us nearly      hours to make the   mile trip  We were there for the last shuttle and the same driver shrugged   the bus was filled up and he was not coming back  If you are not planning on going to the strip or have a car and don t mind paying for the parking at the strip  it s a clean place to stay with a nice pool area One really big positive was the surprisingly great day Spa  If you decide to stay here anyway  make sure you hit the spa  Cindy was fantastic  
P =>   Great place to stay  this is a great place to stay  we got a great rate through Expedia and it was well worth it  The grounds and pool were beautiful and my    yr old loved the waterslides  My only complaint would be that there was no kiddie pool  I have a    month old and there was no place for her to play  The room was spacious and clean and the staff was friendly  I will definitely return  
P =>   Excellent Resort  We stayed at the Cancun Resort during il this year  We had a   bedroom suite  and the rooms were clean and spacious  and the decor very nice  The hotel itself has beautiful grounds and an amazing pool  which is heated  It is not on the strip but that did not bother us one bit  as it was just a short   minute drive to the strip  It is perfect for a relaxing stay We had a wonderful time at the Cancun and in Vegas and would definately consider staying here again  
P =>   Paid for a   bdr at the last minute given a  bdr  The company Las Vegas Getaways hooked me up with Monarch Resorts Cancun resort in Las Vegas Nevada through a radio promotion  Las Vegas Getaways called me on a Sunday the day of my Wedding after I told them what day to call  Then they put me through to the Cancun resort to make and pay for the reservation  At that point I paid for a   bdr suite  this was back in   now   days before the reservation i get an email confirming a   bdr  I call both the resort and Las Vegas Getaways and I m told that they can give me my money back but that is all they can do  At this point it is to late for me to make alternate reservations  so I pretty much have to take it up the u know what  
P =>   great  This is a great resort for a fairly low price  It is at the far south end of Las vegas Blvd  the strip   We discovered  thanks to GPS  it is much quicker to get on I    than to drive up and down the strip  The resort was very clean  Check in was a breeze  They let us check in a few hours before check in  The pool and surrounding area are immacuate   The suites are a little small but adequate  We had a two bedroom two bath  Both have whirlpoool tubs and they both worked well  We used the very large balcony daily and nightly  We had a view of the mountains  The sunrise and sunset were dramatic  Everything in our suite was clean  They say no daily housekeeping  but we had it daily without asking  Very friendly staff for the most part  The concierge could be more helpful  She stared at her computer for   minutes before acknowledging my presence  Overall  great place to stay and will return  
P =>   Great stay at the Cancun My sister and I rented a two bedroom suite and were very surprised by the size  It was huge  One bedroom had a king size bed with ensuite that was huge and the other bedroom had a queen size bed and the bathroom was located just outside the bedroom and was also very large  Both bathrooms had jacuzzi tubs  We took advantage of the Food   Less store which is located just a   minute walk from the resort and bought everything we needed for breakfast and we went there and bought our dinner one night  We had the best roasted chicken from their deli we had ever had  The pool area was fabulous and the hotel staff are very attentive and polite  It reminds you of a hotel resort down in the Caribbean  If you stay less than   days you do not get daily maid service unless you want to pay for it  but they do come in and change the towels and take the garbage out daily  We found the shuttle service quite good and the drivers were very friendly  If I had any criticisms it would be that the furnishing in our room were a bit out dated and you could not open the dishwasher door to put your dishes in unless you opened up the refrigerator door  Overall it was a fantastic stay and great bargain  We both decided that we would definitely stay there again  but would ask for a room overlooking the pool area  
P =>  Loved it  After reading some of the reviews I was a little bit apprehensive  I loved the place and our stay wasn t long enough  The pool was great  the hot tubs even better and the fact that the place had slides was even more awesome  Our room was clean  had two bathrooms and a pull out sofa  It easily slept    A bigger plus was that the building we stayed in was energy saving  yes   so if you are energy concious  this is very comforting  note  yes I do know that nothing about las vegas is enery saving  We took the shuttle a few times and the drivers were friendly and when we walked around the staff maintenance greeted us every time  My son and I ate breakfast at the Coba Cafe  which in the pyramid and it was great  He got two pig pancakes  a THREE egg omelette  hashbrowns  a big piece of ham and hot cocoa  He couldnt eat it all and had enough to take back some to his cousin who got full too  the only drawbacks were  is that some of the pool staff was young  and were more interested in their freinds than working  but that is teenagers for you  We drove across to the food   less and bought groceries which was great  There is also a   buck movie rental machine in there if you want to go that route and have a movie night The shuttle did get full at the end of the evening when everyone was trying to get on the last shuttle back  the fare was only    bucks from the MGM  which is the first last stop on the monorail  to the resort  which is okay for me  II am going back soon  when it is warmer to stay at the pool all day    they had activities planned for young children    There is even an observation deck on one of the buildings that I didn t get too  and I dont want to forget the best part   the bathtubs   Both rooms had jacuzzi tubs  So if you want relaxing then this is the place to stay  its quiet  clean  and pretty  and then you can go out and party all night at the strip  
P =>   peaceful restful vegas Ok I was concerned about going to Las Vegas for my son s wedding  I had a little bronchitis and didn t relish breathing smoke so we stayed at the Cancun  Woke up on a beautiful sunny day went out by the pool and heard the sounds of waterfalls and birds    bedroom suite with comfortable pull out sofa so a total of   people slept in the suite  says slept   but my son is over   ft   Approx a mile from the strip  I rented a car but the cabs make frequent runs  Very family friendly  jacuzzi  waterslides  game room billiards  patio  across the street from the library  Out let mall in the next block       in the next block for a slurpee fix  Room had   king and the other room had   double beds  bathrooms very large each had a jucuzzi tub and shower  Very clean  Carpet was worn funiture drab but clean and very reasonably priced   Did go to the casisnos and as I predicted was very uncomfortable due to the smokes impact on my breathing  
P => Excellent highly recommend it Great value for the price  Fairly new  so smells good  Clean  roomy  nice furniture  Its a suite with kitchen  dining room and living room      bathroom off living room with a folding wall to separate off the living room so it can be used as an extra bedroom    bedroom unit can sleep      bedroom unit can sleep    No gambling so nice and quiet  Highly recommended  
P =>   great family friendly place My family stayed at this resort as timeshare owners  We had a   month old child  and    yar old grandparents with us  The staff was very friendly at check in  The   bedroom suite had a kitchen with stove and refrigerator  living room with pull out sofa  and dining room  The suite was clean  and the bathrooms generous  The rooms were large enough that we could fit a portable crib at one side  The pool area was clean and had a slide  Our group had great fun hanging out at the pool area  The snack bar had good food to choose from  It is not in the middle of the Strip  but there is shuttle service going to and from the main area of the Strip  The spa was small  and it did not make efforts to conceal clutter of lotions  so it was not as relaxing as it could have been  My only criticisms are that the bathtubs were very deep for older people to step in and out of  the latch on the balcony door was difficult to use and we thought we were locked out once  and the sofabed could not be left open during the day or else it blocked the whole living room  
P =>   Loved it only one small problem already booked again for this year  We stayed here for   days during Spring Break of     Reserved through a hotel internet site  not as part of a time share  This was our first stay at a non casino hotel  so we weren t sure how we would like it  It was really a nice place for us  We brought our young son who loved the pool and waterslides  On our first day  we went grocery shopping and spent about      for    for breakfast and lunch food for the whole stay  which was great  We spent mornings at the pool  ate lunch back in the room  then went  quot out quot  in the afternoon evenings  So we saved a lot  only buying one restaurant meal a day  Still had lots of  quot gambling time quot   They have a complimentary shuttle  but it was always full  so we just took our own car   They should probably have more frequent shutles  although we were there during a busy week  We had the one bedroom last time  which was great  The kitchen was fully functional with full size stove  fridge etc  I don t understand the comments about the kitchen being small  I thought it was great for a hotel time share  The carpet was a little worn  so hopefully they are working on replacing it  There are sliding shutters so you can close off the living room for privacy as a second bedroom  and still access the kitchen  so that was nice  Otherwise  yeah it was a little  quot dark quot  if you had the shutters closed  but it is decorated in those colors  tans browns etc  so why don t people just open their shutters and let some light in  We had the slider open a lot  with a little balcony to sit on  it was very nice  We had no problems with bugs  dirty linens  trash etc  So not sure where these other travelers stayed  It was very clean and a really nice place for our family  We had one small problem with a maintenence man who chased my   year old son and myself out of a jacuzzi because the capacity was exceeded  although the majority of the occupants were kids about   years old who were in there with their parents  The sign clearly indicated no kids under     I think that was the age   But since we were the last to get it  he kicked us out instead of all of the underage kids   So we went to the next jacuzzi  there are many   and he followed and kicked us out of that on too  saying it was an  quot adults only quot   Ugh   That was frustring and I did complain to management  although I would say that they didn t seem too interested in my complaint  But otherwise  we had a nice time and are staying again next month for Spring Break     this time in a two bedroom  I would recommend to anyone for the price  
P =>   Fantasic value  Very happy  Our AAA travel agent found this for our Vegas stay  What a pleasant surprise  We were very happy with it and felt we got excellent value  This place is now on the the top of my list of places to stay in Las Vegas The room was great  It had a fully stocked kitchen  a dining room  a living room  a bedroom with a huge comfortable bed  and an enormous on suite bathroom  The bathroom featured a jacuzzi tub  There is also another bathroom with shower off the living room The staff were friendly  courteous  and efficient it is a    minute drive down LV Blvd from The Strip  If you are driving in LV  then this is a great deal  You can drive up to the hotels on the strip and part for free up there I did not get a chance to walk around the grounds  or try out their pool  etc  But being the middle of uary and cold outside  it was not an issue  
P =>   Great Place to Stay Stayed here with my husband and two kids  in a one bedroom condo unit  I was very skeptical after reading the reviews posted here and I must say all the bad reviews this resort has received are all nonsense  We checked in on Sunday  early evening  and was welcomed with warm chocalate chip cookies and many smiling faces We got to our room and called for a rollaway  but they do not provide them  so the kind front desk staff offered to have extra bedding and an egg crate mattress brought to our room  The room was very clean and amenties were just as stated on the resorts website  The extereior and common areas of the resort were always clean and I felt very safe letting our    year old daughter walk the grounds with her   year old brother each night The pool was a lot of fun for the kids  they had three of the waterslides open and a lifeguard is on duty the whole time the pool is open We ate dinner in the Caribe Lounge one night and the food was very tasty no foreign object of any kind   and the staff hlepful and friendly Every evening the kids would go to the club house and play pool for a couple of hours We will definitely be staying there again  
P =>   Simply a nice place We ve been to Vegas so many times and stayed at different strip hotels but our last   winter visits were booked in this resort via Monarch Resorts  The place is about     miles to the strip which is a good thing as it limits your time in the casino  remember  you will lose   of    times you gamble  and enables you to explore the other Vegas and do other stuff  like shopping in the nearby Belz factory outlet or visiting Hoover Dam and Lake Mead The resort is well maintained  Our   bedroom   bath suite was clean and the king bed was comfortable The living room had a sleeper sofa  The suite was located on the ground floor of the rear left building and there were ample outdoor parking  The wifi connection was really strong  Youtube loaded quick  and rate was about     a day or     for   days  If you have no laptop there were PCs available in the recreation room which also had   pool tables and   pingpong tables  Front desk was friendly and room service was prompt  Heating was OK  There were complimentary cookies and water at the reception area  Shuttles to and from the strip  Tropicana  ran past midnight  Since it was winter and the low temps were in the   s  the swimming pools were closed but I saw kids in the heated jacuzzis  Housekeeping was very limited  once a week   so re use your towels  call room service to request fresh ones  and throw your garbage in the bins located in the basement parking  The self service baggage trolleys were quite helpful The advantage of a timeshare suite versus the hotel is having the kitchen which allows you to wake up late and eat in  kitchen small but functional   This is not only convenient but also economical  We loaded up on groceries at the Food   Less across the street for     and that took care of our breakfasts  snacks and brunches for   days  Next to Food   Less were restaurants and stores including Starbucks and Panda Express  The only complaint we had have was the noise from the sliding door caused by howling wind one night that was really loud in the living room  But then we were too sleepy to care Two Vegas tips  traffic is always heavy on the strip so remember these two side streets  Koval and Paradise  If you are into buffet and gambling bargain deals  buy a coupon book  check out Las Vegas Advisor s     book that has plenty of   for   offerings  Have a winning Vegas trip  baby  
P =>  Very Nice Resort   Clean   Quiet   Asteticly Pleasing I really enjoyed my stay at the Cancun Resort  I really don t have a whole lot more to say than what previous positive reviewers have said   I had just read a few bad reviews before my visit and I just want to set the record straight that this place is far from being a dump  The The condos were very nice and I loved the furnishings  The Pool was nicely landscaped with plenty of little private shaded nooks throughout the property  Loved the free pool rafts and hammocks  Everyting you need is on site   The convience store had just about anything an travler would be looking for  It was very easy to get the the strip Casinos    Just pull out of the driveway onto Las Vegas Blvd and drive north about   miles  Don t except the same sort of service you would get at a Four Seasons Resort    This is one of those timeshare s that is not like a hotel resort   So you must critique it that way  As a timeshare  it is one of the nicest I ve stayed in  Overall  my stay was a very comfortable one  They did have a sports bar by the pool that stayed open until      PM that also serves food I do recommend a car since this resort is a bit away from public transportation    I enjoyed staying somewhere without a Casino since I was there for an entire week  it really didn t matter  
P =>  Superior Resort   Best Experience Ever In Vegas This is a Winner and deserves a much higher rating  atleast    points higher   Highly Recommended  We just returned from the Monarch Cancun Resorts in Vegas and it was the best experience at any resort we ve ever had  The room was very clean sanitized  the service was excellent and the Cancun people were super nice  The customer service by the entire staff made our stay very enjoyable and relaxing Excellent Excellent Excellent   the room  two bedroom in the newer wing  was as good as any resort we ve visited in the last    years and it was very clean  The beds were very comfortable  We stayed in the newer wing section  Building     Yes  we were skeptical on what to expect because of some of the negative reviews that we read in trip advisor  but we were pleasantly suprised at the excellent room  Excellent   Pool  Game room and bar service  I especially enjoyed relaxing in the poos and jacuzzis We can t wait to return  
P =>  Awesome    After I planned this exchange I went on line to check out the site  I found some of the uncomplimentary reviews and began to worry  Well I want to put anyone s mind to rest who has the same thoughts  This resort is awesome  It is off the strip and thus quiet  The staff were always attentive and helped us whenever we asked  Our   bedroom unit was spotless  well equiped and we actually used the kitchen and   of us were in there at once  Everything that I needed was stocked in the kitchen and there is a Food   Less right across the street for supplies The one hard thing was transportation  There is no shuttle from the airport so you need to get a cab  or one of the CTS     airport shuttles  There is a CanCun shuttle which takes you to the Tropicana  and the South Point Shuttle also comes by  There is a trolley which comes by fairly often and you can get a day pass       or a night pass       but you have to transfer several times and it can be time consuming  If you aren t on a schedule it is very easy to get around  Leave plenty of time tho if you have a time schedule  The pool was beautiful  There was always somewhere to sit and they had good towels and a nice little store for sundries and souveniers  fair prices   They had lifegaurds there until    PM  A couple of the hot tubs were a little cool  and I would have liked the hot tubs to be open later  The restaurant is fairly generic  but we had room service several times and the food was great  I had a salmon dinner which was one of the best I have ever had   The concierge was helpful and had answers to all our questions  The front desk staff were welcoming and check in and check out was a breeze  The lounge is well staffed and has food available later than the restaurant  The bartenders are all great  There is a exercise room and a full service Day Spa  Both are on site and it isn t hard to get an appointment  Each building has available guest washing facilities  We were in the main building  which is the oldest building and had a view directly towards the pool  The room and resort were so comfortable and relaxing that we spent alot of time right there  One other item that people complained about was the A C and ours was great  The spa tubs were wonderful and there was ample hot water to actually use them  ALL IN ALL it was a wonderful resort  wonderful staff and I would go again in a heart beat  
P =>   Enjoyed but understand the bad reviews We just returned from our stay at the Cancun resort  First of all  I m a very easy person to please and I can understand why this resort has gotten all the bad reviews  I ve stayed at two other timeshare resorts which were both immaculate with huge kitchens and washer dryer in the unit  At the Cancun resort we had a one bedroom Villa with   bathrooms  This Villa was about   of the size of the other resorts we ve stayed at  And when you read that only one person can be in the kitchen at a time that is not an exaggeration  The kitchen is very small  This didn t bother us because we never used it anyway  Overall  the villa was clean and comfortable  However  if you are looking for perfection then this is definitely not the place for you  The lampshade in the living room had a huge whole in it  It looked like the light bulb got too hot and burned right through the shade  In the bathroom right off of the living room  it looked like the sink had been ripped from the wall and just placed back and the shower did not even work  the water didn t turn on   In the bathroom off of the bedroom  there were several scuffs on the walls and the towel rack had been ripped off of the wall and was just lying on the floor  wholes in the wall were it used to be   It seems they would have attempted to fix all of these issues before the next guest arrived  With all that said  we didn t spend much time in the room anyway and the swimming pool area was fabulous    The pool was very clean and very spacious  I always found a lounge chair to lie in and always got a raft when I wanted it  We never had a problem parking although underground parking was limited  We would definitely return because we liked the location  off the strip   unit was clean  and pool area was wonderful  
P =>  horrible disgrace  I TRADED IN HERE through interval international    DO NOT waste your week like we did  this place is a disgrace   garbage all over the elevator floors all week and garbage all over the garage level all week also  there was no toilet paper or tissues or soap in the rooms  we were in the newest building and the lampshade was torn  the carpet was filthy and full of holes  they never came for the mid week cleaning as promised  so we called and they charged us      for the cleaning  the pool was ice cold  this place does not deserve   star it is awful  i turned the knob on the sink and the knob fell off  the outlet did not work for the hair dryer and maintenance could not fix it either  What a horrible disappointment  do not be fooled by the interval rating  listen to the people that actually stayed here  i wish i listened to all the bad comments before i wasted my week here  knick knacks are glued to the shelf in the unit and evidently were broken and since they were glued down you now have the remaining broken piece permanantly attached to the shelf  HORRIBLE DISGRACE  STAY FAR AWAY    
P =>   Money Spent On Pool    Not Rooms    This place is nice from the pics posted on the Interval website  though upon arriving and after inquiring we found out the room pics on the site are of the Penthouse Suite  not their regular rooms We stayed in building   the Yuccatan  aptly named   The place is a dump  They appeared to have spent all of their funds on the pool area and left the rooms alone To begin with  there is no a c working in the elevators  for the whole week not a bit of a c in any of them  Of course when you took the elevator to view the penthouse suite on the presentation that a c worked just fine The room is billed on Interval has having a kitchen  it should be a LK instead of K  The kitchen is extremely small  only large enuf for one person at a time  and if someone wants in the frig or oven you have to step out of it so they can open the door  The dishwasher rack was broken  the door that holds in the powders wouldnt stay shut  There was very few utensils  plates  bowls  etc in a place that is suppose to accomodate   people  Basic kitchen supplies like soap had not been restocked  Food under the kitchen table  someone did not vacuum under there The living room was lacking furniture again for a place that says it will accomodate   people  had   chair and   small couch  The place is very dark  whoever put in the canister lights in the ceiling put them all   in a row on one side of the rooms only in each room leaving the rest of the room dark  The master rooms mind blinds had weights on the strings from where they had been retied so much  the strings were off the slats and they didnt close completely which left it very bright in there at night cause there is a huge light right outside the window that comes on at night that you cannot turn off  The master is small with a king bed  though seems more of a queen size to us but the night stands are huge things with huge clunky lamps and lampshades from a gone by era that take up most of the room  A corner ent center takes up what little space is left  The shower is awful  its large  largest I ve ever seen though didnt matter when opening a Pepsi gets you more pressure than this shower has  you have to stand directly under it to feel anything and I m sure a few days I never got wet at all  The bathrooms are extremely long though for what reason we dont know  it was just wasted space that could of been used for the kitchen  bedroom  anywhere else really  They have huge fake plants sitting around that take up lots of room  we moved all of those to a corner  they added nothing to the decor and were oddly sitting in the strangest places where they were directly hindering you trying to walk to rooms  A ceiling fan when you first enter the room is great  but why not put any in the rooms or living room  You can only turn the heat ac to off or on  low  med  or high  No picking a temp you d like and just set it and forget it  A lot of mirrors  if you re into that you wont be disappointed  They put them above each bed  in the hallways to the bedrooms and in the eating area behind the kitchen table  Why is anybodys guess  None of us were keen on watching ourselves eating in the mirror   lolThere are no baking pans  only a couple old pots and pans that are not non stick and   sizes of pyrex dishes  thats it  We had to wash utensils just so someone else could eat  and there are no drawers in the kitchen  all of the utensils are up in the cabinets  thats how small this kitchen is   no dang drawers  LOLI would not recommend this place  If you can avoid it  please do at all costs  On the other hand  all of their money has gone into the pools and waterslides area which I was told is very nice  I didnt personally go check them out If you like dark  dingy and most things broken or not working then this is definately the place for you  
P =>   LOVED IT We are owners of this resort via timeshare  After reading some of the reviews I didn t know what to expect but after we spend a week there for our   th Anniversary  I wonder if the people writing the bad reviews stayed at the same hotel     We had a beautiful room  Wonderful friendly service  staff and a fabulous time    I will stay at this resort every time I go to Vegas  My husband and I travel alot both in our RV and at our Time shares and this in one of the Best      I can only give it    stars in every catagory       
P =>   Not a   Star Resort We were there           had   seperate two bedroom units  Overall we were   people  The resort is pretty far from the strip which can be a plus or neg  depending on your funds for gambling  I have to agree with the previous reviews of the rooms looking dreadful  It is VERY true  It s very dark  depressing and not mexican at all  The furniture looks like it was picked up at a yard sale in need of lots of TLC  The kitchen is super small  the only plus is the bathrooms  They are huge  they probably could have cut them in half and made bigger closets  The closets are teenie tiny  The food in the cafe is descent  priced okay  The place does not have a business center that lets you use a computer and printer  The major complaint was that the shuttle service realy sucks  They re tiny shuttle vans some with working a c that only seat    people  Everytime we went to get in line there was already about    if not more waiting  so we d get a cab  which we always had to get   cabs  Pricey if you multiply this times   days  The worst is trying to get a shuttle for the airport  I had to call about   different shuttle companies to hire a bus      of them don t go outside the strip so do your homework before you go if it s a big party I think the tahiti village looked alot better  
P =>  The pictures don t lie If you view the pics of the resort on the web you will not be disppointed upon arriving  The rooms are spacious and the view from the balcony of the desert  outstanding  It feels nothing like the usual  quot hotel quot  experience  The kitchen is a nice touch  The only thing I disliked was the shower  The water would leak onto the tile floor of the restroom because there is no shower curtain  That weekend was too windy for a swim but the pool is great especially for children  We ate at the bar and the food was reasonably priced  The staff was helpful in assisting me when I locked myself out of the room  This place is very family friendly and great  Even though your a short drive from the strip and we had a car the resort does provide shuttle service  
P =>  Spacious well appointed apartment like suites  Great for family travel  We got booked at the Cancum resort because Travelocity screwed up a previous reservation at a different Las Vegas hotel  I don t recommend ever using Travelocity again  but in this case  I m glad we got to stay at the Cancun It s about   miles due south from the southend of the Strip so you need a car  You need a car anyway  if you re planning to do any significant tours of the Strip  The hotel is made up of apartment suites and has something like     separate buildings  I can t remember the exact number   The theme is mayan  and there s a parklike area in the middle with a mockup of a big mayan temple and a water slide  Great way to keep the kids entertained  We got one of the one bedroom suites  they have two bedroom ones as well   It had a small full kitchen  one dining room area  one living room area that could convert into it s own bedroom  and the master bedroom  There are two bathrooms  one off the master bedroom that is gigantic with a whirlpool bathtub  and another one off the living room  nd bedroom  I can t remember the exact price I paid for it  but I do remember it being quite the steal  Most likely it is a better bargain because it is off the Strip  But if you re going to have a car anyway  why not stay a bit further away and pay a lot less  
P =>  Another great weekend at the Cancun  We are a member of the Cancun Resort and other properties and love going there  The rooms are great and the people that work there are super friendly and helpful  I like that there is a fully stocked kitchen and tv s in the rooms and living area  The linens are fresh and clean  Our kids love the pool and water slides and the game room gives them some extra activities to do after a long day walking around on the strip  The kids can bring movies to watch and we fill the fridge with lots of snacks for a fun weekend get away  Most of the other guests members are friendly and we have met other couples and famlies there  We like that it is not right on the strip  because we can relax with our family without all the crazy Vegas atmosphere going on non stop  After all day or night on the strip coming back to the resort to hang out and relax the until late the next morning is great  The resort offers a shuttle to casinos and cabs are available also  We usually take our own vehicle and valet park it at one of the local casino s on the strip  Casino s will valet park for free  just have to tip the valet I can t stress enough how great the staff at the Cancun is  They always work with us on any issues and really do a great job to make sure your experience is fun  I say this because when we were checking out  there was a guest that was giving the staff a hard time because they arrived without making reservations and  quot expecxted quot  a room  Just because you are a member  does not mean you can just show up when you want  Make reservations ahead of time and be extra polite and they will do anything for you  Knowing the staff  had there been something available I m sure they would have accomodated this individual  
P =>   Awfully depressing rooms  The room was decorated with very depressing browns and earth tones and the furniture was very hard and uncomfortable  Service was terrible as they don t clean the rooms everyday   we could tell by the dusty lamps and tables  and we asked for a pillow and we were abruptly told they were all out and hung up on  be okay for families who just want to hang out by the pool in the summer  but for adults looking for something nice  I wouldn t suggest it  Way too far from the strip or a casino to really enjoy Vegas   even if you drive  it s too far out  There s no casino nearby which defeats some of the reason most people go to Vegas I think  
P =>   Geat value for resort  kitchen is a plus I LOVE LOVE THE CANCUN RESORT  I have stayed at the location several times  I love the kitchen area and I love the rooms overall  The jacuzzi tub is a plus  Highly recommend  
P =>   Great Value My buddy got a time share in this location  At first we were worried because it seemed so far from the strip  I must say for the price we paid about        a night it was so worth it   I know he paid extra for his time share program  It had   full bedrooms and bathrooms and a decent sized living room  dining   kitchen  We just stayed there for   nights because we were going elsewhere and this was a meeting spot  I loved the morning bar by the HUGE pool  The hammocks are great  We during the early part of the day  They offer free floating boats and have a fun kiddie slides  The resort is pretty big and they offer free rides to the strip  Only till like   ish  All in all  it was a great place to stay that was away from the strip at a great price 
P =>   Having owned   timeshares            First of all let is be said that we have been great fans of timeshares having owned up to   weeks at resorts in Maine and Hilton Head Island  Initially we were very impressed with the site as we checked in  The hallways were actually cold which is always welcoming when coming in from the heat  We were staying with family in a one bedroom  pull out sofa in the livingroom set up  I give the resort kudos for being able to pull off privacy in that setting  Particularly liked the pull out shutters that made the livingroom private  The room didn t appear that bad initially  a little on the dark side  but bearable  For a room that was  quot putting its best foot forward quot  in an effort to make a sale  it was awful  The rug in the livingroom area from the bathroom  light switch behind the door when it opened beside the couch  was worn  discolored and frayed  as in     inch strands of rug fiber      the walls were filthy throughout parts of the livingroom and they needed painting   Thought to self   quot What ARE they doing with the maintenance fees  quot   The air conditioning was non functional so we had windows open during the day and at night  Family member with allergies had a reaction to the dust and mold within the unit  Must say that a call for service of the air conditioning was answered promptly and was quickly resolved We called the desk to ask about sheets for the pull out sofa and were pleased to learn that the bed was already clean and made up  Shifting to bedtime                  upon pulling out the sofa bed the sheets looked excessively wrinkled and then upon closer inspection saw several    inch long strands of hair and  stop reading if you are squeemish  found a big round circle of what appeared to be  quot body fluid quot  on the top sheet          aaarrrrggghhh       my husband tore the sheets from the mattress  complete with the mattress pad and threw them in the hallway  marched down to the desk and told them what happened and demanded new sheets and a clean mattress pad  The desk person never flinched or apologized but did have fresh sheets delivered within    minutes       The parking set up where we were required parking on the side of the building  across from afore mentioned construction  and then a walk through a bit of an alley between the two buildings  There was no lighting at all and no visible security  The buildings have no electrical security  No key cards to get into the buildings which are wide open  no key necessary for the elevator   The resort has LOTS of potential and could do well with better management  improved cleanliness and some security  Again  it has potential  its a shame it isn t be realized   The location is great and very accessible to the strip       that said  would I stay there again  Nope  just can t get past the sheet thing     
P =>   Great for kids This place was fabulous  My husband had to go to Vegas for a convention and My little girl and I came along  We found this place and my daughter and I didn t leave durring the day  The suites are great and it s so great to have a full kitchen when traveling with kids  My daughter loved going swimming but it was a bit cold so she would want to go inside to swim in the huge bathtub in our suite  Perfect  would definatly stay again  
P =>   Love Love Loved It  My fiance  amp  I stayed in the one bedroom villa with a pool view in the Cancun Building  and I must say it was like I was in paradise  When we first arrived at the resort we were a little dissapointed on how far the strip was from the resort and there s a lot of construction going on  but needless to say that didn t ruin the experience  A   minute drive away from the strip wasn t going to bother me  The staff were very friendly  and the check in was a breeze The one bedroom villa was exquisite  It was perfect for the two of us  The master bath jacuzzi tub was a hit  and the mini kitchen helped save us money since we were t here for a week  The pool was so relaxing  the palm trees and ICE COLD pool helped us forget that it was about    degrees     am  The new Caribe Cafe was a great place to get a quick bite  as well as their sundries store just incase you forgot something at home  Food   Less  Shopping Outlet  Washington Mutual  etc  was all located right across the street so that was a major convenience  THe noise level was as if you were at home  very comfortable and the AC in the room was great Housekeepers come in midweekly and clean up the room  we came back to see that the dishes were in the dishwasher and the towels were replaced  the bed was made and everything was like we had just checked in Overall  we loved this place  We were given a week at the Cancun Resort as a gift from a timeshare holder  They are in progress of expanding the resort  by the time they re done we ll be back again for sure  as a timeshare holder  Word of advice  get a POOL VIEW room  it really enhances the trip  
P =>  Awesome resort This RESORT is spectacular and is exactly what its name describes  a  quot resort quot   I my opinion you could stay at this resort and be totally self sufficient  if that is what you desire  In a city like VEGAS  having a room s  like what Cancun provides is priceless  The fact that you are able to cook in the full kitchens that the villas provide is a great idea  add to that a grocery store located right across the street from this property and you have a great combo to save some money  The Amenities at this resort are first class  pools  hot tubs  water slides  restaurant  game rooms  free shuttle to the strip  the list goes on and on  If possible I highly recommend the penthouse suite  one word decribes these rooms UNBELIEVABLE  My wife and I will stay at this RESORT for many years to come   
P => nice resort dirty pool This is a very nice resort  We have used a number of other resorts and we really liked this one  The pool was nice with the fountains and many hottubs but the bottom of the pool was dirty and was not cleaned once the entire week that we were there  The units themselves are very nicely equipped with amentities such as a kitchen and seperate dining areas  They have a nice gameroom on site with foosball  pool and ping pong tables  They also have a large screen TV in the gameroom to watch  The staff are all very friendly and helpful  They have a shuttle on site that goes back and forth to the strip numerous times a day  They have a laundry room with   washer and dryer  They didn t have a change machine for the washer dryer even though they were coin operated machines  They need to have a washer dryer in each unit because we have been to other resorts before that had them inside the individual units and you could start a load of laundry before you left for the day  It is always better to go home with all clean clothes than to have to spend a lot of time washing dirty clothes when you get back home  We may or may not use this resort again  mainly because we like to visit many resorts  
P =>   Poor security  great resort I loved the resort but had a latex pillow stolen out of my room by someone in housekeeping  I presume   I admit it   I have to have my very own pillow when I travel  It is pretty sad that the resort can t provide simple security for valuables in your room  not jewels  watches  cash  etc   There is a safe for those   but my pillow wouldn t have fit in the safe    It was just pillow for heavens sake  Anyway  security wasn t helpful at all in finding the pillow or offering any compensation  I probably won t stay here again  
P =>  We loved this place    My husband and i stayed at the Cancun for   days  we really thought the facilities were very nice  the pool was beautiful  we did take advantage of the daily shuttles  we are pretty easy going travelers so even if the guys were late hey oh well we are on vaca right  the only thing i would say we had a problem with was perhaps they should have an airport shuttle  oh well overall we had a great time and stay at the Cancun  
P =>   A good surprise This resort is a gem    I had never stayed at a Grand Monarch property    wasn t sure what to expect    the room  a one bedroom  had everything one needed    and was good for privacy if you had   people    two baths and a moveable partition  The bed was a bit soft    could be uncomfortable if you had a bad back    but that was about the only negative   parking garage nice  pool area EXCELLENT with the most attentive lifeguards I ve ever seen    many water slides and they didn t even laugh if a    year old went down  me   They had a steel band on Saturday    free ice cream sundaes by the pool    water aerobics    and plenty of chairs in sun and shade    what more could you ask    easy access to the strip  better if you have a rental car  and every staff member from janitor to security was friendly Would stay there again in a minute    
P =>  Loved this resort    I just came back yesterday from spending   days and   nights at this lovely resort  This resort is located on the strip  but it was at least   mile away from all the  quot mass confusion quot  from the other hotels casinos They did have a shuttle bus available for you to go to those casinos  but I preferred to use my car to go there The place was lovely and full of amenities  such as the room itself I stayed in a one bedroom villa  which consisted of  when you first walk in  a dining room  with table and chairs  a small kitchenette  with everything except the food  you need to prepare and cook any meals  I was impressed with the refrigerator  stove  microwave  toaster  and blender  and all the utensils and pots and pans with accessories you will need  the bedroom had a full bath  with a hugh tub with a whirlpool jetstream  and two sinks witha hairdryer  the living room had a tv with a dvd vcr player  the other tv was in the bedroom   and was enclosed in a woodpanel with with doors you can open and close The sofa had a pull out bed to be used for another party  a separate small bathroom  with shower  and a balcony  The employess acted very professional and courteous  I did have one problem with trying to heat the room  because the weather was cold  I called the front desk and they called someone from housekeeping who came in minutes  I enjoyed this place so much  I barely left it  This was truly a home away from home   I hope to go back again soon   
P =>   Nice room   comfy bed My stay was a bit unconventional   I went to Vegas for a tradeshow and didn t utilize the property much except for sleeping  The location is a bit south   probably     miles south of where the strip starts and about    miles from the Las Vegas Convention Center  but that could be a good thing as well  The entrance and lobby were nice   it seemed pretty new  I had a two bedroom and I was impressed by the granite counters in the kitchen and both bathrooms  yes  a two bedroom with two bathrooms   both had large whirlpool tubs   the one in the master bedroom was huge  Nice tile floors   it was very much like an apartment with a dining table  living room and like I said  a kitchen with a fridge  microwave  oven and dishwasher  I think    I wish I had stayed longer to enjoy and try out the day spa   maybe next time  I ll be back for sure  
P =>  A Few Concerns I stayed here for a birthday trip with my boyfriend  We were here for   nights Sun  Mon  Tues  The first room we got to was right next to the construction so I asked to be moved and the front desk said as long as nothing was touched or used they could do it  The move was made  The room was okay       I only noticed that the air conditioning duct over the table had some kind of dried redish stuff coming out of it  rust  I don t know but once I saw it I refused to eat meals at the table  Also  the jacuzzi tub had mold in the tiles  I went across the street and bought tile X and sponges to clean it before I would enter it  One night there was a thunderstorm and my boyfriend and I were riding in the elevator back to our room and the elevator stopped and the lights went out  We were in there for less then   minutes  Once I got out I called the front desk and was told in a dry unconcerned manner that the main tower was struck and power was out  The rep showed no concern about what had just happened to me  From then on we walked the flights of stairs to our room  The next day we thought we might take the elevator again and saw a gray spider about the size of a   year olds hand and once again decided on the stairs  I guess they don t do anything for birthdays b c all I got was a verbal wish and then lots of telemarketing phone calls  At one point we just unplugged the phone  I went on another occassion about   years ago and it was a lot better then what I experienced on this trip  
P =>  Great Place  I stayed at the Cancun Resort the week of ober      with my husband  mom and   year old son  We were in a   bedromm in the Merida building  third floor  The apartment was very nice  spacious and had everything you needed  The bathrooms were huge and the kitchen was a decent size  My mom and I had no problem working in the kitchen at the same time  There were TVs in each bedroom and jacuzzi tubs in both bathrooms  There is also a balcony which was nice to sit out on at night We called housekeeping several times during our stay to pick up our trash and they were there in no time  ilena and Lourdes were great  They also came in to tidy up and refresh our linens on the fourth day of our stay  Never had a problem when we called the front desk  Everything was handled promptly  I don t know what other people are talking about a smell in the rooms but I haver smelled anything The best feature  in my opinion  was the pool  It was very warm  don t know why other people are saying it was cold   There was some pieces of foam in the pool but that was due to construction and it was no big deal  My son loved the pool and they have some cool hammocks for you to relax on  They also have   water slides which were nice and about   hot tubs located throughout the pool area  The great thing was that the pool was opened till    at night so that was convenient after a day on the strip and having the opportunity of relaxing in the pool when we got back was nice  The resort has several activities for different age groups throughout the day  There is a   on the phone you just call and a recording gives you the days activities according to each day  We never had a chance to do any of them since we were out all day on the strip  The location was great also  It was just a quick   minute ride to the beginning of the strip  Mandalay Bay   I liked the fact it was a non smoking facility and also it was a very quite resort  We didn t use the shuttle bus service since we did rent our own car  They also have a game room for kids and an adult lounge in the main lobby area Overall  it was a great place to stay  My husband and I would definetly stay here again on our next trip to Vegas  
P =>  Bad Experience Booked this resort for three nights  t         on line through Expedia Was very hesitant about staying at the Cancun after reading reviews on Trip Advisor  but took a chance anyway Big Mistake  This resort is no where close to a five star as advertised  more like a two star  The rooms were very worn and in need of an update  The room we were assigned had a very bad odor  smelled like sewer  I asked to look at another room in a different building  but with the same results  I told the girl at the front desk that the rooms were not acceptable to us and she had no comment  almost like she hears it all the time  We decided to stay on the strip     nights at Mandalay Bay and   nights at MGM and had a great time  I read these reviews all the time but felt compelled to write one this time  Do yourself a favor on your trip to Vegas and book a hotel on the strip  
P => Nice Staff Nice Weather Nice Pool area Nice Location Exchanged our Kissimmee Orlando golf course timeshare Staff was very nice  check in a pleasure  although I had assumed I had an exact room  but it seemed I had somewhat of a choice   quot there is a room facing the pool  but it is not finished being cleaned yet  otherwise     is available  quot  Room was smaller than our enormous Kissimmee Wyndham Palms two bedroom one  but remember  timeshares have different size and newer older rooms  so that is why you and I may see variation sometimes in the description  Ours was a two bedroom  two bath place  adequate for our family of two adults and two teenage boys  TV is normal size  Kissimmee    quot   I wish we were able to get a room in which the second bedroom had two twin beds  some exist here at Cancun  and not two queens  but they were all taken of course  My sixteen year old son is six feet tall  and it just wouldn t work with him and my fourteen year old son sleeping together on a full size bed   our bedroom had a queen with bathroom attached  theirs had a full with bathroom unattached   so my fourteen year old slept on the pull out   Our Kissimmee time share has  in the second bedroom  TWO queen sized beds  never mind two twins  and the master has a king  although the pool here at Cancun is much better than in Kissimmee  Also  they do a room clean at Cancun once during the week if you stay longer than like five days   Kissimmee had NO cleaning day  unless you ordered paid for it   Anyway  the weather in Las Vegas in ust was fantastic  like Aruba without the wind and occassional humidity   my husband and I go to Aruba every year without the kids   We did not miss the DAILY thunderstorms that occurred in the afternoon in Florida at the end of e  The kitchen here at Cancun was small  but able to meet our breakfast and lunch needs  We spent the evenings on the strip  It was nice that both bathrooms were large  BOTH had two sinks  and BOTH had jacuzzi tubs   The pool area was lovely  Even without the waterfall working when we went  it was still very nice  Four waterslides  hammocks  poolside casual INDOOR bar restaurant  I think they should have something TOTALLY outdoors  though  like a tiki bar kind of thing  Much of the pool is five feet  so  if they didn t have the free floats and noodles  I would have reviewed it as  quot too deep quot   There are shallow areas  but they are not large  Oh  the BEST part of the pool is the covered jazuzzi  As well as some small uncovered jacuzzis  they have this one larger Adult Only one that is within the an temple  yet attached to the pool  Real cool  The one thing I forgot is WATER SHOES  I didn t think I needed them  but if you are going when it is hot  YOU NEED THEM  Never mind hot  whatever they used to make the patio is SLIPPERY I love the location  It is on the same road as the strip   Las Vegas Blvd  S  just a few miles south of the main stip  but so nice and quiet   except for wishing we were on the third floor of our two story section  Had little kids above us and heard their running at most unusual hours Food  There is a great ITALIAN restaurant  called something like the BOOTLEGGER  it is on the right as you head north to the strip     highly recommended  one of the staff of Cancun suggested it  and it was right on I stayed at the Cancun seven nights  the Hilton   nights  and the south rim of the Grand Canyon one night  and I could ve stayed longer  There was so much to see in Vegas and I loved the weather      Have a great time  
P =>  Dark and gloomy Unfortunately this resort was not what we hoped  The rooms were very dark and the furniture uncomfortable  the kitchen area is small and inconvenient  Some redecoration is overdue  Loungers by the pool had to be taken very early or there were none available  The pool area is small for the number of the apartments and when the next blocks are built  will be even worse   in spite of a new pool on the plans  However  the staff are friendly enough and the shuttle service into the casinos is excellent  We wouldn t return  
P =>  Great rooms service pool non smoking facility    This is a great resort when you want out of the hustle and bustle of the strip but can visit it as often as you would like with it s on the hour    minute ride  The pool is beautiful and great for kids with it s waterslides and daycare and kid camps  There is a grill with great food so you can take it to your room and eat  or grab a drink and sit by the pool  It s a non smoking facility so you can escape the smoke from the strip and what a relief for a non smoker  Our stay was great and we would definately stay again  
P => Not all that great We just got back from Vegas  thankfully our trip was saved after moving to another resort after the  rd day  The Cancun resort wasn t terrible  if you are used to     star resorts   It just wasn t what I was looking for  The suites were moderately decorated and the bed was very very hard  I m only    and it hurt my hips to sleep on my side  The towels they give you in the rooms are very very cheap  so cheap in fact that I think they throw them away instead of washing them  All our towels were apparantly new and shed all over our bodies when drying off  Then just add some lotion and you have a sticky fuzzy surprise  Yuck  The large pool where mostly everyone swims was not heated  FREEZING  The pool was largely overcrowded and they had BIO Hazards where they had to evacuate the pool twice in one day  It happened for both pools as well so by  pm that day all pools were shut down for the day  I will also be lucky if my kids don t come down with a serious bug in the next few days   just like another review had said  I guess the one thing I will say for them is at least they did evacuate the pool    The kitchenette was very very small  but still workable  Limited underground parking  so don t expect to be able to park in the shade  Lots of scarey looking people staying there as well  we moved to the Aladdin Resort in town on the  th day and really enjoyed it  I recommend the Aladdin highly  
P =>  Excellent Stay My wife  two children      amp      stayed at the Cancun Resort  e   th thru the   th  A great resort for a family  We booked a two bedroom condo  clean and well furbished  The resort pool was fantastic  Large  clean with four waterslides  plenty of chairs and tables  There is a poolside cafe bar that serves breakfast  lunch and dinner  a limited menu but what we had  burgers  tuna sandwich  nachos  were good  The resort staff was well above average  courteous and professional  They have a shuttle that runs from noon to midnight  takes you to the Vegas Outlet Mall and several stops along the strip  We used it several times and it was never more than ten minutes late from the appointed pick up times  The game room was a big hit for the kids  four pool tables  a foosball table and a ping pong table all in good condition  A very nice resort for a family  The only complaint that I could make is that they need to update the mattress sheets in the bedrooms  they were a little hard and the sheet could have a higher thread count  The bottom line here is the next time we take the family to Vegas the only place that we will be staying will be at the Cancun Resort  
P =>  Cancun Resort is a great place to stay   We stayed at the Cancun Resort for   days  e    e     and I have to say that it was a great stay  The kitchen was small  but well stocked  The living room dining room combination was comfortable  We  family of    stayed in a   bedroom unit on the  th floor  corner unit of the newest building and I must say the bedrooms  both of them  were huge  Both had whirlpools with showers and a very large bathroom area  The master bedroom has a king size bed and the second bedroom had a queen  as well as the pull out sofa in the living room which we didn t need to use  Very quiet resort  The pool area was so nice  They have these hammocks under a shaded tent area that was completely awesome  There is a game room for kids as well as adults  Staff was on point and very courteous  The concierge was so helpful about places to visit on the strip and off  On our first day there  two of the televisions were not working and I called the front desk and the maintenance guy was there within    minutes to fix the problem  We rented a car  but they do have a shuttle bus  Plenty of parking  indoor and outdoor  and they are building two more buildings to complete this resort  The balcony is very long and we had a view of the mountains and in the evening this view is breath taking  The only slight downer was that there is a room tax of       a day in Clark county in Vegas for timeshare exchange stays  I guess that is a Vegas thing because we have never had this extra expense with our other exchanges  but I have to say it was well worth it  What I really liked most about this resort is that the entrance to your villa is from the inside  like a hotel room   On other timeshare resorts we have stayed at  Orlando  Palm Springs   the entrance to your villa was always from the outside  The elevators are quick  Overall  a wonderful stay and would definitely come back  
P => Great swimming pool After reading several other reviews I was nervous about staying at the Cancun Resort  I even emailed the resort and told them about what others were saying about the resort on Tripadvisor  They emailed me back and reassured me that everything would be fine and gave me the managers name should I have any problems  They even called when I was there to make sure everything was ok  That s customer service What I liked was the pool  It has   water slides and several hot tubs  The pool area never felt crowded  There is a very nice restaurant pool side  They supply towels  noodle floats  and regular pool floats  On Saturday they had a steel drum band playing live music   very nice I read many bad comments about the customer service and the shuttle both of which we used many times  We called the front desk a couple of times and everytime they answered the call very promptly  And the shuttle which takes you to the strip was on time every time  The resort says it has washers and dryers but take note they are not in your unit  They are down the hall and there is a fee  What I didn t like was the kitchen  It was very small and the room was only made smaller by the dark wood shades they use in the living room area  But it did have everything you need  The bathrooms were large and the jetted tubs were awesome  They have maid service if you stay longer than   days  
P => Vegas Relaxing       It was Great  Super friendly  Beautifully kept  Nice ambience  the pool was gorgeous  the room was great  I ve never been able to relax in Vegas  it s usually non stop shoulder to shoulder people and heat that you can t escape  I was blown away by the beautiful calm of this place  I enjoyed the jacuzzi tub  big enough for two  and it was so relaxing  The room was quiet  the accommodations were very comfortable and the maid doesn t knock every morning  In fact  the staff is there right when you need them  but they re not intrusive in any way  I highly recommend this resort for people who enjoy a little relaxation and repose after walking along the hot  amp  crowded Vegas strip      Best trip to Vegas ever  
P =>  WILL STAY HERE FROM NOW ON    I recently stayed at the Cancun because no other place had rooms available and I loved it  We got the two bedroom which was very very big  The kitchen was fully equipped and furnished  Both bathrooms had jacuzzi tubs  the one in the masterbedroom was HUGE    In the living room was a queen sofa too  The dvd player played CDs so we had music going all day and night  The drive to the strip is not as bad as some say   maybe five minutes at the most  The is a market right across the street so you can stock up the fridge and save some money  The room is supposed to be for   people max  but we had     just don t tell  Our heater wasnt working when we checked in and I d say within half hour the problem got fixed  It was toooo cold for the pool  but gosh I wish it wasnt t because it is also HUGE and very beautiful  I will be going again next month and will stay here again  I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone  
P =>  Great place to make memories  My visit to this resort is one I ll never forget  The suites were immaculate  Fully furnished with a fully supplied kitchenette and dining area  This is great if you enjoy cooking your own meals  which can enhance the experience  Jaccuzi tub was a hit  Even from the  nd floor  my view of the Vegas area was beautiful  day and night  The water park is fun for all ages with slides  hot tubs  and large swimming areas  I had a minor problem with one channel on my TV and someone was there within minutes to change the remote and reprogram the TV  For my first trip to Vegas  this resort was made my trip worthwhile  This place is highly reccomended  I ll book it for my next Vegas trip   
P => Family Fun We stayed at the resort from y      y    and LOVED every second of it  The Pool is one of the best I ve seen  with   water slides and depths that ranged from       feet to   feet  The water was always clean and the lifeguards were always alert The food and drinks at the pool bar were very good and service was above average The room was very clean  we had a   bedroom with a pullout sofa in the living room    bathrooms and full kitchen  Across the street from the resort is a fully stocked super market that is open    hrs  a day  Must be very careful crossing the BIG street to get there The only down side to this resort is their shuttle bus  The week that I was at the resort  the average teperature was     degrees and not once was the Air Conditioning working in the buses But besides that  Its a very nice place  
P =>  NOT a GAY friendly resort  Apparently LESBIANS that wear  quot boys quot  surf trunks are not welcome on the slide or in the pool  according to  quot JASON quot  the pool manager   I am presently removing ANY and ALL investments my family has with this resort and its parent companies   I have not felt so humiliated in all my life  I strongly advise AGAINST staying here  unless of course you promote HATE and INTOLLERANCE Sincerely   Cute Lesbian 
P =>  a great week           We just returned from a week in Vegas staying at the Cancun resort  We liked the accomodations a lot  A great place for families  The room was a one bedroom w    baths  Our    year old liked this resort a lot  Only a couple miles from the strip which gives you time to escape the hustle bustle of the night time  We felt like we had something to look forward to every night driving into the strip  Loved the pool area  Nice sandwhiches and good breakfasts at the pool restaurant  Staff friendly and helpful  Only have maid service once during the week but will refresh your towels and empty trash at your daily request  Had special music by the pool for father s dayWe would definitely stay again when visitng Vegas Very clean rooms and overall facility  Activities for kids also  When checking in request poolside view  
P =>  Wonderful resort    My husband and I just got back from a weeks stay at this resort and it was a wonderful experience  We had two bedrooms with two huge bathrooms each with its own Jacuzzi and double sink  heaven    The kitchen was fully equipped and was spotless  as was the dining and living rooms  I especially loved the balcony which stretched from one bedroom to the other  The resort had a limited amount of indoor parking  and lots of outdoor parking  We had a rental car so we did not use the shuttle services provided  I would give this resort six stars  
P =>  Great time excellent resort for groups of   or more   Have stayed here   times  Great experience very time  Themed mayan resort  You must have a time share to stay here  Was excellent all around  Great free shuttle service that takes you to the strip and back runs  pm   am  Great relaxing pool  with a water slide  juccuzis  and even hammocks  The rooms are like little apartments  The suites have   full size seperate bedrooms each with its own bathroom with a spa tub  there is a living room with a couch that folds into a bed  and a small dining room with a table  and even a full kitchen  You can fit up to   people in the suite  Suites also have a mini bar  big screen TV  cd dvd player  and even a juccuzi on the balcony  Beat that  
P => Fabulous  Outstanding  We were at the Cancun Resort from           Let me start by saying that if I could give the Cancun Resort six stars  then the six would be an understatment  We have been travelling to Las Vegas for seven years and this is the first time that we did not come home exhausted  We contribute this to the relaxing atmosphere of the resort  Acutally we found it to be an Oasis  The landscape is absolutely beautiful  the staff made you feel like kings and queens  The only thing that I found unacceptable is that they re not located on the East Coast of the US   
P =>  Shuttle Bus Driver It was the worse time of my life  I was a passengeron a shuttle bus on the   th of april      at     PMThe driver of the Bus      License plate     PLC literally ran a suv into oncomming traffic  The bus driver did not have the right away and instead of slowing down and merging properly with traffic became verbally abusive  and I was scared for my life  a limo driver got out and comforted the driver in the other car she appeared shaken  I WILL NEVER STAY THERE AGAIN  For someone to have little regard for someone else s life appalled me  I complained to the front desk but only told me that their drivers are contracted from another company  This person needs to me accountable and fired  
P =>  Loved It      
P => Great Location Off the Strip  
P =>  wonderful     
P =>  The Cancun Resort is a timeshare resort which is simply the best   
P =>  Love the hotels rooms  Very spacious and jacuzzi bathtubs  
P =>  Very Nice Resort   
P =>  Disaster  
P =>   Bel endroit pour la famille    
P =>   Nur empfehlenswert     
P =>  ce n est pas un hotel  
P => 
P =>   Good value for money Vegas was the best starting point for my this years holiday with my wife  As we were in Vegas before  we did not had intentions to spend much time on the strip and after checking the prices for the hotels there  we decided that we rather save some     and look for an off strip hotel  Based on the reviews here I selected Candlewood which was avaiable for some     at the time I booked  For that price it offered all I needed  A nice clean room  we had a suite   free internet and it was not far away from the strip  If you are looking for good value for money hotel which does not necessarily be on the strip  then Candlewood should be one of your options 
P =>   Know what you should expect and you ll like this place This hotel is all about the expectations  This is an extended stay hotel without daily housekeeping and is meant for longer term stays for people who want to stay at a place that s kind of like an apartment with more  homelike  features than a typical hotel room In reading some of the previous reviews  I see where there were some people who did not like this hotel  most likely because they had expectations that were too high My expectations weren t so high and I ended up really actually liking this place  We stayed here two nights for fun and then transferred to a conference at the Planet Hollywood hotel for three nights  If I came back  I d much rather stay here at the Candlewood where I can get a better room  albeit smaller  for one fifth the price  even though its four blocks off the strip The rooms are smallish but they are very easy to get around in  they re great if you are mobility impaired  and despite the size  they have everything you need to feel at home a full fridge  cook top stove  microwave  coffeemaker and plates  dishes and utensils for two  We had a basic single queen  The sleeping area seemed a bit small but the kitchen was fine  the desk area doubles as a place to eat and the bathroom was big enough for two people to get ready in There were a few things that were not likable  At check in  you ll notice the carpets are a bit dirty and worn and the rooms when you first walk in have a bit of a musty smell  probably because the rooms aren t cleaned everyday  You might be able to ask for fresh towels each day  But the smell is only slight and you get used to it quickly  The parking lot has plenty of spaces but is laid out a little awkwardly  And  the hotel is not on the strip  It s about a five block walk that is doable if you have good shoes  But even then its just a few dollars for a cab But don t let that deter you from the good things about the hotel  First  you can t beat the price  There are some cheaper places but they are real dumps  This place is far from that  The staff was very  very friendly and helpful They also have a well stocked honor pantry right next to the front desk  It has much more than just a few snacks  They have some things that are easy to make into a quick full meal in your room  like soups and microwavable dinners  And the prices are very reasonable  in some cases cheaper than a convenience store The hotel also has free self laundry service on each floor   You pay a little for the soap and softener but the machines are free   Again  if you are a long term stay  this is a godsend  You don t have to go to a Laundromat and you get to keep your quarters for other Las Vegas enterprises The amenities in the bathroom weren t the greatest but the towels in the bathrooms were actually pretty nice  way better than the ones we got later in the week at Planet Hollywood Resort   Since they don t change them out every day  the towels are thicker and more homelike  The shower and tub surround looked newer but the faucet and shower head weren t new  Once I turned it on  I figured out why  Don t change out what s not broken  The shower had plenty of hot water and the water pressure was great  like    times better than the chintzy water stream at Planet Hollywood  It was hot in the room when we checked in but the room temperature control worked very well and you could set the specific temperature you wanted and it worked well right away  The A C unit was a little loud but it did an excellent job getting the exact temperature I wanted and keeping it that way The free Wi Fi was appreciated but a bit on the slow side Since there is so much to do in Las Vegas  it is unlikely you are going to spend a lot of time in your hotel  but if you want to save some money and maybe even try to make some of your own food  you should strongly consider this hotel  It will save you money and let you keep more of it to spend on other things in Vegas  which if you know Vegas  you ll need plenty of money for  
P =>  Very good Cheap Adress    Family oriented First you need a car   Clean   aged but clean and very friendly service people   Rooms are big  we had a suite   very quiet  lot s of amenities not far from the action   Nice     to be recommended except if you want to gamble and party all night but for visiting Vegas at a very reasonnable price  The best  
P =>   Comfortable Home Away From Home Hotel This is a home away from home hotel  In the kitchen there is everything you need except an oven  But with so many places to eat near the hotel and at Vegas  theres no need to cook  Having the fridge is great  no need to go down the hall to get ice  The   bedroom room was on the smallish side with a queen bed  The sofabed in the living room was next to the A C so it can get quite cold  This is a longer stay hotel so there is no daily housekeeping  We stayed   nights and there was no housekeeping  Staff was friendly and nice  
P =>  The first extended stay hotel that I d WANT to stay in for an extended time Spent three nights here  my first time in Las Vegas that I have NOT stayed on the Strip  and it made for a better experience  There was a  cheap   snack pantry on site  in room kitchenette  televisions in the living room and bedroom  and free wi fi  The hotel was clean  quiet  and only a    minute walk to Las Vegas Blvd  
P =>  Good price but bad location It is a bit far from the strip  but the room is not that bad  it has a kitchen inside your room  so you can cook if you want to  Best if you rent car when you book this hotel  
P =>   Very very Nice I m writing this from my room  checkin was a breeze  I heard someone complain about the long hallways sometime with an odor  This hotel is used as long term for some    Sooo people are cooking their food instead of going out to get it You don t sleep in the hallways so get over it Rooms VERY clean everything is provided Free internet most strip hotels charge        day You can ever take the Bus from the airport if you like Route     or     not exactly sure The honor system store is great Great prices     cents for a coke  NYNY charges       for the same thing Lots of channells on TV to watch Shower lots of pressure and good hot water never ran out  front desk always very helpful lots of menu s get shoved under your door The pizza was great  The ONLY small complaint I might have is the A C my sensor was disactivated so mine was always on bonus  It was quite loud going on and off during the night i woke me up a few times I loved the beds very comfy So in review I would recomend this to people that want to be quiet and away from the strip  I personally would not stay here gain myself  no fault of the hotel itself  I m a be on the strip and gamble if I can t sleep kinda guy i was alone on this trip BUT if i was with my girlfriend I might return ASk away if you have any questions As for the pet fee complaint it says in the binder NON refundable  pet charge not deposit  
P =>   Really nice hotel off The Strip We stayed for   nights and thought the hotel was really nice  we like to travel on a budget and Candlewood suits us just fine Free internet again which is an extra bonus always   
P =>  ent stay at Candlewood Suites    Ok  so we just got back from our   night stay at the Candlewood Suites in Las Vegas    and we paid      for the flight hotel for   people    not as good a deal as the OP  but we had to book on short notice   anyhow  we booked separately  was cheaper this way  and so we had the option of using   separate rooms  but ended up only staying in one the hotel is very close to the airport    had I known  probably would ve taken a cab to from airport instead of using the Gray Line roundtrip shuttle    but since we did use the shuttle  we were the first ones dropped off since we were probably the closest from the airport The hotel is about    m from the strip    too far to walk in this heat right now   but it is right across the street from Terrible s Casino and down the street from Hard Rock Hotel  There are plenty of restaurants within walking distance too    a Bahama Breeze across the street  a japanese sushi restaurant  Morton s  etc  There s a gas station at the corner to pick up some things if needed  but the hotel itself has the  quot cupboard quot  which has drinks snacks toiletries etc  that you can purchase on the honor system  you either fill out a slip under your room  and pay later  or just put some cash in there     decent free coffee there anytime as well  although there s a Starbuck s just across the street for you must have Starbucks fans   the surrounding area is a little sketchy at night    so would probably advise taking a cab at night and not walking alone  There is a bus stop at the corner of Flamingo Paradise Rd where you can catch the     up to the strip       each way     for    hour pass    but this pass is not the same one that you can use on  quot the Deuce quot  bus that goes up down the strip  you have to pay an additional    each way if you buy the regular      hr pass that s used on the regular bus  However  if you purchase  quot the Deuce quot  bus pass for    for    hrs  then you can use it on any bus  The  quot Deuce quot  costs    each way otherwise  Had I known  I think I would ve taken the    each way ride up to the strip  then bought the   day  quot Deuce quot  bus pass for     and that would ve taken care of all the transportation needs for the time we were there  Note  You can purchase these   hr or   day passes as you board the bus   but you must have exact change  Also  the Deuce can be fairly slow at night  because of the traffic  and of all the people getting on and off  You have to have exact change to buy these passes or pay the fare  But after a long day  that air conditioned bus does feel nice   As for the rooms  they were fine   clean  roomy  and has refrigerator microwave electric range dishwasher coffeemaker  and cups plates bowls pots pans utensils salt sugar  and dishwashing liquid  They have shampoo soap samples in the bathroom  We stocked up at the nearby Albertson s for our breakfast snacks and that saved us more money  The air conditioner worked just fine  but it is pretty loud when it turns on off  so if you re a light sleeper  you might have some trouble sleeping Free Wifi in your room was a big  The bathroom was clean  towels were fine    and the bed sheets pillows were fine as well  You re not staying at the Bellagio or Venetian  but the accomodations were just fine   and besides  we weren t in the rooms that much anyways  The showers worked great  and the water drained fine   Note  this is an  quot Extended Stay quot  property    meaning  there is no daily maid service unless you are staying for I think   or more nights  However  should you need something  the front desk is more than accomodating  If you need fresh towels  you just bring them to the front desk and they will give you more new towels  The front desk staff was generally friendly and helpful We didn t check out the pool  but it looked small on their website What else can I say  It s a bit of a hassle to get to the strip from this location  would be ok to walk to the strip when the weather gets cooler  So we usually waited      minutes for the bus to get to from the Strip and also used the bus to go up down the Strip as needed  A cab ride to from the Strip will probably run you about         to from the airport about        probably Overall  a decent place to shower sleep for the price you paid and fairly close to the Strip    we had no major problems to report    walls are fairly thin  but was quiet most of the time So our advice    buy either the   day regular bus pass to get to the Strip and pay    each time you use the Deuce on the Strip  or get the   day  quot Deuce quot  bus pass when you get to the Strip  you probably will pay    on the regular bus to get the Strip first though    get some snacks water drinks at the nearby gas station or take a bus cab to the nearby Albertson s to stock up your fridge    was advised not to eat at Terrible s Casino at all cost    we did try the Wynn buffet which was excellent  though pricey    We saw Ka at MGM and Zumanity at New York New York    both were different and both were very good  we had seen  quot O quot  and  quot Mystere quot  previously      do checkout the discounts

P =>   Everything you need for a comfortable stay My husband and I spent one night here on the way home from a week in Death Valley CA  I chose the hotel in part because it is fairly close to McCarran Airport  where we were catching a flight the next morning  Despite its proximity to the airport  we heard absolutely no aircraft noise  unlike our stay a week earlier at the Best Western McCarran Inn just down the road  which seems to be right on the flight path   Neither were we disturbed by noise from other rooms  The desk clerk told me that the floor above us was vacant  but the room next door was occupied  We could hear voices in the corridor  but once inside our room  all was quiet  This was our first time at a Candlewood hotel so I don t know if it s typical of the chain  but they certainly seem to have done a good job of soundproofing this hotel inside and out Check in was very efficient  with lots of information about restaurants within walking distance   There are many  with just about every ethnic cuisine you might wish for   The hotel also has its own  quot cupboard quot  next to the lobby  where you can buy snacks  soft drinks  fruit  breakfast items and frozen meals  It s all on the honour system    just take what you want and drop the money in a box  As we were tired  not particularly hungry and wanted to turn in early  we bought frozen stuff and microwaved it in the room  Not exactly home cooking let alone haute cuisine  but it was nice just to relax in the very comfortable room and watch a DVD  free  along with CDs  from the front desk  The suites are probably intended for people staying longer than one night  Each has a full sized fridge  a microwave  a two burner stove  a coffee maker  a toaster  crockery and cutlery for two  a good assortment of pots  pans and utensils  and a dishwasher  They even supply dishwashing liquid if you re using the sink or powder if you use the machine  All the appliances were as clean as if they d just been delivered from the showroom  In fact  everything in our suite was spotless The room was spacious and the bed was comfortable  as were the pillows  The free wifi worked well  enabling us to check in for our flight and catch up on e mail  All this for a very reasonable     including tax  Definitely recommended  
P =>  Location Location Location This was my  th long term stay at this place The location is very convenient with a    Hour Kinko s across the street  steps from some excellent reasonably priced restaurants that stay open late  i e Firefly  Dragonfly  Musashi There are also dozens of restaurants nearby with regular dinner hours You can get world class dining within minutes from this place It s about a   minute drive to Bellagio or a   minute drive to the Hard Rock Hotel The hotel is spotless  I ve seen people cleaning the place throughout the day The hotel has a heated pool   making swimming possible on cooler days However  there is no landscaping around the pool area The gym is open    hrs and has decent equipment I again had the   bedroom suite that was well equipped for a long term stay The windows do open  so you can let in some fresh air Also looks like they upgraded the mattresses since my last stay The place is generally still in pretty good shape Here are my Dislikes The air conditioning is very loud  I shut it off to sleep  then I m forced to turn it back on when the heat wakes me up The furniture is kind of drab   the suites definitely need remodeling I wouldn t mind it for a few days but I find it depressing after looking at it for a month  Mind you  I ve seen a lot worse decor for a lot more money I would also prefer to have a king sized bed but the hotel only has queen sized ones The Internet is very very slow if you re trying to view video streams They re almost unwatchable However  the Internet speed is adequate for regular browsing Other than those few picky complaints  the hotel is fine The staff is very friendly and helpful You can trust me on that because I dealt with all of them daily for almost   months straight with no problems This definitely is not the Wynn but it s more than adequate  
P =>   Roomy but front desk lady mean Hotel is right off the Las Vegas Strip  The one bedroom suites was roomy enough to fit   of my girlfriends  It even had a full kitchen  but one bathroom  There s a little vanity next to the closet in the bedroom  which was very helpful  Most of the time the bathroom is the only place to get ready  The only problem I had was with the front desk lady  My friend and I went down to get extra blankets  The lady was not friendly at all  We asked for    but only got    The lady gave us an attitude  We asked for BLANKETS  but got mattress covers      How do you get that mixed up   So we called from the room and they brought up some real blankets   Finally  The same lady brought the blankets and she was all of a sudden NICE  What a hassle   
P =>  Clean roomy convienient and well located Having been sent to Las Vegas for work purposes  I was put up for an initial two nights at the Candlewood Suites until the rest of my collegues turned up and were due to move to a Best Western  However  at the last minute we made a block booking at the Candlewood and those two nights became five  There was a little bit of kerfuffle about moving me from my initial single booking to the block booking   but the guys at the front desk handled this efficiently with the minimum of fuss Despite the booking not being in my name  rather  it was in the name of my boss   the staff at the front desk made sure everything was okay  They explained the honour system for the  quot cupboard quot  and where all the facilities were  I was most impressed to see a free DVD library in operation   something that other hotels would charge an arm a leg for The room was big and roomy  certainly enough to set up a fair amount of computer equipment  and the kitchen was invaluable for the occasional snack  and for breakfasting  The bed was comfortable  and the recliner was a welcome break from working away for hours on end  Internet access is provided via ethernet   but is still free  They do not provide  to the best of my knowledge   I had a ton of cables due to my business trip  cables   but there s plenty of places in Las Vegas where you can get one  They filter most network protocols which makes anything other than web access extremely slow   a pain in the backside at times The bathroom was clean  the towels fresh and clean  unlike some people have reported   I like the fact that the maid service only comes once a week   which forces you to re use towels  although they can be exchanged for clean ones at reception  and keep things tidy yourself The TV was big  had access to all the important channels  and there is a dual VHS and DVD player to boot The free microwavable popcorn was a good touch  The  quot food cupboard quot  which is based on an honour system  i e  you either pay in dollars there and then by dropping the notes coins through a slot   or you fill in a little piece of paper which has the prices of the items plus the quantity you ve taken of that price range  plus your room number  and drop it through the slot   The cupboard is extremely reasonably priced indeed Location wise  it s a nice    minute walk to the Strip itself  Or if you re driving  everything is very accessible by the roads  It s a wonderful location for the Las Vegas Convention Centre   which is again  around a       minute walk  Over the road you have the wonderful Bahama Breeze restaurant serving a variety of Caribbean food and drink  I d highly recommend the Aruba Red beer and the Jerk Chicken dish   as well as a Starbucks and other dinning facilities All in all I ve had a great time at the Candlewood Suites  I was a bit aprhensive about the place having read some of the reviews here  but ultimately it s a very pleasent place to stay  I d be very happy to stay here on holiday  
P =>  Great value off strip but convenient  I was really pleased with my stay  I did a lot of reading before I stayed at this place  but I didn t have much of a choice due to finances at the time  Admittedly  after reading others  reviews  I was really concerned  A friend of mine used his Holiday Inn points to pay for our stay  I was frankly shocked and ecstatic to find that the experience was so favorable  There were two couples staying in one of the Queen suites with the fold out couch  The cleanliness of the room was acceptable  the staff was friendly  I don t mind getting my own towels and not having someone clean my room on a daily basis  I m paranoid  the less they re in my room  the better   so these conditions did not bother me  It was great for four people   the privacy of the separate  quot bedroom quot  was invaluable  I can easily imagine an extended stay being comfortable  The fridge dinette area allowed us to eat cereal in room in the mornings and cool store bottled water  They give you a complimentary bag of popcorn and a few other amenities  Location is FANTASTIC  I go to Vegas a lot  so I really don t want to stay on the strip  The novelty is lost on me with strip hotels  and I enjoy the quiet of off strip accommodations  This place is great for that  and its location allows you to bypass the strip traffic while maintaining easy access to all the casinos  The pool area was clean and appeared to be well maintained   the hot tub was a welcome treat for aching feet at the end of a long day  I can t say that this was a life changing experience  but I d definitely stay there again  For the price  it can t be beat  
P =>   Great price and good off strip location Visiting Vegas for the first time during a peak period  superbowl weekend  there was little accommodation on offer  The Candlewood Suites  although off strip are within walking distance to everything  If you were feeling lazy a taxi would be at the door within minutes The room was clean and very spacious  especially for the low price we paid  I loved the  quot convenience store quot  and the honesty system  take what you need  fill in a form stating what it is and leave in a box for reception   The prices were so good I can t imagine anyone trying to rip them off and the convenience of it was fantastic  I imagine this place would be great for a long stay  Sadly I was only there for two days   o  
P =>   Reasonable for Las Vegas This was our first visit to a Candlewood Suites hotel and although it cannot be described as luxurious  a little bit downmarket from a Holiday Inn Express   I was impressed with the self catering facilities  These included a shop and laundry  which they trust you to pay for  and kitchen facilites in the suite Given the quality of other hotels in Las Vegas  and I include hotels on the strip   I thought it was a good value for money hotel 
P =>   Great location We enjoyed our two night stay at the Candlewood Suites very much  The rooms feature a fully equipped kitchenette  great for long time stays  What we really liked was the complimentary laundry room  that they feature on every floor  Since we were on a long trip  we were greatful for having free laundry facilities right in the hotel  The location of the hotel is great  just two blocks from the strip and there is a Starbucks right across the street  
P =>   watch belongings The hotel itself was ok but I forgot a leather jacket and by the time I called it was gone and employees and managment did not do a thing So if you stay there watch and dont forget anything  
P =>  Send your enemy here  What a crap place  We ordered non smoking rooms and got smoking rooms The facilites were new back in the day it was built but it really seemed like it was over    years ago  This place is worn down  well used and badly maintained The staff are good but the facility is poor A highlight was the honesty box system for the store   you buy something by writing down the price and placing it in the box within the convenience store  It was a good system that offered choice and the prices were excellent This is a cheap and nasty place that we thought was a Holiday Inn  due to our original booking  but alas  it was not Send your worst enemy here or someone you dis like  They will  quot like quot  you even more  
P =>   The place was just fine The hotel was centrally located across the street from the Hard Rock  We paid about      for a Saturday night when places around town were going for as much as      or more  The front desk staff was friendly and efficient  The room was very clean and well kept  A separate livign area with small kitchen  The hotel was not in the very best neighborhood but all things considered it was just fine and a great price  We stayed only   night but wodul definitely consider staying again in the future  
P => Exactly as described on website Stayed here on several occasions Always found the Reception staff helpful  amp  friendly Room clean and comfortable  amp  hotel approx   mins easy walk  at least in winter temperatures  from the Strip  
P =>   Just fine We stayed   nights at the Candlewood Suites using Priority Club rewards  We were delighted to avoid paying                  a night at a Strip hotel  the Stones  Prince  and the air show were all scheduled that weekend   Had never stayed at a Candlewood before  so was not sure what to expect  What we got was  Efficient check in  very clean room  quiet location   th floor   nice kitchenette  we used the microwave  fridge  and sink   decent bed and pillows  good cable channels  including   or   HBO s and Fox news   black out curtains  Popcorn  free  is in the room and a coupon for a free soda was in our key envelope  The Cupboard is handy  but could have used a small packet of cough drops   Love that the Cupboard  along with laundry  is on the honor system  The a c and heat worked fine  although it s the typical wall unit  i e   a little loud but not a problem   The hallways  elevators  and outside premises were well taken care of  Area is fine  Starbucks is just across the street  It s near several nice restaurants  Bahama Breeze  Buca di Beppo  etc    This is a perfect  reasonable  and safe place to stay for business   or if you don t have to stay on the strip  we come to Vegas once or twice a year  so it doesn t really matter any more where we stay   The only advice I d give is to make sure you know the most expedient place to park and then get to your room  a little diagram of the place would be helpful  but was not given at check in   We had no trouble getting around  rental car   location is convenient  just down Flamingo to Paradise   It s a quick walk to Terrible s Casino  Probably wouldn t walk to Hard Rock or the Strip  but could if more motivated  
P =>  Best Value in Las Vegas My husband and I have stayed here twice now  because it is the best value for a weekend in Las Vegas In my experience if you want to visit Vegas on a weekend the prices go sky high  Many of the hotels on the strip are             night The Candlewood Suites  are basic  clean  friendly accommodations  Most importantly they are safe  and quiet and off the strip  It is nice to have downtime  away from the strip It feels homey and cozy In my opinion when you come to Vegas you don t come to relax in your hotel room  you come to enjoy the city  shows  clubs and night life  The only time we were in our room  was basically a couple hours in the morning and an hour before bedtime The beds seem a little small  but other than that it had a very cozy feeling  I was not too pleased with their soaps  and shampoos  but I always bring my own anyway  In some cities it is important to invest in a great luxurious  expensive hotel  Vegas is not one of those cities  Parking is free at all the hotels and casinos so every morning after we woke up and got ready and had our breakfast we drove to a particular casino for their shows  gambling and fun etc  Then at night we would come back and enjoy our free popcorn and soda in bed with a free movie that they offer at the front desk As long as they stay safe  clean  affordable and efficient we will keep coming back I am not sure if this is the best deal during the week  I know during the week the prices on the Strip hotels are competitive  but I do know it s the best deal for weekends  
P =>   Wonderful little touches great rate clean  We stayed here so we could combine business with pleasure  making sure it was suitable for work  It was PERKS   we got an excellent price for the weekend  right off the hotel s website  free internet in your room  good workspace  quiet  mini kitchen  microwave  utensils  and full size fridge  free snacks in your room  microwave popcorn  coffee  nice touch   great cable channels including food network  hgtv  hbo  they have the Candlewood Cupboard   where you have a coupon for a free drink  and can go grab any snacks or drinks  using the honor system or filling out a charge slip  pool  clean room  nice size  we stayed in the studio suite   great location    mile from strip on Paradise Flamingo and free from traffic   just a quick zip to the hotel resort  amp  casinos on the back roads  free laundry  you can wash your clothes for free and they even provide the detergent  
P => Best value Las Vegas  We booked one night here with Priority points  saw the poor reviews of few months ago and booked two nights at the Holiday Inn Express  so we can offer a comparison The Candlwood cost only        points compared to        per night at the Express  Both were clean  comfortable and very convenient for the strip  The express was a little better here and there  the pool was nicer the rooms smelt very fresh and clean  but I certainly didn t feel it was worth the extra points  The Candlewood was quieter  no aircraft noise  and although we didn t use it  having a well equipped kitchen would be great for a longer stay  I liked the Candlewood cupboard  you can get into the small store using your room key  help yourself to whatever  pretty basic  food you needed and pay or charge to your room via an honesty box  Really nice to have fresh milk in our very English cup of tea for a change  
P =>  Great stay at Candlewood Suites Stayed               Thursday thru Saturday nights  and had a great rewards stay at Candlewood Suites in Las Vegas  Was worrried after seeing their Trip Advisor rating drop over the last few months  But  for this last minute trip  I decided to give it a try especially since it was just me and everywhere on the strip was  as usual  priced really high for Friday and Saturday night while Candlewood Suites was available for a great rate of just        priority Club points per night For my stay in room      first floor      Staff at check in and thruout my stay were all friendly and helpful Room and bathroom were very clean King bed was firm but that s the way mine is at home so I felt right at home with it Even Friday and Saturday nights there were no noise problems or other such issues but I may just have been lucky to be in a quiet wing with no one above me stomping around their room after    pm Made a long distance call back to Indiana  approx     minutes  and the charge was only    cents so they didn t gouge me for that like some places do Found the  quot store quot  there very useful to get a Coke  only    cents  and a snack so I didn t need to go out for that Having a room with no maid service during your stay is different especially for stays longer than mine but it was fine for me I made some coffee one morning  it was ok  but other than that I didn t make much use of the dishes  silverware  stove  refrigerator  microwave  or dishwasher but they were all there if you wanted to use them I don t mind walking  and I always do a ton of it in Vegas  but I had a car this trip because I knew this place was too far from the strip to walk  IMO  only Terribles is walking distance from here Because I hate driving in Vegas  I prefer staying on the strip  usually Sunday thru Thursday  but I would stay here again especially at the bargain rate of        Priority Club points per night  I wouldn t spend      a night as it sometimes is on the web site  up to     a night would be my limit for here  
P => Great Value Location and Amenities My wife and I and our    month old twins recently stayed at Candlewood Suites and found the whole Candlewood facility excellent Our room had plenty of space for   cribs  a separate bedroom and the full kitchen including dishwasher and microwave was exactly what we needed for babies bottles plus a few meals in The free laundry facilities  located on every floor   plus the   hour store were an added bonus while the location   a    minute walk to the strip   provided ample parking All in all  I highly recommend this place to anyone wanting somewhere clean with a good location without paying crazy strip prices  
P => Candlewwod Suites  a good value  I stayed with family for two nights  t            We booked a   bedroom suite  which had a double bed in bedroom and a pull out sleeper sofa  The bed was comfortable but firm  and the sofa sleper was comfortable for a pull out  The room itself was clean and comfortable  with the sofa and a nice recliner  as well as tv  small CD stereo and VCR  free movies loaned in lobby   Also  a kitchenette w  fridge  microwave    burner cooktop and all necessary plates  pans ect Small pool area  but kept up nicely  Also very nice exercise room for this type of facility This is an off strip property  but very close to alot  such as Terribles and Hard Rock Casinos  convience stores  and restaurants  all in walking distance  VERY nice employees  quite helpful whenver needed  All in all  a pleasant stay  
P =>  Good for a night or two Stayed for a Friday night using my Holiday Inn Priority Club credits  It was only        points  The Holiday Inn Express was        and I would say that the Candlewood is a better room  That s a great deal for a weekend night in LV for all you Priority Club members   The room was typical of Holiday Inn  but with a full kitchen area  top range  microwave  full size refrigerator  coffee maker  toaster  pots  pan  knives  forks  and even a dish washer  The only slight criticism of the room is the one queen size bed  no kings  But the bed was very soft and comfy for my wife and I  Each room also has a very  very comfortable reclining chair  Terrible s Casino is right at the corner  with the Hard Rock a little further down  Both are easily walkable  A small  store  is in the hotel lobby with a nice assortment of all the food items you may wish to have or prepare in your room  Video movies are available for free  Overall  a good place for a day or two when you re on a budget or want that extra Friday night in Vegas  I would highly recommend using your points for the weekend at this hotel  
P =>  Great Place to Stay in Vegas This is a nice quiet hotel convenient to the Strip  We got a great rate for a one bedroom suite with a kitchen  I was impressed with the cleanliness of our room and the hotel  Access to free washers dryers was a wonderful bonus  A box of laundry soap    load  was    and fabric softener was     The hotel staff was friendly and check in and check out were fast and easy  I would definitely stay here again and recommend this hotel  
P => great Bargin for Budget Travelers Stayed there Memorial Day Weekend for a nite  and a week later for another nite  Easy check in and employees were very friendly and polite  Got a one bedroom suite for family of   and worked out well with youngest on floor  Parents got seperate room and A C worked great  Quiet and they have lots of great perks like free wash dry and a little store that was a bargin compared to everything else in Vegas  Suites fully equipped and lots of storage for food if your going to be there several days  Free rental of VHS tapes and a nice pool area with spa  Only dislike was we were up towards the main area and the pool was far to the rear  If you plan on using the pool alot with small kids  request a room above              Will stay again  especially if I can grab another internet deal like this time  You won t touch these rates on the strip on a weekend nite  
P =>  Nice quiet weekend stay  Stayed here Friday thru Sunday and the end of il  Easy check in and check out  No waiting and no lines  Close to parking lot  which is such a blessing if you have ever become lost in the multi level garages and spent over    minutes to get to your room  Great place for the price  Refigerator very handy  except there was no ice in the freezer and there seem to not be any ice machines on any floor  Walked next door to liquor store for a bag of ice  then was informed freezer has ice maker  just no ice ready for use   There was only a packaged coffee supply for one night  even though I stayed for two nights  I guess you have to ask for more or go to Starbucks across the street  Having a car definitely helped  Did not try to walk to any of the nearby casinos  Terrible s and Hard Rock   Work out room is awesome  No crowd  Typical small motel swimming pool  nothing fancy at all  but private  Overall  hotel is an excellent spot if you dont need to have a casino in the lobby or dont mind feeling like your not in Vegas  It is located in a safe central area that allows you to access many of the casinos within minutes by taking Paradise Rd or Koval Ln  Avoid driving down the strip  A good spot for the buisness traveler  
P =>  Absolutely great for what it is We  couple plus   kids aged    and     stayed here in a   BR suite from ch    il         and were very pleased  Having the separate bedroom was great for a family  Although the decor is very standard issue motel variety  everything is clean and fairly new  We had   TVs and used the kitchen for breakfast each day  We found we didn t miss the maid service  When we needed towels  we simply loaded up the laundry basket  provided  and headed down to the desk to get more  Our kids borrowed   videos to watch  and much to my surprise  leaking Starbuck s lid   I even used the free laundry facilities  The pool is postage stamp small  but the kids did swim there   but the hot tub is large  It was really helpful that these facilities were available    hours per day  We didn t make much use of the convenience store off the lobby  as we had a car and purchased items at a local supermarket  In contrast to an earlier report  I found all of the front desk staff I encountered to be pleasant and helpful  Their two local restaurant recommendations  Gordon Biersch   a brewery restaurant across the street and Milano s   a takeout pizza place about a   minute drive away  were good This is NOT a strip type hotel  nor is it a resort  nor does it have a casino  If none of that bothers you  you may want to consider it  We found having a rental car was an easy way to get around  virtually all local hotels have free parking   Coming back to this low key and quiet hotel after a hectic day in Las Vegas was such a relief  I have stayed on the strip many times  Luxor  Flamingo  MGM  Stratosphere  Excalibur     and would stay here again  
P =>   Awesome place The people here were beyond nice  The room was clean  The pool was small  but sunny and also had a large hot tub  I loved having a kitchen in the room  The best part is the laundy room and convience store that work on the honor system    you write down what you take and put it in the box  When you check out  it is automatically added to your bill  It was close to the Hard Rock Cafe Hotel  and you can walk across the street to Starbucks  Great place for someone who wants to be away from the bustle of the strip  
P =>  Couldn t be better This hotel is located in an area just off the strip  The neighborhood was fine  I think it was the best possible place to stay for my husband and me  We rented a car and so we had the freedom to go sight seeing on the strip or to a grocery store to stock up  There was a full size refrigerator and microwave  a cooktop  and pots  plates  bowls  utensils  etc  The only thing you don t have is daily maid service  This suited us fine because we liked the privacy  I also did not have to bother to  quot pre clean quot  the room before the maid got there every day Our room was in the back of the hotel by the pool  and it was very easy to get to the car  It is a rather big hotel  but it was quiet and clean  There is an elevator by the pool door in the back  too There are restaurants all around  including Starbucks across the street  but we saved money on our stay by grocery shopping and eating in the room If this is your first trip to Vegas  do stay on the strip for the experience  Bring good shoes If this is not your first trip  rent a car  stay at the Candlewood  It is cheaper  healthier  and more peaceful  
P => Great VALUE for Las Vegas   a must consider  Some people just like having a little kitchen in their hotel room when they are travelling  Some people prefer to collect frequent hotel points with a major chain rather than being within    feet of a slot machine  Some people want to save money  If you re any one of those people  the Candlewood Suites in LV is for you  I was able to get a midweek room rate there of     per night  and this was during a major convention where every other hotel in town was charging over       Candlewood is now part of the Intercontinental Hotels chain  meaning you can earn valuable Priority Club points for your stay  The hotel is a kind of extended stay hotel  where you get a mini kitchen along with every room  The difference is that while most extended stay hotels close their lobby early in the evening  this one stay open    hours  What everyone cares most about in Vegas is location  This hotel is in a good location   not great  It is not on the strip  It is a good walk to the strip  The hotel is right across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel  which is a great place to go for food  My room was clean  the bed pretty comfortable  and there was free high speed internet access for getting some work done  I would have to consider this hotel again for my next Vegas stays  
P =>  Good Idea       Hi Travellers I ve stayed here from    sept     sept And i must say its a very friendly placeClean witch i think is very important nice and friendly staff had a warm welcome on arrival swimming pool was good but no resort type Overall Exellent for a great price  
P =>   Candlewood a good choice Stayed at the Candlewood Suites on Paradise Rd for a week while in Vegas for a conference  I d definitely stay again  even though its not on the strip its not far from all the action  and the   b r suite was a pleasant change from the usual hotel room  equipped with a desk table tv vcr fridge stove microwave etc i can see myself staying there with family to save on expenses vs a regular hotel My only problem was no high speed internet  ok so i m a geek  but the front desk staff say it should be installed by year s end  
P =>  A pleasant surprise  We booked a Saturday night stay at this hotel because others were so pricy  The staff was very pleasant  The suite was spacious  We had a bedroom and a sitting room with a sleep sofa that was separate  Made for great privacy  Especially because we had a young adult with us  Pool was great  It was near the Hard Rock cafe and several small eateries  We ate at a great brewery that was very reasonably priced We would definitely return  
P =>  Fantastic value  
P => Excellent for business travelers  
P => Loved the Candlewood  
P =>  Great and affordable  
P => Great Deal Esp for Swimmers   
P =>   H tel sp cialis  pour les longs s jours et un peu loin du Strip     
P => 
P => Wedding and Touring Cool place right on the strip its a bit small but what do you want for such a cheap hotle in the middle of everything   staff are great also  
P =>  Best deal ever  The hotel allowed us to check in by   pm  the rooms were neat and tighty  all drinks in the bar were only     And they had a Ben and Jerry s  I mean this hotel is the best  its right across street from Mirage  and next to Venetian  We were right in the center of everything and their service was the best  They are going thru some remodeling and their is no valet so you have to park in car garage in back of hotel but we didn t really care much about that  If your on budget  this is definitely a great place to be  I will definitely be going back there cause    bucks a night was the best  It didn t have the best of pools  but overall it was a great stay  
P =>  Excellent Value Cant beat Location Casino Royale is now my place to stay in Vegas  I have been several times and did not even know they had rooms  All the rooms are remodeled  The dollar beers and margaritas help getting your day started  The gaming is not intimidating  Loved my stay there  A hidden gem  You can use the money you save to put on your favorite game  
P =>  Great Location Good Value Exactly As Expected  Before our first trip my husband and I really did our research before booking a hotel room  We re on a budget  and being we stayed two nights during the week we got a good deal on our room at     a night  We value location over having lots of  quot extras quot  because honestly  how long are you in your room in Vegas anyway Pros  Excellent location  Centrally located on the strip  the Venetian and Harrah s are right next door and the Mirage is across the street  We could easily access everything located in the center of the strip  We drove to Vegas so we had our car with us  and the parking structure was no fuss  no muss and easily accessible  Rooms were just as pictured on the website  and actually a bit bigger than I expected  The bed was quite comfortable and we had excellent water pressure in the shower  There is an Outback Steakhouse  Denny s  Subway  and Noble Roman Pizza located here  We ate at the Denny s twice for the sake of price and convenience  and each meal was great  The casino bar offers    margarita s and    Michelob Light and Michelob Original Lager  Cons  Figuring out where the front desk for check in was a bit confusing upon our arrival  You have to enter through the rear of the building due to construction  and walk through the casino to check in  We read a few reviews which people complained about this same problem  and it was still a bit confusing for us once we got inside  Because of construction there is noise coming from outside  and we had a view of it  The walls are also paper thin  We could hear everything going on in the hallway  and at times we felt like our window was open because we could hear the construction so well  But really  coming to Vegas to get a great nights rest  C mon   I forgot to pack my toothbrush  so we called down to the front desk to see if they had those cheap o toothbrushes  but they didn t so that was kind of an inconvenience  The high speed internet access is not in the room  it s downstairs in their lobby area  The margarita s served at the casino bar for    didn t have much tequila in them  It may seem very minor  but I thought our hallway smelled  quot funky  quot  Luckily the smell didn t carry over into our room Overall  the hotel is a good value and you can t beat the location  That said  I personally would not pay      a night to stay here  because there are just too many  quot little quot  things that are not offered here that you might expect  like the front desk to carry some toothbrushes  from a hotel  The staff members we encountered were friendly  but don t expect to be treated like royalty here  Great budget hotel  
P =>   For it s location you can t beat the price  With some bad reviews  major renos going on and a small gambling area that we thought would be really smokey  we really expected the worse  but were totally wrong  With less than   days in Vegas and lugging   small children  we opted to stay in smaller hotel over the gigantic ones  Looked everywhere and wanted to stay on the strip but the prices for     star hotels were in the   digit range so for     USD a night for the end of e weekend at the Casino Royale  this place was a steal   Upon arriving at the parking lot in the back  the place looked less than appealing because of the renos but the front clerk said it would be done by ust  From the parking lot to the front desk  it was a short walk  the two front clerks were really nice  no wait at   pm  Got our room key and walked passed the gambling area which did not reek of cigarettes  I mean there were cigarette smells here and there but you wouldn t be inhaling anymore than walking behind someone who was smoking outside on the strip  There s a huge locked sliding glass door that separates the hotel rooms from the casino and everything else which was great and it s located across from the Ben  amp  Jerry s ice cream store and one of the main entrances that leads you outside  another happy surprise  They gave us room     and it was nicely renovated  it looks as they advertised on their website  Beds were high and comfy  enough space for two small kids to run around and there was even a huge flat screen tv to compliment the room decor  This time maid service listened to us when we asked them not to come in our room to clean up    lol  Lots of hot water for shower  cold a c works fine  small fridge was handy but no microwave for fast convenient heating drinks food  There is a small coffee maker that we used to warm my kid s milk  which was fine  Night sleep was good  no noise from outside at all  Only negative thing I wish they had was a nice pool but for the weekend price and prime location  you really can t go wrong with this little gem  Great stay and I would come back again  
P =>   Great Value Mid Strip Location Spent five nights here in         and will again later this month  y   Front desk is right off the strip basically  as is the entrance to the hotel rooms  Very convenient  There is NO valet parking  but the lot is pretty close to the hotel  Not a long walk from most areas of the garage to the front desk  The  quot good quot  spaces outside the garage next to the casino are less than a minute s walk to the front desk  This place does not claim to be a resort  it s certainly not  but it is located NEAR some nice resorts  The rooms are basic  but clean as far as I could see  No bugs  blood  or guts that I could find  and this place is pretty old  Many  including the one I stayed in  have been recently remodeled though  and so really didn t look bad at all  I d say the room I was in was better than a Motel   for instance  No floor to ceiling windows or anything fancy  but it was clean and functional  The noise from LVB was only slightly annoying  and earplugs took care of that  I slept real good  No loud parties in the hall  and they have security cameras too I believe  The  quot hotel quot  part of the casino actually runs east from the strip  and has four floors and     rooms  while the casino itself parallels the strip for the most part  The whole place is kind of like an  quot L quot  shape  Some of the rooms at the  quot crux quot  of the L are pretty much right off the strip actually  and it took me about    seconds to get from my room to Las Vegas Blvd from mine  I could also walk into Harrah s and be at their blackjack  quot Party Pit quot  in about    seconds   probably quicker than anyone STAYING at Harrah s  The gym next door at Harrah s is also only about a two or three minute walk from Casino Royale  I had NO problems with the front desk  and they seemed very accommodating to me  though I ve read complaints from others  be I was just lucky  or it was a weekday check in I don t know  At any rate  I m going to be staying there AGAIN later this month  They COMPED me a room for three nights  and I didn t really think I d get comped at my level of play  This is a BIG PLUS for me as a gambler  Other casinos I wouldn t have even earned a lousy  and it probably would have been lousy   buffet  Granted the rooms here are always inexpensive  but I liked that they thought enough of my play to actually comp me a room  Heck  they only have     rooms  Maid service was good  I had no complaints  They also have free Internet on the first floor for guests  I felt pretty secure in the hotel  and the rooms have a safe as well as a fridge and I think maybe even a microwave  can t remember   T V  worked okay but not too many channels  I wouldn t say the reception  cable   was all that great either  But it did the job for watching the local news at night  which is about all I used it for  There IS construction going on still I believe  so I d ask for an even numbered room if they have one  That would be on the Harrah s side of the building  I d also try to get as close to LVB as possible or else you may hear them crashing bottles into the trash cans after the bars empty them from Harrah s next door  This is Harrah s noise  so don t blame the Royale for this at least  There is a Subway sandwich place on site  as well as a Denny s  Next door     seconds from my room  is a McDonald s  and below that is a food court with Chinese and Mexican  quot mall food  quot  Outback Restaurant  the busiest in the WORLD I was told  is upstairs and they will comp you if you gamble enough  It was good and I ate lunch there several times  You can watch the peeps walk by from there as well as the Denny s  I eat this stuff at home  and think most of the Vegas fancy restaurants are not worth the money unless you re trying to impress your girl  You can be in the Mirage Casino in less than three minutes from the front of Casino Royale  Heck  what can I say  I like this place  The plusses  location  price  convenience  room safe  fridge etc   far outweigh the minuses in my opinion  The minuses would be the smoke in the casino  and I SMOKE   The casino is pretty well worn as well  and yes SOME of the dealers are downright indifferent or even rude at times  They probably don t get paid much  I DID have a great experience at their craps tables though  Best odds on the strip from what I can see  and I found ALL the craps guys and gals to be nice and not rude at all  There was one guy there actually who should have been working in a better place he was so good  He knew what I was going to do before I did  and kept track of my bets real well  Of course I was tipping the boys some too  which I m sure got their attention  but they were nice to everyone from what I could see  Slots were not that loose in my opinion  I d try El Cortez downtown Vegas for loose slots  It s a dump  too  but does have loose slots  That s it  
P =>   Fun change of pace A little hold out dive in the midst of Mega casinos  We haven t stayed here  but make it a point in our yearly visit to Vegas to spend time here  It is almost refreshing to get away from the Glitz  where else an you buy     and up clothing for only    bucks   China   Sign up for a players card and get a coupon book with buy   get   free bottle of beer or drink for a dollar  Or your     dollar promo play  You win the jackpot or you get nothing  Except the free drinks while you re playing plentiful   Yes its a dive but fun Where in Vegas can you get a bottle of beer for a buck The servers are friendly and frequent  The slots are looser than anywhere we ve been in Vegas and we always break even or come out a couple bucks ahead  I don t think We ll ever stay there but its a fun change of pace to visit 
P =>   Rude Dealers No CW anywhere  I did not stay here but was at the casino next door  I wandered into the Casino Royale and decided to play Let It Ride  It was approximately      in the afternoon on a Saturday  I was the only one at the table and the dealer acted like he d rather watch the TV over the bar area than deal cards to me  He didn t talk and kept stopping the game to watch TV  I also looked everywhere for a cocktail waitress and never found one  Because of this experience I will never consider staying here  
P =>  excellent hotel stayed here in feb      days clean room and comfortable bed wide screen tv refrigerator everything you need small smokey casino but ok cannot beat the location for the money casino royale please dont change  
P =>   Best Deal in Vegas  I m rating this based on the fact that it was a fantastic deal  very clean  and in a great location  Our room was very clean   and housekeeping did a great job cleaning it every morning  They are also recently remodeled and it s perfect for a weekend getaway for guys or gals  I wouldn t recommend it for a  quot romantic getaway quot  but it s great for a bunch of friends on the party  A bunch of my friends were in Vegas for a long weekend  They are a bunch of drunk idiots so they didn t need anything elegant   just a place to crash  This worked out great because Casino Royale is in such a great location  It s VERY easy to get in and out of the hotel  seconds from the main door to the street   They also have cheap food for late at night like Roman Noble s Pizza and Subway  I d stay here again in a heartbeat  My only advice is to ask for an ODD numbered room  We had room     and it faced Harrah s side alley  There were a bunch of casino workers smashing glass in the dumpster each night  beer bottles   The ODD numbered rooms face their parking lot  which would be much quieter  I didn t complain because the noise was coming from Harrah s and was beyond the control of the Royale  
P =>   Viva The Casino Royale Just back from a    night stay at The Casino Royale and can thoroughly recommend it  The location is ace  right in the middle of the strip  rooms were very comfortable and clean and the beds were adorable  Excellent maid service each day  No noise at night in the hotel section so we managed to sleep soundly  The swimming pool is an ample size and was still open when we were there  The staff were very friendly  IWe d definately stay there again  e and Chris from scotland 
P =>  Most Underrated in Vegas  Recently renovated  and centrally located on the strip  I love this place  Sure  this is not one of the  quot major players quot  in Vegas  but if you are looking for a clean place  with great location  this is the place to be Not huge  it does not take one     minutes to get from room to street  It took us less than    seconds  The rooms are clean and  as stated  recently renovated  One great feature  there are safes in the room that work excellently  I have to admit  maid service was slow  But when they did show  they did a great job Cheap eats are all around this place  Located next to Harrah s  you can go there to eat at one of the many places there  Otherwise  it is directly next door to both McD s and Dennys  I don t gamble  but do drink and the     cent margaritas in the casino were awesome any time of day or night  There are stands and bars with drink specials not far from Casino Royale s doors  making it a great location for the person who does not wish to spend a fortune on alcohol  but wishes to purchase a lot of alcohol Again  I don t gamble  but per other reviews and guide books know that Casino Royal offers some of the best odds on the strip  However  if you are looking to game late at night into the morning with Vegas  elite  don t head to Casino Royale  Past one A M   the clientele is a tad seedy  But it is so close to the Venetian  Harrahs  among others  I read reviews that Casino Royale is of the smokiest  Well  they don t offer smoking rooms  or smoking in hall ways  so that is a plus  I must be used to run down little pubs at home  because I did not think even the casino was all that smokey  It is easy to catch the Deuce near Casino Royale  Either Harrahs or Imperial Palace has a monorail station  so that is near too  but I did not catch that at all  IP has a close by taxi hub  so that was handy Overall  this is such a great place  that with the recent remodeling  I am sure that next time I go prices will not be as affordable        for Thurs Sun  Not bad at all  
P => Perfect Location  This hotel is cheap and in the BEST location  It is located right next to Harrah and across the street from the Mirage among many of the other hotels that are walking distance    even in high heels  There is a    hour McDonalds within about    feet as well as some other affordable restaurants with great hours  The hallways of the actual hotel rooms are a little smelly and old looking but the room is decent  There is a nice sized mini fridge right in the room and the beds are GREAT  I heard that they just refurbished the rooms and I was definitely happy with my booking  My next trip to Vegas will definitely be booked at the Casino Royale   PS   The casino itself offers       Michelob and Michelob Light as well as       margaritas    great way to pre party without going far from your room    
P =>  You get what you pay for This hotel is a good option if you are looking to save a few dollars  It is ideally located on the strip right in the middle of some great casinos  Personally I d rather save my money for shows and some nice dining while in Vegas so this was a good choice in that regard  The rooms seemed clean enough though very basic  The bed was very comfortable and the room had a small fridge in it  The elevator was broken one of the three days we stayed there so we had to trudge up the stairs  The casino is small and dated but since I had great luck on the slots while I was there I cannot complain The only complaint I had was that the staff there are neither friendly nor helpful  The front desk staff is downright surly  If you are a person who just need basic accommodation to rest your weary head and can fend for yourself then the Casino Royale is fine  Just don t expect  quot Royale quot  treatment  
P =>  Back in Time     Being a frequent visitor to Las Vegas and having stayed at the  quot best of the best  quot  I have to say that staying at Casino Royale is a  quot step back in time  quot  A time when courtesy  affordability  pride  and cleanliness are an everyday commodity  I love the quick ease in which the hotel is accessed  No struggles for elevators and   plus floors  The quaint facility has a demeanor of yesteryear  with the gaming of today New mattresses and bedding and flooring were an even greater welcome than I expected this past trip  How many of the  quot glitzy quot  hotels actually give you a refrigerator you can use   This one does Perhaps it doesn t boast a celebrity  or offer buffets  but you will find this a very pleasant environment while you are in Las Vegas  If you do choose to play  then use your comps at Outback Steakhouse which is located upstairs  or the Subway  or Pizza bar I give this hotel a thumbs up for sure  
P =>   Great find Cool place  Perfect location on the strip  Clean big rooms  no frills  but who cares your never in there in Vegas  No pool  but just use one of the other hotels  
P =>  Hotel OK Pit Bosses Negative Hotel room in line with     pricing  friendly  efficient housekeeper  efficient  helpful front desk personnel  dealers at table games mostly good    HOWEVER  playing at a craps table one night  a pit boss was extremely loud and rude to a shooter  The shooter remained calm and mature and complied with the instructions by the pit boss on the throwing of the dice  But at the end of the fantastic roll  the pit boss continued loud admonishment of the shooter and banned the guest from shooting the dice again  Another pit boss then literally threw the shooter s player card toward him onto the table  A  quot big boss quot  was in the pit and said nothing to the employees about their unprofessional actions  One young lady even told the pit boss this was her first time at craps and that when she threw the dice please don t yell at her like that  The inappropriate communication behavior by the pit boss drove some of us committed craps players away  We found    craps tables downtown with especially great people and service at Binion s   they were polite  customer caring  friendly   even when directing guests on rules of dice throwing  We played over    hours of craps at Binion s with excellent service  fun atmosphere and even some winnings  One Casino Royale dealer told me that management kept up with table games  profits and losses throughout the day and night and pressured pit bosses when tables were losing to the house  be that pit boss was trying to interrupt the shooter s great run at that moment   the shooter still made all of us a lot of money quickly  No more Casino Royale for us  
P =>  Another great stay at Casino Royale  What s not to like  We ve stayed at Casino Royale two to three times a year for the past   years  We ve tried the bigger hotel casinos and found Casino Royale to be a better value and more convenient  Its a small  fun casino  great service  friendly staff  comfortable rooms  We liked the card access security feature  If your ego demands a fancy resort  you should book elsewhere  If you are looking for fun at a reasonable price  then stay at Casino Royale  
P =>  Casino Royale is disgusting This place is disgusting  From the moment you walk thru the door and get a combination of smells from the icecream parlor  The steakhouse  sandwich shop  pizza and the casino smoke all in one breath  It took everything I had not to puke  Still wanting to give it a chance we made our way into the check in room where a nice lady helped us check in but told us we would have to stand in another line for our club card  She advised us that she couldn t help us with  So we went to the line approx   ft over and waited a few minutes and then there she was just like in the Scooby Doo movies she was there to process our cards  OK so we finish there and head up to our room  The first elevator we see is out of service    we venture down the hall and make it up to the  nd floor  It appears that this is not just vacation lodging but possibly this is where low income people reside      We open the door and a whole new aroma appears now the smell of nasty urine or just plain ol FUNK  We look out the window hoping for some sort of a view to make this work because the cost is nice and the location is Great  We pull open the curtains and our view is to the back alley parking lot area and it doesn t appear to be safe at all  The view just looked like something out of a movie where you know bad things go down back there  This place is definately very rough around the edges The renovations did look nice  but you got the feeling like the bed is nice but who on earth has slept here before me  I am not a spoiled person I have had my share of stays in Motel   s and such and I must say when a Hotel   is better than this place it s not that great of an option  If you are a couple I wouldn t recomend this place there is No chance for romance there  We called immediately and changed our hotel  We ended staying farther down the strip than we would ve liked but I am thankful that we had that option  
P =>  Excellent for the money The entire hotel is Non Smoking effective ch  st  so this is excellent news for some  and heartbreaking for others  I got   comp nights  but rates are always cheap during the week  and about      cheaper on weekends than the  quot big guys  quot  The beds were more comfortable than the room I had at Harrah s the previous nights  AC worked well  and the windows opened  which is a huge plus for me  I enjoy fresh air  Shower pressure was decent  and bathroom was clean  In room has a coffee pot  refrigerator  and safe  Television has    channels  and no video check out  Also  my main complaint is NO internet access  even for a fee  You need to swipe your room key just to get into the building  I see this as a hassle  others might enjoy the extra security  To deal with the traffic  learn the back driveway into the garage  Just follow signs for Harrah s valet  but proceed straight under the large Harrah s globe sign that goes across that access road  
P =>   An unusual package in a great location We were headed to Las Vegas for a spring break weekend and picked a time when city wide rates were off the charts  Stumbled on a deal for the Casino Royale property located in the shadow of the Venetian and across the street from the Mirage  A small hotel with no public space we had trouble finding where to check in  Very nervous when we saw construction dumpsters in the parking lot  fortunately our room was already renovated  Comfortable room in a well worn property  In room mini fridge  cable TV  nice bedding and a decent bathroom  There is a Ben  amp  Jerry s  Denny s and Outback Steakhouse in the property  Small casino without a lot of frills  The best part is the location  convenient parking and a very short walk to most of the major casinos  Literally a few hundred feet from the entrance to the Venetian  If you want to be on the infamous strip and you don t require a high level of amenities  then this property will work for you  
P =>   Casino Royale is Great Stayed with a group of   guys  age        to go to the Mountain West Tournament  All four rooms were recently renovated  New carpet  new beige paint  new bedding  VERY SOFT    hotel is small but nicer than we thought it would be  It is a budget hotel but the location can not be beat  The casino bar hosts    and       beers with very friendly bartenders  The elevator is very small and old  we only used it when we had luggage  Overall a wonderful stay  Tip   walk to Harrahs through the parking garage to catch taxis When I come to Vegas with my wife we will stay at the Bellagio or Wynn  but when we come out for a guys weekend definately Casino Royale  
P =>   Loved It    This is a great place to stay on the strip  Lots of action and super fun  The hotel is clean and the service is great  We will be back  Perfect for the budget and also felt very safe  We have not been to Vegas in    years and will definately we go back to this hotel  YOU WONT BE SORRY  Good luck and VIVA LAS VEGAS    
P =>   Good times at the Casino Royale Small casino  Small hotel   perfect location  I have no complaints about this property at all  The negative reviews you ll read are most likely from people that would be dissatisfied with the level of service The Bellagio offers to it s penthouse suite guests  If you re young  or old   on a budget  or not   looking for a good time in Vegas without the frills   Casino Royale is the place to go  Checking in and out went smoothly   The front desk is easy to find  can t miss it in a casino this small  and the staff was very friendly  The room was simple  clean  and conveniently located in respect to the casino   Literally a   minute walk from the street to your room  The casino is small  smoky and charming in a retro sort of way  Table games are cheap  slots are plentiful   food is basic   I spent most of my time gambling and eating at the other casinos  but at the end of the night   always ended up back at the royale nursing a cup of whisky playing some slots  It s a good time  Check it out  
P =>   You get what you pay for   LOCATION is awesome though My husband and I compromised   we stayed here for   nights and then went to the Venetian for   nights  This place actually was exactly what I read and expected  Run of the mill cheap hotel in a SUPERB location  Yes it s used and kind of dirty  but the price cannot be beat          a night  It looks like any room that price nearly anywhere in the U S    Warning   YES   there were prostitutes about  by the security door to get in the hotel area  and they are not modest  NOT a family hotel  Staff was courteous  casino small but kept well  room was cleaned as well as could be  NOTE   each time I called for something they were there within minutes  extra pillows  towels  etc    I even called about our T V  not working and the guy fixed it within    minutes  Our window looked out over their pool   not heated  not clean in ember  just an F Y I  We could also see the Venetian towering above AND heard that huge BONG BONG each morning  on the hour  from the Venetian s Bell Tower  see the pictures I ve included here   So be warned  BUT   this hotel is what I read and I was prepared  Go there with these things in mind and you re good to go  Again  you cannot beat the price or location  Personally  I would probably not stay there again   I d buck up the extra         a night and stay a few doors down at the Flamingo or something  
P =>   Great Location on the Strip   First of all let me advise if you want luxury and great strip views  breakfast in bed and expensive room service  don t stay here  If you want value  a convenient location on the strip and a clean  comfortable place to stay  book now  I have stayed at the Casino Royale   times in the past   years  It is not a luxury Vegas resort  but since I only use the room for sleeping and was hardly ever in it  the value and location on the strip are great  Check in was quick  staff was nice and efficient  and access to the rooms is right around the corner  unlike the mega hotels where you have to walk   miles through the Casino to get to your tower room after check in  I drove my own car and figured out how to get to the hotel parking lot going the  quot back way quot  since it is almost impossible to turn into the hotel property from the strip  The pedestrians never stop to let you in  and if you try to nudge your car into the driveway  irate pedestrians start banging on the car  Gees   Casino Royale is right in the middle of the strip with Harrah s on one side and the Venetian on the other  The Mirage is right across the street  Also  the monorail can be accessed very quickly by walking through Harrah s next door  Very convenient  The room is kept very clean  as was the bathroom  If you are worried about walking on old carpet  wear flip flops or socks  I even had a phone message waiting from housekeeping one evening when I returned  I had left the  quot do not disturb quot  sign on the door  and they wanted me to know that they would clean my room if I just called them  Great housekeeping service  Also an in room safe that I really liked  I will stay again in       I can stay for   nights at the Casino Royale for what it would cost for   night at the Bellagio  
P =>  About what I expected Worth the      per night that I paid  Fri Mon  Good  great location  coldest AC in Vegas    minutes from room to strip  great shower  never felt unsafe  friendly staff at check inBad  paper thin walls  view of a wall  no room service  but takeout from Outback in the hotel   thought room was clean but noticed black marks in the tub that came from my feet after walking thru the room on the carpet  and finally   you re staying at the Casino Royale 
P =>   Convenient location  If you want to get away from all the mega resorts  this is a great place to stay and very affordable  The casino is small compared to the mega resorts but that is what I liked about it  Easy to get around  not overly crowded  and convenient location  Check it out  
P =>   Clean value hotel We stayed at the Casino Royale as part of the Tahiti Village  quot free trip quot  promotion  and added a day on our own at the end  The room was immaculate  For the most part this room on the  th floor was quiet  Air conditioning during   days of      temps was very adequate  I would recommend the hotel for anyone wanting an economical place to stay  our extra night was       It is right next to Harrah s   and Harrah s buffet is awesome  No views in this hotel  all the rooms face other walls or parking lots   
P =>   The Good The Bad The Ugly The Good  Location  location  location  About as close to all the action on the middle of the strip as you could get  The room rates for this spot on South Las Vegas Blvd  can t be beat  The Bad  This all depends on what you are looking for  If all you want is a clean room to lay your head and a place to get cleaned up the Casino Royale will fit the bill  This Hotel Casino is a former Motel   with minimal amenities and even less style  The Ugly  Compared to its surroundings  this place is pretty dreary  The Casino draws a younger         crowd clamoring for       beers and garitas and they can get a little intolerable after dropping a ten spot on drinks  The Synopsis  By modern Vegas standards  the Casino Royale is unrefined and the tiny casino is reminiscent of the old grinder casinos of days gone by  Don t come here expecting anything other than a basic motel  with the exception of an in room safe  and you won t be disappointed  
P =>  Liked this great location Stayed   th for   nights and was pleasantly surprised  Already scheduled my e trip for the Casino Royale  Keep in mind that I am a poker player and don t spend more than   hours per night in my room  However  the location is great  Just a few minute walk to Bellagio  Mirage  or Treasure Island and I find all the poker action I need  Then after a long day at the poker tables  the   dollar Michelob beers at the Casino Royale are very welcome  I also enjoyed the    craps tables  You can play a long time on not very much cash when you want to play a house edge game there Granted  the place could use new carpeting in the hallways of the hotel and is a bit dated  but the rooms are clean and decent and quiet  Maid service is very good and the staff was friendly  If you are looking for luxury  go to Caesars  but if you want a great location at a great price  this isn t bad  I used Travelworm to book the good room rates  but I m sure most of the online booking places have the same good rates for this place  
P =>  Cheap   can t beat the location  Would I stay here with my wife and kids  No way  However  I did go with a bunch of guys for a bachelor party and it was perfect  Imagine if a Motel   had a casino and that is what Casino Royale is like Positives Location  Casino Royale is located between The Venitian and Harrahs at Mid strip The staff was VERY nice and helpful Beer is only a       unless it s Michelob then it s only a buck In room safeNegatives Hallways smell mustyDoor and lock are flimsyBed is uncomfortableHallways are noisyI would recomend this place for college kids or bachelor Bachlorette parties on a budget 
P =>  A good value We stayed   nights at casino Royale  we checked in early with no problems  Our room was pretty average   nd floor with a view of the Harrah s loading dock  in room safe and fridge  The location can NOT be beat  wedged between Harrah s and the Venetian and we could watch the Mirage volcano from the penny slots  The casino was small and laid back  we were first timers and we didn t feel out of place  Food selection was limited  but Denny s for breakfast and late night pizza was fine for us  The pool is a little bigger than your average hot tub  but still refreshing and no little one s running around  One dollar michelob s and margarita s all the time  cocktail service was a little slow  but friendly  You are on your own staying here  so if you need a spa treatment or room service or a cabana you need to go somewhere else  but if you want a cheap place close to the action this is it  
P =>  Great Place To Stay with unbeatable prices   Just got back from my stay at the Casino Royale Hotel in Las Vegas  Nevada  and it was a great place to stay  in a great location in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip   Its a smaller  private hotel  non of the bells and whistles of the bigger hotels around it  but for the price  its unbeatable  The staff was helpful and did everything they could to help  including letting us check in early as well as check out late  due to our flight times  I ll definitely be staying here again when I visit Las Vegas  and would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a great place to stay in the heart of The Strip  The combination of the price and location of the Casino Royale is unmatched  Also  the hotel is right next door to Panda Express  McDonald s and Chipotle  which is a great alternative to the overpriced Subway in the casino  
P =>   Great Value  Casino Royale offers exceptional service  courteous staff  clean hotel rooms  great views and a perfect location in the heart of the strip  We stayed at Casino Royale for a week last week and really liked it  Although I was sceptical at first  I cannot complain  Check in was so quick unlike the mega hotels in Las Vegas  We asked for a room higher up  as recommended through reviews  and were given a room on the  th floor  Access to the strip was so quick and easy in comparison to hotels on the strip where you have to literally walk a mile to get to the street  Amenities included a mini fridge  a safety deposit box  which could be accessed via digits of your choice or by credit card   a coffee maker  and a hairdryer  One item that we needed that was not initially in the room was an iron and ironing board  but when we requested one it was brought to our room within   minutes  You definitely won t get service that quick at any of the monster strip hotels  The stay was quiet except for situations out of the control of the hotel such as the clock tower at the Venetian  the Mirage volcano until midnight and the crazy drunken hallway antics  Security was great at trying to keep out those not staying at the hotel  The only small problem we noticed was that one of the elevators was out of service the whole week  but there was an alternative elevator available and the stairs were just fine  We would definitely stay at Casino Royale again  For those with negative comments I don t know about you but when I go on vacation  I spend more time partying  checking out the sites and scenery because that s what I like to do on my vacation  A hotel for us is the place to crash  go to sleep    and shower  I d rather spend the    I saved from staying at a cheaper hotel on dinners  shows and nights out on the town  be expensive hotels are more suited for your needs  if all you want to do is stay in your hotel room for the entire vacation  
P =>  No Complaints This is a decent hotel  It is clean and convenient  Wonderful location and spacious rooms  The staff was friendly and we loved the little casino  Having Outback  Dennys  Subway  and the little pizza joint just a hop skip and a jump away was GREAT  You can go in and out of the huge hotels whenever you want  use thier pool  poolside bar  etc   We would have no objection to staying at the Casino Royaleagain  
P =>  Better then Harrahs and Others The hotel is perfect if you going to drink  gamble  and have a good time  The pool is as big as my car  but you can go to other hotels pools  The rooms are nice and clean  and larger than most  There is no view  but you make up for that in location  The rooms are    seconds from the casino floor through a secured glass doorway  There is never a wait for the elevator and the staff is excellent  One important thing to note  We had friends staying at the Mirage and Harrahs  It took us   min and    seconds to get to Harrahs casino floor from our room  It took my friends who were staying at Harrahs   min and    seconds to get to the floor when we timed it  Once I know if was longer  It took us   min and    seconds to get from our room to the mirage  and we wait to cross the street  It took our friends   min and    seconds to get from their room in the Mirage to the casino floor  Before the Love show  they waited   minutes for an elevator and then had to walk a mile to the casino  By staying here  you save hundreds but are closer to the action then at the other hotels  The only difference is the pool  but you can easily go to other casinos pools  We went to the Flamingos twice  We carried a back pack and everything  The casino is great  You get a two free ice creams at Ben and Jerrys for signing up for their club and their drinks are strong  The waitresses are quick to bring them too     michalobs are perfect for getting the night started  
P =>   Give Casino Royale a Chance Just got back from a trip last weekend that included a stay at the Casino Royale  While the hotel casino is definately not the shining star on the strip  it does have several pluses that make it worth a look Probably the best thing to say about the Casino Royale is its location  The hotel is smack dab in the middle of the strip  and is directly across from Caesar s Palace  Free parking in back with a   story garage makes the hotel really accessible  The price is another plus  Where else can you get a hotel room on the strip for under       The rooms are comparable to any standard hotel  i e  La Quinta  Best Western  Holiday Inn  and are clean and roomy  Access to the hotel is by room key only  adding to an overall secure feel  While the rooms might not be swanky  lets be honest with ourselves  How much time do you actually plan on spending in your room while in Vegas The hotel has an Outback and a Denny s  which is perfect in the morning to ease last night s hangover  The cons all come from your expectations  If you want a bunch of fluff  Casino Royale is definately not for you  The dealers in the casino are not the friendliest  and the hotel doesn t offer the amenities of others on the strip  If you are looking for a safe  clean  and reasonalby priced hotel in the middle of the strip  try Casino Royale  We will be visiting again in the spring  
P => Got Robbed    Our stay was ok there up until the last day  The rooms are basic and it seems that they have renovated recently  The casino itself is a bit shabby and they only have these sucker blackjack games  called blackjack switch  aside from maybe one or two regular blackjack single deck games  which are always full The last day after checking out I put my suitcase and backpack in the car  The trunk had my friend s large suitcase so there was no room  In less than thirty minutes  in broad daylight  our car was broken into and they stole everything I had  They hit another car too that was nearby  Both the cars were in the parking garage on the level visible from the main lot  There are no security cameras in this hotel s parking garage and there is not even a security guard patrolling the area  This place was obviously targeted for that reason and they knew to rob the guests who were checking out and putting luggage in their cars  The security dept at the casino has not returned one of my four calls asking about the case and inquiring about whether they reviewed the security cameras that are on the outside of the casino itself  that can view the main outside lot and the traffic coming and going at the casino  Nothing  no response at all  This place is not that safe in my opinion and I would never go back  I would stay at a nicer hotel with more security in place  since it seems that Las Vegas has some pretty shady and dangerous criminals preying on the tourists visiting the Strip  
P =>  Great Location but                        We spent a   day weekend at this hotel  and considering its location right on the Las Vegas Strip  surrounded by multi mega million dollar resorts its hard to be fair and not give it a negative review  The hotel was super clean  and you couldn t ask for a better location  The negatives were the room was really small  the bathroom was tiny  and the hotel offered nothing to make you want to spend any time at the hotel  The hotel  or I should say Motel  appears to be quite old and doesn t offer any of the modern touches you look for when deciding where to stay  The room rate         night on Fri   amp  Sat   was very reasonable compared to the         to         nightly weekend rate at the rest of the hotels on the strip  Its a wonder this motel hasn t been torn down yet to make room for another mega resort  If you decide to stay here  just remember  you get what you pay for  
P => Great Stay   We stayed here for   nights last week  Loved it  Thanks to recommendations from others on the Las Vegas forum  I called the hotel ahead and requested the  rd floor  We had rooms     and      Both rooms newly renovated  A C worked great  No smell of smoke at all Very clean and the bathroom was renovated as well  We had prime location on the strip  so everything was walking distance We would stay here again  We paid     per night  Great price for the prime location  
P =>  Diamond In The Rough My husband and I just got back from a   night stay at the Casino Royale and we LOVED it  It was a smaller casino  but had everything we needed  The rooms were large and clean and provided us with a safe  fridge  and coffee maker  The casino had a large variety of games and using the hotel s club card gave us many fun playing coupons  The hotel pool is smaller  but again big enough to swim laps and adequate space to get some sun  It is open daily from      a m  to       p m  One of the other great things about this hotel is the location  It s pretty much right smack dab in the middle of the strip  Restaurants right next door include McDonald s  Panda Express  and Chipotle   Outback Steakhouse connected to hotel  We will be staying here again on our next visit to Vegas and why not with the player s card you can earn free nights  
P =>  Great location My husband and I were pleasantly surprised by our stay at Casino Royale  We go to Vegas often but the weekend prices can get exorbinant  You can usually find a reasonable rate here and it is a good deal  The rooms are clean and of a good size  The casino is fun with quick drink service when you are playing  My husband and I won       playing video poker  luck of the draw of course but winning always gives me a favorable impression of a hotel  The only thing I would recommend is requesting a room on the Venetian side  We were on the Harrah s side right by a loading dock and the trucks were rolling in all night  backing up with that loud beep and we got very little sleep The location is wonderful  close to all the big casinos  We would definitely return  
P =>  Enjoyed stay A group of us girls  bestfriend weekend  stayed here for   night  The hotel is off the main road so no noise  Which was great  The rooms are nice  Clean  and well kept  The hotel bar tender Daryl was great     margarita   whoooooo    Had a great time here  Friend won on penny slots Would love to go back 
P => Value Value Value I stayed here for three nights in uary and would recommend this to any one that wants good value in themiddle of the strip  Very clean rooms  very standardnot a lot of extras but can t beat it fo location  cleanliness and value  No hesitation to stay here again  
P =>  Best Buy on the Strip This hotel is the best buy on the strip  It is certainly not elegant or luxurious  but it is clean and inexpensive  The location can t be beat  Right across from Caesar s and The Mirage  I have stayed there several times  and always enjoyed my stay  
P => close the tables in vegas  Visited the casino weekend of june      Place was filled even at     am  but the dealers announced craps tables were closing  and the only one left would be the sit down craps  This place was FULL at     with action  Best craps odds in town     xodds  but the sit down only has   x The craps table near the bar is dirty  and has some duct tape holding the rails  One dealer said that they can not afford to pay OT  so they close tables down  THis is vegas and they close  The Subway was expensive       for a meal deal  THis place is in a good location  and they give     in free slot play for getting a players card  The pit boss has mine still  they lost it  They can have it  They only bring draft beer to tables  must get bottles at full price at the bar  I can only imagine that this place will be replaced soon  
P => Bad experience We travel to Vegas once a year and enjoy staying at different hotels each time  This was our first and last stay at the Casino Royale  While we are certainly not picky about every little thing  there were too many things here that were unacceptable  We read this site often for the reviews  and in doing so found that you should request one of the newly remodeled rooms on the  th floor  We did just that  When walking in the room it was very nice  Had a mini bar with fridge  etc  But the room felt like it was not very clean  We put on a clean pair of socks  walked across the room to the window  and our socks became filthy  Next  beware of the rooms on the right side of the casino  facing the McDonalds   This was where our room was  and it was right above the loading dock  We were kept awake ALL NIGHT due to the beeping  yelling  and other noises associated with a loading dock  We walked outside the next day and observed that there were about    rooms from floors     that would have all had the same situation  the ones nearest the back parking lot   We know the rooms are cheap here  but is this why  The casino itself was nice and small  but very dark and many mirrors  We ourselves were concerned that we would walk into one of the mirrors  and wondered what elderly people with poor eyesight must encounter here    Needless to say  we were booked to stay for   nights  checked out  and checked into the Monte Carlo   what an incredible difference  Bottom line  if it is cheap you get what you pay for  
P =>  surprised Was surprised on how clean the rooms were kept  bathrm  clean towels everyday  beds made  amp  all straighted up everyday  Would stay again  Right in the middle of the strip  Only one problem sometimes could enter hotel without pass key  because door left open  Met lots of security walking the halls  next to Dennys for good breakfast  I enjoyed the convenience   ie  Ronkonkoma  NY  
P =>  My first trip to Vegas stayed at Casino Royale We arrived at the Casino Royale around       Pm  It was a little difficult finding the front desk  Check in was fast  Our room was clean  Nothing flashy which wasa OK  since I wasn t planning on being in the room too much   The thermostat on the A C didn t work  It kept turning on and off   on and off   on and off    so I just turned it off The casino was fun  Like the rooms  nothing flashy but it got the job done  This is a place for the really low rollers like me  Black Jack  roulette  and craps all had low minimum bets  So low  it s hard to get on a table  Food was also cheap with Subway  Denny s and Outback on site  Throw in the    Michelobs  guaritas had very little if any alcohol  and you ve got a low rollers dream The best thing about the Casino Royale was the location  It was almost in the middle of the strip  It s between Harrah s and the Venetian and across the street from the Mirage and Caesar s  Everywhere was within walking distance and we went to every casino on the strip All in all  I had a good time  No regrets about staying at the Casino Royale  Except for the A C  the room was Ok  Service was good and the Casino was made with the little guy in mind  I would recommend Casino Royale if you want a no frills room in a great location  
P =>  No Complaints We stayed at Casino Royale for   nights the end of ch  Nothing fancy but the coffee pot in the room was a real plus for us  Quiet and clean  One tip though ask for a hair dryer at the desk at check in  A bit crowded at the entrance to the rooms with a popular t shirt seller right at the room entrance  Great location with McDonalds next door for quick food  Casino is small and crowded but friendly  Played craps for the first time and staff was helpful  Glad we found this place and would stay here again  
P =>  Perfect for the price   Perfect location  right on the strip by the Venetian  TI  Mirage  Easy in and  out parking  You can enter and exit on Koval Ave instead of the Strip I got a smoking room  There was a tiny bit of the smoking motel room smell hanging in the air  but not bad at all   much better than the typical crappy motel  Rooms are very close to the casino and to the front desk  No casino noise in the room however  Beds were very comfortable  Room was clean  For late night food  the casino s Subway was open at  am  It may be open    hours   I don t know One concern  is the air conditioning system a match for the Las Vegas summer  It was only about    degrees during the day when I was there  and I could not get my room cold  I really mean cold  though   I like hotel rooms to be at    degrees  I plan to stay again in e and will report on the A C  
P => Great place in the middle of all the action     Stayed here at the Casino Royale and I have to say   quot  This place is off the chains quot   Only problem I had was when I made the reservations for the junior suite they said I would have a wrap around leather couch  It was their error because that is only available for the suite  I told them i was informed wrong and they tried to upgrade me for free but they were completely sold out that weekend  I had the chance to actually see the suite and I am def  going back to stay in there  Great room for the money especially if your splitting the money with a few friends  ior Suite with   rooms    tv s split with   other friends came out to         a piece      a night  you cant beat that  Plus ITS RIGHT ON THE STRIP     you step out and Vegas life is right in front of your eyes    stars if they would of upgrade      P S  Bring an Iron or get yours first they ran out hahahhahhahaaaaa 
P =>  Location is key We stayed at the Casino Royale for   nights in ch      after staying at Mandalay Bay for   nights on the same trip  We stayed at Mandalay Bay for a convention but when it was time for me to pay for the last two nights  it was           per night  We made the reservations about   weeks before the trip and ch is a VERY expensive time of the year for Las Vegas  We normally stay at the Flamingo because of the location  but the rooms were about         per night  We decided to stay at Casino Royale because that is where we spend all of our time gambling every trip anyway Our room at Casino Royale was about    feet from the casino and we could not hear any of the casino noise  The Casino Royale is your basic motel like Motel    Don t expect any frills just a clean room  The rooms were average size  but after staying at some of the mega resorts on the strip they seemed small but in compairson to other motels in the US  the room size is about right  I would stay at Casino Royale again because of the gambling and the location  The pool is about the size of my bathtub  so don t expect to spend the day at the pool unless you just want to lay in the sun  The food is average  There is a Subway and Noble Pizza in the casino and a Denny s attached to the casino and an Outback upstairs  We ate at the Outback on another trip and it was very good  I am not a fan of eating at a Denny s on vacation since I don t eat at Denny s at home and as far as the Subway and Noble Pizza in the casino  I choose not to eat at somewhere in the smoke filled casino unless I am drunk  The casino is rather smoke filled which bothers the contacts but that is what 
P =>   Short walk to action but bad A C and heating   I booked a room here for two nights on last minute s notice during a busy Vegas weekend  My room was clean and decent  Super   quality  but larger   I was prepared for a surly staff  but the front desk lady was very pleasant  The hotel is so small that the walk to the casino is wonderfully short  and the door to the strip is about    feet away from where the hotel  quot security quot  door and the casino meet  My only gripe was that there is no individual climate controls in the rooms  When they have the heating system on  starting in ober  the rooms can get very warm if the temp goes above    f outside  I had to open my window  but then the noise of the strip will keep you up The casino is old school Vegas  Very cheap  friendly and great gambling rules     x odds on Craps and such   A little smokey though  Cheap drinks  but don t eat anything there  walk next door to Harrah s or somewhere else  
P =>  Loved the Casino Royale  
P =>  Choice location   inexpensive surprise  
P =>  The Price Is Right   
P =>  Good no frills hotel in a great location  
P => 
P => Clean Comfortable  My husband and I booked the Rooms in the Manor and the experience was really good  We had my sister and parents also  Even if we did not ask  on check in  they gave us adjoining rooms  The rooms were clean and comfortable  The rooms were located on the ground floor   and parking was basically just in front of the manor Circus Circus offerred really good buffet meals   at    USD for the whole day  breakfast  lunch and dinner  and they also offered all you can eat prime rib for    USD  It was well worth it We stayed for   nights and we had a really great time  It is probably one of the cheapest hotels but facilities were great  
P =>   Not for us  Just returned from Vegas and a couple of days at the Grand Canyon  We stayed at Circus Circus and wasn t thrilled by the place  It s a place for you to take little kids and if you have an RV there is a KOA campground at the back of the hotel The Steak House is fantastic  Garden Grill is ok but compared to other hotels somewhat short on bars or lounges  People in the casino didn t look happy  maybe losing a lot  as we did  the slots certainly don t let you win many times  A little out of the way to other hotels casinos unless you are a decent walker  the buses are ok but don t seem to come by that often and it can get a little cool this time of the year The room we had was decent and clean   Skyrise tower   but the hotel as a whole is grubby and the constant hassle of the vendors reminds you of being in a place a lot less than Vegas casino Downtown is worth a visit  the Freemont street is as it states   an experience  Golden Nugget has been fixed up and looking good Miracle Mile shops and Planet Holywood hotel are outstanding Be sure to visit the Grand Canyon  awe inspiring place and it was nice to get away from the Circus for a couple of days Pay a few more bucks and stay elsewhere  Circus is part of MGM and the Mirage so I think they will keep it going for the kids and RV crowd to stay and play  Not for us though  
P =>   Would stay anywhere else    I had never been to Vegas before this and if this was the only hotel there  I d never go back  The service is horrible  they are slow and always seem to disappear when you re next in line  The buffet is the dumps  the food tasted old and reheated  And the casino     for a kids hotel  this is the worst place you could take your children  The smell of smoke is revolting  and i m not saying that because I m a non smoker because you can smoke in any casino and I had to cover my nose when I d enter that casino  The only good thing I can say about it was the new west tower is nice and worth the extra     a night to upgrade  otherwise  stay elsewhere  
P =>   a bit tired Stayed at the Circus Circus for   nights  The room and facilities were ok especially for the price we paid  so I can t complain  It has to be said though  the hotel has seen better days  some of the gambling areas in particular could do with a facelift The Garden Grill where we had a meal though  has to be recommended as good value for money  also a delicious steak was had  Finallay  the service in the cafe on the ground floor was excellent    
P =>   Circus Circus Hotel Las Vegas We stayed in the Circus Circus Hotel for   nights  as people say there is   sections to this hotel the manor rooms  amp  tower rooms I stayed in the Tower Rooms in the main hotel  which were very good with   big queen beds and nice bathroom We also had the buffet one day which is     for breakfast  lunch  amp  dinner  its good value nice supply of salads etc 
P =>  Circus Circus   highly recommended I ve stayed there twice  sept       and feb         I travelled with some work mates and we chose this hotel because it was pretty cheap  compared to other places  it looked good and has a good position  Depending on the period of travelling  you can get lower prices   so check their fees from time to time Circus Circus    is situated on the Strip   so one can easily get to most points of attraction either by walking or by taking the bus  It takes about       minutes to get from Circus to Luxor  and you walk by the Bellagio hotel  by the Caesar or the Venice Booking was easy and fast  even if there were a lot of people in line   this place has a lot of rooms and a lot of guests  The rooms were very clean and the view from the   th floor was magnificent  One can see a nice piece of the Vegas from the Circus Circus windows  The casino is pretty cheerful  a lot of young people looking forward to having fun  and it s cheaper than in other hotels  Free drinks for the players  Souvenir shops  a mini roller coaster park right inside the hotel  restaurants   this hotel has them all  although places aren t as luxurious as in the Bellagio  There s also a chapel for those with serious intentions  or who just got too drunk   About the hotel s weak points  it s very big and pretty crowded  you have to pay attention on how to get to your room  how to get to the reception and how to get to the restrooms  once you re in the casino  There are circular places in the casino  the McD zone  and it s easy to get lost  Or lose your children  The staff proves to be helpful in these situations  Another issue  typical to Las Vegas  was getting in the hotel after police closed one end of the Strip in order to get some guy   in order to enter the Circus Circus  we had to pick a different route  so be sure you have a GPS  very useful on all US teritory  I highly recommend for people who don t wanna spend too much money on a room  you ll just sleep in it  there are so many attraction out there   yet wanna be able to have fun in a nearby casino  and stay close to the Strip  
P =>   LAS VEGAS really great hotel for family with kids  lost of rides in the dome  buffet and stores inside hotel had pretty good prices  easy transportation to get access to hotels on strip and prices where good 
P =>   For just over    pounds  under     a night this hotel is fine     We booked   nights at Circus Circus for Mid tember     We were   Scottish  amp    Canadian on a road trip travelling from Alberta  Canada and then heading back up California Coast and Las Vegas was to be one of the main stopping points on our trip  We were visiting Vegas for the first time and after reading mixed reviews about most hotels in Vegas we decided to stop reading the reviews  amp  just book so Circus Circus it was   At a very cheap price per night our party of    two couples and   other opted for   rooms  At check  in we were greeted by our polite but very straight to the point receptionist and allocated   rooms in the Skyrise tower   th floor I think   Up to the rooms we went and were pleasantly surprised rooms very clean  good decorative order  modern TV and clean bathroom with basic amenities  After spending many hotel nights in North America and in Europe and working in    amp    star hotels on both sides of the atlantic  these rooms for the price we paid per night get no complaints from us   They were serviced everyday to a good standard  We didn t encounter any problems with the hotel itself  free car parking  buffet restaurant  ok its not fancy but if you didnt fancy walking in the heat to somewhere and wanted a quick breakfast or dinner it is fine  The Casino has the same machines in it as as all the others and the shops not fancy but if its cheap souvenirs your looking for thats what you get  The Swimming Pool is not the biggest and if you are someone who wants to spend all day at the pool then you might be a bit bored at this small area  Fitness Centre is well equipped The hotels location is about      minutes walk from Caesars Palace  Mirage  Fashion Mall  Treasure Island  amp  the Wynn hotels etc   no problems walking to and from  Recommendations for Las Vegas    see the Love Show in the Mirage   fantasticTake a Taxi to Fremont Street experience and eat at Golden Gate Casino for cheap old fashioned Vegas experience The Peppermill restaurant just   mins walk from Circus Circus   take a right and its on opposite side  glass low rise building open    hours   not fancy but great food  amp  drink pancakes and hot and crispy chicken wrap recommended  Enjoy yourself 
P =>   DIRTY NOISY POOR SERVICE   NEED I SAY MORE  My husband and I stayed at this hotel for   nights in tember       When we booked in the only rooms that were available were the lodges away from the main hotel  These rooms were like cardboard boxes  we could hear people in the rooms on both sides  below us  and outside the window so we didn t get much sleep  The bed was clean but the corridors leading to the rooms were dirty  the air conditioners were noisy  the staff were unfriendly  When we booked in we gave our credit card details and were asked to initial in   places and sign at the bottom of the checkin sheet  When we checked out   days later we noticed that we had been charged for telephones calls every day  When I queried this the person at the desk showed me that I had initialled that I agree to be charged for daily phonecalls even if we don t use the phone      I objected at being told to initial this charge and not being told what it meant and the lady told me that there was nothing I could do as I d initialed it  When I got angry and walked away the staff just laughed at me  So this is a warning to anyone who is planning to stay at the Circus Circus Hotel in Las Vegas  be careful what you initial when you check in  I will not stay at this hotel again even if it was the last hotel on earth and I certainly wouldn t recommend it to anyone  
P =>  Good Deal Its    bucks a night      its on the strip      the steak house is amazing        the buffet is terrible  worst ever  Its clean  and comfy  Stayed for cheap at circus circus and partied everywhere else  
P =>  Hotel is a lot older and it shows but your kids of all ages will love the entertainment We were able to book a great price for air and hotel for a family of four at the Circus Circus Las Vegas  in il       This was our  th time to Vegas   st time with the kids The hotel is one of the oldest hotels on the strip   and it shows  The front desk was very nice at check in but the service in other areas was terrible  We requested a fridge upon check in and after numerous calls  it was sent to our room close to midnight the next day  FYI   the fridge was so beat up and loud that we unplugged it after a few hours  Rooms say they have been updated but even the nicer rooms are no comparison to some of the other cheaper hotels on the strip  Just because the hotel is on the strip does not mean it is in a convenient location  There is a shuttle pickup almost right outside the hotel but get there early otherwise you ll be standing in line for a long time  The double deuce is a great way to get around but lines are long at every stop  We paid a little more for a cab just so we didn t have wait so long Things I liked about the Circus Cirucs   McDonalds  Activities for kids of all agesDislikes   hotel  needs a makeover   location 
P =>  One of Many vegas Trips We have been lots and plan to go more   Great place  Loose Slots and great Service  
P =>  Stayed once before hotel has been updated  Traveled to Vegas for leisure trip with husband  Brother  amp  sister in law for a few days of R amp R  Circus Circus was a good location at other end of strip in old town  We had afab time  stayed here about   years ago  hotel has been updated and looks good  Value of room was great with space and view in tower room  Many shops and bargains Will stay again  
P =>   TIREDBUT FRIENDLY AND CHEAP we asked to be moved on arrival  st room only   lamp ouy of   worked and swower rail faulty rooms old and tired in towers ask for newer room much better staff great cc is for those on a budget and not too fussy get a multi day bus pass great value and everyone on packed busses friendly and chatty 
P =>   Oh What a Circus Circus  I stayed here with friends for five nights in ober    A recent reviewer of this hotel seems to think that all we tripadvisors want to do is moan   We are all entitled to our opinion and everyone s experience will not only be different  but valid  This hotel has clearly seen better days and is in need of a major revamp  Coming from a country that has banned smoking in public places for a number of years and a lifetime non smoker I can totally concur with the stink that awaits you when you walk through the door  The other hotels along the strip allow smoking but they seem to be able to remove the smell more efficiently My  quot non smoking quot  room wasn t much better and this in a hotel which children are catered for in a big way  This is a hotel which is definitely for families who are looking for Blackpool Pleasure Beach and piers under one roof   UK Tripadvisors will know what I mean   Popular but not for everyone and the hotel blurb doesn t make that clear As with others  check in was tiresome and took    minutes  Once you got to the desk the process was quick enough but not very welcoming after a long flight  We were in the Manor rooms across the road  No better than Super   Motel standard  A small fridge was available but when I opened the door it was stinking so I never used it The room was cleaned every day with fresh towels and toiletries  Bathroom is typical for this type of hotel  We never ate at the     buffet  MacDonalds is next door and there was definitely less waiting and at least you know what you are getting  Bar service was pretty basic but there was happy hour   for   which was good value At the weekend  families arrive big time and although they are not allowed on the casino floor  kids tended to run beserk around the perimeter  You can understand the attraction Circus Circus has for kids  The lights  noise  excitement  circus acts  funfair etc   you get my drift  I got the impression that the whole theme of the place is a bit outdated   Clowns  trapeze artistes  funfair rides etc This is definitely a family friendly hotel and if you are prepared to accept cheap prices and lower standards and call it  quot value for money quot  then you won t go wrong  You only get what you pay for  as the say  However the hotel suffers from years of lack of investment and is now very far behind the other major hotels on the strip  If you lower your expectations  using this place as a place to sleep only  then there is plenty to enjoy around the rest of the strip and you will have a great time  Depending on the type of family you are  as a parent you will either love or hate this place  Couples could find a better deal elsewhere  Would I return   My second trip to Las Vegas and my third visit to the US this year   To Las Vegas  definitely  but not to this hotel  The place has seen better days and needs to catch up with the   st century instead of living off its hey day thirty years ago  be just a coincidence but one of my friends who stayed with us was diagnosed with bed bug bites when he returned home Enjoy it while it lasts because at this rate it will be flattened and replaced before long  or closed for major refurbishnment  Viva Las Vegas  
P =>  Circus Circus   Value For Your Buck We booked this hotel as part of a charter package for   nights    days  and flight  came out to less than      CAN per person  When we arrived  the long check in line was a little annoying  but we did arrive around   am  not the usual check in time of  pm  Still  they eventually added more staff  and we were in our room within a half hour  And what a nice room it was  We were given the West Tower  and when we walked in  it was nice and spacious  with a flat screen tv  and marble sinks and walls in the shower  It definitely looked remodeled  even though the hallway looked kind of like an old apartment  But after a couple of days  I didn t even care about that  I liked the fact it was north of the strip  so it was like being in the suburbs  away from the excessive noise and crowds of the main Strip area  We weren t planning on spending our entire day at Circus Circus  so it was more than adequate for our needs  The cleaning staff was really nice and left us extra things when we asked  The Circus buffet is hit and miss  If you want fancy dining  then you re going to the wrong place  If you want just enough food to stuff yourself that is still good quality  then     for a all day buffet purchase is a steal  considering each meal is at least      And if you don t want to eat that  I d recommend the McDonalds  the best food ever  Don t bother paying for WiFi  just go to the fancy McDonads next door  and use their free WiFi  There s a Starbucks on Paradise and Sahara just    minutes walk north  The casinos in general were smokey  so Circus Circus wasn t any worse  I made      in the penny machine on my first day  so that was a treat Overall  I liked the atmosphere of the place  I m not into the fancy  shiny hotels  Those places are fine to visit and play the casinos  but they seem to posh for my tastes  And it was nice and quiet in our room  so you could even take a quiet nap in the afternoon  I didn t take advantage of the Adventure Dome  so I can t comment on the rides or anything else in there We did the Grand Canyon tour  pre booked via the internet  so it was nice that Circus Circus was one of a few hotels that the buses pulled into  both for pick up and drop off at the end of a long day I will definitely be checking into this place again  
P =>   Yuck  We got a great package deal and that is reason we got this hotel  The buffet is disgusting my husband and I both were nauceous the remainder of the day after we ate the food  Each morning I would woke up with a stuffed up nose and I think it was because the room seemed so dusty  It is a great place to stay if you want a cheap trip to Vegas but otherwise spend more money and stay somewhere else  
P =>  Customer Service at its best Value for money Great place Circus Circus las vegas     wow Great place thats located in the heart of things      fanatastic casino    were i won on roulette  People from all walks of life there rich poor family couples romance    somthing for eveyone  and a Big buffet style breaffast every morning with very helpfull and friendly staff     If you get the chance go go go Pictures on there way      
P =>   circus circus is a great las vegas hotel if you have kids or are a kid at heart this is a really great hotel the rooms may be older but it is a decent place to sleep the casino is totally awesome the adventuredome theme park is great for everyone as is the midway games the pizzeria is some of the best food ive ever tasted id recommend to anyone traveling to las vegas to stay at the circus circus hotel 
P =>   not real good I chose Circus Circus because of the price  Sometimes you get what you pay for  I requested a quiet room  I was told the outside rooms are quieter than the tower rooms  What we got sounded like a motocross race track at nights  The noise was from chain saws that were being used for their holloween freight dome  The curtains do not shut well to block out the bright lights  The neighbors TV sets go right thru the walls  If you want a quiet room after a night of entertainment  Circus Circus is not the place to stay  
P =>   good value for money We stayed at Circus Circus for   nights on the last leg of our honeymoon  Certainly value for money  Its situated at the bottom end of the Strip and not far from Downdown  There is a public bus stop just outside where we got a day pass     hours  for     If you arrive in Las Vegas between  am   pm then you are best to book a shuttle service which cost    pp each way from the airport to hotel  We arrived after midnight and got a taxi which cost us      We were a little disappointed that the fairground wasnt open the   nights we were there  Hotel staff were very helpful and friendly  We ate in the buffet restraunt which cost     for an all day pass  
P =>   Place to stay  ok The rooms are fine   just make sure if you specified a  quot no smoking quot  room that you do get it  They changed our room to a non smoking without any problems The hotel casino restaurant area is very smoky  and we found hard to tolerate   so went to gamble to other casinos Its location on the strip is further from the main hotels and casinos  but the bus that goes up and down the strip stops right there  The rate was very good  however  We booked   nights with   of them being free THere is a McDonald s very close for cheap breakfast and a few places selling half priced show tickets  Overall stay was ok  but hated the smoke filled casino area  
P =>   Great hotel for a great price We stayed at the hotel for a night during the week and then came back for the weekend  I checked a bag with the concierge between the   stays  and the first day was free We stayed in different rooms for the   stays  both rooms were spacious  clean and beautiful  My friend and I each had a very comfortable queen size bed We ordered a fridge for the room and it was promptly delivered Check in and check out were fast and efficient  and there was pleanty of parking The hotel is located towards the end of the strip  so it was easy to avoid traffic by taking the highway from one end of the strip to the other  
P =>  Good value for the money The room was good  Free circus acts were pretty good  Lot of entertainment for kids  
P =>  Excellent value great for kids We had a great time at the Circus Circus  It s a little old but overall clean  good location  and excellent value  I had a   yr old and   yr old boy and both enjoyed the Adventuredome park  Our stay included     tickets  so that was another excellent value  The buffet was uninspired  but again with     coupons an excellent value  The only hitch for the trip was the checkin   it took probably close to an hour in a line that just didn t seem to move  The rooms have individual AC units mounted under the windows and they are pretty loud  but we got used to it  Room was clean and cozy  The circus area really needs an update but the free show was entertaining  The room was so cheap that we just left it vacant for a few days to visit the Grand Canyon  
P => excellent hotel fast check in great room had a great view  room made up everyday evan when we didn quot t leave until       am  checking out is simple and fast  evan somebody from nebraska could do it  me   ask for a tower room  swimming pool accross the street via walk way  
P =>  Best for families with kids  Stayed with young children and had a great time  Lots to do  Buffet was okay  Food choices were good for picky eaters  
P =>  Great Value for     great value for the       lots for Kids to do  Fun hotel  
P =>  Circus Circus was a fun place to stay   great for kids If your looking a great value with lots to do   then circus circus is for you  Great location on the strip   if you have kids   you never really have to leave the property   Mcdonalds is right next door  Fun and lots of adventures within the hotel  Staff was really nice   great value for the      
P =>  Understand you get what you pay for   I did my research and I decided to take a chance  I took tips off here and tired to stay in the west tower where the remodeled rooms are and I asked for a non smoking room  We checked in really late and when we got there we were sent to our smoking room on the smoking floor  If you smoke you don t understand the disgust a non smoker feels when being devoured by an entire hallway and room that smells like cigarette smoke  I was nice and politely asked to be moved to another room and guess what  They were all out of non smoking rooms   Thankfully someone read we were on our honeymoon and a very nice person upgraded us to the honeymoon suite and no one ever stays in the room because most honeymooners opt for a better hotel  Its was comfortable  big and I was happy for the rest of the trip  The free circus acts were cool  There are lots of kids on the weekend but not during the week  Hotel was a bit difficult to navigate  Overall we had an awesome stay and if i m on a budget i may take the risk and stay there again i ll just know what i m getting myself into  After all its vegas so start your gambling now and book your room at Circus Circus  
P =>  FIRST VEGAS EXPEIRIENCE NOT A LET DONW This is my first Vegas trip and my friends and I were on a budget  We searched for several of good deals and the cheapest one with a hotel on the strip was Circus  Check in  Only   people working dealing with check ins and outs  Once it was our turn the lady behind the desk was very helpful with our answers and accommodations  We had a queen size bed but switched us to a room with two queens for the same price  There is an extra    a day for phone charge  Our room was a decent size room over looking the pool and part of the strip  Our maid was very nice and gave us extra towels and pillows  It was a long walk to get to our elevator  We had to go through every shop and slot tables while the air is filled with so much cigarette smoke it feels as if you are inhaling a pack a day  The hotel is very family oriented as kids are running rampage while drinking     OZ soda pop while parents are gambling their college funds away  They have a nice area with rides and carnival games along with really cool free acrobatic show  The buffet has a deal that you can eat all day for       lunch and dinner  The food is bland at best and lacks flavor  They added six new dishes for dinner and had the same thing from lunch  If you are planning to go and see the rest of the hotels I strongly recommend purchasing the Deuce bus pass  For     for   days unlimited  Over all Circus for families is great as there is a ton of things the kids can do  For couples the money saved on the hotel you can enjoy a good dinner on the strip or a grand canyon trip  For friends  its a room with a bed  shower and on the strip in the end that is all you need  
P =>  cheap for the strip I know there are better hotels on the strip  but this one is cheap  We did book a room in the West Tower which I think has been done up in the last couple of years  Asked for a room with a good view  which we got  on the   th floor  The room was clean and comfortable and for     a night for us both  mon thurs rates   I was quite happy  The monorail is a bit of a walk in the heat down to the Hilton  but the Deuce buses are very regular and cheap   if a bit crowded The best thing about the Circus Circus   you have Slots of Fun right on your doorstep     c roulette     craps and    blackjack  If you are on a budget and want to stay on the strip  then I think it s a good choice  although I have heard really bad reports on the manor rooms  I have not personally stayed in them so can t comment  so if your budget can stretch to it  go for the West Tower  
P =>  great time great price I stayed in te manor and I have no idea what anyone is complaining about  I had   beds  my own fridge  the room was clean when I arrived and kept clean while I stayed  My room had a color t v  that had NBC CBS FOX FOX News and Cnnn News and TBS   maybe a few more    the bathroom was adaquit size  I had an iron and an ironing board   What else do you want for the price     The poker room was clean and curtious  The food at the buffet was acceptable and always hot  For     a day all u can eat i was defiantly impressed  The check in line was a little long but the service people were friendly and accomadating  I would defiantly return for another trip     Unless I hit the lotto  then I would probably try somthing fancyer         sorry no pics  what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas  
P =>  Another good trip This is our  rd visit to Circus   Circus and again it was a good trip  Yes the check in queue is long but the staff on the desk worked very efficiantly to get us through as quickly as they could  We were upgraded   again  to a West Tower Room which are lovely all newly refurbished and comfortable The Buffet is reasonable to eat at  the breakfasts are very good  the evening dinners not quite so good The pools are always good to sit at during the morning as it was so hot during our stay  We have always found the staff very friendly  so dont take notice of the all the negative reviews  We were worried the first time we went with the reviews but have never had any problems  Yes  it is busy at the weekend with families going to the Adventure Dome but they do no harm to anyone  If you didn t like children why would you book to stay there  We loved to see all the kids faces when they came away with arm full of toys etc  All in all it was another enjoyable stay  I tip   there is a trip to Laughlin you can book for    at the trip shop in the casino area  It is the bargain of the month year  You get a coach trip to a small town on the Colorado River with   or   casinos and a free buffet thrown in   a lovely day out  Pick up is  am and back by  pm  Also good prices for all the shows at the     price bureau in the hotel  Dont believe all the negative reviews  some people you can never please    
P =>  Good vaue for the price We stayed there on a fridaynight after looking for a cheap nice hotel in LV  We paid      tax  not bad for a weekend  and we mentioned that we were on our honeymoon  They gave us a nicer room  and THAT was a nice room          big an open  flat screen TV clean and quiet  Could not ask for anything else A great option if you are looking for a cheap hotel in LV  
P =>   Cannot believe I paid     dollars for this  So I made a reservation at expedia for the Circus Circus in hopes to stay the night in a real hotel on the strip  Instead  they put us in the Manor rooms  which is worse than the travelodge super  motel   All of which were available for less than what I paid at this dump And I already disliked clowns   So unless they GUARANTEE you a room in the towers  steer FAR AWAY from here  
P =>   You get what you pay for    Our family of four  boys     amp     stayed at Circus Circus in mid late ust for   nights  It is an extremely large  somewhat chaotic place which the boys loved and my wife and I tolerated  On the plus side  the kids LOVED the Adventuredome  and the beds for some reason   were not looked down upon and were excited to be in Vegas  The rooms were dark and somewhat dated and aside from a quickly remedied issue with the bathtub  fine  except for the television reception which was inexplicably awful   However  housekeeping was literally unable to provide us with an extra pillow  which is difficult to believe in a hotel with      rooms  The casino was unspectacular  skip Slots  o Fun next door  but actually had a decent vibe and the restaurant choices were adequate  The desk staff was pleasantly accommodating for the amount of people they have to deal with  There is also a discount tickets desk in the lobby for a good number of shows in town which we used to good effect The hotel is located on the north end of the strip and despite what others have written here  it is a hike to the main strip areas and traffic on Las Vegas Boulevard is a nightmare   I would take Industrial Avenue behind the hotel to  quot get somewhere quot   Circus Circus is fine place to stay if you need to do Las Vegas on the very cheap or if you have younger kids for whom the Adventuredome  which is really kind of good  is a big draw  However  if you are looking for glitz and glamour  there are better  moderate priced choices  If I were to return to Vegas with my kids  I would consider staying here again  for a weekend away with my wife  no  
P =>   Very nice and funny hotel not so far from the centre of the strip I stayed   nights in this hotel in august  the hotel is composed of two main buildings and  on the other side of the road  of   minor buildings  The hotel is full of attractions  a huge cover dome with rollercoaster  two swimmingpools  casino  restaurants   everything based on the circus style  The rooms are big and the bed very comfortable  the bathroom is clean  and you can park the car in front of your room  if you are in one of the minor buildings  The location is not so far from the main hotels of the strip    minutes far from the bellagio A good tip  you can park your car for free in every hotel on the strip  Very usefull and you can save money  don t use the taxi  very expensive  
P =>   family wedding went to circus circus over christmas      for a family wedding  the rooms were very clean  large and looked after very well  the hotel was busy because of the christmas holidays but the staff were very helpfull to us british people  even on christmas day when we had a problem over hiring wedding suites for the men  one lady went out of her way to help us out of a very difficult situation  we were a party of    adults and   kids and no one had any problems at all  we had trips arrange for us very well  the buffet area for our breakfast was superb  i would recommend this hotel to anyone  value for money and service at its best  
P =>   Rooms are clean but if you want fancy go somewhere else We ended up in Circus Circus since the Flamingo lost our reservation and it was fully booked  We decided for the price to stay there and at that point there were not that many hotels to pick  I m glad we rented a car because it is further than it appears  We didn t stay at the hotel  so it was perfect to sleep  The rooms were very clean and same as the bathroom with no luxurious ammenities  Next time  I will pick somewhere in the middle of the strip with all the walking that we did and the car came handy as well  The casino look kinda dirty on the morning light  
P =>   VERY pleasantly surprised  I was hesitant about booking our rooms    of them   here after reading all of the negative reviews  Luckily  I ve never been one to listen to negativitty  YES  Circus Circus is one of the older hotels  but I had not one problem with them  We arrived around noon and the VERY friendly desk clerk let us check in early with no hesitation  We were even given  quot buy one  get one free coupons for the Adventuredome  which is a lot of fun   I was traveling with a group of friends and my sister with her    month old son  Circus Circus was a very kid friendly hotel  actually it seemed as thought ALL of Vegas was  as there were children everywhere     ALL three of our West Tower rooms were very clean and just like any standard hotel room  The staff was always nice and helpful  Even the buffet was great and reasonabliy priced  There is a Deuce bus stop right outside the front of the hotel  so getting to the main part of the strip was easy  I would recommend this hotel to everyone who would rather spend their money on gambling and shows and not on a lavish hotel that you re ONLY going to be sleeping in    
P =>   Not as bad as I expected We stayed in the SkyRise tower and the rooms were actually decent  I had heard and read some HORRIBLE reviews but was stuck staying here with a group I enjoyed the buffet but my friends did not  It was priced decent for what you get  comparable to Golden Corral  McDonalds is inside with decent prices that families and people on a budget can afford  If you get hungry after   pm  you dont have many food options as every restaurant seemed to be closed from   pm to  pm except McDonalds and a few snack places or is not bright and shiny and new like other hotels  but its bearable and okay if you are just going to be out on the strip all day anyway The only thing that I could complain about are the children    I am allergic to them and they were everywhere   lt kidding gt  
P =>   Never Never again at Circus Circus The hotel was old and and several different locations  manors  towers  and I stayed in the West Tower and others stayed in the Manor  The hotel looked old  the staff was not helpful and they had so many other sidewalk vendor selling their stuff it was just very uncomfortable  The Manor location of circus circus was similar to and old Motel    old furniture  old bedding  quot Yuck quot   We had about    people staying at the Hotel to attend a wedding and everyone agreed the next time they visit Vegas they will never stay at Circus Circus  
P =>   Fantastic hotel and great value for money  Just returned from trip  thought Circus Circus was fantastic  was great value for money  the rooms were really spacious and clean with large bathrooms  TV s  air con etc  location was fine we were a little further up the strip than most hotels but there was a bus stop outside  the buses travel up and down the strip    per ride or       hr pass  easy to use  buy tickets before you get on the bus  Hotel facilities were great  lovely pool  free sunbeds and towels  poolside bar  plenty of space and shade    pools    spa pools  several casinos  main casino was nice  good service etc  plenty of on site shops including a great gift shop  never went in Adventuredome which is the   acre theme park even though you get one free wristband per person  looked cool though  Several restaurants in the hotel  I recommend the buffet  its amazing value for money  all you can eat and has a great selection of food  The all you can eat pasta not so good but the other food in mexitalia looks good just avoid the pasta  Garden Grill has a large menu  the    bar it turns into between  am  pm is def worth a visit too  
P =>   this place should be condemned The location is poor   the rooms outdated and dirty   we saw cockroaches on the wall in the bathroom   the casino was so smokey that we could barely breathe   I recommend asking someone you know about the best place to stay   don t go by the internet site   
P =>   nice cheap clean hotel  excellent value  i think this hotel was excellent vlaue  there was a promo on wensite  book   nights  get one free  thee   nights i payed for were     each and got Fri night  usually       for free  The rooms were big  same size as MGM s albeit a little dated   The rooms were clean  the aircon worked well  I dont think it was far out of the way off the strip  easilly withing walking distance to caesars and othre casinos or there is a bus right outside that takes you down the stip for    one way or    for    hours  The casino itself was not the best  and as others said there were a lot of kids  I was happy i stayed here  and when i went out at night to the othre casinos and cluns  i just got a cab or bus  it was very easy  
P =>   A good value  All of Vegas is on sale but this was a good find  Whether visiting a city or taking a cruise  it is best NOT to choose the most elaborate place for your first visit or sail on the best ship first  This way  you will appreciate the luxuries more on subsequent visits Circus Circus is      s Las Vegas and suitable for kids as there is an enclosed amusement park on premise Not the best location on the strip if you are carless  but everything one needs to get a feel for Vegas on the cheap  
P =>   A mixed bag overall but a very good value My wife and I decided to take a long weekend in Las Vegas for our anniversary at the end of ust  Southwest Airlines Vacations and the Circus Circus website essentially offered the same deal   a free hotel room with purchase of the airfare   We booked through Southwest Vacations   Despite some of the negative reviews here  I can t really argue with  free   So off we went As other people have noted  Circus Circus is an older property located toward the north end of the Strip  And with all the construction on the adjoining properties  there is less activity going on in that area  As a result  the traffic around the hotel isn t as bad as in the main part of Las Vegas Blvd  Plus  and the hotel has direct access to Industrial Road   the access road on the west side of the Strip   Most of the hotels on the west side of Las Vegas Blvd have access from Industrial Rd and Frank Sinatra Drive  but not always direct access  So you can avoid the traffic on the Strip by using the back way  but it is not always clear how to cut back over when you want to   On the other hand  you will need a car  particularly in the summer There seemed to be plenty of parking at Circus Circus  but the garages are older and the spaces are kind of narrow  The public areas at the hotel  including much of the casino floor  seem rather cramped compared to the newer hotels we walked through  The Promenade area around the AdventureDome is often packed  We walked through the midway area and the AdventureDome  The circus acts and the rides looked kind of fun  but we don t have kids and there were other things we wanted to do  The hotel has two smallish pools and two hot tubs  They are well maintained  but it takes some walking  and at least   elevators  to get to them  We only ate at one of the restaurants   the Pizzeria  If you are hungry and tired  we were   the food is adequate  However  we paid     for a personal pizza  a calzone  a glass of wine and a soft drink  There are much better options in Las Vegas A decent hotel room can make just about any place bearable  and Circus Circus delivered that  We stayed in a Main Tower Room  It was somewhat plain  with few extra amenities  and dated d cor  Some of the furniture was worn here and there and the clock didn t work  Plus  they put us in an end room with a view of a concrete wall  the West Tower   However  the room itself was spacious and clean with a comfortable bed  And since we were in Vegas we didn t spend a lot of time in the room anyway except to sleep and change clothes  Our experience with the service at the hotel was generally good  We arrived late and there wasn t a line for check in  There was a significant line at check out  but the hotel offers a self check out and I only had to drop off the card keys in the box  Housekeeping did a good job  And I was pleasantly surprised about the elevators  For the most part  they were fast  well maintained and conveniently located  The only exception was the pool elevators  which were slow  hard to find and hot  And on one occasion  the doors didn t open  We had to ride back down to the pool deck and take the other elevator All in all  I can t really complain about Circus Circus  Yes  it is aging and it is not as nice as some of the newer hotels  But it is kind of fun in its own way  Most importantly  it makes a decent base of operations from which to see other parts of Las Vegas  And we got a great deal  So what more could you really want  
P =>   Cheap rooms with great location This hotel is based at the north of the strip and is ideal for anyone who is looking for a cheap hotel on the strip  The rest of the strip is easily accessable from this hotel and downtown vegas a short cab ride away  The hotel looks a little dated and could do with a lick of paint in certain areas  It is ideal for families who can take advantage of the adventuredome which is inside the hotel  But  as mentioned this was ideal for what we wanted  a cheap hotel with low stakes blackjack  clean and comfortable rooms in a great location on the strip  
P =>   Nice nothing special   Circus circus has good sized rooms  very clean  and overall service good  However it s rather tired looking and right up the end of the strip a long trek from where most good bits are  Stayed in the skyrise tower which was again tired looking and rather shabby  marks on walls and chipped bits here and there  needs a revamp really  The hotel also had a weird musky water smell to it  kind of damp smell  If you want budget accommodation and then taxi or walk to the other areas for entertainment then it s fine  
P =>   circuis circuis is great for chldren and teens after reading lots of bad reviews about circuis circuis i was upset by the negativiaty   after our   trip to vegas and   time staying at the hotel i was still pleased with the resuls of our room   we had claen beds and amazing bathroom with a large mirror  the room had large space areas and tv desk and chairs   taking a   year old and    year old to vegas may not be to everyones taste of a family holiday but the kids love all that the hotel offers   with very cheap resturants   would reccomend this to anyone with children and also to the older genration that dont mind children running as we took our mother and farther to vegas to  
P =>  Pay a bit more      if you can This hotel is really a circus    in the positive and negative way For me it was ok  the room was excellent for its price However if you are looking for something nice  a good swimming pool and great ambiance    don t go there and pay a bit more for the other strip hotels The food is not bad  but certainly not great    the swimming pool is dirty small    well a joke compared to the other hotels  
P =>  Great for our purposes I have stayed at Circus Circus many times over the past few years  I travel down with two buddies and we play poker there  It is a cheap place to stay and play for   guys  Since we play poker there we get the  quot poker room rate quot  which is EXTREMELY cheap  I shared with one buddy and the total cost for   nights including taxes was        so      for each of us  We stayed in the Main Tower as we want quick and easy access to the casino  I have never stayed in the Manor and can not comment on this section  Our rooms were dated for sure  but clean  functional and comfortable  Since we had the  quot poker room rate quot  we were able to check in in the VIP line which was quick and effcient Location of Circus Circus can be an issue for some people as it is further down the Strip  but I find the walk down the Strip not to be a problem   although this time it was very HOT  but we also drive down to Vegas so we have a car to get us around Service was great   friendly and fast everywhere we went  One complaint is that the Casino Cafe is not open    hours anymore and getting something to eat at  am was a little tough  but the Westside Deli was open and a Chil dog hit the spot for sure  The other place we ate ate   the Garden Grill   where we had all you can eat Prime Rib for       as we had comp coupons from the poker room was incredible   best Prime Rib I have had in    years  Also Slots of Fun next door was great for a break from poker   cheap table games and cheap draft beer   toms for fun and energy there  As well the McDonalds next to Slots of Fun is the nicest one I have ever been in and the most efficient   they have it down to a science there getting you r order and food out fast We did not go to the pool so I can not comment on this As for the poker room   we love it   fast cocktail service freindly staff and I always win there   up about      playing      limit over the time I was there  They also have a freeroll tournament in the poker room on Sundays if you play    hours during the week   I played this and won      Circus Circus is what it is   a very cheap place to stay that is works in certain circumstances   a week with buddies in Vegas  Or staying with children as there is lots to keep them busy  I would not stay here if it was just my wife and I  we usually stay down town at the Golden Nugget   I would go a little more up scale for sure  I will be back with my buddies in the spring  
P =>  Rooms dark and smelly  Cool indoor theme park The hotel was a bit far down the strip which was a bit of a pain  The rooms smelt a bit funny and were very dark but it is a budget hotel so can t really complain  Everything was working and the breakfast buffet was nice  
P =>  Average Hotel I stayed at Circus Circus Las Vegas some years ago  I thought at the time it was a fab hotel  clean  spacious rooms  good amenities etc  I would recommend this to anyone of a budget  The hotel itself is in a good location on the strip close to lots of different shops  bars and restaurants  I am returning to Vegas this month  t   st  and staying at the Luxor  i ve read a lot of mixed reviews on this hotel and i m getting worried   I ll report back shortly       
P => Nice Hotel on Vegas Strip We Stayed on the   th Floor of the Circus Circus for   nights in      The rooms and bathrooms at this hotel were a lot better than we expected for the price we payed  The facilities at this hotel were great for kids with the indoor theme park  We got a discount book when we checked in so used that for a few things in the lobby and entry into the theme park  Great rides  we had a ball  the adults and the kids   Cheap eating is available at McDonalds in the lobby along with other various eateries  The free circus show was good to watch although short and basic  As with most places in Vegas alot of money can be spent on extras  kids arcades etc  Slots of fun is just out the front of the hotel with    cent specials margarettas and hotdogs   The pool was lovely  big enough for the amount of people using it  service was available at an eatery down there  Location of the hotel at the southern end of the strip was not a problem we walked back some nights other nights took the strip bus    or    for a    hour ticket  They run every        minutes and stop every few hundred metres up and down the strip  I would certainly stay here again or recommend for others to  
P =>  If you don t have kids don t waste your money  This was by far one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in  This was my fourth trip to Vegas and while the hotel was inexpensive  you get what you pay for  Paper thin walls allowed for the sounds of everyone else s bathroom habits to be heard loud and clear as well as the maids in the morning making the  Do Not Disturb  sign irrelevant  The staff was unhelpful and rude  when you make out what they were saying through very thick accents   Waited over    hours for two pillows and an ashtray  Vents in room were almost clogged full of dust and lint and used towels were left on the window sill when we checked in  Tons of kids everywhere which is to be expected from that kind of hotel but accomodations for children weren t that great  Restaurants were over priced and not good quality  especially the buffet and the casino cafe  and servers were rude  I was charged    per day for the phone regardless of the fact that I didn t make any calls outside of the hotel  When I questioned the staff about why that wasn t made clear at check in the answer was  quot It was on the receipt that you signed when you checked in whether they tell you about it or not so it s your fault for not reading your receipt  quot  There is also a lot of harrassment that happens just walking through the hotel by all the vendor kiosks that are trying to sell you something  I can t say enough bad things about this hotel  I WILL NEVER STAY AT OR SPEND MONEY AT THIS HOTEL AGAIN          
P =>   way better than what we were expecting  My family and I decided to head to Vegas for one last trip before school  we booked a cheap flight and hotel package and after that was done is when I started to read some horrible reviews  I was honestly expecting the worst when we arrived  but it was a pleasant surprise that it was the exact opposite  We checked in and the lady was extremely pleasant and helpful and we were happy when we received two for one coupons for the Adventure dome  Our room was in the West Tower and we held our breath as we opened the door  To our surprise it was a newely renovated room  with a large bathroom and a spacious bedroom area  We ate at the one of the restaurants the first night that offered a         prime rib dinner  all you can eat  and my husband loved it  the other meals we ordered there were huge and we probably could of shared it amoungst us  We had such a great time and would love to go back again  
P =>   Excellent Value  We were a bit unsure about staying at this hotel after reading some of the reviews  but we are glad we did  It was excellent value for money  We stayed in the West Tower  which I believe is the nicest part of the hotel  for   nights  The room was spotlessly clean  and that s coming from someone who usually has to get out the anti bacterial cleaner before touching anyhting  and it was large enough to accommodate   adults and   teenage boys  The all you can eat buffet was one of the cheapest on the strip and had an excellent choice  Would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to everyone for a great value break  
P =>   Enjoyed IT I glad I stayed   even after reading reviews    Great location on the strip  NIce comfortable room at a very reasonable rate    
P =>   fun always go to vegas once a year for the last   years  always stay at circus  the hotel is what you make out of it  it s fun for the kids  also it s a good deal  made reservations in may  and requested   rooms side by side  they gave us inter connecting rooms  at first the lady at the check in counter was a little rude  but when i talked to another lady who worked for vip services  she took care of us  even though the hotel is a little older  people fail to realize that the reason that they go to vegas is to see the sights and to enjoy them selves  not to become hotel critics  overall you can t get a better deal at about     a night and two free nights for players  going back in may with my wife   can t wait  
P =>   Love Circus Circus    This was our third stay at Circus Circus in the last   years  The first time we stayed at the Manors and learned our lesson not to stay there again  The second time we booked in the Tower and it was nice  However  this last time we were there for four nights beginning ust  rd  We were very happy with our renovated room in the West Tower  It was wonderful   We went down to the other end of the Strip with the swanky casinos and lost a lot of money and then came back to Circus Circus to win it all back and then some  Love being on that end of the strip with Slots A Fun  Sahara  Riviera and all of those  We have stayed at the other end and in the middle of the Strip and we will not go back  
P =>   good value Arrived here with a party of   were given rooms in the older part of hotel requested a move to the West Tower  as there was a big conference on rooms were not available till the next day rooms were  clean and very comfortable   All THE STAFF were friendly and helpfull I was worried after reading some of the reviews if you want deep piled carpets and gold plated slots spend your money elsewhere steakhouse great other eateries standard  after all they supply snacks mainly  never tried the buffet always busy so it speaks for itself children in the hotel were never a problem only downside is location but there were plenty buses taxis 
P =>   Good for low budgets and modest expectations I stayed at the Circus Circus on several occasions and while the rooms were big  clean and fairly modern  all public areas were kind of stale and clearly needed refurbishment  It is clear that this hotel caters to low budgets which is fine I guess  The breakfast buffet is good  the choice of restaurants for dinner not so much  I haven t had a good meal there  
P =>   Refurbishment needed poor location Situated at the north end of the Strip  Stratosphere Tower end   well away from the main action on the Strip  taxis  or a long  hot walk  was required to get to the central Strip area In desperate need of a refurbishment  the decor was very tired looking and with a claustrophobic feeling  Looked like the hotel had the original decor from the     s  Geared towards families on a budget  it is cheap and served a purpose to keep the costs down for a stag weekend from the UK but there are much better places to stay  Would definately return to Vegas and would definately not stay there again  
P =>   Won t mind staying again  Circus Circus was perfectly fine for my wife  my    month old  and myself  We booked our reservations through Orbitz com  amp  got a decent deal for a Saturday night  The hotel does charge a    night charge for use of the phone for local calls  which is nothing compared to the        night resort fess that you find at some of the other places  plus higher rates  The rooms in the West Tower were real nice  The room was clean  the bed was very comfortable  amp  the room stayed very cool  We had a room on the   nd floor with a view of Las Vegas Blvd  Unfortunately with the location of CIrcus Circus  there was only a view of the Riviera  amp  some construction  but I have never been to Las Vegas one time where there wasn t construction going on   The hotel is located at the far end of the Strip  and does require a little bit of walking to get to the main area  A little tip though  get a pass for The Deuce  Its only    person for a    hour pass  but you can ride in a double decker bus as much as you want all up and down the Strip  It even picks up right in front of Slots A Fun which is right next to Circus Circus The elevators were extreamly packed  amp  trying to get a stroller on one of them was hard  A maintenance employee let ride the employee service elevator b c we were waiting for an elevator for       min due to every elevator that stopped was full The only complaint I had was that being a weekend and during summer  a peak season  there were very few cheap  sit down dining options around     pm  An error on my part by assumption  or for living in the laughlin area where at least the cafe is open    hours in each casino   but I assumed that there was at least one    hour restaurant  Of course  this is a review of the hotel portion  not the food  amp  beverage  so I can t fault the Hotel for that My    month old loved the Advenuredome  even though she was   quot  too small to ride the small rides  She got to play games  amp  watch the rides in action  which was exciting enough for her  As well  the Midway  amp  free circus acts really got her attention too  The games range from      and you win the usual stuffed animal prize Overall  we will stay there again  It was a great place to stay  especially if you have kids  
P =>   Avoid this hotel  One of the worst hotels I have stayed at in many years  Am surprised MGM is not embarassed to have this in their portfolio  The hotel looks like it hasn t been touched since being built in       The pool is an absolute joke   literally in the parking lot with no privacy fence or plantings and getting to it practically involved cutting through the boiler room  Spend an extra        a night and go stay at one of the nice hotels closer to the action  
P =>   Circus Circus is run just like it s name  Circus Circus Hotel needs some new slogans that better fit their hotels  For example     quot Circus Circus  the worst hotel on the strip  quot    quot Circus Circus the ONLY place Ants share room and board with guests  quot   Circus Circus the only hotel that offers a   mile walk between hotel rooms and the main lobby quot Staff was rude  Hotel was crowded  Not kid friendly  Over priced BASICALLY  the worst choice hotel possible  Trump tower is offering prices of     a night  which is less than what I paid  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY      
P =>   ok ish No matter what anyone says it is too far down the strip to be worth it in the summer  The walk in    F  was too much  thank god for McDonalds  and it s not often I say that   half way down   air con was very much appreciated  Pay more and stay central  you ll be glad you did  We were in the motel style manor rooms  which were clean and cool  so given how litte we paid were fine One thing to be aware of are the shuttle buses from the airport   I think were called  Showtime    don t buy a return as when you phone to arrange it you can t get through   someone else on here mentioned this and they were dead right  We tried every    minutes for hours and only succeeded when we got the receptionist to persisitently try  Get a single and a make other arrangements  The airport s dead near anyway  
P =>   Not too bad for the price Got a very good deal for Circus Circus  we paid     for a family of   for   nights The hotel is rather tired looking and sits right at one end of  The Strip   so it s rather a long walk to the other attractions of Las Vegas  If you are on a budget it s ideal but if I was to visit Las Vegas again I would pay extra for a better hotel and better location  
P =>   Cheap for a very good reason This is a very busy and impersonal hotel  the staff were not particularly helpful and verged on the rude at times  The rooms were ok but not brilliant  The worst thing was the location  although it does not look far on the map  it is along way from the other hotels on the Strip  This was a major factor with the temperatures of    degrees   in ust  Basically you get what you pay for but I wished we had paid a bit more and stayed in a more central location  
P =>  As kid friendly as Vegas gets If you have to spend one night in Vegas with kids  this is the place  The circus acts were fun  the indoor amusement park and pool were ok  We stayed in a remodeled room which was very nice and worth the extra money  We checked in on the phone an hour before arrival  HIGHLY recommend that  They try to keep the girlie pictures and advertisements away so it s a little more kid friendly  Once on the streets though  be prepared if you ve got kids  
P =>  ent hotel fun atmosphere  Clean  While viewing TA hotel reviews for an upcoming vacation  I realized that I never wrote about my visit to Circus Circus two years ago  Considering the amount of wear and tear a hotel can receive  I understand if readers think a two year old review is inconsequential  but I want to alleviate any budget conscious traveler  After staying five days with my husband I found the hotel to be more than adequate Hotel Room  Bed was comfortable and the linens smelled freshly laundered No smoke smell and no evidence of previous occupants Bathroom Tub  toilet  sink  and bathroom floor were very clean with no visible mold  Showers had good water pressure StaffThis is a large hotel and employees are very busy  yet were friendly and helpful  Within five minutes after calling Housekeeping  an iron was delivered to our room Food EntertainmentThe complimentary circus acts were entertaining and the Adventure Dome  filled with amusement park type rides and activities  was a pleasant diversion  There are several eateries in the hotel  including McDonalds  The Buffet was reasonably priced  crammed with edibles a notch above Old Country Buffet quality  LocationThe hotel is located near the end of the strip  I felt safe and comfortable at all times Public transportation in Vegas runs    hours so don t bother renting a car I cannot comment on the Manor because we stayed in the main hotel    Remember  if you do have a problem  contact management and CALMLY and succinctly communicate the issue and an acceptable solution  Like my Gramma used to say  you catch more flies with honey then with vinegar I would definitely stay there again  
P =>  good hotel good hotel  I was scared because of the bad reviews but this hotel is actually nice  good staffing as well  The hotel is really big and the cicus was fun and entertaining  The only complaint I had was that one of the cocktail waitresses was rude  other thanthat the other staff was great  Its near the strip so the bus can take you there in a few minutes  
P =>  Less expensive hotel   not the Ritz but has everything a family needs as a base to explore Las Vegas  Don t try to compare the Circus Circus to one of the newer ultra deluxe mega hotels on the strip  If that is what you want go stay there   but expect to pay considerably more  The Circus Circus is an older hotel but it is very popular with families  It is crowded but most hotels in Vegas are   but since the lobby areas do not have a great big high ceiling it probably feels more crowded than other hotels The Hotel worked fine for myself  my wife our   year old and our    year old  The Adventuredome indoor amusement park was a must for both our kids  Lots of great rides  The Circus Acts and midway were fun   but there is not enough seating for when the shows start  But for the price  free  I don t think you have a right to complain The hotel is a bit dated in some areas  but our rooms were very large  clean and newly renovated  We had a marble tub shower  LCD TV  fresh linens and non smoking rooms adjoining rooms  Rooms were not ultra luxurious but we had no complaints The place is very popular with families so expect lots of kids  If you are looking for the ultra posh resort or the hip hangout   this is not for you  The name alone should tell you that this is not the place The hotel is lower priced  It is on the North end of the strip but we had a rental car so that was not a big deal for us  There is a bus and other transportation options I would recommend this place to other families who are not looking to spend a whole whack of cash for a room but want something decent that the kids will enjoy You do get what you pay for so people should not be surprised that this hotel built in the    s     does not compare to one of the newer super hotels The biggest complaint I have about the hotel is the pools  They are surprising difficult to get to and are relatively small without any amenities like you would expect for a hotel that caters to families  Just basic pools   kind of small and no waterslide or anything  The hotel does not some updating here and there   and re doing the pools should be a priority  
P =>  Plenty of Convention Room Comdex was Gr  Make Time for Leisure there is plenty to do After the BusinessConvention time prices triple and if you don t book early You probablyhave to scout for Rooms  Superb Dinning  you name it it is there  Have Fun 
P =>   what a dump circus circus sucks  that s all there is to it  it s the unofficial hotel of choice for parents dragging their juvenile delinquents along for vacation  it s dirty  noisy  and almost at the end of the strip  the restaurants there are way too pricey  as are drinks  and they really aren t even that good  the casino is okay  but defiantly outdated  the rooms are small  smell of stale smoke  even though ours was a non smoking room   and have nothing modern in them  i almost thought i should have brought rabbit ears to hook up just to get a picture if you are gonna spend minimal time in the hotel  and don t mind walking much further to get there  or pay more in cab fare  then hit it up  it s cheaper than a nice hotel  but if you want a good hotel experience  this is defiantly not the place to go  the only redeeming quality about this place is that there s a really fun  really seedy  quot casino quot  next door to it called slots a fun  it s a place to rub elbows with other tourists who don t wanna be high rollers at the real casinos  but it is really fun place to be drunk at while losing your rent money for the next month  
P =>   O K    lives up to its name Good   location  good standard rooms  in main part of hotel  that are very clean  amp  some with great views  value for money Bad   chaotic customer service  noisy  brash  amp  restaurants expensive   some with poor food  amp  long queues After a long flight   the hotel check in was appallingly long  an hour    not a great start  The lobby and public areas of the hotel are ridiculously chaotic   in fact everywhere outside of your room is literally a circus  sorry for the pun   The decor has seen better days and the hotel is very catered for families with young children  The main let down of the hotel   it s chaotically run  amp  customer service is variable   some staff are pretty helpful  others really couldn t care less The restaurants are very hit and miss   the Garden grill and Westside cafe have long queues in the morning and the food is unappealing  amp  expensive   think bagels  bagels and another bagel  Head for the the casino cafe which is better  but expect queues  There is a chemist  like a mini supermarket in the US    mins away however which sells a variety of food  The rooms  in the main part of the hotel  not the manor lodge  are good   of a    seen better days Hilton standard so make sure you get one in the main hotel  They are very clean and serviced daily  The view from our room of the North end of the strip was also simply fantastic esp at night  The location is also ok         mins to the central part of the strip  So in sum   value for money  it lives up to its name in terms of service  could do a lot better   so O K  
P =>   You get what you pay for I chose this location because of its low prices  The hotel does offer fairly entertainment  such as circus shows every     hour  but if you have the money  I would suggest another hotel  My boyfriend and I stayed in the manor  which was a little far from the central hotel  The room was clean but old  dark  and slightly discolored  It s location is not central on the Strip and you have to walk a fair distance to look at the other hotels  Overall  it s good if you re on a tight budget  
P =>  Disgusting The room that my family and I stayed in was outdated  The carpet had numerous stains  cookie crumbs underneath the armoirem visible dust on the night stand  stains on the linen  and hair in the tub  To top it off the associates didn t know where the room was located nor any of the restaurants  I work in the hospitality industry and quite frankly  I m surprised this hotel is still around  
P =>   Gross gross gross  This is the worst hotel you could imagine  It smelt like I cant even say what     Pubic hairs in the bath tub  yellow spot in my bed  and a couple cockroaches in the bathroom  The buffet food was horrible  And  dont use their valet service     
P =>   Average standard  Don t forget one dollar hot dog nearby  Quite delicious  Small theme park in this hotel  advanturedome  is fun for children  
P =>   good for a cheap stay My buddy and I booked Circus Circus for four nights for our trip to Vegas  Since we are both taken it was a fine place to stay since there was no need to try to bring any ladies back to the room  Stayed in the Skyrise Tower  normal double beds and    quot  tube tv with desk  Was a pretty basic room  slightly dated  only real complaint were the pillows that come with the bed  Instead of eating at the hotel we instead ate lunch every day at the McDonalds right next door  probably the nicest McDonalds I have ever been to  plus it was cheap  Gambling was nice and cheap with    mininums for Blackjack and Craps  Looks like the casino has hit on some hard times  one gambling table section was closed the entire time we were there  The other was only half open most of the time and Craps opens at Noon  Played most of the time at Slots O Fun which is the little building right next to and owned by Circus Circus  Never had a problem finding an open chair at a table or space at the Craps table until our last night  which was a Friday night  Slots O Fun seemed to get a little more business than the tables actually in the main Casino  though it does have easy street access which probably contributes to that The Deuce has a stop right in front of Slots O Fun     for   way     all day        days  Also has a stop on the opposite side of the street at the Riveria  Can get crowded  but since its one of the earlier stops there usually wasn t a problem Was a great place for a cheap room and cheap gambling as long as you don t mind all the kids running around while you make your way back to your room  Didn t have any problem with neighbor noise though  so that was nice  
P =>   Don t judge a book by its cover  I recently traveled to Las Vegas with my boyfriend for his college graduation gift  I had never been to Vegas and was really concerned about staying at Circus Cirucs after reading all of the reviews  however  when we arrived late Tues  night we were greeted by FRIENDLY employees who were glad to accomodate us  We were upgraded from a manor room to the skyrise tower without any request or extra charge  We arrived in our room on the   nd floor and were greeted with a beautiful view of the strip  We had a large king size bed  large chair  desk table  television  and two end tables  The room was very large and the bathroom large  as well  ble sink countertops and marble shower walls provided us with very clean amenities  The sheets were clean  along with everything else in the room  Others who have written bad reviews obviously havent seen what we did  This hotel is great if your on a budget  or with children  Yes  it was crowned with families  but aren t they entiled to family vacations  too  The only complaint I had with circus circus is its location at the end of the strip and that I didn t get to stay longer  However  it is near the stratosphere and if you have a chance  with all the extra money you will have staying at circus circus  you should visit the restaurant Top of the World there  it was EXCELLENT  Not to mention the    blackjack offered   circus circus  So if your on you way to stay here  don t worry  EVERYTHING WILL BE GREAT  after all your in VEGAS      
P =>   It s Day Has Come and Gone I read an article once about Mae West that said  as she was aging  her apartment aged with her  Her once clean and sumptuous decor of white satin and silk had deteriorated and like her apartment  Mae too clung to her ing nue attire even though her dresses didn t fit quite right and were turning dingy  That s the Circus Circus or  as I like to call it CC  A hotel that s day has come and gone and it doesn t seem that the owners  MGM Mirage   mind too much or maybe like Mae they re too old to notice  CC is for the bargain hunters  frat boys  or other individuals that don t really care where they stay as long they re under a roof  At the last minute  my company decided to send me to a convention  My other compatriots were booked at the Hilton next to the convention center but by the time my plans were made the Hilton was full  The company s travel agent chose the CC for me because it was one  the closest hotel to the convention center that had a room and two  it was inexpensive  After all  my colleagues were paying a special convention rate of     night and CC was going to be     night for me so it all seemed reasonable When I arrived  I waited in line  as one often does in Vegas  for    minutes to check in  The reception personnel were friendly  but advised me  quot there is a    per night room charge for the telephone quot   a little tidbit conveniently not mentioned on any confirmation forms Upon receiving my room key  I was told I had a Manor room  Sound lovely  It s not  To get there I had to go out the back door  across the street and walk a vast parking lot to the building with my room  which also happened to be next to the Strip s only RV Park  Obviously  not a good sign  What can I say  the room was dirty and I had to wheel my luggage the quarter mile from reception myself   The room is big actually for an old hotel  I d estimate     sq  ft   plus or minus  but unfortunately they haven t updated it since the late      s or early      s and when a room and furnishings are that old you just can t get it clean  Not happy  I returned to the hotel to try to get another room  and for a mere upgrade of     per night  I did get a room in one of the towers  Once again  I have to say  the reception and bell staff were very friendly and quick to come and retrieve me  My advice   don t stay in a Manor room They did send a very nice bellhop who picked me up in a golf cart so I didn t have to walk anymore  He carried all my luggage and escorted me to the new room all the while assuring me that I would like the tower room MUCH better than the Manor room  He was right  it was better  It had been updated in the early      s  it didn t smell and the bedding and bathroom appeared to be clean  Unfortunately  these old hotels aren t built as well as the new ones  My adjoining door wasn t doubled nor insulated and I could hear the children next door wake up and scream every morning at   a m  They played and danced on the marble tile as their laughter vibrated under the door and into my entry  the sound of their parent s voices echoing a song of discipline each morning as the left to parts unknown around   a m   just    minutes before my alarm clock was set to go off The food at CC didn t fair much better  The supposedly great steakhouse is anything but that and most of the other options are just oversized portions prepared from large foodservice distributor offerings It s kind of sad   this hotel is from the classic Vegas era of time  it has been featured in several movies and a lot of money could make it a beautiful again  The owners could keep the circus theme and the family aspects of the place  like the Adventure Dome  and create an adults only carnaval area within the hotel  which could appeal to a wider demographic of potential guests   it could be something unique All the people I came in contact with who work at Circus Circus were nice  so that s a plus  but that s the only thing going for this hotel  
P =>  Rooms clean and large  Buffet meals are good value Rooms clean and large  Buffet meals are good value 
P =>  Circus Circus sucks     I took my family to Vegas for the very first time for all of us and it sucked  When we arrived we were greeted by a very rude and a non helpful staff  We finally get to our room and walk in and the beds weren t even made  The dirty linen was sitting in a plastic bag next to our door  We call down stairs and told them they said  quot we ll send someone right up quot   An hour later no one showed up  My husband calls down and asks when someone was going to come up and they were rude to him and said soon and hung up on him  Finally    min later a very nice maid  probably the only nice person that worked there  showed up and apologized  The floors are dirty throughout the hotel  There is no air conditioning inside the elevators or outside of them  Luckily my family and I visited other casinos in the area and they were so much nicer  The staff was so much nicer  They are the ones that made our first trip to Las Vegas a memorable one   not Circus Circus  
P =>  Dont stay here This would be a great hotel if you have children  If you are an adult  there is not much to do and it is very far from all the sites  The room had an odd smell to it that never went away  There was always a line to get in to an elevator and for check in  It seemed to be super crowded with families   kids running all over so you are almost tripping over them  The hotel itself seemed very dated and old  The food was not very good and neither was the service   they forgot our drinks and apps on two occasions  Not many of the help spoke english  The pool was gross  not clean at all and really crowded  There were only like  channels on the tv  Had to pay    dollars a day for internet and a   a day charge for the phone  The cleaning lady left all our dirty towels on the floor  The best part about it was how comfy the bed was  The gym was tiny and dated and smelled bad Overall we did not enjoy it and would t stay there again  
P =>   It was not a very bad trip Me and my husband spent our  yr anniversity in Las Vages and we stayed at the Circus Circus Hotel it was not as bad as some of the reviews that I had read on line  We stayed three days from e       we had fun at the circus shows and walking up and down the strip at night  Las Vages is such a beautiful place at night when all the city lights are on  There was so much too see and do but not enough time  The food where we ate was really good but the  SLOT MACHINES WASN quot T LETTING GO ANY MONEY   Overall we had fun and hope to go back again someday but will stay at a different location due to that fact that Circus Circus is far away from all the main sights and places that you could walk too and not have to catch the bus  We will never forget Las Vages  SIN CITY   quot What happen is Vages stayes in Vages   Mr LaRon  amp  Erma Smith Dothan AL 
P =>   fantastic stay stayed at circus circus from the   th e for a week  We were a bit nervous because we saw some bad reviews before we went When we arrived check in was straight forward and efficiant  The hotel was lively and friendly Our room was on the   th floor in one of the towers The room was clean and had everything in there that you could need  We ordered room service for breakfast on the first day which was really lovely The casino is great and the neighbouring slots of fun we had drinks at the bar nearly every night my favorite was the pina colada The bar staff could have been a bit more friendly but service was fast The circus acts were great and even tho the hotel had lots of children staying they were always kept occupied by the circus and the indoor amusments We loved the hotel and even tho its a long walk from the centre of the strip  we caught the deuce bus every day for       hour pass the buses are great and run all day and night and you never wait more than   mins for   Visit Freemont Street if you can its a great atmaosphere Had a fantastic time gambled loads  ate loads and drunk loads would go again tomorrow  
P =>   An incredible bargain  This was my second stay at Circus  Circus in the past   years  I found it to be an incredible bargain  Both times  our room was huge  with a king bed  sofa and chair  dressing room  etc  The entire room was spotless  with plenty of towels  etc  Moreover the service was outstanding  at the checkin  the bellhops  valet parking  etc  Checkout took about    seconds done via the TV in our room  When we called for a bellhop  even though it was the busiest check out time   just before   AM  he was there in less than   minutes  I ve never had better service anywhere  We actually found a special online for about     per night  So I d say that sometimes you get MORE than you pay for  I certainly feel that we did  The only downside is that there is an     per day charge for internet  
P =>   Nice place to be The hotel may be rated   star  but is great value for money  if the friendly staff upgrades you to a better room  The rooms are good   really spacious  modern and with all standard amenities  The bathroom maintains the standards that the room d cor sets  Internet access and parking are added attractions  The casino is good enough and the travel  show  box office desks are good place to have all the info that you d need about Vegas  hotels  casinos  shows  et al  Since it s a really value for money property  you may encounter long queues at check in and check out  But don t panic  the staff is very efficient  amp  the check in a breeze  Only negative  if one may call it  is that it is towards the end of the strip  But if you are a tourist willing to explore  it shouldn t bother you at all  And btw  don t miss the lights at night   Vegas is at its best  when it gets dark  
P =>  A dazzling spectacle My daughter and I stayed for   days at the Circus Circus  the boulevard  Las Vegas in  this year  and i can safely say it was the best hotel i have ever stayed in  Even my daughter agrees  who loves staying in luxury and comfort We landed in Las vegas at night  and when we reached near the hotel we were dazzled by what we saw  There was a huge front porch  with hundreds of lights  and a giant billboard with a clown there to greet us  From there we walked into the casino  which was like any other  but what was truly amazing was  Midway  an area in the middle of the casino earmarked for entertainment  There was a circus performance for free every hour from   am to   pm  and an incredible number of games kids could play  all costing about a dollar or even less  My daughter won a soft toy and was on top the world  She also won      of free play at the slot machines  One day  while strolling thru the hotel  we were given free meal coupons for a meal at a restaurant called the Buffet  where the choice of foods was mind boggling  and so much variety  all so tasty  we could hardly eat all that we wanted  i shall never forget the huge table full of every kind of dessert and pudding imaginable About the rooms  They were truly spacious  We got a room with   kingsize double beds for the two of us  and best was a small club sort of thing nearby  where there was a pool  a library  internet facilities  and every convenience imaginable  from a shop to a microwave that we could use  All in all  it was an amazing experience  and the hotel was so comfortable and exciting and lively  there were days when we would spend the whole day just strolling around the shops or in the restaurants of the hotel  If I can afford it I will surely go there again  this time with my entire family  
P => LOVED my stay at Circus Circus  I just got married out in Las Vegas  so we had a group of about    people staying out there  I personally stayed in one of the bigger rooms   They said the hotel only has    It was a suite style room with a kitchen  living room  king size bed  stand up shower  and whirlpool bath  big enough for     It also had double sinks in the bathroom and a huge mirror  My room was on the top floor     and had a great view  I only paid     more a night then all the other rooms  My family did compare their rooms and decided that the rooms above the   nd floor were better then the rooms below  Our bed was nice and comfy  It was not loud at all  We had   kids with us and everybody enjoyed their time there  The buffet wasn t the best food you ll ever have  but it was decent  The staff there was great  We had a little impromptu reception there and they designated a certain spot for us  All the staff told me congrats since I was in my wedding dress  They were really good to my family also The hotel is a little more towards the end of the strip  but it worked out just fine  
P =>  Clean affordable friendly staff My boyfriend and I just got back from a stay at Circus Circus  and I have to admit i was a little scared reading some of the reviews  Compared to some of the other hotels on the strip  this one wasnt as nice  but that being said  it was very affordable  very clean room  plenty of restaurants to choose from  friendly staff  and a great place for kids  We expected the hotel to be more out of the way then it actually was  It took us only   minutes to walk to the Fashion show mall and the rest of the hotels  Upon checking in  I was concerned about the room being the unrenovated one  which looked kinda scary on the internet   We did get one of those rooms but it was incrediby clean and quite spacious  It would have been a    dollar charge to upgrade to a new room for   days  Not bad at all  But we werent planning on being in the room  so we just forgot about it  The only complaint we had about the hotel was the renovating being done on the floor under us at      in the morning  Loud banging and hammering  very annoying when you havent slept  We ate at the italan restaraunt  and the buffet in the hotel and both were tasty  The buffet had a lot of good salads  The potato salad was really good  It also has a Mcdonalds inside the midway and next door to the hotel which was very conveinent at those late night munchy times  The bus also stops right outside the hotel and has the ticket booth right outside as well  also very convienent  Valet parking was great  quick and very friendly  They helped us out when our rental car comany was running extreamly late which was very good  All in all I was super depressed when we had to leave   Greatest trip ever  the hotel is clean  close  and has everything you could need  What more could you ask for   
P =>  Don t Believe all the bad reports  This is a family friendly Hotel which for the money was good value  being one of the oldest hotels on the Strip is in need of some serious updating  generally the rooms we had were clean and I found everything in working order  To me this is a hotel that you would not stay in for any length of time and really is just a base for sleeping in  the buffet servce was very good on the occasions I used it  if you like wine with your dinner forget it it is virtually impossible to get  you have to wait for a waitress from the casino and by that time you have finished your meal  I advise you stay well clear of the Mexicanitalian Resturant service here is not an option  the staff are like something out of faulty towers a simple meal when ordered took   minutes to arrive at the table  if you ordered a drink they thought you were some sort of alien being The Front Desk was fine and there was no long waiting  staff were helpful and paid attention to your requests  the permanant circus was a bit of a joke I would not waste time on that  the ADventuredome was o k  but very overated compared to other attractions and definetly in line for a refit  The location is ok and I used the DEUCE bus servce to go up and down the strip and found it very good but it can get packed later on in the day All the attractions on the Strip were of course very good   I did a ground and air trip to the Grand Canyon which was fantastic  but the SKYWALK I found was very overrated once again and not at all what I exspected far to small  the Indian tribe should have got Disney or MGM to build it  by the way on arrival at the Grand Canyon I was greeted by one of the Indians and I mean one who said  quot tickets and what you want quot  pity General Custer was not around  but the Grand Canyon is what it says  
P =>  Go for a Tower Room Well first of all I prepaid a   night stay in the Manor Rooms  All in taxes included through Lowcostvegas com it came to       However on arrival at the Manor Room I thought it s not as bad as the reviews and I was just getting what I paid for  However the bed looked a bit dodgy and the building was tired  And a funny musty smell all over  The safe was there but it had no door on it  I decided I couldn t stay in that room  I went back to reception and paid     dollars for an upgrade to the main tower  How great a decision it was  The room was the exact same standard as the widescreen rooms at the Excalibur  Very modern and fresh the room was  The bed was very comfortable  The whole room was spotless  Loved the big flatscreen tv  Towels and soap etc and bed sheets done daily  I was really impressed  I also felt safe in my room  I don t think I d feel the same if I was in the Manor Rooms  As for the casino  I m not a gambler  but it had a nice buzz about it  The buffet however in my opinion is terrible for the price  Eat elsewhere  The Garden Grill restaurant is nice for steaks  I ordered a bottle of Fosters to drink with my dinner  The waitress then came out with a second bottle of Fosters in a bucket of ice with the cap still on it  All smiles she told me it s a complimentary bottle  Great I thought  She then said if I open it I gotta pay for it  which was strange  But overall if you get a tower room you cannot go too far wrong at Circus Circus  You might have to walk a bit to get up the strip  But seriously folks  all the hotels are basically the same  Loads of rooms and big gaming areas  Ok one might have nicer carpets than the other  But basically thats the only difference    Slots of Fun next door to Circus Circus is a great little place to hang out   Great staff  dirt cheap drink and you won t run into snobs    Id rather get a beer there for less than    than get charged off for     at Centrifuge at MGM for   vodkas and a Redbull   I knew then why the bar was empty up there   There was a buzz at Slots Of Fun   I know where I will stay next time in Vegas  and thats Circus Circus  Other than the Foster bottle incident you will have a feeling that your not being getting ripped off compared to prices being charged by other hotels up strip charge  Definitely stay here folks  but avoid the Manor Rooms and you ll be grand  P s don t make an international call from the room telephone  I made a call for about   min back to the UK  I was put on to an operator who took my credit card details  I checked my card s online statement  The call cost          Go up the street a bit across from Mc Donalds and get an international phonecard from seven    shop  A    card will give u over an hour to a UK landline  
P =>  Very family oriented   rarely got free drinks in casino If you re travelling with children  it s a very family friendly place  Rooms were clean and spacious  We stayed in the NON smoking Skyrise tower with the parkade right off the elevator level   very convenient  The outdoor pool access was right down the hall  If your planning on saving a buck and staying in the Manor rooms  was advised several times to spend the little bit extra and stay in the Skyrise tower  Adventure dome looked like fun but didn t have a chance to ride any rides or play any games  Midway was interesting and has a very large traditional arcade  Restaurant was very good with above average service   it was all you can eat Prime Rib    yum yum  Fashion Show mall is a block away and your at the downtown end of the strip so taking in the Freemont experience is easy  
P =>  ent Stay Fabulous Price  The Circus Circus is a destination for those looking to save money  so don t stay here expecting the elegance of the Venetian or the opulance of the Belliago  What you will get is a clean  adequately appointed room  The Tower Rooms are your standard hotel rooms while the Manor Rooms are more akin to a motel setting  No room service in the Manor Rooms  but they contain a refrigerator AND parking right outside of the building   I had a family member who stayed in a Manor Room and his room was clean and comfortable  My Tower Room was the same  but with a fairly recently updated bathroom  As a six day stay cost me little more than      total  this was a great value and I didn t compromise on cleanliness or safety The buffet was highly priced for the offering  in my opinion  I would recommend going to te Sahara  join their slot club for a discount   or to the nearby Palace Station for a nice buffet at a great price  Slots are about average  but there was a continual    blackjack game  Even Slots A Fun next door didn t offer a    table when I was there  There are two kidney shaped pools along with a large and small hot tub  The pool areas are average and do fill up quickly  The free circus acts are fun to watch and lots of activities are available for children  The    daily phone charge does come with free  unlimited local calls  Internet is     a day  While I hate that the Wi Fi isn t free  I don t think any hotel on the strip has free Wi Fi Overall  Know what you want  You can stay here  on the strip  and take the  quot Duece quot  bus up and down the strip for    a trip or    a day  You ll have a decent room  hotel level amenities and all the requirements to have a good time without shelling out a lot of money for lodging  If this is in line with your desires and expectations then by all means stay here  If a luxurious stay with a spa is what you are seeking then this is not the place for you  I had a great time and would stay again  and would tell my closest friends and family to do the same  
P =>  Better than expected Before booking at the CC  know what you are getting into  The CC is an older casino on the far North end of the strip  It s about   miles from the center of the strip  The West Tower rooms are the newer more modern accommodations  Overall  For the price  this vacation was a steal  The hotel appeared to have a smell of chlorine throughout the elevators and halls  Probably due to the pool and water rides in the adventure dome  Room  We stayed in room      of the Skyrise tower  We arrived late Thur night and the West Tower was booked  Check in was quick and the staff was friendly enough  Our room had a king size bed  tiny tv  closet space  two night stands  three drawer armoire  table  two chairs and a small drink table  Plenty of room for two people  Bed  Firm but comfortable  Nothing special but it was serviceable for sleeping  Sheets were clean  no weird stains or anything  If I had to gripe about something it would be the pillows  They were about two steps up from airline pillows  We had three and requested two more from housekeeping  I found that sleeping on two of them worked out fine  Bathroom  Large granite counter with two sinks and a walk in shower with granite walls  It was very clean  If I had to pick the biggest pleasant surprise about staying at the CC it would be the bathroom  Shower water pressure was a bit weak for me but that s about it  Note  We only used our room to sleep  shower  and change in  Most of our time was spent at the craps tables or on the strip  If you like to enjoy your room more  then another hotel would probably suit you better Con about CC rooms  The CC is older so it is designed to make you walk through the entire casino before you get to your rooms  No big deal  but sometimes it gets to be annoying  There are only two exits on opposite ends of the casino to get out Casino  We only played craps  but the pit bosses and dealers were the friendliest in town  The casino is older but appears to be maintained  The casino is smokier then the newer hotels Location  The worst part about CC is the location  We like the exercise so we walked the first two days  After logging about       miles we decided to buy a deuce  bus  pass  The deuce runs every   min until   pm  I think  and then every    min  Cost is    one way     for    hrs and     for   days  It gets crowded at night  but in the day it is fast and comfortable  Kids  We do not have any  but the Adventure Dome seemed to be a great place for kids  There was a roller coaster  water ride  free falls  and many others  Plenty of activities to keep kids occupied  All day pass was         with two coupons in the CC book for    off  You will receive these books at check in  Anyone worried about kids bothering them  shouldn t worry  We were staying right next to the elevators on the  rd flr  which has the pool and we never heard any noise  Also  the casino floors are kid free Check out  Fast and no problems  Left our bags with the bell hop for   hours with no issues  Taxi  Cost about         from airport  Don t take the tunnel  From the airport  you should probably take paradise rd  
P =>  Not as bad as I thought it would be We were there for   nights last week  We were in the West Tower  which the rooms have been redone  Bed was comfortable and the room was nice  After reading many reviews  I was really worried about what it would be like  but it wasn t bad at all  Yes the hotel is much older than the rest  The smoke wasn t that bad  some of the other hotels  were worse  There are alot of kids around cause it is geared towards kids  so if you do not want to be around kids  then I would suggest you stay somewhere else  For the price  I would stay again  only slept there for about   or   hours a night  why spend more money for that  
P =>  Dirty and cheap  Stayed at this hotel for five night swith my husband who attended a conference  The room was small and had a dirty carpet and hairs in the bathroom  Pretty much a filthy place  It is a bit of a walk down the strip to get to the other hotels  casinos and shopping  If you are on a tight budget and don t mind a place that is not so clean  this might be the place for you  
P =>   Great hotel to stay with kids Great hotel for kids  Adventure done arcade and Circus acts were good for kids  Good food  Room was big Will stay again 
P =>   extremely disappointing go elsewhere Circus Circus is billed as a great Vegas deal  Is it  It depends  The price is okay but in these repressed times  people are finding phenomenal deals for just a little more further down the Strip  To give you one example of how it may not be the good deal you believed it to be  CC has the audacity to charge an extra dollar per day for the telephone that is in your room whether you use it or not  how tacky   Re  Location  not too bad  before the summer heat hits  if you have business at the convention center which is about a       minute walk away  For overall location  not the best on the Strip since most action is on the other end  Rooms  plain d cor  colors dark and drab  room lighting absolutely terrible  they seem to be trying to save money by using very low wattage bulbs   the beds were the absolute worst I ever have slept in here and abroad they should have been thrown out years ago  service can be poor and management appears to have questionable control over maid service and engineering departments to name two departments  When I first complained  a manager told me they didn t comp on poor service when it involved amenities Are you kidding me  If management doesn t stand behind the hotel and its services  who does  They did comp me in the end  but I had to insist  complain repeatedly  and then only for that night s room rate  twice   Heck  they should have offered me a free future return or a stay in one of their other hotels for all the grief and discomfort I endured  Slots  I found the    slot payouts to be generous when you play   at a time  below that forget it  Food  quite mediocre and expensive given what the competition offers  Consider that the Belagio offers a phenomenal buffet for about twice what Circus Circus charges  the service is better  they offer great wines at a slightly extra charge  and if you stay at Circus Circus  I recommend eating at the Subway or McDonald s located right out front  For breakfast  go to another hotel and get a good meal for a couple dollars more  maybe less  Parking  Free right out back  a very nice amenity  Overall Service  the people who work there are nice enough  it is just that they don t appear to always have the support or authority to get something done  Layoffs too have left the hotel and its facilities extremely short staffed leading to some morale problems and serious delays and breakdowns in service  My overall recommendation  If you are a businessperson  professional  traveling without children  or visiting the U S  for the first time  shop around for other hotel offerings  You will be glad you did  The lowest rate may not be the overall best deal in this town  
P =>   Good budget option in Vegas The hotel is a little dated but excellent value  The rooms are large with a big bathroom  Check in was quick and the desk assistant was very helpful  The hotel is located near the end of the strip but the bus runs from right out the front every   mins or so and you can buy a   day pass for      The internet is charged at        per    hours but I don t think this is very different from any other hotel in Vegas  Although we had a good time at Circus Circus I think if we visit Vegas again we will stay at Hurrahs  which is central strip and offers great drink deals   a good place to stay for couples or groups  Those with children may appreciate Circus Circus a bit more than we did  
P =>   Rip OFF  Ruined my tire and rim and wont pay for it  I used the Valet parking     The next day  I figured I wouldnt need to check my tires after leaving it  quot safe quot  with the Valet parking     When I reached Utah  I did a walk around and noticed that my passenger front tire and rim had been RUINED  I nice gash in my tire and rim  I have expensive tires and rims    I called  made the report as soon as I noticed    Called them on Monday   They absolutely refused to pay for the damage done to my car  OOH  Dont eat at the buffet  it is a rip off  all the food is nasty  Also  the beds REALLY sucked  Paid     a night   for what  NOTHING  
P =>   If you have kids bring them here  Stayed there last year and we re going again this summer  The first time is tricky  might get lost but easy to learn you re way around  Pools looked too crowded but my little ones loved the circus acts and playing games while dad played his machines  There s a McDonald s restaurant in there incase you don t need a buffet breakfast or just want some fries to snack on  Good value and lots of things for the kids to see  The check out line was pretty long but they have those boxes to return your room card and leave if you don t need anything else  
P =>   Brilliant and great fun  We went to this hotel after refusing to stay at the Riviera across the road  This hotel was brilliant  Our first trip to Vegas  we found the staff friendly and very helpful and the check in process was easy  We stayed in the Skyrise tower  overlooking the Stratosphere  The hotel is dated in comparison to the others  but this is certainly reflected in the price The maid service was great  the sheets changed everyday and room cleaned  We didn t eat much in the hotel  but there is plenty of choice available if you wanted to  The theme is very light hearted and a fun place to stay at  I would have no doubts staying there again  
P =>   Not nearly as bad as it is rated Ok  so this place isn t the Taj Mahal  but for the price       and the things to do  largest indoor theme park in the world for       this is a good deal  They have free circus shows about every hour  It s not close to the main part of the strip  but it s walkable The TV is ridiculously small  like a    quot  tube TV The room isn t that bad  But not great  for sure The buffet is a great deal for the strip       and you can get your own drinks There is a McDonald s and a Subway right next door The pool is pretty bad  the only major mark against the hotel There is an RV park attached to it  with a coin laundry room The Adventuredome theme park  for     for all the rides  is worth it  and friendly to all ages of kids  
P =>   Cheap for a night on the strip The hotel is run down and probably in line for once of the next tear downs  but it was cheap and clean  The amusement park was closed for cleaning and there were little stands selling carnival type junk  Eating options were limited  
P =>   Try the other end of the Strip Stayed here with my son and daughters boyfriend for   nights having travelled out for the Ricky Hatton debacle Seems to me most Vegas rooms are pretty functional and the casinos virtually interchangeable so from our point of view we weren t bothered about fancy Hotel We intended to spend very little time in the room anyway and shopping in the hotels wasn t a factor that we were bothered with  Price was uppermost in our decision to stay here and it was a good price we got We stayed in the Manor Rooms which are not actually in the hotel They are basically   big rather ugly buildings in a car park about     yards outside the main hotel The rooms were fine though not really a   person room we d been promised   queen size beds not the   singles I d asked for and so a fold up bed was provided when we complained The room was over crowded for   guys but it didn t bother us since we weren t there to spend anything other than the minimum time in the room Maid service daily was efficient towels and toiletries plentiful It was clean No complaints for the price There was a TV  it probably worked We didn t watch My only reservation is that the hotel is at the end of the Strip with less action and fewer other casinos to visit so if I could get a good price on MGM Grand or Luxor or Excalibur I d sooner be at that end of the Strip which is after all about   and a half miles long so being at the  quot wrong quot  end can get pricey in taxis to get where you want to be On the other hand if Circus Circus was doing a really good deal I d stay again If going with my wife I d go elsewhere though  ambience and shopping would win out and MGM Grand Bellagio Wynn etc would be more the mark for a couples vacation 
P =>  Need a Cheap Hotel for work       mins away from the Convention   I would only stay here for the location of the hotel beign close by to the main convention centre    Otherwise I would look around    Its a    minute walk to the convention centre and ideally located   Its pretty good even with company   Vegas is too hot always and the strip gets busier by the evening   so you want to be among the hustle bustle   and get out at the right time    
P =>  A great fun filled experience  Myself  amp  my partner stayed here in ruary       It was my first time in America  amp  we enjoyed every moment of it  We got married in Vegas  amp  Circus Circus was our accommodation  Although it is at one end of the strip it is still in walking distance of any of the other hotels  amp  if you don t fancy the walk then the  Deuce  bus stops right outside the hotel for only    for a whole days travelling  Also the Hilton hotel is only a short walk away  amp  they have a monorail that travels right down to the MGM Grand or you can get off at any stop you fancy  Our room was clean  amp  we never had any problems with it or with any of the staff  they were always polite  amp  helpful  The only downside I would say about this hotel is with it being one of the older ones it is quite smokey in the casino area  The air conditioning in some of the higher star rated hotels such as the Bellagio  amp  Treasure Island hides the smoke better  Having said that you cannot get a better value for money hotel  amp  I would definately recommend Circus Circus  
P =>  Circus fun in Vegas We stayed here for about a week  Hotel is on one end of the strip so walk towards the other end can be long  But plenty of stuff to do in circus circus  Also  its children play area is gerat for kids  In door amusement park is worth a visit  Food quality and prices are more value for   to other places on strip  
P =>  Nice We stayed for   nights from il    till    and it was fun  Nice clean rooms on the tower  free parking lot  right on the strip and next to convenience stores and drugstore  We just payed     dollars per night per room and hotel staff was very kind with us  There is a charge for wireless internet and    dollar telephone fee per night per room  
P =>   Had a great time at the Circus Circus Me and my boyfriend stayed at the Circus Circus for our first trip to Vegas recently and I have to say I was slightly worried after reading the reviews on here  We stayed for   nights as part of a multi centre holiday and had a really great time  As i d never been to Vegas before I was amazed at the sheer size of everything  the hotel was huge  the room was huge  there were two huge beds in our room  the casino was also huuge  It took about   minutes just to walk from our room to the reception area  The staff were friendly and helpful and check in was a breeze   no queue   We had a tower room with a great view looking down the strip  the room was great  clean and comfortable with enough room for a family of four  The decor was a tad old fashioned but I wasn t complaining   I was in Vegas   I thought the location towards the north end of the strip was just fine  it took about   mins walk to get into the centre of the strip but there are lots of things to see on the way and you have to get used to doing alot of walking in Vegas   there are other hotels further  north  than Circus Circus like Stratosphere and Sahara so it s not isolated on it s own or anything  I can t comment on the buffet or anything as we never ate at the Circus Circus but there were a few restaurants in the hotel that looked very nice  Circus Circus may not be as modern or extravagant as some of the other hotels on the strip but it s a great base for seeing what Vegas has to offer  great value for money and I would definately go back  
P =>   Fun Unlimited Las Vegas being a place of fun  excitement  winning  loosing  romance and lots more   where this hotel stands tall on the main strip with all its various activities  They have everything from cassino to indoor theme park  circus to games   and not to mention lovely hospitality  This holel is for all age groups   so need not worry and go ahead and book it guys  My JP        
P =>   lumpy bed I have stayed at circus circus   times now  The first two times were great  Stayed in the tower  with my daughter and her family  This time I went with my husband and I raved about the hotel It was the worse   nights we had The mattress was lumpy  You could feel the springs in your back  It even made noise when you turned over The other patrons were so loud at      every morning you couldn t sleep  Not to mention the people on the   th floor who listened to music half the night and all you could hear was boom boom boom The worse stay I ve ever had     
P =>   Wow  What a Value  I stayed on the   nd floor of the West Tower  I rented   adjoining rooms for     a night each  Wonderfully large rooms with granite marble tops and clean  Two queen sized beds  This is a great hotel for kids and a great value  Vegas is hurting now due to the recession  and this is one of the best hotel values I ve ever had   and free parking  
P =>  GOOD FOR THE PRICE My daughter and I stayed at CIRCUS CIRCUS in ch       The room was clean and perfectly adequate  We had clean towels every day and clean sheets when requested   the little card you leave on the bed   The casino it s self is not the newest but you re in the best place to choose a casino  The restaurant does a lovely breakfast buffet but the evening buffet is not worth it  There s a circus act starting at   am in The Midway  We didn t see much of it but it was always busy  Also  there s a theme park with roller coaster and rides  There s a bus stop outside the hotel that takes you to the main strip and the other side takes you downtown  The Freemont Street Experience  Downtown  is great  There s a light show you have to see  It starts at at  pm   I think  and are every hour on the hour but the best one s are a bit later  see one then go to the buffet at the Freemont St hotel and casino  it s really good food and well worth the money  There s a good outlet shopping centre that the bus takes you right outside  We had a fantastic time in Vegas and the hotel I would recommend  It s clean  good location for either direction and professional and friendly staff  
P =>   Wonderful  Despite some reviews I read  I booked based on price and location  I wasn t disappointed at all  From check in to check out  the entire experience was definitely more bang for the buck  My room was nice  clean  spacious and always fully stocked by the housekeeping staff  I left early on a Friday morning  and left one of my rings  not noticed until I got to the airport   I immediately called CC Security  who already had the ring and shipped it out that day  
P =>   I Loved It  Although I was there a few years ago  it was great at the time  The Blue Iguana is the best place to get Mexican food  and the drinks are wonderful  The rooms are average  but not bad  plus for the price you can t beat it  My only complaint is the roller coaster  if you re short like me  your head smashed from one side to the other  giving you a major headache  My husband on the other hand  who is fairly tall  had no problems at all  I thought the service was above average  Overall  I thought it was a great place to stay  I plan on staying there each time I m in Vegas  
P =>  Las Vegas Didnt enjoyed the hotel  though the city was very nice  My sons pram was stolen from Circus Circus  and no one even entertained  Rooms were OK  The Airconditioning created trouble   be good for those  who have shoe string budget 
P =>   Value for Money After reading the reviews  i really was looking into changing our hotel but i was pleasantly suprised  The hotel   yes it is dated  it was built in the      s but for somewhere to lay your head and shower after walking all day it was perfect  The hotel is at the end of the strip but it s not to far to walk    Hotel   Takes about    minutes to check in but got upgraded to one of the recently renovated rooms  plasma screnn  pillow top xlarge bed   tidy and very spacious  The hotel casino s do smell of stale smoke but this is only because smoking is allowed in the casino but we had a nonsmoking room and it was fine  The buffet restaurant is a little bit canteen style but is one of the cheapest buffets on the strip   u get what you pay for  Breakfast is     and you have unlimited bacon  waffles  pancakes  eggs  bagels  cereal  fruit  yoghurt and fruit juice etc   enough to keep you going for a good few hours  Dinner was ok but the food is very same y and you get your usual deep fried chicken  beef stew etc  The shops seem to be a little over priced for soft drinks and snacks  there is a supermarket as you come out of the hotel on the left which we didnt find until the last day but it is a lot cheaper and has much more vaiety   think it s where the locals shop Few things about Vegas  i got some tips from trip advisor which really helped   The DEUCE   it s a big gold double decker bus that runs up and down the strip    hours a day and comes along every      mins in busy times  Worth getting a   or   day pass as you can get on and off as many times as u like and it does come in handy just to sit down for   mins to go to the next hotel  Shopping   we went to the las vegas fashion outlet in Primm   u can get tickets from the top of the fashion show mall   it takes about    minutes to get there and goes twice a day  Shops ok there  has a Gap  Timberland etc and the usual bargain shops   things are cheaper there but not as good as the outlet centres i have been to in New York  The Las Vegas outlet  which is where the last stop on the deuce is  is just   mins outside of vegas  not great  has converse and a few other shops i have heard of but all the others i had never heard of Went to Grand Canyon on a bus trip but would advise flying for that bit extra as you have to get on   different buses and takes hours   Was amazing to see the grand canyon though and well worth going The hotel is a great place to stay if you want to be away from all the noise and hustle and bustle  There are a lot of kids there as there is an indoor theme park and a circus there but we dont have kids and you dont really get invloved in any of it if you are just looking for a cheap place to stay  The pool was fine and had a lovely large warm jacuzzi that is nice to relax in after walking all day Overall i would definately recommend Vegas and Circus Circus as for what we paid   i could not beleive the value for money and friendly staff      
P =>   OK   eat elsewhere though      Stayed here a couple of years ago so my review may be a little out of date if things have changed  To sum it up  CircusCircus was OK  The room was of average size and reasonably clean  The casino area was a little dated and a bit of a sticky carpet to be honest  much nicer casinos in other hotels  The location is ok  at the top end of the strip  We ate in one of the restaurants within the hotel  The food was dire  A    year old chicken breast  was like eating string  and when we complained  we were met with abuse and told that we should have sent the food back as soon as it came  but as it was covered in breadcrumbs  one had to bite into it to taste it    So  as a result  no apology or discount on the bill offered by the restaurant manager  Las Vegas itself is fantastic  Loved every minute  All in all  if it hasn t already had one  CircusCircus could do with a massive revamp or a thorough cleaning of the casino area at least      
P =>   Excellent value Excellent bedrooms in this very good value hotel  At the far end of the strip so quite a distance from other hotels however there is a Deuce bus stop at the front of the hotel and for    per day you can travel up and down as much as you like  When you look around other hotels they are much more luxurious than Circus Circus but they are also a lot more expensive  We had an excellent   nights at this hotel and couldn t fault it at all  Buffet restaurant excellent value and very nice food  Nothing fancy but something for everyone  Not necessarily the best but excellent value  
P =>   So so for adults great for children I checked Trip Advisor after my fiance  booked a nonrefundable   nights at Circus Circus I was somewhat prepared for what we got for the price  Our Manor room on the first floor was big but outdated  Before we left for dinner the first night  it sounded like the people above us were jumping off the bed onto the floor  I woke up the first night to a crying toddler in the room next door  Luckly  that was the worst night for noise  Had the breakfast buffet twice  Get there early and there is no line  Beware of sales reps for Tahiti Village  They will offer you discounts for dinner  shows  etc  for   hours of your time They seemed to be everywhere  
P =>  Old Smelly but ok if on a budget A group of us from IReland stayed here during paddys day for   days  It is very clear what has happened to this Hotel and this end of the Strip  The Curcus Circus im sure in its day was THE place to be in Vegas and faces the famous Riviera  The remainder of the strip is full of modern first class Hotels  The Circus Circus feels like it has accepted defeat agasinst these and so doesnt bother to maintain itself and im sure will always get business from the lies of us  gangs of lads who were on a budget There is cearly a   star Hotel  from the casino  to the buffet  the staff  the smell and the dreaded carpet throughout  We were lucky in that we had once of the nicer rooms with a fab view  but                 there was an inch thick of dirt on the window  they had not been cleaned in years The smell throughout got to me after a couple of days and i just wanted out  I was jealous walking down the strip seeing the other hotels and knowing theres great bargains to be got now Look  if you dont care about hygiene  food  bad mannered staff then stay here IF you do  then dont  stay well clear Im going back in y and am in the Mandalay bay          Dave  
P =>  Great value for a room on the Strip Circus Circus is cheap  really cheap  It s not the most glamourous place to stay  but it is still on the Strip  the rooms are large  the pool reasonable  the casino OK  The free gaming lessons in the mornings were useful  It s about    minutes to walk to the main section of the strip  although Circus Circus is on the Trolley  The buffet was fairly bad  and        for    hours of wi fi absolutely extortionate  And  though I expect to be hassled on the Strip  I don t really want pushy sales techniques as I wander through my hotel  But  all in all  you pay an incredibly low price for a more than reasonable experience  
P =>  What a dump    Dont stay here   Its cheap for a reason   Rooms are very basic and grubby  They dont even have lights in the ceilings so you have to use the minimal light provided by the two lamps to navigate your way around the room  Out of the hundreds of rooms the hotel has we were sent over to a section of rooms located on the ground floor at the rear of the hotel having to cross a busy road to get there  so we didnt even get a view of the strip to make up for the s  ty room  The hotel is at the very far end of the strip a good   min walk to where the action is  Cabs are costly and the public transport    The Duece  is a JOKE  Your lucky if you can get on a bus and if you dare to comment to the driver you get sworn at and abused  Great service My advice spend a little extra and stay somewhere nice it ll make your holiday much more enjoyable  
P =>   What a blast We didn t know what to expect for     night  but were thrilled with it all  What a riot  Trapeze artists  a midway  a casino  entertainment  food  We wanted to stay somewhere where we didn t stick out when pushing a stroller  and we didn t  But it was fun for all ages  Great location  very clean and quiet room  in tower   super nice bell man  free valet  front desk was only so so  but floor staff and bartenders were great  Highly recommend  
P =>   West Tower Room Was Very Nice    My boyfriend and I just got back from a fun little weekend trip to Vegas  Whatever you do  request a West Tower room  or pay to upgrade to this room  I know they have old and outdated rooms  but the West Tower Room was really nice with flat screen tv s and a nice bathroom  I used to stay at Circus Circus all the time when I was growing up  so this place is nostalgic to me  but I am very picky about a nice hotel room and was totally impressed with the West Tower room  For the price  you can t beat it  especially to be right on the strip  The casino itself is old  but the West Tower Rooms were just as nice as a   star hotel  If you don t mind walking  everything on the strip is just a       minute walk away and it s great to get some excerise and people watch of course  Also  don t miss the Paris s Le Village Buffet for weekday lunch  or Saturday Sunday champagne brunch buffet for        per person  great food and you can drink a lot of champagne when you mix it with a little cranberry juice     
P =>   never go there Our room was horrible and grubby especially the bathroom the whole room was dated we had a view of the construction site around the   th floor  we booked the hotel for ourselves and two kids mainly for the adventuredome  when we got there the adventuredome was closed for maintenance for the four days we where there  no courtesy call to say this was happening  This was the reason we booked here  very smokey atmosphere everywhere  understandibly as it was a casino  but the kids had to walk past all the smoke to get out of the building  It took ages to get out of the building from our room  seemed like corridor after corridor oh and beware of constantly being zapped by static that was a nightmare  Once out of the hotel you could actually enjoy vegas  The foyer down near the main entrance was so dated with its grubby white and silver chairs it looked so cheap and nasty  Forgot to mention both children came down with a nasty virus while we were there      
P =>   We had a great stay  The hotel was clean  there were plenty of good towels for the two of us  and when we needed a light bulb replaced  and the safe opened up from the last customers in the room  we only had to wait    minutes or so  The check in process was faster than most I think  This is a huge hotel and there are always lots of people waiting to check in  but I only had to wait about   minutes for the   or   people in front of me  The bill was difficult to understand  everything was broken up by person and individual charges  like phone charges whether you use it or not  But I think we were charged fairly and for the price we paid  it was a great deal  I would have appreciated free internet though  I have never been to a hotel where you had to pay extra  So  if you don t mind crowds  the lobby was always busy and full of people waiting for something  this place was great   and if you have kids  even better for all the kids activities in the Adventuredome  The food at the buffet was okay  lots of fresh fruit and take out cups for coffee in the morning  
P =>   Perfect for exploration of Las Vegas If your like myself  amp  my husband the purpose of your visit to any holiday destination is not to sit in your hotel watching tv and scratching your behind  Its about getting out there  finding new things to see  new places to go  finding adventure  Its Las Vegas for goodness sake Old   yes  Granny wallpaper   yes  Children around the place   yes  what do you expect  this is a hotel stuck in the old day      THE GOOD OLD DAYS  ok it may not have zoo animals at your beck and call  and marble  gold amp  diamond encrusted floors but who really cares  It has bright lights  friendly down to earth people there spending what they want not what they feel they have to  nice friendly staff and clean comfortable rooms with a view  ok this view could possibly be of a car park or the front of the hotel or a nicer hotel but let me stress the point again  your not there to say in your room  You get top end three star standard everyday for half the price of a nightclub entry ticket in Vegas  Its on the strip  its oldskool and to top it all off you get free fantastic circuis acts while you play  The beer is cold  flowing  amp  free no matter what your bet  We have stayed in hotels all over Ireland and the rest of the world and i ll tell you now that its of a good standard and cheaper that a hostel on the Arran Islands  There are no      slots and no pretensas here  its just good cheap fun  if you have booked this hotel and are looking at other reviews with horror and depression then fear not  This hotel is a cut above the rest  and a great starting point for your Las Vegas holiday The last thing I will say is that if you going to Vegas dont drink too much  bring sun cream  wear good walking shoes and relax  If your there worrying about the small things you will miss the big things  also slots or fun is the best Well done the Irish rugby team  up the Irish  
P =>   Giant Garbage Bin This hotel is like a giant garbage bin  everything is filthy  I will list the pros and cons to staying here PROS  super cheap prices  even tho its a dump  you get what you pay for i guess  and you dont pay much  some nights when its slow you can stay in their best room for the cost of a basic room at another   star hotel   great location  right on the las vegas strip  nice casino  restraunts  lots of shopping  free circus act  entertainment is definately there  not the best  but its there CONS  my room was so dirty that i didnt want to sleep in the bed without wearing my hooded sweatshirt with the hood up  huge black stains in the carpet  maids didnt clean the room well  orange pop sprayed on the walls etc  kids everywhere  kids crying  totally killed the Vegas Vibe  Very outdated decor  in major need of a renovation  especially for las vegas  they need to up their game  You can stay at the Sahara or Stratosphere for almost the same price and get   X the value over there  I would recomend the Stratosphere to anyone that is considering Circus Circus  and the Sahara is good too  
P =>   past its sell by date Went to circus circus with a friend and was dissapointed with the room and hotel  It was very out dated and in need of an update  The pool area was tiny and next to a road so you could hear alot of noise  It seemed to be full of ghetto style people with hoards of children  I m sure anyone wanting to go with children would like this place as on the plus it has a theme park and circus acts  however for   adults alone it was a bit cheap and tacky too far out from the other hotels and attractions  I would not go back and anyone who has ever stayed has told me the same before and since  The price however is what attracts people  
P =>   Not impressed I m afraid     It was grubby and stank of stale cigarette smoke wherever you went  It was full of loud families and it wasn t suitable for us  I m afraid  Rooms were a great size and so were bathrooms  however  that was about it The real GEM was the FAMOUS STEAK HOUSE which is DEFINITELY worth a visit  in fact  don t go home without sampling the beautiful steaks  Very classy  
P =>   Location Location Location   Stayed at this hotel in ch      for   nights  I was recommended the hotel by a friend who had stayed there  but was slighly worried it would be very childish as the theme is Clowns   thankfully  i loved it  The Rooms are massive and have   double beds and a flat screen TV with en suite bathroom  Location  On the strip  near the end with the statosphere  which is a must do for the evening as you get AMAZING pictures    It is a   min walk to the Fashion Show Mall  but to be advised the hotel that was next to Circus has been knocked down and they were starying to build another hotel  but this was a year ago so it may be nearly done by now as they seem to get the hotels done rather quickyl   The hotel has a buffet breakfast  which is amazing  They have cooked breakfasts  pancakes  potatoes  cakes  pretty much everything   Its worth filling up on this in the morning so you set for most of the day and it was extremely cheap   Otherwise they have a mcdonald around the corner of the hotel and also a mcdonalds in the hotel  but this was upstairs     i didnt even realise it was there until a couple of days into our trip  If you going to Las Vegas and just want a good value hotel  because lets face it  your only really sleeping in your room   this is the hotel for you  
P =>   Family friendly and good value  This is the second time I have stayed here with my children  Make sure you request the West Tower  The rooms are MUCH nicer  We got an incredible deal at     per night  We got two rooms  connecting  that gave us all the room we needed and two bathrooms  The rooms are not super clean  We found some trash behind the dresser and under the chair  but you do get what you pay for  We stayed five nights and had a good experience  Valet parking is free and is a godsend as you could end up lugging your bags for a long time  My only complaints were that the rides and games are old and many were out of order  We lost countless quarters to games that did not work  I wish they would replace them or fix them  Two of the major rides in the adventure dome were not operational  The staff manning the rides really needed a cup of coffee or something  They all seemed bored to death and almost bothered to have to operate the ride  The Circus acts are amazing  My son loved them all  The large pool was not operational either  The little pool worked but the larger pool is better  All of the other staff we came into contact with were friendly except security  Our first night the fire alarm went off at  am  We all got dressed and began to head out of our room when a security guard came by and barked at us to go back to our rooms as it was a false alarm  Everyone  kids  was pretty freaked out by the alarm and to have the guard yell at us like we were fools for leaving our rooms seemed pretty out of line  Last time I stayed here I had issues with security being rude  Seems they need some lessons in customer service  We had several excellent meals with great service at the Garden Grill  They have all you can eat Prime Rib for      The Krispy Kreme store and McDonalds are a great convenience  I am not a fan of the buffet for dinner but do like it for breakfast  For a good dinner take the Duece and go up the strip  Maggianos is a great choice  
P =>   West tower rooms are a good weekday value If you are looking for a budget room  this is for you  If you need good service and are willing to pay for it  there are much nicer places Stay during the week and the rates are half  Wish I would have We stayed in the West Tower room        I thought the room was nice enough but the windows look like they haven t been washed in    years  Ruined the view We waited to check in until almost      P M  and didn t have a problem  Casino advertises    black jack tables but I was never able to get a seat at one  They typically only have one    table and there are usually a half dozen people like me waiting for a seat It is probably about     mile to the next decent casino  A long way if you are a couch potato but not bad if the weather is nice  Take the bus if it is too far  We found Vegas vacation to be so much walking anyway that the extra mile or so didn t bother us Public bathrooms do remind me of a high school locker room  Dirty  few and far between  and few stalls The entertainment in this hotel  circus acts etc   were better than the other hotels I thought  In fact  I can t hardly think of any other hotel that had  free  entertainment If you are seeing vegas on a budget  stay in the west tower rooms  We didn t spend much time in the room anyway If luxury is your gig and you can afford it  I recommend Ceasers  Venetian  Wynn  and Palazzo  They were absolutely beautiful  
P =>   Great value  Stayed at the Circus Circus from ruary   st till the   th  There is really nothing negative to write about this hotel  My friend and I got a really nice room in the West Tower  very clean and spacious  Location of Circus Circus is good  It s    minute walk to the newer hotels like The Venetian  The Bellagio etc   I would definitely recommend it to everybody  
P =>  Nice rooms and good facilities but dirty laundry and unhelpful staff Overall  this hotel is good value  the nicer rooms are worth the money and the tv  bathroom  bed  and other room facilities were satisfactory Unfortunately I had to be shown four rooms before I could find a bed that wasn t stained with lipstick or a peculiar black mess  could be the result of bugs or insects   The final room also had a problem with the door that took two days to resolve Apart from this I did enjoy my stay and would consider staying there again should I be doing Las Vegas on a budget  however hopefully a four or five star will be possible next time Finally  the theme park was good fun and fairly cheap and the other amenities were perfect for an enjoyable  if not rather cheap  few days  
P =>  stay away pay a little more While we did not stay there  my boyfriend and I decided to walk through and we were going to eat there  But  the cleanliness or lack of  This place is nasty and stinks  It is the smell that hits you as you walk in and stays with you all day long  My boyfriend used the bathroom and said it looked like it hadn t been cleaned all day and was horrible  I cannot imagine letting a child run around this place  we felt so dirty we left right a way  The people that hang out there make you watch your back  Don t waste your time going there  
P =>  pretty good hotel i like circus circus   it was a friendly and live hotel 
P =>  Beware of thieves    I stayed at this hotel for four nights  I had breakfast at the hotel when I went to get a cup of coffee  When I came back within a minute  my shoulder bag  containing my laptop and some books  vanished   There were only six people in the dining area at the time  and none of them had moved from their seats and none had anyhing in their hands  Only people who were moving were the staff  who denied seeing anything  So  if you have breakfast  lunch or dinner  BEWARE OF THIEVES    
P =>   Implode it soon  Disgusting  While we did not stay there  my wife and I decided to walk through and play a while  I didn t have a problem with the kids like some talk about because it is a kid place  What I did have a problem with was the cleanliness or lack of  This place is nasty and stinks  It is the smell that hits you as you walk in and stays with you all day long  My wife used the bathroom and said it looked like it hadn t been cleaned all day and was horrible  I cannot imagine letting a child run around this place if the kids rides and etc are as filthy as the rest of the place  
P =>   Mixed Review My mum and I stayed at Circus Circus for a week during ruary       After reading the reviews here on tripadvisor we were a little worried  The hotel reception is dark and always busy  people queuing to check in and out         The staff were helpful and friendly  We chose a manor room  which was great because you did not get any of the noise from the theme park below  but on the other hand it was a   minute walk from the entrance to the elevator then another long walk from there to the room  Not good if you can t walk much  The room it s self was OK  nothing to write home about  was basic  TV  iron  haidryer  the safe in the room you had to pay for  two quaters each time you opened it   Ours did not work  we did report it but nothing was done about it The location is a little way off the strip  a pretty long walk to the mast of everything The one thing it was near was Fashion Show Mall   great if your trip was for shopping  I wouldn t advise taxi s the cost a fortune     a ride one way   Get a Duce bus ticket    for    hours of     for   days travel  They are clean and reliable and cheap  
P =>   You get what you pay for    My boyfriend and I stayed at Circus Circus for a week last ch  It was okay   the rooms were nothing special  but it wasn t awful either  It worked for what we needed  Overall  we had no real problems while staying here  but we also didn t spend a lot of time at the hotel  since we mainly went to Vegas to visit friends and see the city  Just know that when it says that it s located in the  quot heart of the strip quot  that isn t completely accurate  At first  it s nice to walk around and take in the sights  but hopefully you aren t expecting to walk everywhere  it gets exhausting  If you are on a budget or traveling with kids  then you would probably have no complaints with Circus Circus  If you are looking for a   or   star hotel  this would definitely not be the place for you  
P =>  Circus Circus No More Horrible check in line  told that they were not expecting such crowds  Saturday no crowds   Went to room     minute walk    elevators  Walked in room first thing is smashed cockroach on wall  and hair dryer and bracket broken off laying on counter  Sheets disgusting  indoor outdoor like carpeting and a nice view of the roof air conditioning unit  Freight train sounding a c unit by bed wakes you up all night  Children screaming in halls at   am  Disgusting stench of body odor and smoke in all areas of the casino  What did I expect for the price   what I got  next time I won t be such a cheap       
P =>   Outdated Stayed here for   nights in  as part of our Virgin Holidays trip  If you re doing a similar thing its worth seeing if you can upgrade for the Vegas part  This hotel is a disappointment compared to the other hotels in Vegas  It needs to be updated as it doesn t seem to be cared for  The furnishings are tired and although it wasn t dirty it felt like it was  It is also quite far from the rest of the strip so be prepared to walk alot to get anywhere  There are far better hotels in Vegas so don t stay at Circus Circus  
P =>   Nothing like the others in Vegas but worked for me just fine My wife and I went to Las Vegas for our  th wedding anniversary  which is Valentines Day  We went ruary   through the   th because of it being cheaper than being there the weekend of Valentines Day   We booked this trip on Orbitz and received a really great deal that included airfare and the hotel room at the Circus Circus  We arrived late on the  th so there was very few people checking in  Our check in was very quick and easy  The man that did the check in for us was friendly and got us booked and to our room in approximately   minutes or so  I was very pleased with that after reading prior reviews that made it seem like the check in was a nightmare   The hotel is old and somewhat tired and dirty in places  It definitely could use a lot of cleaning and work to bring it up to par with others in the area  The stores in the hotel are generic with very little selection and high prices  There is a McDonalds and Krispy Kreme Donut shop inside the hotel   The room was in the west tower and we were on the   th floor  The room was more than perfect  except there are few electrical outlets  This was a hassle because of several things that needed to be plugged in to be charges  Other than the outlet problem  I absolutely could not have been more pleased with the room  The bed was a king size and was oh so comfortable and nice  The TV was a flat screen that was on the wall  The room faced opposite of the strip and faced the adventure dome  Being on the   th floor  we were above the dome and had a great view of snowy mountains  I loved the view so much and it was a highlight of the trip for me  It was really quiet in the room and in the hall  I only heard another person once the entire trip while in the room  The room and bathroom were extremely clean and had no problems at all  I was happy as could be  Check out was a breeze  It took me less than a couple of minutes to check out  If I ever visit Las Vegas again and I am on a tight budget  I will definitely consider staying at the Circus Circus again  However  one thing that may keep me from staying at this hotel again is the location  It is a pretty good walk to the middle of the strip and on the complete opposite end from the famous Las Vegas sign  We walked to the sign and back on the first day and it took a long time and really wore us out  I may would rather stay at a more centralized location to cut down on walk time  
P =>   good value if you have or don t mind kids  spotless very good value rooms nearer top end of strip so a bit of a walk to where it s at unless you stay on site  clientele rather annoying though lots of kids and teenagers running about  spend a bit more and stay somewhere far classier unless you have kids  
P =>   We got scabies from this hotel  This hotel should not be in business  I stayed there a couple years ago and every person in my room got scabies  In case you are not aware of what scabies is  here is a short description Scabies is a contagious disorder of the skin caused by very small  wingless insects or mites called the Human Itch mite  The female insect burrows into the skin where she lays       eggs daily  If untreated  the female will continue to lay eggs for about five weeks  The eggs hatch and the new mites begin the cycle all over again   http   www safe use com pests scabies scabies htm Basically it is a terrible itchy and ugly rash all over your body  Clearly the sanitation is this hotel is not even close to safe standards  I will never set foot in here again  We reported this case to the hotel and there was no reimbursement what so ever  Not to mention the people that gamble in the hotel are completely disgusting and perverted humans  I would never let my children stay at this hotel regardless of how cheap it is  There are other resorts on the strip that are more convenient and only slightly more expensive  Avoid Circus Circus at all costs  
P =>  Great place to stay We had read some bad reports but I wonder what some people expect  The price is very good and our spacious room was excellent and we had a wonderful view  If there was a fault it was that the carpets were pretty worn  The casino and the circus acts were all just an escalator ride away Circus Circus is pretty central for all the other casinos  The staff were great but unfortunately for them and Las Vegas we did not go to gamble The casino and the circus acts were all just an escalator ride away  
P =>  Highly Recommend for Families Our party of   stayed and Circus Circus for a total of   nights and were more than happy with the level of service and rooms  Though the Hotel itself perhaps requires modernisation  cleanliness and location were perfect  This hotel was the best Value for Money on our one month holiday to the USA  
P =>  Good Value for money dont be dishearted by the reviews  After reading the reviews we were nervous to say the least about our stay at the Circus Circus   On arrival the check lines are enormous and the reception area is rather rowdy hence I wouldnt recommend staying in this hotel in peak periods  The rooms are clean and basic and ideal for a short break  The hotels location is great much better than many of its counterparts The Luxor  madalay bay  If you want to explore Vegas and spend your money going out the circus circus is a fine choice  Of course it is dated and many of the clientele may be a bit rough round the edges but if you dont want to spend Bellagio money on a   star the Circus Circus is a good option  
P =>   fun hotel  Recently stayed in the Circus Circus hotel and casino in Las Vegas  It was OK  the rooms were fine  very basic but were clean  The hotel facilites were good  there was an indoor theme park  the rides were better for children  There was a few restaurants and shops inside aswell as the casino which was pretty big  Not as luxurious as some of the hotels we visited in Vegas but adequate  The one problem I found was that it was slightly out the way  I travelled with another girl and we found that late at night it wasnt very nice to walk that end of the strip  All in all I would say that the hotel is a lot better for children  A lot of entertainment if you have children  Fairly good value for money  Not too bad if u like walking  Takes about   mins to walk up to the main part of the strip  
P =>   Great Deal   I planned a   day weekend trip to Las Vegas and decided to book   stay with Circus Circus  I booked my reservation on their own website and found quite a deal  I booked my stay to check in on         and to check out on          The rate was about       per night  Whenever I go to Vegas I always look for an in expensive room rate simply because i hardly spend any time in the room  I like the online reservation system  plus this hotel only asks for the  st nights room rate to book  When I arrived at Circus Circus I could tell the building was quite old and run down  I parked my car in the parking garage and it was very old  dirty and run down looking  However I could not complain about that simply because I was not paying   star hotel rates  I arrived at the hotel about      and the hotel check in process was a bit slow  there was a long line and only   employee s at the front desk  Once I reached the counter the clerk was very friendly   just as fyi they bill an extra       once you check in as a security deposit  which they did nt tell me about  I found out after the fact  I was placed on the   th floor of the skyrise tower  Circus Circus has a total of about   different towers  I dont know how the other towers are  The room was quite a walk from the front desk  When I got to my room I must say for the price that I paid  I was quite impressed  the room was very clean and modern and was not  aged  looking at all  The bathroom was roomy and modern and had plenty of hot water  soap  towels  lotion  and shampoo  The bed was comfortable  and the window had a nice view of the strip  My only complain about the room was the tv  it only gets a few channels  and has poor quality  Be careful with the remote control and dont order any movies by accident  I did and had to pay       for it and they refused to waive it  As for room service  it is not    hours  the room service   food options during late night early mornings is not available  This is a great place for a family getaway  they have an amazing theme park  and nice promenade with stores  shops  etc  and even McDonalds for a quick bite to eat  As for the check out process  I checked out via the television set  which is much better than waiting in line  I would stay here again if the price is right  
P =>   Worst hotel in Vegas For this year s family vacation  we decided a trip to Las Vegas would be a fun and exciting experience  For the kids  Circus Circus seemed like the best hotel  including an indoor amusement park and arcade  Little did we know  most of the machines in the arcade were broken or run down and the theme park had several of its  quot premium quot  rides closed down   how convenient  Also  on the sign of the Adventuredome  the hours were as followed  Friday and Saturday    am   midnight   but after buying an all day pass  we came back at   pm to find it closed for the night  The rooms were decent  but internet is        a day  PER device which they failed to mention at check in  After arguing with a supervisor  we had the        charge removed  It is fair to say that this hotel is run down  broken and ready to close and I would not recommend staying here  even with a family of kids  There are much better places to stay in Vegas that will not ruin your experience  
P =>   Fine for a short stay My sister  brother and I spent   weeks travelling across America together  we had been staying in hostels for the past couple of weeks and this was considered a luxury for us so our expectations were low  The room was relatively clean and spacious and the beds were comfortable  There were circus acts performing in the hotel which lost its appeal quite quickly  This would probably entertain families with young children  Overall  it wasn t a terrible hotel but looking back it probably would have been nicer to have stayed in a hotel more central to the strip  
P =>  Gross and nasty casino circus but rooms are fine Let me begin to state that this hotel has charges an extremely low price   I doubt most people pay more than     per night  That price is basically the price of the Comfort Inn Motel   outside of Las Vegas  So if you book this hotel  don t expect luxury or contemporary decors  so definitely lower your expectations  because after all  they are charging Motel prices  However  from what I understand  the best rooms are the West Tower rooms  as the are renovated  The worst are the Manors  The in betweens are the Tower Wing and the Skyrise Wing  I stayed at the Skyrise Wing The casino area However  the worst part of the hotel is the extremely nasty  dirty  and disgusting casino gaming area  The air smells like      dirt  fried chicken   just anything you can name  Air conditioning is lacking  and there are smokers everywhere  Carpets are old and dirty  Headroom is low  and just is not a good experience Anyways  onto pros and consPros  Extremely low prices   This is a      Beds are quite comfortable  Large showers  ent service attitude  Great views  Abundant elevatorsCons  Kind of away from the strip  it is    minutes walk from Wynn  which is the tip of the strip  and    minutes walk from Venetian  which is probably the center center north of the strip  Disgusting air quality at the casino gaming area  Overall furnishings are old  Air conditioning in room is very loud  Dirty carpets  Very low headroom  felt cramped  Adventuredome was quite small  Just general small things  like some pictures in hallways falling off  or dents in electrical circuits  Small TVAlso  I feel that since most people who stay here are tourists  they are going to visit hotels such as Venetian or MGM Grand  Then  after walking through these ultra luxurious   star hotel and having set a high expectation  and going back to Circus Circus at night   it is just difficult to get used to  Circus Circus might have been good elsewhere  but in Las Vegas where everywhere is so beautiful stunning  it is just very difficult to get used to  I would compare this hotel to a Holiday Inn Holiday Inn Express  Overall  I would not recommend tourists to stay here  If you are just looking for a clean bed and room at cheap prices  then the hotel is for you  Otherwise  pay more and stay somewhere else  Vegas hotels are plentiful and are quite cheap  
P =>  Get What You Pay For Wanted to spend three days with our kids  ages   and    in a fun location  and thought of Circus Circus  Having never stayed there before  we were excited for the kids  The Adventuredome  the Midway and the circus acts all seemed like great entertainment for them  The hotel rate was very cheap  little did I know  so I thought we had all of the makings of a perfect fun family getaway Upon arrival  the driveway area in front of the hotel was a disaster with people  cars and luggage everywhere  There was nobody from the hotel making any effort to keep a flow of traffic  direct cars  anything  After a nearly one hour wait in line to check in  the lobby was full  and I mean full  of kids and luggage strewn everywhere     imagine hundreds of families all trying to check in at once     where are they all supposed to wait  I literally felt as if I was in a crowded downtown bus station in the middle of a large  metropolitan city   we didn t get a lower floor as we had requested  Even though the reservation was flagged with this note  we got stuck on the   th floor  Our room was supposed to be a non smoking room  Even though I guess it technically was  I was told that it was  despite no signage to indicate such   there were cigarette burns on the carpet and edges of the desk  The room smelled horribly of smoke  To move to another room  we would have had to have gone to a much higher floor  so we opted to have housekeeping come and spray the room with deodorizer  When we opened the curtains to look out  the outside of the window was so dirty that we could hardly see anything  near or far The biggest thing I noticed about the hotel  casino area and men s restrooms was how dirty everything was and all of the trash and debris that was strewn about  There were empty beer bottles  food bags  food remnants  cups and glasses laying everywhere  Trash cans were overflowing  people were throwing their trash on the floor because they couldn t stuff it in the cans  there was garbage stuffed behind gaming machines in the casino area  and the circus seating area was disgusting  I went there to see a performance with my kids and literally stepped in a puddle of beer while wiping ketchup off of the seats  The whole seating area was like this And the worst part was that it looked like this upon our arrival on Thursday at     pm  and STILL looked this way when we left on Saturday at     pm Our room service tray  which we received Friday morning at     am  was still in the room Friday evening when we returned  so I set it out in the hallway outside our room  When we left Saturday at     pm  IT WAS STILL THERE Also  the room service selection is terrible  You can only get real food  breakfast  sandwiches  steaks  desserts  from     am until       noon  six hours   From       noon until     am the next morning  eighteen hours   you can only get pizzas from the Pizzeria for room service Finally  for a hotel that attracts and caters to kids and families  there are no kids channels on the television  No Disney Channel  no Nickelodeon  no Cartoon Network  NOTHING  So if you have kids and plan to spend a little time in the room  don t count on any TV to keep them occupied The only positive aspect of Circus Circus is the Adventuredome  a five acre indoor amusement park with rides  games and a huge arcade  It was the main reason we came to Las Vegas and stayed at the Circus Circus My recommendation  Avoid Circus Circus at all costs  Stay somewhere else and drive to the Adventuredome   you don t have to be a guest to use it and you don t even get a discount for staying there  
P =>  Travel Agents View I have just returned from my second visit to Circus Circus  We travelled on       for  nights Firstly  its worth remembering that there are several blocks to Circus Circus  and the Manor Rooms as I understand  are the rooms with the issues  We stayed in the Sky Towers  in room        and it was great Remember  you are not pay top price  and therefore will not get luxury    accommodation and facilities   what you will get is value for money and a great base  The rooms are large  clean  and you can request on check in  twin or king beds  smoking or non smoking floor  The decor is a bit bright  stripped curtains  purple or green  clean  carpet  flowery bed spread  white clean sheets and towels  Bathrooms are a good size  and there is plenty of hot water  I do feel that we got value for money  and would return again in the future if the price is right The hotel is popular with families  however  if you leave the hotel by   am you miss a lot of the queues  as the indoor fair ground rides open then and it does get busy ect When you check in  you are charged    per day  this is for local unlimited calls from your room ect   check with the operator about free phone numbers  as some hotels block these numbers The safe in the room is   c  a time  you need   x   c to lock the safe each time  Would always recommend using a safe for your passports ect  Buffet  is       pp    its ok  not fantastic  and there are better breakfasts particular on the strip  never went in for lunch or dinner so cannot comment    Monte Carlo and Planet Hollywood are my personal favourites for breakfast  and really set you up for the day The Garden Grill in Circus  is really good  My husband enjoys the Filet Sliders  and I enjoy the Nachos   the portions in the US are huge  so order wisely  If your not sure  just order one course  and take it from there I really like PF Chang the Chinese restaurant at Planet Hollywood  it is really busy no matter what time of day or night you go  but its worth the wait  Also  Outback SteakHouse is very good  also does excellent pasta  Tony Roma s   have the Shrimp  amp  Scampi pasta   fantastic It was busy in Las Vegas  and cold at night  normal temperatures for the time of year  Wrap up warm and walk the strip and you are warm before you know it The Deuce bus runs   hours a day up and down the strip  it does get busy  and does not run to time due to the amount of traffic  especially at peak times  The fare is    per ride  or    for    hours  you can also use local buses with these card  We visited the huge shopping area on Sunset  as there are a couple of craft shops there  it was great  as you went through some residential areas as well small malls ect  Bus drivers are really ehelpful  if you are unsure of your stop  and at the main Deuce Terminal at SST they will right down the buses and the stops you need   so much better than the UK   If you are getting a taxi from   to the airport make sure you tell the driver to take Paradise Road and Industrial Road not the freeway or the strip  as it will cost a fortune  The cost should be no more than          and if you are being charged a lot more on arrival  then say that you want to contact the taxi authority  If you are being overcharged  they will reduce their fare immediately  as if they are found to have taken a longer route than necessary they can get fined themselves upto      We struck lucky  as we went out on the Thomas Cook Charter  we did not pre book transfers  and spoke with the rep on arrival  as they were going to our hotel  they charged us    each one way       for return  though the pick up time was too early for us   We dropped off at   hotels before reaching ours  and some were off the strip  which for me was great to see  as would not have got to see these hotels If you would like more info on places to eat and other hotels on the strip   as got to visit many  then do feel free to contact me Best regardsAlison 
P =>   It is a circus but a dirty one Had heard about this hotel from some Canadian friends who stayed there in their RV  Thought if we were going to vegas we would stay somewhere typical  The hotel has a very shabby feel  the carpets need a good clean the elevators are grubby and not up to the volume of guests  I was in the queue for check in for over    mins  We were towards the end of a tour around California and had stayed in   hotels before this one and the room was by far the dirtiest with the least facilities  No coffee  no fridge and no microwave  I checked under the bed for lost socks when we left and it was filthy  We stayed   nights  my husband picked up a nasty stomach bug and I was covered in bites  OK it was cheap for Vegas but you would be better off finding somewhere else  
P =>   give the circus a miss Very old decore  amp  facilities  small room  not very helpful staff  we were charged    for each call we made to hotel Housekeeping  for extra pillows  amp  to get the safe opened from the last guests who left it locked etc    the buffet was the best part of our stay here  The lifts are old and werent functioning properly  half of the hotel  amp  lifts were shut down due to the low number of guests  Considering the quality of other casino  hotel resorts in LV  Circus Circus is the poor cousin  There are plenty of other more beautiful places to stay and with the down turn in the USA economy  they are priced right as well  
P =>   ent experiences     no complaints  We wanted a quick  cheap getaway to Las Vegas and ended up booking our accommodations at Circus Circus for      CAD       USD  for   nights  I was a little apprehensive after reading some of the negative reviews  but the price simply could not be beat When we got there  check in was relatively painless  We did have to wait for a while  even though the line was short  This seems to be typical of Circus Circus   the Front Desk never seems to have enough people on duty  and although they are quite friendly and pleasant  they are definitely slow  We also had to pay    per day for  unlimited  local calls  which was fine as we did not want to use our cell phones and incur roaming charges  We were given a non smoking room in the Skyrise Tower  The decor was borderline garish and definitely dated  but the room itself was clean and relatively spacious  Can t say anything better or worse than that  Never had to wait too long for the elevators  and housekeeping was reasonable  they brought us extra pillows superquick when we asked   Given the price we paid  we really weren t expecting much  As far as location goes  it s a little far north on the Strip  If you have the time and the inclination  you could definitely walk to the other hotels  e g   Mirage  Bellagio  to see the attractions  It is a bit of a trek  it s about   miles between Circus Circus and Mandalay Bay  which is the southern most hotel   A better alternative is to take the Deuce  a double decker bus that runs up and down the Strip  You can get a    hour pass for    USD  It comes quite frequently and has numerous stops  The Deuce made it very easy to get around the Strip  and also goes to Fremont Street  If you like shopping  the Fashion Show mall is minutes away from Circus Circus  Lots of shops  and eats  but is a little pricey  If you re looking for cheap show tickets  there is a   Price ticket booth in the Food Court  Alternatively  there are some shops beside the Riviera Hotel  e g  Ross  which has great clothes for less  like a cheaper version of T J  Maxx or Winners  The last couple of nights  we upgraded to a West Tower Room  They wanted     night extra  which was contrary to what the Front Desk staff has told us when we first checked in  she said it was     night   but ended up honouring the lower price  The West Tower Rooms are gorgeous     decor was more modern  and has a flat screen TV   and the room definitely felt newer  Overall  a fairly decent stay  The only negative thing I have to report is the faint smell of booze  cigarettes and or vomit when you walk through the common areas  e g   Casino   A turn off  but we really didn t spend that much time at the hotel  Next time though  I think I d prefer to shell out a little more money and stay in a more central location  But if you re on a budget  it s quite satisfactory  Just don t expect too much     the Bellagio it ain t  
P =>   The ups and downs of Circus Circus The negatives     Hidden charge  Each room is charged    per day for phone use  if its used or not  doesnt matter  still    a day     The rep at the Dollar rental desk at the lobby was very unhelpful  Unfortunately  I did not catch his name     He seemed as if I awoke him from a nap  He told me the lowest price he could offer for an economy car was        a day  He said that my Dollar car coupon would not help me  nor would he accept a AAA discount  He was not at all interested in making business or helping me out  The truth is  if he was friendly and nice to me  I probably would have just forked over the     plus tax and rented a car for the two days that I needed it  Lucky for me  I made a smart move by leaving  walking down the street to Budget at the Stratosphere and rented a car for     a day     Second hand smoke all over the place The positives     Nice and cheap family oriented hotel with a lot of people having fun and enjoying their trips     Hotel had some friendly staff  
P =>   What you pay for is what you get I have been to vegas before and love the place it has always been my ambition to return with my wife and family I contacted my travel agent who books all our holidays and he recommended circus circus not for luxury not for glamour for the simple reason the price and childrenThe rooms are clean and spacious we stayed in the tower the beds were changed every day and the room cleaned we had our two teenage children and my eldest son had the next room with his wife and three year old The children loved the place plenty to do loads of other kids around probally more than normal as we were there during thanksgiving Vegas is not for kids but circus circus is at the end of the day its cheap if you want champagne at beer prices dont bother Some people who have left comments seem to think there staying at a   star hotel if you have kids its great if you are on a budget its great when I visit next time with just my wife I would not stay here but it suited our needs and we were very happy because we were only expecting what we paid for and we got good value for moneyFantastic steakhouse good breakfast buffet and plenty of entertainment for the kids As I have said   star it aint but the rooms are clean if you just want a cheap place to sleep or keep your kids occupied perfect if you want to pay peanuts and rip the place to pieces easy All I can say is we got more than we expected for the price we paid  
P =>   brillant hotel stayed at circus circus hotel for   nights had a brillant stay  there is so much going on in the hotel u would never have to leave  the rooms were clean and spacious  resturants were lovely  i loved everthing about this hotel  i would go back again  
P =>   West Towers Rock  We booked the Circus Circus West Towers directly through their website on an early bird special in  for stay from         We specifically requested a West Tower room as per previous reviews   we were not disappointed    The rooms were clean  spacious  and extremely comfortable  Elevators were fast  never had a wait at all  We had rented a car so we didn t plan to gamble at Circus Circus the majority of the time  Bottom line  the room served it s purpose and we definitely plan on stay here again  
P =>   Incredible Value   Fantastic Room   After doing some research I found a great rate for Circus Circus with the  rd night for free  I had read that the Tower rooms were nicer than the Manor rooms and Wow   This would have to be the nicest room I have stayed in a long time  The room was massive and the bed was great  I would recommend this hotel to anyone  Even though the location is not as central as other hotels the bus that travels along the strip was a very short walk  Great for anyone on a budget   
P =>  Rude at Check in I stayed there for my Wedding night in one of there Jacuzzi suites  The room was fabulous  No problems there  At check in the Shift Manager was very rude and just seemed like she hated her job  She was not once nice or said anything nice  She was very rude  But they did get us checked in after a       min wait in line  The room had a great view  the bed was very comfortable  had a fridge nice new t v  Oh and a few of the jets didn t work in the hot tub  
P =>  Great for the price Nice rooms for the price  lovely buffets and friendly service  While in Las Vegas we really don t spend the whole day sitting in a hotel room  Circus Circus is fine for active people who want to experience the city and see the sights  Our room was clean  nicely decorated and very large  The bus for       a day umlimited use connects all the Strip hotels   so the location is no problem  
P =>  Some Good Mostly Awful We decided to meet up with extended family  each of us with a child under    in Vegas for Thanksgiving  We all decided to stay at CC due to a good package deal we found  All of us stayed in four separate Tower rooms that were one floor away from eachother First  the awful The main problem    the ELEVATORS  Ugh  it was so frustrating to get to our rooms or downstairs when half of them  not exaggerating  were broken  Several times we had to fold up our stroller and carry it and our baby up or down   flights of dumpy emergency stairwells  We were in the newer  nicer wing of the hotel  too When we all decided to go to their pool with the babies  getting there and back was like being lost in Wonderland with Alice  the dark version  not the cute cartoon version   Before we got into an elevator in their manor wing  the old dumpy wing   a staff member informed us that half of those elevators were broken  too  He also said that Fire Rescue had to come and save some kids that were trapped in one earlier that day  The heated pool was too cold  and their large jacuzzi was lukwarm  good for the babies  But it was so salty  I dont even want to think about how much pee was in there  There was a bar but it was closed  Alcohol would have helped the situation On the way back  only two of those elevators were now working   There was never any room in any of the elevators  think of canned sardines   stuffed full of impatient people  just like the wing by our rooms   So once again we went down yet another emergency stairwell  only to find that it takes you completely outside the hotel  and you have to walk all the way around thier parking garage to get back to the main lobby elevators  Which is really  quot fun quot  when you re all wet from the pool  UGHHH The tile floors by all the elevators  and inside them were always sticky disgusting  I dont think that in the four days we stayed that anyone swept or mopped those dirty floors  Gross Don t eat at Mexitalia Express unless you want a sore stomach after waiting    mintues for your  quot fast quot  overpriced yucky food  You re better off going to the McDonalds inside CC or getting a       JUMBO hot dog from their snack bar The casino advertises    blackjack tables  Plural  Weds night  there was ONE    table  packed full all night  The next two nights  there were zero    tables  So we played the    s instead There was a pipe problem going on in our bathroom  Off and on  sometimes for hours  we would be treated to a loud whiiiiiiiiiiine from the creaking pipes that you even can hear from outside our room  Our neighbors were like   quot What is that noise  quot Which reminds me of the VERY thin walls  Combine that with hyper kids up past their bedtime that this hotel is full of  BAD thing for your sleep habits The good The drink service at the video poker bars is very good  The bartenders only comp wells and beers  and maybe wine  so don t expect a Crown n Coke for free  Just tip a buck or so after each free drink and you get a quick refill every time  The buffet was worth the price  although we liked the breakfast buffet much better than the dinner buffet  They both had a moderate selection  The Steak House was impeccably delicious  but was very expensive  The chef overcooked my     petite filet mignon  so I sent it back  and they were very polite about getting me a nice big steak that was done perfectly  Maid service was great  We had rented a crib for our baby  and they even made it up all cute by tucking in her doll under the covers  They mopped the bathroom floors  When I requested extra pillows over the over the phone  they were brought promptly  I feel bad because I realized after we checked out that we forgot to tip them  A few hints I won t stay here again  I would rather pay     per night and stay in a nice hotel  Or even pay the same price and stay in the roach motel that is next door to CC  Its a one story  without elevators  A few tips if you still want to brave this hotel I recommend packing some snacks and a cooler with drinks and sandwich fixings for you and your family  and even bringing instant coffee  and some styrofoam cups  There is no coffee maker  microwave  or fridge in the room  Having a cooler was nice for us so we could give the babies milk when they needed it  The tap water is semi bearable to drink  and gets hot really fast If you dont have a stroller  then take the stairs  it will save you alot of waiting time    even if you have to walk all the way around the outside of Circus Circus  
P =>  Worst customer service look for some other place Booked a room with   double beds and non smoking like more than a month ago  and when we landed there  after waiting for   hours in the line to complete the checkin  the person at front desk says that they don t have a room with double beds  even though I had a confirmation I believe the confirmation only states that I have a booking and I need to accept whatever room they provide  Ridiculous   When mentioned that this type of approach will make them loose customers  the response from her  amp  her supervisor  both were  quot That s fine quot  The rooms are way too old  carpets were full of spots with a weird smell in the room This place is not for adults   find something else more towards the center of the strip  The folks in circus circus have to go through a course in customer service      
P =>   Good Budget Base This hotel has been slated in the forums     when I asked for peoples thoughts on this hotel I was laughed at and told to cancel my trip     CRAZY   This is a large clean well equiped Hotel     its not the newest or glitziest     but for a good budget base on the strip you cant go wrong   It is a very family orientated hotel    with the circus acts and the fairground     so plenty of children around at the weekends  Though it did not bother me at all    the bars and gaming areas are still Adults only     and as the night progresses the children disappear   As we were on a budget    the food in the hotel and around it    unless you went to an expensive restaurant    was pretty much fast food and dinners    not bad    but nothing special  The Hotel is towards the bottom of the strip  by the Sahara     but it is a nice walk to the main strip area with all the big hotels and attractions    although if it is as hot as it was when I was there    I would get the deuce    The cheap and quick bus that opperates up and down the strip   The pool area was clean and a nice place to relax in the sun  the rooms were large  clean and with all the ammenities you need All in all a good place to stay on a budget    or with the kids    I loved my time in Las vegas    although if I had the money    I would stay in the large expensive hotels     One day     
P =>   You get what you pay for I experienced the same as many prior reviewers  The property is in satisfactory condition  not run down or demolition worthy  but not a place where I would take my family or a date  It s like a review I wrote for Gold Strike in Jean  NV  it s that kind of property  For     a night  you get what you pay for  The elevators had trash strewn on the floor of the cab  and there was graffiti etched liberally around the interior  The rooms weren t bad  about what you d get for a Best Western  did have a flat screen TV  and was clean  I ll give them that  Its location is good  north center strip  and casino had adequate gaming  The employees  however  were overall very accommodating and efficient  Check in was a snap  as was check out  I left late in the night  so checked out in person at the desk  and Donald was very efficient and personable  I ate at the Steakhouse  if you haven t eaten there  give it a try  Despite its location  it is top flight In a nutshell  if you need a centrally located home base in Las Vegas and don t mind minimal surroundings  this is adequate  But if you re looking to impress a date or want opulence  this may not be your best choice  
P =>   Good value and efficient service We booked and pre paid for Circus Circus as a family and were therefore a little surprised to be asked at check in for a further dollar a day for the telephone in our room  This would give us free local calls for the duration of our stay  but how many local calls a day does the average tourist make while in the hotel  As others have said the hotel is looking tired but the tower room we had was large and well insulated from any noise in neighbouring rooms  The air conditioning however was also of a past era and was noisy on all settings except offThe food in the hotel was also good value and family friendly  The only real down side to staying here is outside the control of the owners  The Sands Hotel which was between Circus Circus and the heart of the strip is now just a bare building site  This makes the walk to the heart of the strip feel further and the sidewalk is covered in an unbelievable amount of litter  composed of pictures of naked women and the services they provide  I would be happy to stay there again for the comfy beds and rooms but would be tempted by a more central location Sta sman  Essex 
P =>   Good value for money We stayed in Circus Circus for three nights before flying to San Diego for a cruise  Having read some of the reviews on TripAdvisor we were a bit worried  but we needn t have been  Yes the hotel is looking a bit tired  but we had a tower room and it was fine  The bathroom looked as if it had been renovated and was clean  as was the rest of the room  The bed was large and comfortable and the room was big by UK standards  Our only gripe was that there was no tea coffee making equipment in the room  However that was not really a problem as there was a    hour Krispy Kreme concession on the ground floor just across the corridor from our nearest lift  so I could get our morning hot drink there We had no problems checking in  or out  and didn t have to queue as other people said they did The breakfast buffet  at        a head  was good value and the food was fine  We had dinner there too the first night which was very little dearer      I think    but that wasn t so good We also had a meal in The Garden Room which was fine and reasonably priced Circus Circus is huge and it did take us a while to find our way around it   and all the slot machines were a bit of a shock  but no different from any other hotel in Vegas  There is a pool  tho  it takes a bit of finding   again it was fine The main problem with the hotel is that is is actually quite a long way from the centre of the strip   we were also offered Excalibur  and that would have been a better choice as it s much nearer where all the action is  We took the mono rail  which is a short walk from Circus Circus  to the top end at MGM and walked all the way back   a good long hike  
P =>  loved circus circus we stayed in november this year only two weeks ago  we had a ball  ok it needs a refurb but the atmosphere is fabulous and the food was fantastic  we loved it and will go back  asap  the jones and roberts manchester england 
P =>   Kids love it not so much adults We came here for my   th  The idea is great  but the hotel needs some work  We were  quot upgraded quot  to the West tower for free  The room was nice  but the beds were way too soft and springy   not good on back and necks  Also  we had some blue stuff on the outside of our tub I found after taking a shower  I moved the curtain over to leave showing for maid  It was still there after they came  I called the desk and a maid and her supervisor came up  I wasn t mad  just a little grossed out wondering how long it had been there  We also had neighbors who partied all night and finally at      am I called front desk and they sent up security and they quieted down  The next night their alarm was going off so I called down and security came up again and turned it off  Unfortunately he only hit the snooze button  I was impressed by their response to both instances The free shows were okay  The unicylcist was good and so were the   Vladimirs  The clowns needed help  They had  quot talent quot  but no character  We ate at the Garden Grill once  it was average  We asked the front desk if the restaruants were good and they said not really  McDonalds   on  nd floor  was good and had normal prices  which is great for a cheap meal   cheap meals are hard to find in Vegas  Next time I would stay further down the strip at the Bellagio or Mandalay  Take the Deuce bus if you come here  it is    for all day pass  
P =>   great for kids   not for us   went to vegas for four days and stayed at circus circus  a bit outdated the hotel plenty of kids there has me and my husband would of preferednto of gone to the bellagio    never mind we went for my   th birthday the staff on reception asked us if we wanted to upgrade on our last night for my birthday but it was a bit too late  the casino had a lot of kids roaming about with pushchairs  pay a bit more and stay at the other hotels down the strip  
P =>   Great Value Good for Kids We had a great   night stay over Veteran s Day  Couldn t beat the price       total for   nights  Booked the West Tower renovated room  don t book anything less   Nice room  definitely great for the price  Check in line was terrible but noticed a sign  after a few minutes  that said         NOWAIT  Called and was checked in over the phone  walked right up to the counter and received my key in less than   minutes  By passed a HUGE line  West Tower is easy access to valet area but a bit farther to the strip  Great place to stay if you have kids with you  We spent the day at the Adventure Dome with the kids and also visited the Midway for games and entertainment  Carnival games are only    to play and with   players you receive a prize  The kids had a great time  Krispy Kreme donughts on site as well as a clean  well run McDonalds in the Midway  Housekeeping did an excellent job  always tip the maid   Don t expect the Bellagio but if you go in with a reasonable mind set you will enjoy your stay  
P =>  fab I stayed at the circus circus hotel as we had a   year old with us from that point of view it was a great hotel for facilities although it is    yrs old this year the hotel definately needs a refurb At the other end of the strip a bit further out but we didnt find this a problem as we jumped straight into a cab and it was very reasonable A very safe and busy destination with lots to do for both couples and families  
P => pleasantly surprised circus circus las vegas  Great time  We have recently returned from Vegas and I was very anxious about this hotel after reading some of the reports  On arrival we were allocated a free upgrade to a room in the West Tower which overlooked the strip  The room contained   double beds a huge tele and a very clean bathroom  Extra coathangers were delivered in mintues and the service we received whilst there was amazing  The deuce bus which stops outside this hotel was a lifesaver as you can use it for    hours for   dollars  You certainly get your moneys worth as The Strip is   miles long  If you want to waste your money stay at one of the fancy hotels further down the strip where you will pay at least double the price for every thing  We cannot commend the staff at this hotel enough and would return here again without trepidation  
P =>  Circus Schmircus   no thanks This hotel was recommended by my travel agent and boy is she in some trouble when I get to see her  Like the previous reviewer I have to say it is a DUMP with a capital  quot D quot   I paid over the odds for this place as well  I found out that the rates are much much cheaper with lots ot travel packages    but well you live and learn   So after lining up to check in for at least a half an hour I was given a room in the Skyline Tower that was just awful  I took one look at the bed and went  quot no way quot   I was able to upgrade   at     per night  where was the    a night upgrade one reviewer mentioned    to a room with a pillow top bed in the West Tower  It still was a very basic room   no door on the wardrobe  which couldnt really be called a wardrobe   just a hanging space   but there was only   coat hangers which made things a bit difficult   Very basic bathroom and toiletries very average  Trying to call down to reception was a nightmare   go through the choosing of numbers and then get put on hold for ages They slug you    a day  mandatory  for unlimited local calls  of which I made none  and then the     a day for the upgrade  I had a fax come through that I had to pay    per page for and then of course there was the        a day Internet charge  I was not a happy camper at all  On top of all my woes  the walls were so thin I could hear the family next door quite clearly and it was very annoying when they came in late at night and woke me up and then of course they woke me up in the early morning too  After   days that family moved out and then even noiser peope moved in  I just HATED being here The hotel is really too far away from the main hustle and bustle and you really need to take a cab to get anywhere  I totally believe the best kindness anyone can do to this place is bulldoze it down and start again  
P =>  Grteat Time at Circus Circus This was our  th visit to Vegas but our first time staying at Circus Circus  Previously we stayed at Stardust  twice but now demolished   Key Largo  now closed  and Barbary Coast  now name changed   Enjoyed every minute of Circus Circus  The room in the Skyrise Tower was very comfortable  Check in and out was very smooth  When checking in asked for a room with a view of the Strip but the receptionist said there weren t any available however when we got into the room it had about the best view of the strip you could get from Circus Circus All the staff were friendly  Did have a car and managed to get out and about  Went to a lovely little vineyard at Pahrump and out the Henderson and Red Rock Canyon as well as plenty of walking  The Duece day pass is excellent value and it lasts    hours not just for the day you buy it Travelled for the first time with US Airways from Manchester UK via Philadelphia and the flights were all excellent  In fact I think they were the best transatlantic flights we have taken  After all the negative comments about US Airways was very pleasantly surprised  
P =>  A real circus Big big big hotel  The hotel has everything  a circus  a horror dome  an adventure dome  restaurants  shops  a swimming pool and of course casino s  Our room was very spacious with two large beds and a large bathroom  Everything was clean and although lots of rooms were occupied during our stay  we never heard our neighbours  The hotel is situated at the beginning of The Strip so it takes a walk to get to the other casion and hotel attractions at The Strip  But then you can always take a taxi  
P =>   Viva Circus Circus  Just back from a visit to Las Vegas Baby  Had a brilliant time and stayed at the Circus Circus  we had read some reviews warning us that there would be wall to wall children   not the case  There were certainly some kids there but no more that any other hotel we visited  we managed to get to the pool for a few hours a couple of days and the most kids in the pool at any of those times were    There are   pools  the one that doesnt have the bar was by far better  much quieter than the other and we walked round to the bar to get a drink in about   minute  there is also a nice jacuzzi too  The rooms were spacious  huge bathroom too  really clean too  Very confortable  The hotel itself is absolutely vast  it took us    minutes from the front entrance to get to our room  we got offered an upgrade to a west tower room for   dollars a night  take it if offered  we wished we had  it will cut your walk to your room in half  and the rooms there have just been re done Lots of nice places to get something to eat in the hotel too  we ate breakfast everyday in the bagels and barista  lots of choice  cereals  fresh fruit  beautiful bagels and cream cheese  about    diffterent kinds of bagels  croissants  muffins  sandwiches  really fresh  We also ate in the Garden Grill  good steak  italian food at reasonable prices  You can get a pitcher of frozen margarita for    dollars here  lovely  If you just want a quick snack  I recommend the Westside Deli  in the casino area where you get a giant footlong hotdog for       Just outside the hotel there is subway and mcdonalds too  You can catch the Duece bus right outside the hotel too  which will take you up and down the strip all day for   dollars  great to hop on and off of  You can also catch the Duece bus right along the other end of the strip to the factory outlets  great bargains there  Timberland  Converse  Adidas  Nike  Osh Kosh etc  Also  catch the Bellagio fountains  Brilliant   Lastly  Have a great time  
P =>   Good fun A nice Hotel  It must have been ok as my Wife and I got married in the hotel wedding chapel  We had a room in the apparently refurbished West Tower which was spacious  clean and comfortable  The hotel is situated at one end of the strip  so is ideally placed to venture out into Vegas  Parking is excellent  valet parking is technically free  although staff work for the tips   staff were helpful and cheerful  There is a large amount of restaurants bars etc so food is never an issue  aside from the Casino there is a good amusement arcade  regular circus acts  a selection of shops  which are slightly pricey  and the indoor theme park complete with roller coasters  haunted house etc I can definately reccommend the wedding chapel   a wonderful ceremony  very romantic and professional in a lovely setting  The staff were very friendly although they will try and rip you off shamelessly when it comes to buying photos of the wedding The price of rooms is also extremely good   ours was around     a night inc taxes  which is spectacular value considering we paid double that for a bog standard comfort inn place a few days before The only issue we had was that the hotel was extremely busy  particularly in the lobby meaning sometimes a    minute wait for a lift and long lines at the buffet and you do get pestered slightly walking to the exits by the shop stall owners trying to sell you things Highly recommended  
P =>   What a Surprise  Fabulous place to stay  Had a   night stay recently in   adjoining rooms in the Skyrise Tower  Mum  amp  Dad in one room and   teenage kids in the other Read a lot of ordinary reviews and wasn t sure what to expect  Must be a lot of grumpy and fussy people out there  it was absolutely fine  Not the newest hotel in Vegas but the rooms were clean  the showers worked fine and I slept like a log so nothing wrong with the beds  Great places to eat  lots of souvenir shops and the Midway circus and games area was great for the kids  If you want   star go somewhere else but we thought it was great 
P =>   Will never stay here again Horrible Hotel  Till the end of       it not even on the Strip because there is a huge construction between Circus Circus and the main part of the Strip  so you need to drive anyway  The hotel itself is a joke  it s gloomy  stinky and does not have any  quot happy las vegas feel quot  whatsoever  I brought my in laws there  and was very ashamed once we steped into the lobby  If you want to save some money   stay out of the Strip  For the same rate you can find much better deals  If you want to be on the Strip   stay in between Treasure Island and Bellagio  this is the only wlkable part now   but the prices are biting    
P => 	Another Good Stay   My wife and I decided to take a    hour getaway trip to Las Vegas  We live in Phoenix so Vegas is only a   hour drive for us We Stayed ober   th   th       This time around we had our little man join us for the very first time but he is only   months old too though  hehehe Our cousin  her husband and two little girls only live about    minutes from the strip so not only did we get to enjoy the hotel we got to visit with them and they even watched our little man overnight so my wife could have the night off and enjoy her self gambling  drinking and etc The trip this time to Circus Circus was much of the same  Everytime we are in Vegas we stay at Circus Circus  The midway is fun and this time I was able to win stuffed animals for my son which was cool  You know how it is for first time parents  We stayed in the West Tower   Refurbished   it had a very comfortable pillow top bed     inch flat screen TV and new furnishing  We were on their highest floor which is    stories The room was nice and cool and we had a great view  The carpet is very worn in many areas though  We also enjoyed the whirlpool bath  however  we didn t get to enjoy it in our room as the jets were not working We called to get it fix but they couldn t so they moved us to the   th floor with the whirlpool inside  However  as soon as we walked in it reeked of cigarette smoke   We Are Non Smokers   we immediately went back to the front desk and asked for another room This time they gave us a room on the   th floor with the whirlpool bath and it smelled of smoke but it was doable as it only reeked a little in the bathroom but not in the sleeping area at all The previous guests obviously smoked in the bathroom because they placed a wash cloth in the air vent to eliminate the smoke from traveling through out the non smoking   th floor This was clearly not the hotel s fault so we settled in the room and enjoyed our oversized whirlpool bath  comfortable bed and    inch flat screen tv but acourse this was after we enjoyed our evening of gambling  shows and drinking etc We have stayed at Circus Circus many times before so we know what to expect and although the hotel doesn t have the best reputation its really not that bad for the rate that we paid of     per night which included the     upgrade for the whirlpool bath The hotel is great for families and for gamblers who want to gamble on the cheap  Circus Circus and Slots Of Fun next door meets those needs If you have a family or you just want to enjoy Vegas on the cheap give Circus Circus a try its not that bad of a hotel  Casino Cafe has great food  the buffett has decent food and lots to choose from  You can t go wrong here  If you want luxury skip Circus but if you are regular and just want to have fun choose Circus SPECIAL NOTE If you are a smoker please don t smoke in the room  Go downstairs and smoke in the casino or outside  The weather is great in Las Vegas right now Be considerate of others  Thank God my son was at my cousin s house when we were room hopping Remember  you can always ask for a smoking room there s no extra charge  Anyways  thank you and enjoy your trip to Las Vegas  I will have Photo s Posted in a few weeks as we are going back to Vegas and stayin in Circus Cirucs again   
P =>   Remember you get what you pay for We got a cheap deal and noted the reviews so expected what you should expect for an older    hotel on The Strip  Our original room was not what we paid for as we did upgrade in an attempt to get one of their refurbished rooms in the West Tower  The older rooms and corridors have a musty smell and look very tired  I wouldn t want to stay in this part of the hotel  Staff immediately changed our room without any bother and we got a much nicer room only to find it had an adjorning door to another room with nightmare neighbours arguing through the night  In the morning without any fuss staff at reception  in particular Trina who should be noted for her helpfulness  reserved possibly one of the best rooms in the hotel for us  For the rest of the stay we were very satisfied  While a    hotel the room must of bordered on    if it weren t for a few little things  It is a hotel for families and much of the facilities were based on that theme but what we saw of them looked good and quite updated  If you want a romantic break   spend the money and go elsewhere  Like some areas of the hotel  the swimming pool needed some work  While the pools seemed clean the surrounding areas were not very attractive  Perhaps some plants and trees would look nice  At the end of the day  if you make sure you get a refurbished room in the West Tower then it is a quite adequate hotel  The Deuce bus stop is outside and takes you downtown or to the central area of The Strip and the posher hotels  Being that you can simply walk in and out the other hotels and there is so much to do  you need only sleep in your own hotel  Overall we had a great time in Vegas and while I would not stay in Circus Circus again prefering to go more upmarket  of course you would have to pay more  it did not mean our trip was any less enjoyable  
P =>  The best place for the kids This hotel is the best for kids  Didn t like the casino  Some parts of the hotel the carpet stinks  from six elevetor only   worked  The buffet  Breakfast        was worth it  There is no discount for kids  Dinner we ate at the Paris Hotel        Buffet  recomeded  also there is fast food at Venitian  chines Burgers etc   Planet Hollywood have restaurants like sbaro  and Italian cusine cheap for     per person for full meal  
P =>  Stay away  We stayed at Circus Circus in the Skyrise tower room with a  quot view quot     th floor   The beds are very uncomfortable and housekeeping didn t clean our room  When we got back to our room around      pm I called housekeeping to come and clean the room and they never showed up  We stayed here in      and what a big difference  
P =>  great for families stayed there for a few days this sep the standards isn t up yo ceasers or bellagio  etc  but then again it doesn t claim to be  if you are taking the kids to vegas  this is the place to stay  i found the staff very helpful  the room was clean and tidy  and the meals acceptable  not many faults really  
P =>   Yuck  You get what you pay for  so all we got was a basic blah    queen bed room with clean sheets and towels  I wish we had spent a little more on a different place because this hotel casino  has seen better days  It has become downright seedy  has NO redeeming ambiance  the carpeting is filthy  and there are NO coffee pots in the rooms Thanks to trip advisor I read about the bus stop being out in front   We wouldn t have been able to enjoy the strip without them    the busses were nicer and cleaner than the hotel  However  if you stay here be prepared to walk A LOT  Check in didn t take long  but the person who checked us in  whose initials are MGM  told us our room was a suite  it wasn t  and that we d have a lovely view of the strip  it actually looked over a roof top and the construction going on down the street   The baby next door didn t cry all night and our room didn t smell bad like some other areas of this property did  Like all the casinos on the strip  the drinks at the slot machines and tables are gratis The cafeteria style breakfast was OK  but we didn t want to eat there again  Next time  I ll spend more money and will stay in a centrally located  newer  nicer place  
P =>   Pretty ent for your money    I arrived and got lost trying to find our room  This place is huge  I still never made it through the entire hotel  I figure for the price and the fact that I only slept there  it s a very good deal  You can walk to the center of the strip where all the excitement is  very long walk if you re not in shape   Or you can catch the Deuce  A double decker bus that runs    hours a day  A one way trip will cost you     A    hour pass is only     Better Deal   The busses can get a little crowded and at night they will seem to take forever  If this happens  no bother  just take a cab Anyway  back to the hotel  The food at the Casino Cafe is awesome  Huge portions  One order of something will probably feed   to   people  It can get a lil smoky because it s connected to the casino and people are allowed to smoke in the casino  So  don t get seated near the door of the restaurant  There s a     shop that has lovely jewelry and another one that has very nice souvenir gifts  I wanted to go to the store called  quot LYCNS PL S quot  or something like that  I never got around to going back  
P =>   Good Value Circus Circus is located towards the end of the strip  A bus stop is right outside so you can travel the Deuce bus regularly The hotel itself is really good for children  having a circus inside  hence the name  and it has a fairground also  It is really good to keep the children occupied The buffet restaurant is good value for money   all you can eat and drink for a set price  Can be a bit repetitive  but try to vary your choice each day The rooms are spacious   however no fridge in our room which would have been beneficial as the weather was very hot and fluids definately required  The air conditioning is great though Like most hotels  the casino is good and drinks regularly supplied  remember to tip the waitress Would definately go back here again as good value and although at the end of the strip  it is worth paying approx      less than other hotels  
P =>   Good for what you pay Circus Circus was just what id expected  I booked a West Tower Room which was newly decorated  and it was perfect for what we needed  it was clean  maid came everyday and got clean towels  and fresh linen whenever we wanted   There was no sound out of the air con  the bathroom was clean  and there was a    quot  flat screen tv   Safe was free to use   There was no kids in the hotel  but that is probably due to the time of year  Check in took   mins  tho it was  am  and check out took   mins  it was  am   The Duece bus stops right out side the hotel and takes u up the strip for    for a    hour ticket   I would stay in the hotel again  just wouldn t eat in it  GROSS     
P =>   bargain we arrived at circus circus not expecting a lot and it was actually quite nice  front desk staff was extremly friendly and helpful room was big with two massive beds  a nice bathroom and very clean the buffet in the evening wasnt great but ok   nothing special but than again for     okay   the gambling there is perfect for young people and travellers as it is really really cheap and affortable no pool unfortunatly for that price   an absolut bargain    
P =>   Cheap and adequate Didn t book  just called at reception and got clean  quiet  comfortable room with   queens for     a night  Incredible value for money  
P =>   Fear and Loathing in Circus Circus We stayed here on our first trip to Las Vegas  It was my choice being a Hunter S Thompson fan I wanted to stay in the hotel featured in the novel Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas  Let me start by saying the rooms are huge    but that s about all that is good about it  Checking in took at least an hour  Front desk staff were hopeless  When we did finally get to our room it stank  Changing rooms took another hour and we were allocated a less stinky room  We got used to the smell after a few days  The bed was hard and uncomfortable  We were there for ten days and I think housekeeping only changed our sheets and made up our room for four of those days  We had to physically chase them down for clean towels as contacting the front desk got us nowhere  The safe was broken and the air conditioner was very old and didn t work well  Very noisy day and night  Lots of comings and goings at all times of the night  Thin walls    I was kept awake by the man in the room next door snoring one night  Lots of ladies that you see on those cards they hand out on The Strip frequenting the hallways  We took another trip to Las Vegas tember    and we didn t venture down that end of The Strip  Our Circus Circus stay was    months ago so they may have had some sort of refurbishment or upgrade since then  Even so I wouldn t stay there again    too far away from amenities  They didn t even have a Starbucks  
P =>   Whats Happened Here    Well I have to say I was a little disappointed this time round  I have been to Vegas twice before and stayed at Circus Circus twice before  so I knew exactly what to expect   value for money  Yes its cheaper that all the other hotels and at the end of the strip  but we liked this  Recently renovated I can say nothing negative about the accommodation   room was clean  fresh  large  much more than value for money  Its the very unfriendly and unhelpfulness of the staff that would probably deter me from staying here again  It doesn t bother me that it is full of families at peak season  the great part about staying here is you sleep here then head off for the day     but I just can t stand rude staff and a no can do attitude     Not much more to say than great value for money as long as you don t need ANY help at all from the staff and lets be honest everyone has a question to ask the concierge at one point during your stay  I think this hotel has got too big for its boots and management may want to look at putting their staff on some customer service training 
P =>  Great Bed  Pool area needs work I loved my king size bed in my room and  wish Icould have bought it home  Shower pressure wasthe greatest in any hotel that I have ever had Room was clean  The only problem with the roomwas the air conditioning was a little loud and manynoise  I would stay at this hotel again if I was notplanning to use the pool  The lifeguards did nothingand were text messaging there friends  If you arewanting a pool area that lifeguards enforce therules  this hotel is not for you  But  if you are notgoing to swim  I would stay there again too  
P =>   viva las vegas after reading some reviews i was worried about staying in the circus circus  but i have to say i had an awesome stay  i guess with any hotels you have good and bad experiences  as you will have at any place whether it be a clothing store  restaurant etc  check in was very fast and it has a completely different entrance from the casino which was nice  it was at the end of the strip but really the strip is not that big   when i got to the room i was very impressed it was very big and clean and modern with a huge bathroom and a nice flat screen TV  i would suggest staying in the reno d tower if you want to have the same experience  i believe that the rooms in that tower are        more a night  a worthwhile investment  They had   pools and unlike some of the reviews that i have read  the pool was in a good location  hard to get at  but it was big with alot of reclining chairs  a pool bar  life guards  and a pool attendant  they had an average buffet that was really big with a huge selection  would suggest it for breakfast and lunch but definatley go to a nice restaurant along the strip for a nice sit down meal  personally i went to the hafbrauhaus which was a very unique german beer hall style restaurant which had really nice food good service and good entertainment  the next morning we went to the grand canyon and had to check out of the hotel  we were able to leave our bags at the bell desk  and at the end of the night we went back to the hotel  and they made out transportion arrangements back to the airport  defiantely a good place for a nice weekend getaway would definately stay there again  
P => Bad location and nightlife Stayed summer       found the location not best suited to singles and parties looking to enjoy the nightlife of Vegas  Also the hotel itself does not contain much in the way of bars  and would be best suited to families  Even the restaurants are closed for large parts of the day  Staying here will result in lots of walking elsewhere  or waiting for buses  
P =>  You get what you pay for    I stayed at Circus Circus  arriving on y    and left on ust  th  I ll start with the positive notes    Bedding and towels were clean    The room was cheap    The breakfast buffet was the best on the strip    The Duece basically stops right in front of the Casino    Nice variety of games including slots  poker and gambling available    Loved the half price ticket booth near the registration desk and the staff there was WONDERFUL Here are the negatives    The room was cheap because it was part of the  quot manor quot  rooms  which is   blocks  behind  the casino    The bathroom floor had tiny cuts and lacerations in the linoleum  The wallpaper had some discoloration  The bathtub backed up after being in the shower for more than   minutes    Waiting   hours in line for registration is outrageous  Registration opened at      pm and I came back around     pm  Even if I had come back around       pm  the line was STILL a   hour wait    The casino is on the Northern part of the strip  It s so far away from everything else  Since they got rid of the Stardust  there are only   casinos nearby   the Riviera  across the street   amp  Slots o Fun    Getting on the Duece was hellish at times  It was always packed with riders going southbound on the strip    KIDS KIDS EVERYWHERE KIDS          They were running around  without parental supervision  acting like hooligans  and no one is around to make sure they are behaving  They have to walk on the casino floor to get to the Midway Area where the circus acts perform  I was hoping to go into a casino to get AWAY from the children    Even though there are   pools  trying to get a chair near the pool is impossible  Circus Circus is an older casino and they have tried to make some renovations to update it  You honestly get what you pay for here and if you don t like children  this is  not  the place for you  I will never stay here again  
P =>  Don t believe the hype This is for people like me who have booked Circus Circus and then read the horrible reviews Stayed from       to       which was Labo u r Day weekend and so VERY busy  Lots of children so when walking through the hotel go through the gambling areas where they are not allowed Longish line at check in but didn t take too long  Staff extremely polite and helpful Stayed in the West tower and the room was perfect Food is OK  Denny s is just down the road so I would say have breakfast there There is no doubt that the old girl could do with a lick of paint but if you ve saved your money by staying here then go and gamble in the Wynn which is       minutes walk away  Beautiful hotel  Try the champagne Sunday brunch  You won t want to eat again for a week All in all a very enjoyable stay  Very difficult to fault  
P => BIG DISAPPOINTMENT My Husband and I stayed here     th thru   st       We were a little deceived by the lobby  which was nice and the shops restaurants which were also nice  But when it came to the actual rooms  it was a big disappointment  There were cigarette burns on the Bedspread  which you could see was also very old by the visible fading  The first night  we had holes in our Sheets  and the  nd night  there were tears in our sheets  At least they changed them  but that wasn t saying much  The TV was very small and only had stations with old episodes of TV shows  no premium TV  unless you paid for it  Even a Motel    gives you HBO  Aside from the room issues  about   the elevators were down which caused people to have to take the stairs down on our last day  We were on floor     My husband also  had gotten his leg caught in one of the elevators when it didn t automatically open when it  should  sense that someone or something is still in between the doors  A young girl had actually gotten her arm caught the previous day  When told about the problem  the only asked if my husband was hurt but didn t ask which elevator it was  as if they didn t care to fix it  Unless you re looking for Motel quality  I would not recommend anyone staying here  It s actually worth paying a little bit more per night to stay in the middle of the strip at a decent hotel  The shops restaurants do not compare to the poor quality of the rooms  I WOULD NOT STAY HERE AGAIN  
P =>   Too far from strip  We have just returned from Vegas  weather fabulous  sights eye popping  we will go back next year We stayed at the CIRCUS CIRCUS HOTEL  on advice from our travel agent  we where told that it was a central location to all the activities and attractions         boy where we mislead The hotel is at the end of the strip  the wrong end  too far away from the hustle and bustle  we had to pay    dollars in a taxi to get to MGM  LUXOR ETC  So most days we paid    dollars on taxis alone The hotel is one of the oldest on the strip  and by the smell  id believe it  The staff where lovely  no complaints there  room was clean and basic  only thing with the room is  to use the safety deposit box  you have to put   c into it everytime you open it  Got a bit annoying The pool is tiny  maybe  ft by  ft  not good for a hoiday resort The buffet made us ill  we tried it one day and i was on the loo and he was vomiting  so we gave it a go   days later  and we both where on the loo  our taxi driver told us  that most tourists who end up in the hospital are from Circus Circus OMG I did see approx   ambulances daily leaving the hotel So if its a cheap room you want  go there  if its location  food  sunbathing  shopping  stay in Mandalay  MGM  Ceasers  New york new york or venitian for pure luxury  Also for a fab spa    go to Wynn hotel  
P =>  It s ok   since we are only here for a short time We ve been traveling through the southwest for the past   weeks and are ending our vacation here before flying back home  This hotel is definitely on the dowdy side  The clock radio is stuck to the bedstand is totally gutted  like a car up on blocks   The elevator to the pool is almost scary and there is a general beat up feel to the place  However the space for the room and bathroom is generous enough and we got this place for its price and location on the north end of the strip  we re in the Skyrise Tower   rd floor  not a great view   If I ever find myself in Las Vegas  I ll try a different casino hotel for more money  
P =>   What a tired hotel We ve been here in the past but we couldn t believe it  It really looks worn outWe were in room       thats the   th floor of the newest tower  The hall carpeting is so worn there is hardly a design left  We were pleased to see this beautiful looking room  but      little did we know  The mattresses are so soft  you actually slide off the edges  but    The worse part is the bathroom  our sink had such loose faucets  my hubby said he was surprised it didn t blow off  The shower head leaked all directions and we never were able to shut off the water completely But first of all  when we arrived  I noticed no handtowels so called housekeeping and a gal came up and gave us a pile of washcloths and said they were  quot all out quot  of hand towels  Wonder what they did for the pile of people checking in after us  If this was the best tower  imagine what you get in the worst one We didn t try the restaurents  this is a casino but its probably one of the best stops for kids  cuz they were everywhere  screaming and running and bus loads of tourists with luggage piled everywhere  taking up the lobby and halls  Just general noise and confusion  Not a place for anyone wanting just a  quot nice quot  place to stay  
P =>   circus circus we were worried about staying here after reading some dodgy reviews but we had an amazing time check in quick  rooms easy to find  we had booked   together and they were all within   rooms of each other our teens absolutely loved it  big rooms  lovely bathroom and clean  it is on the strip  a bit of a walk away from the new york new york end but all the hotel carparks are free so do what we did and drive to that end  it can get a bit hot to walk at times  saying that though treasure island and mirage are nearly next door  make sure you fit in the free shows on at the front of the hotels  the fountains at bellagio are breath taking would definitely recommend this hotel to families  especially teens  the one thing we did find shocking is the amount of wee little kids up at   in the morning  there are some dodgy sights late evening up and down the strip and it felt uncomfortable at times walking around with my   teens  they enjoyed it though don t do what we did and get lost in the venetian  it is like a small city in each of these hotels  we walked in to watch the gondolas and after an hour of walking ended up coming out of another hotel pretty much where we started   also make sure you visit the cheesecake factory in caesars palace  fantastic  but beware if you order appetizers as they don t do small portions   
P =>   STAY ON THE STRIP FOR AN OFF STRIP PRICE  Went to Vegas for nine days in y   arrived for crazeee y  th  Having said that checking in was easy and our room was large and clean  The hotel is geared for families and unlike most of the other hotels on the strip there are kids everywhere  During our stay some teenagers moved in to the room next door and were very noisy and quite intimidating   the hotel security and help desk were fantastic we changed rooms within an hour to a quiet and much larger room  Circus Circus may be old and not have the finnesse of the newer resort hotels but it has everything that you need   in fact if you didnt want to leave for a week you really wouldnt have to there are loads of restaurants from fast food to a plush expensive steak house  The pool area is across a walkway behind the hotel and has two good sized pools and a bar and snack bar   good for a chill out   it was   degrees so we only stayed at poolside for a couple of hours each day  Vegas is just fab and i will DEFINITELY be back   
P => 
P =>  Great bargain The room was nice an clean and right on the money  On the end of the strip  but still a good place to start your sightseeing  
P =>   Terrible hotel very poor customer service Me and my girlfriend stayed at this hotel for a   night stop over  we found checking in was a nightmare  staff were very rude  they put us in the manor rooms which I would describe as a motel based across the road from the hotel  the rooms were very clean  the only positve thing I can put  The hotel is based for families but could do with an extreme make over  If you are looking at this hotel because of the cheap value  I would recomend paying a bit more and staying at the MGM  
P =>  It s a Circus Circus all right   in all the wrong ways  I booked at Circus Circus because of the price and the fact that the Manor rooms included a refrigerator for no extra charge  The absence of a  quot resort fee quot  was nice as well  This place served its purpose as a place to sleep  store our luggage  amp  rest when not out on the Strip  The down side is that the beds are not all that comfortable and the TV service is minimal  so don t expect to watch more than news or TBS  There are movies  adult  amp  otherwise  I believe   but I didn t watch any of that  so I m not sure what they cost Another problem was that I requested a non smoking room and I believe that my room  while not designated either way  was originally a smoking room  since it had a distinct smoke smell to it  It was an immediate turnoff  but as there was no ashtray  I can t say if the smoking was done on the sly or if the room was designated as  quot non smoking quot  and then not properly cleaned  It wasn t enough of a problem to complain about  When I arrived  there was no refrigerator in the room  despite  quot all quot  manor rooms having them according to advertisement   My husband called the front desk and one was sent over fairly quickly  so no problems there  They did have to pull it out of another room  though  so I have a feeling that they are short on fridges The actual casino and surrounding property  including the main tower  restaurants and the like  is VERY crowded at all times of the day and night  You are forced to walk through a mall like shopping area on the way to the manor rooms or walk through reception and around the property  The salespeople are very pushy and frequently try to ask you questions or sell you stuff  even when you are dragging luggage and obviously checking out of the hotel  This creates a traffic jam and a lot of delays when trying to move through the hotel  The circus acts are cute  but the bleacher style seating area is cramped and made of hard plastic  It doesn t make you feel very comfortable  the area is small  so most times when you are interested in watching the show  there is no place to sit anyway I feel that this place might be a good place for parents with kids due to the Adventuredome area and to a lesser degree  the midway and the circus acts  but for childless people in their   s  this place was too tacky and hectic for our taste  Once in the room it was okay  but there are other places to stay for a similiar price that wouldn t be a zoo  If price is a concern  try downtown or a property off the strip  The bus service is fairly good in Las Vegas and some  like the Orleans  have shuttles  I definitely won t be back and honestly  I think this Circus is on its last legs  To think the owners are the same as the Mandalay Bay is a bit shocking  
P =>  Great value We were pleasantly surprised with the Manor Motor Lodge  It s a huge room  clean  bath room is great  slightly noisy between rooms  But a great value at     night  We weren t here to gamble  just passing through and needed a place for the night  
P =>   Good family fun My wife and I stayed here on the  th y w e  Temp reached   c so the a c and swimming pools were great  Not in a central part of  The Strip  but the bus out the front of the casino was great for getting around  a c d too    The rooms were dated  walls between rooms are paper thin  could here conversations from next room    but comfortable and clean  WiFi was available but at a cost and a bit pricey  Great restaurant choices within the casino  A good choice to stay if you are a family with children  Regular circus acts  a huge double story indoor amusement centre  rides  clowns  etc  Probably wouldn t stay here again but definately a good choice for the budget concious and young family  
P =>   I ll Never Stay Here Again Stayed here for two nights in e  The  quot manors quot  are back behind the actual casino and hotel  Walking back there at night was a scary experience  The rooms themselves were in terrible condition    bad beds  carpet stains  missing fixtures  etc  In addition  the Circus Circus is so far away from everything  that you are much better off just spending an extra     or so a night and staying some place nicer and further down the strip  Just getting to the hotel from the manors is a walk  I will never stay there again  
P =>   Far old outdated  First let me say that Circus Circus is on the Vegas Strip but far from the  quot real Strip quot  action  So you either have a rental car or be prepared to wait long for the bus or walk long distances to everywhere  There is a whole block under construction that is scarry to walk at night We stayed on the Manor motel section as it was cheaper  and yes  it was cheap  you get what you paid for   and less  We had the kids with us and thought that Circus Circus would be a good location for  family oriented quot  attractions  The adventurdome   ndoor amusement park on premises  is somewhat OK  however  it is starting to show some evidence of aging and the same neglect you see in the rest of the hotel  Swimming pools are small for the size of the hotel and not anything extraordinary  Rooms were smelly  uncomfortable beds  rusty fixtures in bathroom  safe not working  missing pictures on wall  Non smoking section  that is a joke  it is within the same building where the smoking section is and the two sections are only separated by a door  Next to two streets with a lot of traffic and noise  You would be better off by staying at the Excalibur or on an off strip hotel  Do not come without a car if traveling with kids  it would be too much walking for them  
P =>   Absolutely completely disgusting You know you re in for an interesting experience when you tell a cab driver to take you to Circus Circus Manor  and he spends the    minute ride making fun of the place and pitying you  That happened to me last week  The rooms  Totally disgusting  My colleague found a cigarette butt on the bedspread in her non smoking room  while my room featured ripped sheets on the bed  questionable brown stains on the bathroom linoleum  and a moldy shower  While this  quot hotel s quot  run down appearance and poorly lit hallways may seem  quot edgy quot  and  quot exciting quot  to some  it s pretty much unacceptable for non Third World travellers  In retrospect  I should have found a nice bathroom stall at the Venitican and camped out there for a few days  it definitely would have been cleaner  
P =>  Disgusting Dump I am an Australian and we are a very tolerant people and will put up with a lot of crap we stayed in about    different motels while on our holiday in the good old USA and most were pretty good value and clean    but this was by far the most disgusting dump we had stayed  quot super   and motel   are better this dump     do yourself a huge favour and stay elsewhere     and they have the hide to charge you more than double the rate for a weekend   we paid      for one night in there manor rooms  filthy smelly would have been better to stay in the car or a public toilet somewhere           a bad bad horrible experience    never again This dump needs to be demolished  
P =>  Great stay Through our travel agent we paid     dollars for a room  The complex is huge  There are many resturants in the complex and its located right on the strip The room was very clean and tidy and I got an adequate nights sleep  The room had a lot of space too I remember the bathroom taps being hard to work  
P =>   Great staff service super on a budget For all the people who complained  wah  wah  this is for people on a budget  we found the service great  the staff friendly   quot  you might try smiling yourself quot   eh  Never had a problem getting to the hotel  checking in was a breeze  our grand kids has a super time  and all the while we enjoyed watching them have fun  we don t gamble at all  we just enjoy Las Vegas  Stop whining when you do not get the  quot five star quot  treatment  just go someplace else next time  sheesh   Circus Circus  we ll be back  thanks for a great time   The food was tasty  well done  Pizza at the Grill has ton s of cheese on it  and was done in record time  speg  was also great  not too spicy nor too bland  McDonalds was a plus on the premises as the kids loved it  service always with a smile  Shops   clowns  and entertainment well worth the trip  
P =>  How did that alarm clock get turned on  We stayed at Circus Circus for   nights in mid ember   years ago  I stayed in their RV park  during my honeymoon  The Manor location is adjacent the RV park  and is about   minutes walk to the strip  As the C C complex is at the northern end of the Strip  it was ok for me and my wife to walk  but on this visit we were accompanied by my very fit    year old mother  who found the walking distance to the centre of the Strip a little far at times So if you re not a walker  and want to stay somewhere more  quot central quot   maybe consider another hotel Although a Non Smoking room had been requested  we got what was obviously a smoking room  however after   days leaving the window open when we were away  it became acceptable The toilet seat had seen plenty of use through the years  So much in fact  that the white plastic coating had worn off  and the laminated wood was showing through There was mildew growing in the bathroom One of the beds in the room had springs sticking through the top of the mattress  My mother had to make sure she slept only on one side of her bed We were meant to receive about       TV channels  We only got    One played the in house advertisement channel all the time  and another played constant re runs of  quot The Wizard of Oz quot   cutting down the watchable choices to   We asked if it could be re tuned  but this obviously was too unimportant or too tiring for the staff  We gave up asking in the end The ice maker on our floor didn t work The safe didn t lock  The towels were very thin and worn  and smelt burnt In our hurry to get out of the room one day  and begin the days activities  we forgot to leave a tip As the week continued  we had no wash cloths  cups or plastic bags for ice For some strange reason the alarm clock went off at  am the following day  How Odd Obviously the maid staff at Circus Circus are actually too lazy to do their job  even though they re being paid a hourly rate for it  Tip or else Obvious too  that if you forget to leave a tip  the vindictive staff turn the radio alarm on to give you that early wake up call Overall  the Circus Circus Manor wasn t dirty or noisy  but was in need of a make over and coat of paint   Or demolition  The staff at check in   out in the main building were friendly and helpful  although we only had contact with them on those two occasions Danger  Danger  Watch out for the HUGE meals  listed as an  quot appetiser quot  on the menu  I had some nachos one night   I got through about     of the plate  On another evening I requested the fruit platter   that was taken in a doggy bag  and fed   of us for a snack the following day I would say our visit was only disappointed by lazy household staff who think vindictive revenge is appropriate  if you forget to leave a tip on one day of a   week holiday  
P =>   Great for a Vegas trip on a Budget  I went to Las Vegas and stayed in the B building of the Manor lodge of Circus Circus  The actual hotel room wasn t too bad  It had a refrigerator  a table  a tv  wireless internet  and the bathroom was decent  The rates were amazing  and it allowed me to spend more money on my outings  The pool was pretty nice  There were three seperate pools which spread out the groups of people  If you are looking to eat on a budget the casino has many cheap places to eat  The casino is at the end of the strip so to get to all the new hotels it is best to take the bus  I rode the Duce bus which ran   hours and returned to the bus stop every    minutes  It is    for a   hour pass  which keeps it resonably cheap  I wouldn t reccomend this hotel for someone who is looking for a fancy new place  and to be in the center of the strip  I would reccomend this hotel for someone like me who needed to travel to vegas cheaply  It is much nicer than other hotels in its price range  
P =>   Not bad but lock up your valuables  It s a bit of a family tradition to stay at Circus Circus for us each time we have visited Vegas since       Previously we had stayed in the Tower rooms and the RV park  but decided this time on the Manor because we had a rental car for the entire length of stay  I have to say that the rooms are bigger than the Tower s and are quite clean and nicely decorated  they also have a Refrigerator which you don t get in the tower s  but unfortunately no Microwave or Internet connection  Having to go to the main building to check in and out is a nuisance  but once you are there at least you don t have to drag suitcases through the midway and the casino which is a big plus  As neither my daughter or myself are gamblers  we didn t miss having to walk through a smoke filled Casino every time we left our room  However  prospective guests beware  we did have items of newly purchased clothing go  quot missing quot  from our room  so I would recommend keeping your suitcases LOCKED and keep money and valuables with you  We contacted  Security  who were very uninterested and advised that it was unlikely they would find the  quot missing quot  items  they issued a Report number only on my insistance  which I will need to claim on my travel insurance If you want fancy Pools with slides and stuff this is not for you  also if you don t have your own transport  stay further towards the middle of the strip  This is one of the older hotels and the local rumour is that it s days are numbered  along with a few others nearby  but I think the theme is good  so hopefully they will re build it with all the  quot Bells and whistles quot   
P =>   Nice hotel wrong location  I go to Las Vegas every year  My first experience was in ober      and my fianc  and I stayed at Circus Circus  The rooms were very nice  but location wise  it was definitely the wrong choice for us  We spent much of our time walking or busing to the other end of the strip  The only time we actually were in the hotel was to sleep or eat  I will not stay at Circus Circus based only on this  It was a nice hotel  with nice staff  and nice rooms  I did however get lost a couple of times trying to get to my room  The price is right  the buffet is okay  It all depends on a persons plans while in Vegas  If this hotel was up the strip more  I would probably stay again  If you do stay here  make sure your room is not near the circus tent at all  I think this would be a fabulous hotel if we had children  Kids would have a blast in this hotel  If you are going to Vegas for the first time  do some research  Plan out what you want to do and stay close to the things you want to do and see  I wish I had  
P =>  easy parking  Easy parking  Unlike most other hotels  you can easily park your car in front of the Manor buildings and walk to reach your room within a minute  It s old  yes  But you can t beat the parking     
P => Circus Circus   Never stay at the Manor Circus Circus has a  quot budget quot  section that is not properly described  The Manor at Circus Circus is in such a state of disrepair it is unbelievable  Stains in carpet  fans in bathroom that do not work  beds with painful springs  honestly  this place was worse than a LOW budget chain  Yeah  they were cooperative  but they had to move us   TIMES  and apologized profusely  talk about embarrasing   Apparently they are tearing The Manor down within the next   years  I ve stayed at Best Western  Motel    Holiday Inn  La Quinta  etc  SO much better  Apparently the management has deemed it unnecessary to make repairs to certain areas  i e   the escalators  elevator  ice machines  and so on  We were utterly dissapointed with our stay  even though we were only in the room for an average of   hours per night  Next time we go for the NASCAR races  we will get the Package with a better Hotel  possibly TI  From Washington state         Scott 
P => One SNAFU but otherwise okay I couldn t get a room at the Hilton because it and almost everywhere else had the day I was arriving as a  quot no arrival quot  day  so I was kind of desperate  Finally  I booked a Manor room at the Circus Circus through an online service for the first night and then got a reservation at the Hilton the rest of the visit  Fortunately  I printed and took with me the online service s email confirming my reservation and the fact that the room was paid for in advance and unrefundable  because when I got to the Circus Circus  they had no record of me having a reservation  They did give me a room  though  and by the time I checked out  they had figured out what was wrong and didn t charge me anything  Well  except that silly       surcharge for the phone  Why don t they just include that in the room rate I was pleasantly surprised by the room  It was very large and comfortable  The bed was reasonably comfortable and there was like a dinette table with chairs  too  The only frustrating thing was that the cable TV had only like   channels  Headline news  ESPN  TBS  and something else  besides the hotel s in house channels  Who doesn t have CBS  NBC  and ABC on their hotel TV cable   The porters were very  very helpful I would stay here again if I needed to  It s not my first choice  but it did in the pinch  
P =>   Days   Circus Circus Our party of   arrived in Las Vegas on     for a week and took up   rooms in the West Tower  Our     room was on the   th floor immediately above the check in counter  Apart from a bit of initial confusion over which elevator to take our stay was quite pleasant  Our room was clean and well appointed  the only disappointment was the limited view of the roof of the amusewment park  Not a big deal  The rest of our party had no complaints about their rooms  The hotel was fairly quiet in spite of the rodeo finals taking place that week and the only busy day was the Saturday  We patronized the buffet for breakfast most mornings and it was fine although like much of Vegas nowadays it s not overly cheap  I have stayed at this hotel in the past in the cheaper Manor rooms and have never had any trouble with the property of any sort  We checked out the Strato Tower one afternoon and on hearing that we were staying at CC the elevator guy said   quot C mon now  I hear the rooms there are real dumps  quot  Sorry  partner  no such luck on the   th floor  
P => Very good hotel for the money booked early great buffet   Our family of   stayed in the manor building  It was very comfortable   queen beds   This was a busy place when you first check in but it was worth it   The buffet was excellent  the kids have the indoor roller coasters and the circus shows  the adults have the casinos  OVERALL an EXCELLENTHOTEL with many extras   We booked the internet rate and felt it was More than a bargain for the price we paid  
P => It Sucks We booked two rooms with Circus Circus recently  We were charged       per room and we were given Manor Motor Lodge building E Both rooms were poorly maintained  dusty and the bed spreads had stains in them  I had never seen anything as dirty as these rooms  When I walked back to the reception  and this was late in the night   the receptionist said you get what you paid for  The manager was as rude I will never stay with them again  You can t get anything worse  
P =>   Bon rapport qualit  prix   
P => 
P =>  Believe the other reviews I chose not to and was sorry  I am a traveling professional and use coference meeting rooms all over the the country  My company chose to ignore the negative reviews  We Will Never use this facility again The Number   problem is the front desk staff and Management  Completely unprofessional unaccommodating  and unfriendly  I arrived on a Sunday to prepare for a Monday morning meeting  I wound up setting up my own meeting space because it was not completely ready for me  I don t mean make adjustments to the room I mean rearrange what was there and completely reset it  During my meeting I needed   copies of a  page document printed out for my class The front desk refused to print for me and told me to use the business centers Credit card activated computer  We rented the meeting room for   days and our students stayed at the hotel bringing thousands of dollars worth of business and the would not print   pages  When I asked to see a manager the girl told me that she was the front desk manager and that I would have to use the business center I can ignore the ugly    s decor but the staff needs to go  From the management on down The management refused to come out from the office for anyone  and I heard several people asking to see management besides myself 
P =>   Good Value   Great Location Booked on the internet for    Dollars    a very good value at that price  The rooms were reasonably clean  I felt safe  The location was outstanding  Getting into the property and out of the property  I had a car  was very  very easy  The rooms are not new  the carpet had a few stains  but overall an acceptable level of  clean   In other words  anything under    dollars and this was is a good value  
P =>   WOW   You go to Vegas  you expect to have the time of your life  Granted  it is a smaller property so you don t really expect the Manadalay Bay in quality  but one would think that no matter how small the property is  it is unacceptable to walk up to the main desk and have the girl behind it sleeping  I was disgusted that an establishment which prides itself on hospitality would allow its employees to sleep on the job right in front of guests  Interestingly enough  once the girl woke up I read her badge and it stated that she was a supervisor  SCARY  That was just one of the many mind boggling occurrences that happened during our stay  The only good thing was that we didn t spend much time at the place because we had better places to be  and that they had a free shuttle   Of course  however  they only had one driver  who conveniently called in sick so we had to pay for our own taxi   Instead of getting angry  we just made a list of all that was wrong and rather found it very comical  The management is obviously terrible  that place won t be around much longer  
P =>   It is all in the past  I just came back from Las Vegas  I had to go there on a business trip  This will be my  rd time visting Vegas  all business  My company has always booked the MGM but this year they broke us down into smaller groups and we stay at the Clarion  This hotel had nicer rooms and service than I had recieved from the MGM  Before I left  I was checking on line for the weather there to know how to pack  I came across this site and was a bit scared of what I would see  Well  I was happily surprised  There was no stains or peeling wall paper  The place was just newly renovated  newly painted  Also the staff was extremely friendly  The staff that handles our meetings were so acommodating  From what my boss said  my company was also very please with the service they received  I am not doubting some of the past reviews  but it is not the case presently  I loved the idea od being picked up in a limo from the airport  Overall I had a great stay  I would go back there in a second and also recomend this property to my family and friends  
P =>   A great stay I was a little leery of this hotel after reading some of the reviews  but found that everything was just fine when I stayed there  Yes  the decor of the hotel is a peach and teal combo that looks very dated these days  but my room was spotlessly clean  The front desk staff were very helpful  and the small restaurant in the lobby does a great breakfast  
P =>   Take another hotel   it s better for you We reserved for   rooms for   nights and after one night we left this terrible hotel  The carpet very dirty in each   rooms  linens and towels very bad  The front desk agent sleep on the counter  Pool dirty too  I don t recommanded this hotel to anybody visiting Las Vegas  We change for the Flamingo Las Vegas on the strip for the same price  
P => Ok for a hotel off the strip I stayed at this hotel for one night  The rooms are spacious and ok if you want a cheaper hotel away from the strip and casinos  When I pulled down the sheets there was a stain and the sheets looked like they were slept in and the towels also had stains  otherwise  the room seemed clean  We called the front desk and they immediately came and changed the sheets  We received a discount for the inconvience  The restaruant in the hotel is actually quite good  I ordered one of their burgers and it was quite large at a reasonable price  It is quite a walk from the strip  so I would suggest that you have a car  if you don t like to walk in the very hot sun  The pool is open    hours  which is really nice since I normally don t get back to hotels until the pools are usually closed  I would probably stay at this hotel again if I only needed to stay one night  
P => Great Option Near The Strip If you re tired of the hassles and costs of staying on the strip but want quick access to it  this is a great choice  Some of the prior reviewers seemed to be expecting a room on the level of Bellagio  Obviously you won t get that for     a night  but the room was clean and the staff was friendly  Also  the hotel is not on the edge of a bad part of town  as one reviewer suggested  Perhaps best of all  a limousine is at your beck and call almost continuously  including for the trips to and from the airport and from the hotel to several points on the strip   However  you have to find your own way back from the strip if you re not up for the walk  which is a little lengthy if your time is limited or the weather is bad   There is also a very nice pool  We will certainly stay here again  
P =>  eh  You get what you pay for people  And I think for the most part  people who work at a place like this don t have the training to keep their cool when confronted by an angry customer  and you will be treated as you treat them  It s not the Wynn We needed a place to stay with our kids for a family wedding  For obvious reasons we didn t want to subject our kids to the casinos  the wedding   Caesar s was enough  The room itself was reasonably clean  it s not a new hotel  so the usual cracks and such in the shower  tile  etc There was some stray hair in the tub and sink  and on bathroom floor which grosses me out  The check in staff was wonderful to us  but an employee  woman  was arguing loudly with another customer at the desk next to us   seems to be a common theme  but personally for us  things went fine  The housekeeper was a dear  and immediately brought us more towels  The bedspreads were slightly stained and felt gummy  I pulled the sheets back to check them and found    yep  more curly black hair and specks of debris  The sheets looked clean  unstained and smelled fresh though  There was no evidence smell of smoke in this non smoking room  a first  There were about    TV channels and the preview chanel was showing some pretty racy stuff  Be careful who has the remote if you bring kids We walked to the strip for dinner  Wear your walking shoes  these are Las Vegas  quot blocks quot   The hotel is abutts the  quot not so nice quot  part of town  There is a strip club next door  abandoned casino adjacent  lots of garbage on the sidewalks  where there are sidewalks  though it appears there is some renovation going on around it   When we came back to the hotel around    there were plenty of skanky looking charfacters around  and much leering at my    year old daughter  Ick  Let s just say we made tracks When we got back  my husband asked for   more pillows  the ones on the bed were sooo flat  We heard some  guy  behind the scenes grumbling  quot Four pillows  What the hell do they need four pillows for  Don t they know were are full  quot Our sweet houskeeper arrived with   pillows  hot and fluffed from the dryer  We asked her for two more  and she olbliged    We left her a nice tip the next morning   and she cleaned the room to a sparkle and totally restocked everything  The pool was fantastic   Nice and clean  water was cool and not over chlorinated  even the spa felt clean  and the kids had a blast  Really great pool gym bar area for this mediocre hotel So there you go 
P => Nice but slight Attitude Stayed here in        Good quiet location and has a nice pool for relaxing in      of the staff are good but I had a problem with one of the women staff who seemed to be not bother with helping with booking in  Rooms are nice and big with most fascility s for our stay  Its a    minute walk to the Strip where you end up at the New York New York hotel in front of you  They have a free limo service which they say is    hour service but found that it is not Certainly not a Hotel I d stay again  Mainly down to the girl in reception with the attitude  I m sure there are better hotel s available for the price we paid  I only went for this hotel because I thought it would be to busy to hotel on the Strip but next time I will stay on the strip for much the same price   I think what ruined this hotel for me was first impression s and my first impression was the bad attitude by this girl  All other staff were excellent and a good meal and a drink and a chat with the bar staff helped me give this hotel a Average rate    
P =>  Just OK   and a half stars is about right for this hotel  It is in quite a good position  about    minutes walk to the  main  bit of the Strip  Caesars Place area  however double the price of a night at the Sahara  where we stayed following our one night at the Clarion  and although just as comfortable and clean  it is without the restaurants  casino  monorail station  cafes  shops  shows  buffets  rides and basically everything we went to Vegas for The other thing is we were put in a room next to what can only be described as a generator which made an awful noise all night which wasn t pleasing after a    hour flight  We would normally of asked to change rooms however we were far too tired and fortunately we had ear plugs with us All in all just ok  plus points being a nice big comfy bed  and the hotel does have a free limo which will take you to the Strip and the airport however it is not very frequent  but a nice extra  
P =>   The good The Bad and The Ugly  I spent several nights  checking in on           by myself on a business trip  The Good    Limo service to from the airport  One way limo service to the strip or convention center     Surprisingly good food  given my comments below    Pool spa looks nice  though it rained much of my stay    ent rates      nt    Restaurant bar staff friendly    No frills room  basic stuff as expected The Bad    No iron in my room  Called maid service  got the bar  told me to call the front desk  No one picked up  Ask for iron in person upon leaving a m   but none present upon my return  Asked again that night  amp  then delivered   Not that big a deal    Only two blocks from the strip   as stated   but the blocks are a country mile  It s a       minute walk from the strip  Bring comfy shoes    Exercise room is a detached facility  Given the rain  I d prefer a facility within the building  Again  not a big deal    Property is in need of a little TLC and updating  The decor does not suit my tastes  Ghetto fabulous southwestern motiff  yeah baby    Small tv  and only    channels to view     for english spanish speakers   Understandably  this may or may not be a problem depending on your stay s purpose  The Ugly    I found graffiti in my room  It was around the door frame on the inside of the bathroom  Ok the door frame is brown  the tagging in black  so it doesn t stand out but am I the only one to see it    Past building repairs are obvious  Drywall work in my ceiling stood out as it did in other parts of the building  Did someone actually review the repairs and say  quot OK  looks good quot     Traffic      Convention center to airport      pm           Map it  it ain t far Notables ent rates  bring your own car if your on the move  If you want to impress  keep driving Hotel between two properties  out of business Key Largo Casino and Platnum Gentlemen s Club  Does that sum it up or what  
P =>  We loved the Clarion  We go to Vegas on business twice a year  I was tired of the huge casino hotels   tons of walking  crowds  smoke and I wanted to be able to lay by the pool or use the hot tub anytime  So  this time we stayed at the Clarion  It was really just a couple of blocks from the strip and I didn t think the neighborhood bad at all  We had a car and used it as it way too hot to walk  But the Clarion offers on call limo service to the strip The hotel was small and had everything we wanted   a nice    hour pool hot tub area  restaurant  very comfortable room  We had fast wireless Internet in our room  main building only  and by the pool  We loved it and had no problems whatsoever  The price was even cheaper than the casino hotels for a much nicer stay  There were even casinos next door to walk to if you wanted  And nice restaurants across the street  It all depends on what you re looking for  but if you want something quiet and relaxing  I would definitely recommend the Clarion  
P =>  A nice inexpensive hotel Despite the bad reviews from others  we found this hotel just fine  Nice staff  clean room  inexpensive     hour pool  a few blocks from the strip  Don t be scared off  
P =>  Dont go the staff are terrible Wish i had checked this site before we stayed there    never again will I not look here My girlfriend and I were visiting Las Vegas whilst touring America  and arrived there at about      pm    hour drive   and I was so tired I just wanted to stop  So came across this place Spoke to the reception  nice guy if he would pay attention to us and stop answering the phone for   minutes  and we were quoted a cost of      for   nights  which I though was great  cheap but great  didn t think much of the cost as it is       minutes from the strip and no casino  Just though we had got a good deal late in the evening So you can imagine our surprise when looking at the account   days later  they have it on TV which is nice  and found out we were being charged this amount a night   I tried to speak to reception that evening to at least discuss the matter  as this was too much cash  we are traveling round the world and couldn t afford this  So you can imagine my surprise when the lady at the desk shoves my receipt for payment under my nose  tells me we have signed and what do I expect  They were sarcastic  called me a liar  and generally were the rudest people I have ever had to deal with in a hotel  This is a lot as I used to be the manger of a hotel  Refused to give me any information even when I accepted I would pay the money as there  must  have been a misunderstanding  all mine I was told The only nice person was the guys that fixed our AC unit which leaked over our clothing  they were really nice  helpful and had good local knowledge  should be at the desk and the people there should be looking for new jobs To be honest I just want to forget the place  it put a complete spoiler on our trip as this was right at the end of America and will be a lingering thought of the place which is ashame  as generally the country was great Just want other people to avoid our mistake     Happy travels 
P => Very dirty rude staff bad part of town THE WORST HOTEL STAY I HAVE HAD EVER     Smelly old hotel with very rude staff  payed      a night for hotel room with whirlpool tub didn t work and was filthy  LORIN girl behind counter very rude accused us of breaking the tub  General Manger IKE very unpleasant also backed his employee LORIN unproffesional rude  Complained about dirty hotel room said  quot  ITS NOT A NEW HOTEL quot   Website is misleading hotel is very nasty  ended up moving to TERRIBLES HOTEL AND CASINO BEST HOTEL FOR     a night VERY NICE STAFF 
P =>  Misleading Website Internet misleading  Claimed to have a shuttle service   i m sure it was great but it shut down at      on a weekend night   Nice place to stay  and a great location    but the internet info is a bit misleading  
P =>   H tel   recommander  
P => 
P =>   Great place to stay and play Like some have said  it is a little rough around the edges  in need of some paint but overall very pleased with the resort  We had   units for a week for   of us  Been to Vegas many times staying at Strip and downtown  This was a nice relaxing break from daily casino exposure  Plenty of room at the pool compared to elbow to elbow at many casino pools  Great bar b que grills and outdoor space by pool and hot tub  Shuttle service to strip and Fremont street was handy  Staff was friendly and willing to accomodate  Only    minutes from Lake Mead  Found a great place to rent a pontoon for an afternoon of cruising and sand bar lunch  Also fast easy access to any activities you want Will definitely book back with the Cliffs again  
P =>   A nice quiet spot in Vegas My husband and I just returned from a   night stay at the Cliffs at Peace Canyon  We booked this trip as an exchange through RCI  If you are used to staying in Condo exchanges  I would say this resort is average to above average  For us  staying off the strip was a plus  It is close enough that you can be to the Strip or Fremont Street in less than a half an hour and we found Las Vegas very easy to navigate  The big plus is that it is a nice quiet neighborhood  Perfect for the lazy trip we had planned  Sleeping in and relaxing at the pool were peaceful and relaxing  I would give this resort a higher rating but the units are a little dated  the bedroom has a full bed instead of a queen  and there were several pool chairs that need to be replaced  
P =>   Great place to stay off the strip but close enough to get to the action Arrived at Cliffs   Peace  off the strip about   miles  which was perfect for a family like ours that didn t want to be directly on the strip the entire vacation  It had a small pool and hot tub  and the room was nicely decorated and large  Only problem is  it only has a queen sized bed in both of the bedrooms  and a pull out couch in the living room  The room had a large kitchen  Family sized washer and dryer  You were assigned parking also  but they had extra spaces  Also  if possible get a room near the pool its definately worth it  Our room was also on the top level which made it hard to take grocery up the    steps in the heat  They also had a pool table in the lobby  a comfortable tv room off the lobby and a computer room off the lobby that had about   computers available for guest We went for y  th and it was the best fireworks show I ve ever seen  Definately worth it  We also took in some of the free shows and activities on the strip  The pirate show  the erupting volcano  the fountain show  the mardi gras parade and many other little sights to see  We were disappointed in Circus Circus     too crowded and the place was dirty and over priced  However our day trip to the Grand Canyon  Hoover Dam and Lake Meade was awesome  
P =>   Great for quiet time and family This is not a typical Vegas Strip location  Located about as far West as you can go and still be in the city  There is a free shuttle service to the Strip  downtown  and a grocery store  but I recommend a car  These condo style units are in a residential community  Relatively quiet  especially if you are not right next to the pool  There are plenty of stores and eating establishments nearby  This location is close to the beltway so getting around is easy  ent interiors  carpet and furniture a little worn but clean  Warning  beds are Doubles  Very small if you are used to a Queen or King size bed  Great pool and hot tub  Acceptable fitness center    of   free computers were out of order  the one working was not working well  Staff courteous and helpful  but stay at front desk  Lots of families with children  
P =>   A Wonderful Resort My wife and I just returned from a one week stay at The Cliffs at Peace Canyon  We had a terrific stay  The minute we drove up to the front of the resort and saw the two storey buildings  we knew that we were going to love the smaller scale  We stayed in a two bedroom  two bathroom unit  The only gripe we had was the fact that the beds were only full size and not queen or double  oh well  we had to sleep a little closer together  The beds were very comfortable  Sure the resort is showing a little bit of wear in a few places  like the doors in the cabinetry of the kitchen and bathroom look like they need to be adjusted a little  but you can just imagine the useage they get from the number of guests  The kitchen was well equipped  fridge with icemaker  stove  dishwasher  dishes and cutlery  washer dryer  They even provided some dishwashing detergent  dish soap  coffee filters and laundry detergent  The pool area was very nice with a cool pool  a hot tub  plenty of chairs and even four barbeques for the use of the guests  As I said  we had an excellent time  met some great people around the pool and will definitely go back  The hotel was a bit off the strip but could be reached by car in    minutes  The resort did have a shuttle service but we did not use it  The staff were very friendly and courteous  
P =>  A few unwanted visitors We stayed at the Cliffs from      to      We had stayed there the year before and thought it was a good deal and offered some  quot quiet quot  time away from the strip  We were inside about   hour when we spotted a roach in the kitchen and then another in the Living room and then in a bathroom  When we called the desk  they did offer to change our room  However I know that our unit couldn t have been the only one with this problem  They were very courteous and prompt about spraying the unit and we did only see one through the rest of the week  I was very nervous about possibly bringing an unwanted visitor home with me  The linens at this resort were also very worn and shabby  but the service was excellent  The staff was great  but they do need some improvements to keep me coming back  
P =>   I Was Impressed    I was very pleased with this hotel  We have teenagers and they are very hard to please  They absolutely loved it  It felt like being at home  The kitchen had everything you could possibly need  The beds were very comfortable  even the sofabed  The condo was very clean  It also had indoor laundry  Lots of ammenities Lots of towels which was great because our teenagers forgot their towels for the pool  The pool is heated which was nice  It had a pool table inside the lounge area which my husband liked  If you don t like all the chaos of the strip than you would love to stay here  We needed some snacks and the good thing is that everything is so close  Target is right down the street  It was a good place especially for the price  And believe me I checked around  It really isn t that far from the strip  less than    minutes if that  We really enjoyed our stay and will be going there again  
P =>   Great Condo   Clean and updated   Parked right outside unit We stayed at the Cliff on il   for   nites  We were on the Harley for a HD HOG training that was at the Red Rock Casino  So  parking close was a great asset  The condo was perfect  Full kitchen with w d in closet area  which I used  The bathroom was clean and nice size  The bedroom was large and nice sheets and bedding with a TV in amoire  Only thing bed was small for us  We have a king and nothing quite compares  So  I slept on the couch  Livingroom was beautiful and tv and gas fireplace to take chill off in evening  I would stay again  I did use the shuttle to downtown and was on time and nice staff  They did call one am for a presentation  I m assuming  but I had appts and they never called again  Great Staff  helpful and gave my friend great directions when she got lost  
P =>   I really love this place  This is the second time that I have stayed here  It is about   miles from the strip but it seems much closer since it is one long road  It is very close to Red Rock Casino  which is one of my favorites  so I like that  It is very close to Red Rock canyon  which is a beautiful place to take a walk or a picnic You can also walk to Target  some great restaurants  Cafe Deia is one of them   and some cute stores The rooms are very clean and updated  Each has a small balcony  with a table and chair set on it  Last year  I stayed in a one bedroom which was bigger than most hotel rooms  but not nearly as big or as nice as the two bedroom  The two bedroom has a master bedroom with it s own bathroom and a closet that is as big as a bedroom The pool and jacuzzi are very nice  They also have a    hour computer room which is free  And it is never busy there are about     computers and a printer It has a full kitchen  stocked with dishes  coffee pot and filters  everything you would need to not eat out every meal  I ve had two great experiences there and would gladly return  
P =>  Cliffs at Peace Canyon   Middle of the Road for us We arrived at      and were not able to get our room untiil       which is the posted check in time  which was fine with us  We went to Red Rock Casino a few miles away to kill a few hours  and that worked out well Once we got in our unit and assessed what we would need from the store  we headed to close by Wal t  which is also an enormous grocery store  Best to go with a specific list made in advance  otherwise you will be overwhelmed and spend hours there  The unit included two small boxes of laundry detergent  I always bring a few dryer sheets  how easy that is for packing   and I also bring my own small plastic bottle of detergent  just in case  There were four adults  so we did use all of it  although I imagine you could get more  There is a small bottle of dish soap in the kitchen  plenty of towels and potholders  paper towels  toilet tissue  and facial tissue is there  with excess in the vantities  There are also plenty of trash bags  but the bags are terrible quality and break easily  so be careful The beds are all queen sized  I knew this before I went  so I want to say I wasn t disappointed  but I still was  Every time I trade my timeshare  we have a large king bedroom and usually a whirlpool tub  I have king at home  so we found the queen a little challenging  My last few trades have also had amazing mattresses and great sheets  I did not find this to be the case at the Cliffs  One of our face towels in the master bath was so threadbare and grayish that it looked like a car washing towel  Nothing was plush  same for the pool towels  I hated the comforter and blanket on the bed  the scratchy  not comfy type  The room was small and wouldn t have accommodated a king bed  though  so there is nothing they can do about that  I was underwhelmed by the master bath  There was a long countertop but only one sink  and it was so low by todays  standards  Very dated  Shower was fine  great water pressure  and the tub was a bit oversized and quite comfortable  Minimal towels given We didn t need to use any front desk services  but the people there seemed very pleasant  The pool area and hot tub area were just lovely  very well maintained  and the four built in gas grills are fantastic  The area where the grills are is well lit and very clean  We grilled outside twice  and it was fantastic  Near the grills is an outdoor fireplace for those wanting to eat outdoors at the high top table by the fireplace If you like to exercise on vacation  the fitness center leaves much to be desired  in my opinion  Two treadmills  neither calibrated to the right speed or incline  The belt was loose on one of them  and they are dated   There are NO free weights at all  Two treadmills    bikes    eliptical  and a universal  The area is small and hot  People were propping the door open with the trashcan  No towels provided in the gym  and I can honestly say I haven t been to a resort through my RCI trades that didn t offer towels and cleaning solutions in the gym to disinfect the equipment after someone sweats on it  The fireplace in the living room of this two bedroom unit was wonderful   turn on with a switch and really warmed you up nicely  The kitchen was equipped with what we needed for cooking  The cabinets and vanities should ALL be replaced immediately  They are old  rotting in parts  difficult to operate  There is nothing updated whatsoever as far as vanities and cabinets  I m on vacation  I want to feel like I am being pampered I read on Trip Advisor to ask for a second floor unit due to bugs  We did not see a single bug and we did have a second floor unit  The unit was very clean when we arrived Horribly  at      a m  or at      a m  EVERY DAY  the maintenance people are dragging pool chairs around while they are cleaning   the noise is like nails on a chalkboard  And we were on the second floor     They are noisily dragging trash cans around and pool chairs  It is not fun to wake up that early in the morning because of loud noise dragging around by your unit  The shuttle service provided by the Cliffs is TOP NOTCH  Their system is working wonderfully   you make a reservation to go to the strip or Freemont Street  and you have a seat on the van   a beautiful  comfortable van  Steve is an amazing asset to the resort  if you are lucky enough to get him as your driver  There are three drivers that we saw during our week  They are efficient and always on time  They ll drop you off to do grocery shopping  too  and come back for you  Extremely accommodating and easy to use  We had a rental car and still used the shuttle almost every day  Be sure to tip these guys There is no free wifi in the rooms  kind of unheard of these days  but they do have a computer room where you can go online and print for free  I brought my laptop because I needed to check in with work all week  and it cost me     to have internet access in the room If you are staying at the Cliffs  be sure to visit Red Rock Resort and Casino   it is lovely  Check out their pool area  beautiful  The casino is really nice there  and it s only about    minutes away  you ll need a car  the shuttle doesn t go there  In closing  although we had a wonderful vacation  enjoyed the weather and being with our friends  had a fun time in Las Vegas  this is not a resort we would chose again in the future  With the maintenance fees and dues we pay for our timeshare  we can get much better  I think we actually lost money on this trade  as I imagine we could have rented it for less than our fees and trade upgrade  
P =>   Great Hotel almost runined by presentation though This hotel or resort is lovely  Would thoroughly recommend it  Staff are so helpful and polite  rooms were brilliant  spacious and clean  pool was a godsend and also the hotel put on a free shuttle to the strip which was excellent if you booked early enough to get on it because the strip is around    minutes drive  However  if i went again I would hire a car because where the resort is  its very easy to drive in and also driving onto the strip is fine  Yes its busy but the traffic is fairly slow and also all the large hotels offer free parking so it would have been easier to have gone to which ever hotel you wanted to visit this way The only downside to this hotel is the presentation they get you to attend regarind time share  They are extremly pushy and it took   people before they seemed to understand the word no  It took up   hours of our short time in Vegas and they were trying to persuade us to take out finance or a loan in order to take part which i think is very irresponsible  So if you visit just say NO     
P =>  Nice place   My husband and I checked into this resort the day after Thanksgiving  We reserved this unit through an RCI exchange  Our unit was a   bedroom    bath unit  It was nice and large  It was a little disappointing that the master bedroom did not have a king size bed  but I knew this going into it and after I saw the size of the bedroom  a queen bed is really all that would fit  The unit was simply furnished  with huge closets  It looks like this complex was not a purpose build timeshare place  it looks like it was probably a residential property prior  but it was still very nice  My only complaint was the tile in the showers was not cleaned properly  There was a lot of mold mildew in the corners  This is something a good cleaning would take care of  The location is about       minutes from the Las Vegas strip  but our main purpose of going to Las Vegas was not the strip It s a great location to Red Rock Canyon which we visited  and Red Rock Casino is only a couple of exits away if you want to do the casino thing  They have a huge bingo hall it was a lot of fun  I ve never played  quot big time quot  bingo before     games in one hour  what a thrill We did not swim in the pool  but it looked very nice and other people were in the pool  so I assume it was fairly warm  We did go in the hot tub and it was nice after a day of hiking  There is a great place close by for breakfast lunch it s called Eggworks  Just ask the front desk for directions  You definitly need a car at this location  It s easy access to the interstate  which can take you to Hoover Dam        minutes   While we were in Las Vegas we also took advantage of kayaking below the Hoover Dam with Desert Adventures  Did flightlines through Bootleg Canyon with Bootleg Canyon Flightlines  A couple of places we ate at were Todd s Unique Dining in Henderson and The Bistro in Boulder City  This was a fantastic vacation and would highly recommend this location to anyone that is looking for something different to do in Las Vegas  
P =>  Great off Strip Secret   The Cliffs is the perfect place to stay if you want to have your very own Vegas condo  Equipped with full kitchen  living room  dining area and washer dryer this is a home away from home  The bathroom was nice and the bedroom had a closet the size of most NY apartments  Great pool  small but comfortable  Near all the hidden treasures of Vegas  would stay here again  and again  
P =>   Love the Cliffs  I have been to Las Vegas numerous of times  mostly on the strip  but this was my first time staying at the Cliffs  off the strip   Because I had already done the entire STRIP in the past  you know  visiting the hotels  watching the shows  gambling  I wanted a place that I could just relax and unwind  The Cliffs is just the place  The room was a nice size  clean  spacious and had all the amenities  The living room had a nice L couch  other chairs  a large TV  coffee table  The dining room and kitchen were a nice size as well  As with most timeshares  all pots plates utensils are provided  We didn t pig out at the buffets in Vegas this time  We just bought some grocerries at Smith s supermarket  the shuttle can take you there   just ask the driver  and we were able to eat dinner at  quot home  quot  There is free DVD rentals  not so many choices   there is a computer lab  workout room  BBQ area  jacuzzi  pool table and beautiful pool  There were a few brave souls in the pool  but I was freezing  When I was rested  I took the shuttle to the strip for some quick gambling and to watch the Bellagio fountains  The shuttle is a godsend  Not having to drive up and down the strip in Vegas is a great thing    Everything was wonderful here and I had a great time  I can t wait to return  
P =>  Great Time  My husband and I stayed here for a week for our honeymoon in y       The rooms are really nice and spacious  although some of the furniture can be a little on the tacky side  They have a shuttle that runs from the hotel to the Bellagio  mid strip  every hour  The best part  its completely free except for the tip to the driver  The staff was very friendly and the pool was really nice as well  
P =>   could have moved in  we stayed in a one bedroom for a week  We loved everything about our stay at The Cliffs  The unit we stayed in was very nice  Everything was new  very spacious  and clean  The pool and jacuzzi were close by and both were maintained very well  The location was east of the strip  and yes you probably should rent a car and not depend on taxi s but you can then take advantage of the nearby stores and strip malls that had everything you need when staying at a time share  The strip itself was about fifteen minutes away with lights and depending on traffic  The Cliffs gave a nice getaway from all the lights and noise of the strip  so going back and forth was well worth the time  The staff were great  I called a few times because we were getting married and they were all very helpful and friendly  We can t wait to come back and we will book with The Cliff at Peace Canyon again    
P =>   Peace at the Cliffs Have just returned from the Cliffs at Peace Canyon  Stayed there between tember   th and ober  th        This was our  nd stay there in the last   years and would recommend it to anyone  It is only about a    minute drive from  quot The Strip quot  and about a    minutes drive from  quot downtown quot   We rented a car for the period and it was great being able to  quot go home quot  after a day of sightseeing  amp  gambling  Car rentals are the way to go because you don t pay for parking in LV so staying at the Cliffs is very convenient The actual living space    bedrooms     bathrooms living room dining room kitchen laundry room  was fully equiped with stove  fridge and dishwasher as well as a washer  amp  dryer  The swimming pool  amp  hot tub spa was great  There were gas BBQs and seating areas that you could enjoy with your family  amp  friends I can t say enough about this place  There were four of us celebrating birthdays and we split the cost   ways       each    you can t go wrong  The front desk  amp  staff were fantastic This place is not to be missed  
P =>   Give peace a chance   Second year at Cliffs  Love the excitement and character of  quot The Strip quot  but delight at the sedate atmosphere at the Cliffs  Just what you want     mins by Shuttle to the action  What more can you ask for  Clean  friendly  Ok the room was a little  quot tired quot  but still great  If you Want action Stay on the strip  If you want to stay in the room stay at home  If you want a Holiday Stay at Cliffs   Hoping to return from across the pond next year Barry  Debbie  Carole  amp  Bob 
P =>   Great place if you don t want to stay on the strip We really love this place  We traded our RCI timeshare for this   bedroom condo for   week  It was clean  spacious and nicely decorated  It s just a short drive to the strip and near lots of shopping and restaurants  We went to a great Bar B Q place across the street  Also close is Red Rock which is stunning  We took a drive up there and found a funny little place that is like an old time western town  You can have lunch there and I think sleep as well  not reco sleeping there    The pool was also very nice  I would stay again  
P =>   Love this place    Just got back from here   we LOVE this place  It s the second time that our family stayed here  The staff is so nice and friendly  It s in close vicinity to everything   and it has all the comforts of home   especially if you have kids  It s comfortable  amp  quiet  and the pool is open till midnight  Close to a Target  Joe s Crab Shack  Red Rock Casino  and the strip isn t to far   and  they provide a shuttle if you don t have a car  I can t say enough about this place   a wonderful place  to create wonderful summer vacation memories with your family  
P =>  torture at peace canyon The summer before we spent a week at Fairfield Grand Desert just off the strip  peaceful  wonderful    pools  couple different hotubs game room for kids  entertainment and poolside activities  drinks  snowcones for the kids  We went with our son and   grandkids and had a blast  We decided to try peace canyon the next summer  The beds were double instead of queens as advertised  the airconditioning was noisy and hard to adjust thruout condo  the pool was nice but way to small and everyone was looking for a chair  we were the only one with kids there   kids   mostly nice older people there  two much fake plants and stuff on tables  etc  were always having to move stuff to use tables  even at night for some reason the birds outside in the middle of the night were swaking making noise  could here the aprtment upstairs when they came home late  To make a long story short  we came in on Sat on it was unanimous we left by Wed morning to go home  We will defenetely go to the Fairfield Grand Desert next time  underground secure parkng  beautiful rooms  so on  
P =>   Way below expectations I spent two days at the Cliffs in a one bedroom apartment  purchased through hotwire  I am not sure why the reviews are so good for this place  because the apartments are way outdated  with old furniture and appliances  I had to flush the toilet water three times praying every time it wouldn t overflow   the pool is the size of a peanut  the gym has some of the oldest machines I have seen in any timeshare or hotel gym  there were no towels or napkins to wipe the machines at the gym after use  apartments on the second floor require to drag your luggage up the stairs  no elevators   and the location is a good    minute drive from the Strip  Oh  and they charge     to use the safe in the room  I did like the area   newer area  with lots of restaurants ans stores  Other than that  I will never go back  By the way  we are timeshare owners  we have multiple timeshare weeks  and we travel extensively in the US and Mexico and have stayed in many timeshares   but this was one of the most outdated timeshares  serious timeshares change the furniture and appliances once every three or five years  Not this one  
P =>   We ll stay here again but    Rooms are very dated  heavy  dark furnishings and window coverings  Comfortable enough though  Parking is well lighted and plentiful  Pool area is definitely the  quot highlight quot   Very nice  and we spent many pleasant hours there  Pool is advertised to be    degrees  but is much cooler than that  Spa is excellent though  We were a bit disappointed in the maintenance however  High end gas BBQ s are furnished in the pool complex  but of the four provided  only two were functioning properly  not sure why this isn t rectified    Upon arriving we found a dirty towel on the sofa and a couple dirty hand towels in the bathroom  probably an anomaly  but not a good first impression  Took a couple tries to finally get a TV remote replaced  Message light on the phones do not function  so better check messages frequently  I am concerned that the GFI s are not wired correctly   but maintenance didn t seem concerned  My advice  be careful  Even though this resort is miles from the  quot Strip quot   part of its allure   you ll discover that the     freeway makes access very painless and relatively quick  especially to from the airport   You re only minutes from Red Rock Canyon  so make sure you visit    All in all  we will stay here again  Overall  a very pleasant experience  
P =>   Wonderful  What a gem  Off the strip with full accomodations for weary travelers  So relaxing we stayed an extra day  Recommended for families and those who enjoy visiting the strip but not staying there  it is way off the strip   Surrounded by many conveniences  
P =>   Very Nice Place The weather was really nice this week  ch           low    s  The condos here are very nice  clean and quiet  The staff is very friendly and they don t bug you with the timeshare presentation  They were very appreciative of any soft paperbacks  I did leave a few in the TV room and noticed that they got picked up very quickly  There s a pool table and also a few computers printer in the business center  There s a time limit of    minutes with each log in  If there aren t any people waiting in line than you can log in over and over again  I didn t have any problems with this and stayed there for    minutes  If you have your own laptop there s another room for wireless access  The pool is very clean and so is the jacuzzi  The exercise room is nice too but my son wished they had some free weights The condos are located very close to Albertson s  Target  JC Penny s and a few other stores and restaurants  We drove down Flamingo Rd to get to the Strip  We didn t have much traffic so it was quite easy to get back and forth  You can self park at any of the hotels on the strip at no charge  One of our favorite restaurants was Bahama Breeze on Flamingo Rd   This place has the best appetizers and drinks  They have the biggest plate of onion rings I have ever seen  We also liked Paymon s on W  Sahara and Byblos Cafe on Flamingo Rd  Paymon s is fancier and has great kabobs  The portions of kabobs are quite big   Byblo s is a small cafe in a corner strip mall   it s not fancy but their hummos  falafals and their freshly made bread is excellent  Their baklava is really good too  We did some shopping at the Outlet stores  The Las Vegas Premium Outlets is newer and nicer than the Las Vegas Outlet Center  We hit all the Nike outlets  there s one in Primm too  and found some great deals on Jordon shirts shorts The Bass Pro Shop is awesome  My    year son who hates shopping stayed there for over an hour going over all the fishing lures  They have a really good selection of hard baits as well as soft baits    good colors too  If you are a bass fishermen this is the place to drool We drove to the Grand Canyon   the west rim  There is a        mile dirt road prior to getting to the Canyon  It is quite bumpy but the scenery is beautiful  We were surrounded by joshua trees and some were in bloom  Once there we had to pay     for parking and additional     per person for the bus They have additional tickets for helicopters  meal tickets  etc  We were a bit disappointed because the bus only drops you off at   vistapoints  We heard that on the south rim there are   vistapoints  One other note    if your kids are into basketball    there are some outside courts on Durango Dr     go north of Flamingo Rd  the kids playing on this court are older but my son got a really good work out  He was there   nights and at one point he said there was over    kids    pick up games  etc  The kids play pretty late at night  
P =>   Nice Stay at Cliffs We had a nice stay at the Cliffs  The rooms were clean and the people were nice and friendly  It was very peacful and we felt safe there with the security  The only thing we did not like was there was almost no hot water pressure  I would recomend renting a car when staying here because it is about twenty minutes from the strip and sometimes you could see a lot of people waiting for the shuttle  There are some good resturants nearby too  
P =>   Great for Families We booked through RCI  We were early and they check us in right away  The room was very nice and comfortable  I liked the fact that there was a washer and dryer in the Condo  There was a problem with the bathroom and it was fixed right away  The people were helpful when asking about directions and places to go in the area  The condo was far from the Vegas Strip but I wanted it that way  The     Freeway was outside of our street and it was east to travel  All in all I enjoyed the experience  
P =>   Ok but nothing special Reasonably comfortable and clean  although one of the bedrooms had odd skylights near the ceiling which let in light at night  Unfortunately  the Cliffs  like a lot of these condo rentals  only has internet in the lobby  I don t understand why property managers are so chintsy about wireless internet  Serving travelers in the twenty first century is not the same as it was in the     s  but the owners of the Cliffs  the Grandview  and other locations in Las Vegas haven t quite caught on  In the future  I m going to be a lot more picky about basic amenities  and not settle for barely okay The beds were small and a little hard  
P =>  Great location and services It is at the great location and close to lots of big places like target  wal mart  My son loves the chuckncheeses  It is at the residential area outside the strip and it is very convenient to go to the busy strip  We have a large   bedroom condo with all the kitchen stuffs such as microwave  dishwasher  washer  dryer  stove  gas stove and oven  They provide others such as dishwasher detergent  laundry detergent etc    Problem  although it is about     years old  the carpet should be replaced   My wife saw   cockcroaches during the stay  I was unwilling to walk on bare foot and if you walk with the socks on  the socks will become dirty quickly  The weather was very hot    s and   s  and the air condition is sufficently cool the rooms except the noise is quite loud  Even though it is an exchange timeshare  we did attend another timeshare talk etc etc so we can get the discounted show in LV strip  They aren t very pushy since they understand our situation  You can use the internet room near the reception or you can try those unsecured wireless network somewhere        Parking is  kind of  covered so you do not have to worry about the extreme heat  The receptionists are very helpful and did their best to answers the questions we have  You can rent the DVDs out free of charge  The pool and spa are excellent way to relax  We spent     hours and we were very dark  
P =>  Wonderful Cliffs Second visit in three years to the Cliffs  RCI Points  and will not be our last Wonderful stay  Rooms as before clean and very spacious  and LOVE the fact that you have your own wahing machines There is no need to hire a car as you are very near to shops and restaurants  recommend Egg Works  best breakfast  and the Italian  can t remember the name  Use the shuttle to go in and out of Vegas  and its so nice to come back and jump in the hot tub Already making plans to return in       
P =>  Nice condos This is an attractive property on a quiet street west of Las Vegas  We rented a two bedroom condo in  for four nights  and it was large  spacious and beautifully decorated  The beds were comfortable  the air conditioner worked great  there were three televisions and a DVD player  a portable stereo  and the kitchen was very well equipped  No complaints about the property or our accommodations  We attended the sales pitch for the timeshare  and received some great free tickets and meal vouchers for our time  We also spent an enjoyable morning at nearby Red Rock Canyon which had some lovely scenery However  the Cliffs at Peace Canyon staff needs a serious lecture on customer service  I laid down for an afternoon nap since we had tickets to a very late show  My husband went to the lobby reception building to use the free computers they provided  A short time later he returned to our unit  which I had unfortunately locked from the inside out of force of habit  Unable to enter with his key  he returned to the reception desk  explained that he was locked out  and asked to be let inside The staff was completely indifferent to his situation  and refused to help in any way  telling him they did not have a pass key on the premises  oh  please  I was born at night but it wasn t last night   He had his photo ID  and would have been willing to wait patiently if they had offered any assistance at all  They allowed him to wander around in near     degree heat for over an hour banging on the door and phoning the unit while I slept away in the bedroom  Finally he banged hard enough on the bedroom window to awaken me  Despite this property s lovely spacious accommodations and reasonable price  I am unable to recommend it because of this incident  What if I had fallen in the shower  or had a heart attack  and was lying inside on the floor and no one would let my husband inside the unit  The staff s attitude and actions represent a dangerous and irresponsible policy  
P =>  A nice place We stayed here in ch  There was a total of   of us including two children and an infant  We had Two  BD condos  It was a very nice place  The furnishings are very cozy  We had king size beds        bathrooms  three tv s  a cd player boom box  a dvd player a fully equipped kitchen and etc  I personally didn t go swimming or take in any of the other amenities  Our kids did and loved it  We were busy going to strip everyday  We rented a car which made it very easy to get around  There are lots of shopping around  A Target down the street  A Walmart about    minutes or so away  We found a mall called Meadows Mall this one was probably about    minutes or more away  The front staff at this place are very friendly  They even recommended a great place for breakfast it was called Eggworks  The prices were very reasonable   st   for some that don t mind walking  When going to the strip park at the Luxor  You can always get parking there and it s not too busy  We did attractions at some of the resorts on the strip   nd tip  To save money you can buy an attraction pass which can get you into attractions free  The pass is called Visit ticket  You can get it for one day or a week  We had it for two days  It s well worth the money  Overall  we enjoyed the trip and the resort great for the stay  Definitely recommend to all  
P =>   Loved this place We stayed here for three nights            We were in Vegas for the first time with our two children ages     amp      We found the place no problem thanks to our GPS in the rental car  It is about    minutes from the strip  The lobby was really nice  There was a pool table  internet room  and another room off to the side with a large tv and couches  Also had free coffee and tea  The front desk staff was very friendly  We were able to pick our two bedroom unit for what was available  I could have had one overlooking the beautiful pool  I thought it would be to noisey so I went for a quiet one in the back  It was very quiet until about   am when the airplanes started taking off from the airport  There is a big controversy in Vegas right now about the FAA allowing the airplanes to make a right hand turn over residential neighborhoods to ease congestion  That is probably what was happening to us  I haven t read anyone else complain about noise from the airport so this must be something new  It wasn t all that bad and I would stay here again in a minute  There was a washer and dryer in the unit which was a great convenience  They supplied two boxes of Tide and if you needed more which I did you could buy it from the front desk for      a box  The shuttle ran only to the Belagio and you had to make reservations to take it  It ran until      am  We didn t use that  We had a rental car and it was very easy to get onto the strip  No problem to get there and back  My kids used the pool and jacuzzi on our first night there  They said the pool was warm which is rare  They enjoyed it  The unit is supplied with plenty of towels for bath and pool use  They also supply dishwashing soap  papertowels  etc  There is so much shopping only blocks away  Went to a super Walmart and got what we needed  I had some minor issues with a broken hairdryer which they came and fixed immediately  Our dvd player was on so our tv was snowey  They came right up and took care of that  If you want to rent a safe which I suggest you do it s only       for your entire stay  I had a problem programming it and I called the front desk  Someone was there in less than   minutes to help us out  We went to Red Rock Canyon which is about    minutes away  This is a great place to stay if you re looking for a quiet  comfortable  clean place to stay off the strip  Book this place  You won t be sorry 
P =>  fantastic vacation at the cliffs great place to stay   off the strip   i rented a car for       at priceline and really enjoyed the experience   close to the new red rock casino and no more than    min to the airport or the strip   it was a blast   the staff was superior and attentive   the grounds were super clean and the rooms were well appointed and cleantry the roadrunner and the sedona   restaurants   they were very good   the roadrunner is casual and reaonsble with huge portions   so you can easily split meal and the sedona is a fine dining establishment owend by andre agassi   super service and food   
P =>  Beautiful resort wonderful vacation  This resort was beautiful and very well kept  It is located about    minutes west of The Strip  by car   straight down Flamingo Road  There is TONS of shopping in the area   anything you need is in easy reach The units are very large and clean  We had no problems at all  I recommend you use a car for the area  depending on how you vacation   that way you can explore the full potential of the area  like Red Rock Canyon  only    minutes away  or Hoover Dam  only    minutes away from the resort  We didn t use the free shuttle  There s a nice pool area and fitness room  and you can rent free movies at the front desk for those off nights when you re not seeing a show Do not book your shows ahead of time  Use the TIX TONIGHT locations and get them at discounted prices  We saved big time on David Copperfield and Cirque s Mystere  That s definitely your best bet  Unless a certain show isn t discounting  you can get good seats at discounted prices to probably     of shows in Vegas on any given night with this company Oh yeah  and if you plan on going on the brand new Skywalk at Grand Canyon West  it is NOT just park there  spend     a head and walk on this thing   you have to buy a package to GET there by bus for     a head  then buy your     admission to the Skywalk ON TOP of that  Total is around     a head to walk on the Skywalk  which is a HUGE rip off  Go all the way to Grand Canyon Nat l Park instead or the North Rim to see the Grand Canyon  The Hulapai dropped the ball on this one  Many people were not happy with the setup at all  
P =>   top notch time share my wife and i stayed here with our   and   year old for a week through our rci exchange  we happened to stay the same week nascar was in town  we have used our rci exchange for    years and stayed in tons of resorts  the cliffs is definately a super place to bring small kids  the pool area is perfect for smaller kids  nice hot tub  attractive fountains in pool  the resort staff and facilities are above standard  the rooms are very comfortable  properly supllied  and clean  we stayed in a two bedroom  which was like a two bedroom apartment  very nice  the resort is close to tropicana and flamingostreets which take you east to the strip in about fifteen minutes  the     is directly east and gets you to the strip in ten to fifteen  you can choose the     in non rush conditions  and the streets for rush hour  lots of shopping  grocieries  and food near by  overall  the cliffs is     out of    for us  the resort offers a well maintained facility with a great  secure  comfortable place for a family with young kids  definately talk to the resort concierre  she is great and will hep you plan your vegas strip day trips  
P =>  Very clean and has everything We got a  BR  BA condo here and love it  The place is very clean and comfortable and makes us feel at home  
P =>   A relaxing stay Just got back from a   day stay at the Cliffs  This is a great  relaxing place to stay  and we would recommend it to anyone  It is close to great restaurants and shopping  and it is far away from the hustle and bustle of the strip  which I think is tacky and hectic  but close enough to it and the airport that it isn t a major hassle to get there  We went to Red Rock Canyon one morning  which is only    minutes away  I highly recommend it even if you are just going on the scenic drive  Stop in the visitor center and ask about Mojave Max  the turtle   The condos are very nicely done  clean  and it was quiet and relaxing  Having a kitchen and larger area than a typical hotel would have was very nice  The hot tub was great  we went two of the nights  The clubhouse was nice and so was the internet access computers  I do wish they offered wireless over the entire complex  It is only around the clubhouse  which is OK  but not too convenient  
P =>   What a Great Place to Stay I stayed here in ust       My partner had time share that we used for the first time in Vegas  This place is   mins from the strip and there is a free shuttle every hour until   pm  The bus also takes you to the local supermarket every    mins  If you stay late then it is only     from the strip The apartment was great it had lots of space  air conditioning that worked very well  The staff were great  avoid the time share sales pitch  You are away from the strip which at first I thought was going to be a bad point in the end it was a positive  After   hrs on the strip to get away was great  I must mention the bus drivers who were really great  friendly and always smiling especially Billy  They have two pools the smaller of the two must be about    degrees  fantastic For anyone who wants to do Vegas and have peace and quite try this place  One tip when going from the airport to the hotel grab a limo instead of a taxi the cost will still be the same around     but if there is more than   you ll save money and if there is only   of you its still more fun and a great way to arrive for the same cost  
P =>  Home away from Home Our family of four had the pleasure of spending a week in a lovely   bedroom suite at this resort  We found while the suite was not as spacious as others we have been at  the layout made up for it  The master suite was located at the opposite end so as to allow the adults a little privacy  Furnishings were nice  decor tastefully done    wouldn t mind having their decorator visit my place  Beds were very comfortable   we learned they replace the mattresses every couple of years and ours had just been done  Kitchen was well stocked and had everything we needed  The resort had a number of movies for loan and this was one thing they could improve on   most were always rented  The hotel provides free shuttle to the strip which is a fairly good distance  so we made us of that and avoided the whole hassle of parking  etc  Never had a problem getting on the shuttle we wanted eventhough it seemed to be a busy week at the resort  The pool area is small but adequate  The hot tub is HOT to the point of being uncomfortable in the daytime    it was comical to see people s faces as they checked out the temperature for the first time  The resort is located in burbs and so a car really is a must unless you plan to spend the entire time on the strip resort  There are a number of smaller box stores within a short drive that offer some more reasonable shopping prices  All in all  if we returned to Vegas  would definetly consider staying there again  
P =>   Cliffs at Peace Canyon   Wonderful Time My husband and I stayed at the Cliffs at Peace Canyon from ober    through ember         through RCI  We arrived in Las Vegas around noon  so we walked on the Strip  and before you knew it  it was time to check in  The Lobby at the Cliffs at Peace Canyon is very small  I think it is the smallest lobby I have ever been in  but service was excellent  We were assigned a unit immediately  We got a unit on the first floor just a few steps from the Front Desk and clubhouse  I really enjoyed that  We had a   bedroom unit  and it was beautifully decorated and had absolutely every appliance and cooking utensil you could ever need  The Master bedroom had a huge walk in closet  but you had to walk into the large Master bathroom to access it  That would be my only complaint  If the doors to the closet were in the bedroom  the room would have been perfect  If one of you is using the toilet  the other person can t get into the closet  I have an issue with someone entering the bathroom while I am using the toilet   The timeshare is about    minutes away from the strip  It takes longer to get back to the resort around rush hour  It was not too far away  although I would not want to stay any further away from the strip  This was our  th trip to Las Vegas  and because it was not right on the strip  this allowed us to do other activities besides gambling  We visited Hoover Dam  the Ethel M Chocolate Factory and Red Rock Canyon  I enjoyed going to the pool every morning  The pool is also very small  but there were always lounge chairs available and the area was never crowded  The jacuzzi was larger than most and the water was hot and the jets had perfect power  There is always coffee available for free in the lounge right off the Main Lobby  On Tuesday evening  the resort provided gambling lessons with a professional craps dealer  My husband picked up some tips  and he used it while playing blackjack  The gambling tips really worked  They also have bingo a few times a week  and the concierge helps out with some vacation tips also which was very useful  Other than that  there are no other activities  The Orleans casino is very close to the resort and so is the Red Rock Casino  I enjoyed both casinos  The resort is right in between Tropicana and Flamingo Roads  so you could drive down either street to try to avoid Las Vegas Blvd traffic as often as possible  There was absolutely no problem at check out either  I had such a relaxed  enjoyable vacation and I would recommend this resort highly  
P =>  Great place to relax  It is a great stay unless you like to party on the strip during the late night cab from the strip is about    dollars because the shuttle only runs until       am 
P =>   Pros  Just returned from my first trip to Vegas  Stayed at The Cliffs  Found the resort to be very nice  Very clean and comfortable  For those of you who enjoy the hustle and bustle of being on the strip  The Cliffs probably wouldn t be for you  It s approx     minutes away There are many shops and restaurants in the area  I would highly recommend Shucky s  The one time I ate there everyone in my party enjoyed their meal A bit of advice      don t book any excursions i e  trips to the Grand Canyon  etc  through the concierge at The Cliffs  They drastically inflate the price  We booked our own excursion  were more than pleased with it and it was less than      I would definately recommend The Cliffs at Peace Canyon  
P =>  quiet place off the strip beautiful grounds  close to so many food places and shopping  great staff and tastefully decorated condos  Great for those traveling on business  There is no wireless access in the rooms but they do have a computer room with wireless internet access  This facility is located in the middle of a very nice new neighborhood  It is located right down the street from a same day cleaners  carwash  super walmart   ross and tonsssss of new places to eat    i will be staying there again      everytime i come here on business  For the ladies there are quite a few new nail salons located close byalso on Tropicana and Fort Apache  I found it easier to take the     west and exit on Tropicana rather than taking tropicana all the way up to grand canyon  But if you are visiting the strip just take tropicana west  all the way to grand canyon and turn right  Enjoy    
P =>  LOVED CLIFFS AT PEACE CANYON    We stayed here the week of           on our wedding trip  We had a   bedroom condo and had my husband s parents and my   year old daughter  We wanted to stay off the strip because we were there to get married and wanted to be able to get away when we needed to get away  The room was breathtaking  The layout and design is absolutely beautiful  I cannot say enough about how comfortable it was to have   people in one condo   even for a wedding  although  we did stay on the strip for our wedding night   The drive is about    minutes from the strip and they drive crazy out in Vegas when you are from GA  HAHA  You ll want to rent a car and you ll want to visit Red Rock Canyon which is nearby  The area is really beautiful and there are lots of good restaurants close so you don t have to pay strip prices too eat  I didn t swim at the pool  but it looked beautiful  The staff was very accomodating and treated us like we were the only ones in Vegas getting married   By the way  I recomend the A Special memory Chapel if you plan to get married there   it isn t cheesey and was beautiful and sent a limo all the way out there for me etc   We declined the presentation and they never mentioned it again  The room did not have free internet  so be prepared if you need it  The TV s were huge  the furniture was beautiful  Overall  we ll probably drive the distance and not stay on the strip next year like we did this year  This condo is GREAT  We did have issues with the neighbors making too much noise one night  they were actually quite rowdy and on the balcony right outside our window   the night before our wedding   The walls are a little thin  We called the front desk and they immediately took care of it  We never heard them again  
P =>  Away from Chaos  We stayed e      y  th and we were so pleasantly surprised  After reading several negative reviews we began to wonder what our HOME property was really like after several years of not visiting  It was awesome  They are required to upgrade every   yrs and we had brand new mattresses in the rooms which was awesome  Pillow top I might add  They are standard queens  not doubles like folks write about  but that s ok  they were great  We loved the big bathroom in the Master bedroom and the kids loved the sitting area in the  nd bathrooom shower  Being able to eat a bowl of cereal when we wanted was nice  Several nice shopping and eateries are around there  Target  Sears Grand  Grocery Stores  Nail Spa Salons  Conveniences of home without all the CHAOS on the strip  We were a mere       minutes from the strip  depending on traffic  but we took either Tropicana all the way in or Flamingo  Several other streets off the main strip also made it easy to go around traffic to get home  We took the shuttle one day  dropped off at Bellagio and returned back to the Cliffs later that evening  made for such a nice day w o the car issues  We planned out everyday to see all hotels that had KID related activities and kept one day just as an adult day  Kids stayed in the very secure condo with security      that was VISIBLE  The recreation room is up front where you have staff and the pool is small enough to just be comfortable  
P =>  will never stay on strip again My wife and I stayed in a two bedroom for five days  we had never stayed off strip before but after this experience we will definately return off strip again  TRANSPORT to and from  shuttles run to the Bellagio from    am to midnight hourly  a return from the Bellagio from      am to      am hourly  on arrival we cabbed it from the airport to the resort    USD   if you cab it to the Bellagio and grab the shuttle it will only cost you    USD cab fare and shuttle tip  you have to reserve shuttle space so call in advance to book it  You can also grab the shuttle to do grocery shopping and to the Freemont experience  There is also a shuttle to the Suncoast casino which leaves     am and returns at     or     pm  we did not find this gaming establishment to our liking and would not recommend it  better to grab a cab and go to the redrock  much nicer establishment  Area     minute car ride without trafic  to strip aka Las Vegas Blvd  down Flamingo road  Plenty of restaurants  bars  shops and food  booze shopping within walking distance  or shuttle on those     plus days  We felt like we were in a tropical resort during the day while still being out doing shows and gaming at night  ROOM  we had a two bedroom    bathroom apt with queen size beds  being happily married and still young enough to get wild we used the master with the attached bathroom  huge walk in closet and safe     USD for the week   the second bathroom was nice when we took seperate quick turn around showers  The kitchen was fully equipped with gas stove  oven  microwave  fridge with icemaker  dishwasher  every countertop appliance you need  plenty of cooking pots and utencils  flatware  and cutlery  they even thought of large plastic poolside glasses for those tropical drinks ooh lala  There is a lunch counter with   stools  a dining table seating   and a large sectional couch seating    sofabed pullout   There is a laundry room in the apt with full size washer dryer  iron and board  can anyone say carry on luggage only woohoo   The porch  balcony has a table and two chairs and offers enough privacy to sip coffee in your boxers without showing off those extra pounds to the neighbor  All in all the rooms are a good size  very clean and well equipped  we did brekkie and lunch there and dined out for dinner  PLEASE REMEMBER THIS IS A NON SMOKING ESTABLISHMENT  smoking is permitted out of doors so kindly ask for ashtrays and smoke on your balconies NOT IN THE ROOMS  that is what we did  mmmmm caffine and nicotine in my boxers on the balcony   plenty of our neighbors were doing the same   FACILITIES  the facilities were clean and well maintained  the photo you see on the net is the lobby  no cathedral ceilings in the rooms  there is a small pool table adjacent to the reception  a game room with tv and a meeting room  The pool area was clean with plenty of chaises longues and tables and chairs  smoking permitted  but  please ask for an ashtray which they are more than happy to supply  The cross shaped hottub is large with good heat but below average jets  the pool    am to midnight  was similarly shaped but OMG it was WAYYYY too cold  I am Canadian and even I suffered major shrinkage  there is a sound system but you have to ask them to turn it on   which we only figured out on our last day  There is a nice size workout room with treads  steps  frees and universals  There is no restaurent on site or ice near the pool  STAFF  very frindly and helpfull staff  shuttle drivers are great   Hey Craig   all you have to do is ask   MISC INFO  Best gamingfor us means a fighting chance and great atmosphere  Bellagio  lovely atmospere plenty of tables  pleasant dealers  piped musac  awesome buffet     USD p p   older crowd     something like us  plenty of drinks   quot O quot    in our opinion  rd best cirque de soleil we have ever seen   and we have seen them all  MGM  great tables  very friendly dealers  mixed crowd  very nice atmosphere  moderate drink replenishment  Rainforest cafe  huge portions dont even think about an appetizer unles you are planning to shlepp your entree in a doggie bag  cost    usd    entrees  and   appetizers both barely half finished and left behind included is tip    quot KA quot  by far the best cirque de soleil show  NOT TO BE MISSED      My jaw was open for the entire show  words cannot describe this total experience good for ages    and up NEW YORK NEW YORK  Fun Fun Fun  Set up like Brooklyne  all indoors  pedestrian mall and entrance to roller coaster        USD per ride  you have to look for a good table great live bands all night  we had a blast although we only broke even  had to move twice   dealers not terribly helpfull unless you consider doubling on a   when the dealer shows a face good advice  Plentifull drinks  my glass was replaced without being finished or me asking all night  nor my wife   We ate at the Mexican restaurant  great food and Don io tequila to boot  shared a combo platter appetizer  taco platter  roasted pork  and   margaritas    USD with tip and plenty of left overs  yup we never learn    quot  Zumanity quot   cabaret style show  Worse show ever  hated it  found it outdated by about    years  acrobatics were tired and old  there were some very funny comedy scenes but that is about it  The contortionist grossed me out          and the We can party with the best of them but the only reason we didn t walk out was out of respect for the performers  If you want to see cirque see the other shows  if you want to see       sex go to a strip joint  This formula was a dismall failure in our opinion and a waste of     USD p p  ADVISE  many of the casinos are sistered so take the time to get a players card  we always get comped with free rooms  meals shows  etc  You do not need to play with mega k s to get freebees in vegas  just play reponsibly with what you are prepared to lose  If you follow that advise you will always leave Vegas with a smile and great memories  
P => Excellent timeshare Our family of   stayed at the Cliffs from ch              We found the  BRDM accomodations very comfortable  nicely furnished and spacious and no smell of cigarette smoke  The bed and pillows were so comfortable  Unit had fully stocked detergent kitchen supplies and we used the outdoor BBQ grill once  Plenty of towels especially for use at the jacuzzi pool and workout room  The location was    minutes from the strip     minutes from Red Rock to go hiking and golfing  With a car we were able to drive to most locations  Their computer room was down for   days during our stay  We would stay here again in the future  
P => Great for business I was recently here attending a conference held at the JW riot about   miles away  What a nice surprise   an immaculate   bedroom unit w full kitchen   My unit seemed brand new with fairly high quality furnishings  tiled floors and a small balcony  As someone who has stayed in a zillion hotels over the years  places like this are my favorite because they feel more like home and are easier to both work in and relax than a cramped hotel room  Bring your own coffee and shampoo conditioner  they do provide soap  The Cliffs was close to my conference and near a wide choice of shopping plazas all along Fort Apache Rd nearby  Whole Foods  Barnes  amp  Nobles  GAP  Banana Republic  as well as A Target  Sears and Mervyns literally next door  For the purpose I was staying for  it was perfect  A caveat though   it is in a residential area far from the Strip  You would positively need a rental car and if you are coming to Vegas for the action of the Strip  this will not do it for you  
P =>  I was pleased  I recently stayed here while attending a proffesional conference and for the most part I enjoyed my stay  The room was spacious  clean  and well equipped  There was plenty of room for our small baby in the pack n play that they provided  One large tv and another in th ebedroom   a sectional couch that was a hideaway  washer dryer with detergent  iron board  Everything we needed  I will say that about half of the staff at the desk were unfriendly and short with me for no reason  The computers were usually  quot offline quot   Very nice heated pool with hot tub  About    minutes form the strip     minutes from Redrocks Canyon  Bottom line is that I would recommend it and return  however  don t expect the  quot Vegas Treatment quot  by the front desk  
P => What a horrible resort  This is the worst resort I have ever stayed at  We stayed in a two bedroom for one week  The first thing I noticed when I walked in the door was a FOUL ODOR  The living room furniture  bedding and garbage disposal smelled  The odor stayed with us for the entire trip  We sprayed disinfectant spray everyday to make the smell manageable  along with opening all the windows The living room furniture looked like they bought it at a second hand store  The kitchen stools and coffee table were falling apart  I was afraid to put anything on the table in fear of the table falling over  We alerted the front desk twice for this problem  Maintenance had to come twice  Front desk informed me that they are working on putting better tables in the livingroom The master bedroom was a small box with a double bed  not a queen size like the resort states  The bedroom closet is in the bathroom  The Cliffs is located    minutes from the strip  No coffee  shampoo  lotion amenities  the unit has a dial up internet  The bathroom is normal size that you would find at a Motel    No whirlpool bathtub  The Washer slowly pours warm water instead of hot water  The Dryer takes longer to dry than a typical Dryer  Our unit had a view of a street in the middle of construction  Finally the pool is much too small  Bottom line  Don t stay at the Cliff s until they renovate  Vegas has much better resorts than THE CLIFFS AT PEACE CANYON  
P =>  Cliffs   Peace Canyon   Accomodations  My husband and I celebrated New Year s Eve and welcomed      in Las Vegas and it was awesome  We arrived New Year s Eve at   n and had a great stay through    th  Since we have been to Vegas before and stayed on the strip  we wanted something a little more relaxing and cozy for we were celebrating our anniversary  We were fortunate to have the accomodations at the Cliffs Peace Canyon  which was a very elegant   bedroom   bath condo with a fireplace and balcony overlooking the pool and seeing the mountains from our balcony  The condo was fully furnished which provided us with plenty of flexibility since our stay was for a week  The area in which this is located is upcoming and and near Red Rock Canyon  Plenty of places to eat  shop  and sightsee  Eventhough we had a car rental for the week  we took advantage of the daily shuttle to the strip  especially on NYE  We will definitely stay here again for our future trip to Vegas  The trip to Red Rock  Hoover Dam  and South Rim  Grand Canyon was AWESOME  Can t wait to return  By the time we return to Vegas  the new Red Rock Casino will be opening which will be nice for those nights in which you want to go out but may not want all of the lights and action of the strip  Great place to spend a week s vacation  I do have photos but unable to post at this time  Plan to do so at later date  
P =>   Outstanding value at the cliffs I stayed here with a colleague for the duration of the consumer electronic show and got a fully equipped two bedroom apartment for the same price that I paid for an average room at the Golden Nugget this time last year  Fixture and fittings are clean and of good quality with beds that drew no compaints  The fully equipped kitchen was a boon and the management had thoughtfully provided some basic supplies for the dishwasher  washing machine and both bathrooms which was really welcome after a long haul flight but for extras there are supemarkets very locally and a huge Sears just built down the street  The staff were friendly and efficient with particular praise for Danny the concierge who very kindly retrieved my watch for me when I left it behind  Although I would agree that the internet room was very hot and wireless access would be nice  at the price and condition of the property  who could complain  I ll definately be back again next year   
P =>   Does what it says on the tin Located just        minutes from the strip  I stayed for the duration of CES at the begining of uary  Situated within pleasant gardens featuring swallowmeknob plams and suculents it gave the location a quite feel  this may change in the high season  The appartment was near to stores etc  and just a    minute drive from Red Rock Canyon which is best viewed just after sunrise Previous reports of hard beds etc   were not founded in the appartment I satyed in  although television reception was patchy at times  I can also confirm that the PC internet room was excessively hot  and did not supply any comfort  Reception staff were pleasant and helpful 
P =>  Exceeded expectations Stayed at Cliffs during Consumer Electronics Show when all the downtown hotels were sold out or       night  Brought my wife and two small kids  Based on photos  amp  reviews posted here  I was prepared for cookie cutter  standard quality apartments with tired furnishings  Was pleasantly surprised  The unit was clean and furnishings were upscale and like new  very much like a nice hotel  The pool was nicely heated     degrees  so that even during the first week of uary it was pleasant  especially with the hot tub nearby  The place was well maintained  The location  well off the strip  turned out to be an advantage  a laid back side of Vegas I never knew existed  more like Scottsdale or Palm Springs  but with the strip close enough for when we needed it  
P =>  better than average My wife and I just got back from a week in Las Vegas and found the facility overall pretty good  The rooms are spacious and everything was very clean and quiet  They provided dishwasher and laundry soap  The furnishings are getting a little tired but from what we understand they are in the process of updating the units  The pool area and work out room are very good  The location requires you to have a car but being away from the strip is not all bad  The only problem we really encountered was access via the gate after hours  the card system is not that easy to use and the telephone help wasn t very good either Good over all location  close to great golf and Red Rock Canyon which was worth while to see  We would go back without giving it a second thought  
P => Apt  living but not a resort The units are very nice  but not five star  The staff was friendly  but did not know the area well  They had no clue about any running trails and there was one right down the street  The pool was too small for the number of people there  We tried to go to the pool in the day  but it was full  At night  it was wide open and made for some nice romantic nights  They have a great b que pit and fire place  We also enjoyed the internet access and mid week maid service  The construction noise is terrible across the street a new mall is being built at   am the work starts and last into the night  If that did not wake you up the nice big dogs in the neighborhood were up everyday and late into the night I could not see any palm trees or a good view from my condominium as other reviewer have raved  HOWEVER  there is a great view of a dangerous intersection next door and provide for some nightly entertainment from the near misses WARNING gt  gt  gt my daughter and a friend caught the shuttle to the strip  At   in the morning when they wanted to return they tried several taxi for an hour and they refused to take them  because it was to far out  Finally  they found one and it got lost even though my daughter had the exact address and cross streets Overall it is a good value  but not a resort  
P =>  Far Away and a mighty hard bed  WE stayed for a week in a two bdrm unit with my sister and her husband  It was roomy and had all the amenties  washer dryer full kitchen two baths tv nice furnishings but a bit worn  The thing I hated was the beds were SO uncomfortable  Hard and worn out  Didn t get a decent night s sleep the whole week  The condo is miles from the strip just so you know  
P => Nice Getaway  
P =>  awesome resort  
P =>  Excellent resort    minutes from the Strip  
P =>  Swaying Palms Beautiful Landscaping   A Truly Refreshing Escape  
P =>  Vacation with Kids

P => 
P =>  Enjoyed my stay Very Much We stayed at this  quot Resort quot  and yes i do agree with the other reviews  this was not like any resort i have stayed in before  However  it did the job  the staff was absolutely excellant to us and the Pool and Jacuzzi were very nice  We stayed in Building   and had no problems I feel like the room did it s job  When we walked in it was clean and big  The Hotel does charge a resort fee  so we put the do not disturb sign up  we stayed from ober   until the  th  when we needed new towels we brought them to housekeeping and asked for new towels  and brought extra small bags for garbage  from home  and threw it in the dumpster  The room was sufficient  it had a blow dryer  iron and ironing board  toaster  coffee machine  refigerator  microwave  and utensils  plates  and glasses  It also had dish wash cloth s and soap  There was   of us and we had a   person room  So there was no couch  but we did bring an air mattress  sheets and blankets  Ok Food wise  We didn t want to spend so much money on the strip every night so we went to Taco bell  which was   minutes walking distance   also a little spanish deli and got some Breakfast Burritos        each    There was also an AMAZING pizza place in the little center next to the hotel  It was called Payless Pizza  looks can be decieving  people a little grungy  But honestly very good pizza and salads  We mostly ate off the strip and went to Cesars Palace Buffet the last night  it was about        and offered king crab legs and shrimp cocktail  unlike other buffets  Activities and Shuttles  The Shuttle ran every    minutes  Once to drop off at Tropicana the other to drop off by Treasure Island  Ok we were really on a tight budget when we came to Vegas but we found out the Tropicana Hotel offers a free pull on a big slot machine outside  If you go to the promotion desk they give you     free  no money necessary  You put it in the slot machine and just play until your money is up or unless you hit big  which we did  and we cashed out  And other than walking aroung hotel to hotel to view how georgous they are that was preety much it  The Clubs were cool and also casinos were all the same We did go to the Grand Canyon tours one day  But make sure you don t just buy a ticket  everywhere you go there are coupons to pay less for the trip  It is a long ride and my suggestion to you is that if you got on the tour bus DON T go on the top deck  Get the table seats on the lower k  You have a long ride and comfort is key    Bring Snacks  a small blanket and be comfy Ok so that s all my advice that i can think of  I enjoyed my trip and hope that this does help people  
P =>  ent place for the price I stayed at the Club de Soleil for three days prior to a training seminar I had in Las Vegas  On the night I arrived  the resort did not have a room for me although I had called in to inform them that I would be checking in late due to a delay because of inclement weather I was sent to another hotel  which by the way I had to pay for the night there  I was very upset  The next morning  I went to the Manager and he apologized profusely and reimbursed me for the expense of the other hotel After this incident  I was given a nice room with a view of the pool  The facilities were clean and modest  The staff was very friendly and eager to help in any way they could  The facilities are a little ways from the strip but the shuttles are very good There are a variety of stores and restaurants located within walking distance  For the money I paid to stay there  I think I got my money s worth  I would stay here again  but I would make sure that they have a room for me  
P =>   Good value but trip started rough Three of us stayed here for a week in tember  We purchased the week as a getaway through Interval International  The experience started rough when we arrived to find out there weren t any rooms available     Minutes later we learned we would have to stay at another timeshare across town  The manager tried to explain the situation as  quot previous guests didn t check out as expected quot    but later she admitted the problem was with their reservation system that double booked many guests for that night We returned the following night to the timeshare  The room is adequately sized with a full kitchen  medium sized bedroom and livingroom and large bathroom  There is also a nice balcony  Our s faced the pool  The walls are a little thin  as we could here the people next door through the  quot lock out quot  door The timeshare is a      minute drive from most locations on the strip  Since parking is free at the major casinos  this was a great location Despite the very poor initial experience  I would still recommend this timeshare based on its value and location  
P =>   Great place to stay off the strip My family stayed here il       We have   boys ages       and    We booked a one bedroom suite and the adjoining one bedroom unit which meant we had two bedrooms  two baths  kitchen and living room  Our main unit also had a small washer dryer in it which was very convenient  We were very happy with the accomodations  Both units were well furnished  updated and clean  The full kitchen was fully stocked with dishes  plates and pots  The two king size beds were comfortable and there was a pull out couch as well  Both baths were equipped with jacuzzi tubs athough we did not use them  The hotel is located OFF the strip not far from the Orleans hotel  A short car ride gets you to the strip  We found this hotel to be a nice retreat from all the traffic of the strip  The hotel offers shuttle service but we did not use it as we had a rental car  Supermarkets are nearby and Payless Pizza is within walking distance  There was a pool and hot tub which was nice  There are also gas BBQ s located near the pool if you wanted to cook dinner outside  There is internet service which they charge     for the week  This was are only complaint as we feel that most hotels do not charge for the internet  The hotel has a game room which my kids enjoyed playing ping pong  We stayed in the building where you check in  there are two buildings located about     mile from each other   Security was good and entrance doors were kept locked requiring card key access  Our room was on the second floor facing the back of the building which we liked because the front of the building faced a busy road  Tropicana Ave   There was plenty of parking onsite  There is no maid service but you can request extra towels and soap  This was not a big deal for us as we have rented vacation units before and were not expecting maid service  There is a workout room onsite as well  Overall we were very pleased with our accomodations and would recommend Club de Soleil to others  
P =>   If you are looking for a quiet place off the strip this is a good choice  This time share resort is within walking distance of the Orleans Hotel and Casino  Albertsons Food store  amp  Walgreens are close and easy to find  as well as places to eat The front desk were welcoming and let us check in early   and printed our boarding pass for the trip home free of charge  The internet was an extra charge of     for the week  but the free shuttle to the strip and activities offered from the resort were great The units were a bit dated but the beds were very comfortable and it met our needs We own timeshares and although we have stayed in more luxury places  this was very comfortable and we enjoyed our time here  
P =>   Amazing Value for the Money Looking to avoid the robbery that occurs by hotels on the strip for weekend rates  I found a great deal on Club De Soleil off the strip  It is a time share facility that uses the off season to rent the rooms as a normal hotel  They have three choices of rooms  we took the one with a kitchen and jacuzzi tub  The place was clean  but there is no maid service when used as a hotel  You are welcome to call down for clean or additional towels  Also  there is a shuttle service that runs from the property to the strip area  but I did not use since I rented a car  The facility also has a heated pool and outdoor hot tub for everyone to use  Overall  a wonderful place to avoid the high cost of resort hotels on or close to the strip  
P =>  We d go back  We exchanged our timeshare through Interval International to stay here during Christmas break  For the most part  this place was very nice  Our unit at Club de Soleil had clean  comfortable rooms with a well stocked kitchen and a large bathroom with double sinks  The fireplace was a nice touch during the time we stayed here  We had sliding glass doors that led to a quaint little veranda with a table and two chairs  Check in was quick and the front desk people were friendly  Keep in mind that the resort was slow this time of year  The concierges were very nice and tried to be helpful  however they did give us some incorrect information  The negatives about this place are the lack of wireless internet service and the fact that they do not even have a computer for guests to use for free in the lobby  You have to pay to use the computer and the fees are expensive  Get with the times  Some other negatives are the lack of activities for guests  however  I can understand this because people do not go to Vegas to stay in their resort  I would also like to note that the location is on a busy street and is failry loud  This is a city so we did not mind  but if you are looking for a quiet place  this is definitely not quiet  Would we go back  Sure  Vegas is amazing  
P =>   Honeymoon We booked this resort from a listing on eBay and absolutely loved it  The suite was newly remodeled and very nice and clean  The resort offered a very convenient shuttle to the strip every hour between  am and  am  They also offered a shuttle to a nearby grocery store at  am  They had a concierge service in the lobby to help us plan our stay there  The pool was nice and although my husband enjoyed the hottub it was too hot outside for me to attempt it  I would most definitely stay at Club de Soleil again and again  
P => Nice quiet getaway My husband and I stayed at the Club de Soleil for three nights at the end of tember  Got an awesome deal from Expedia caThis property is time share but units are rented out  There was absolutely no pressure to buy from the salespeople who gave out welcome packages  There are   large properties located about   miles west of the Strip on W Tropicana  We stayed in a studio complete with comfortable king bed  comfy pillows  bath with jacuzzi tub and a window that actually opened  No maid service though if you re only staying   nights  The resort was quiet with a nice pool area  A shuttle arrived every hour to take you over to the Strip  The Orleans casino hotel is within walking distance of the property though  Overall no complaints  We d stay again  
P =>  Great stay but    This property was very nice  My wife and I along with another couple stayed in phase  of this property  I was impresed with the cleanliness and the overall accomodations  If you rent a car the grocery store Albertsons is right down the street on Tropicana Ave  It is a great store and open       There are shuttles to and from the strip but if you drive there is plenty of free parking at the Casinos  The only bad part was that my room was not ready when I arrived and we had to wait for three hours  However the staff did a great job in service recovery and gave us an upgrade to a connecting   bedroom  the whirlpool is a little high when getting into it  So if you re stiff you may have a small problem  Overall it was a great value  
P =>  Great if you plan to leave early on departure day  I stayed here for a girls weekend first weekend of il  There were   girls and plenty of room  For the price  it was well worth staying off the strip  We were out most of the time but when we were there it was very nice  clean and comfortable  This is actually my preference to a hotel  This property is great    just one complaint  Check out time is at   am    and they mean   am  At      am    someone will actually knock on your door asking if you are checking out  Nothing like feeling rushed out at the end of a vacation  I didnt see lines of people waiting for my room so what s the big deal  The sister property Tahiti Village is NOT like this  so although CDS is nice    the check out just irks me  Otherwise  great place   
P =>   Above average accomadations We stayed at Club de Soleil phase   and found all staff  amp  accomadations were above average  we had the two bedroom unit  lite noise from upstairs unit yes but no more then most hotel units  the free shuttle service they operate is very accomadating and it is nice to get off the strip and lounge by the pool  I would highly recommend Club de Soleil phase   or    
P =>   A Great Place to stay when in Las Vegas We spent one week at the Club de Soleil when we attended the Con Expo in Las Vegas this year  We shared the   B R condo with another couple  Both Bedrooms had King beds and whirlpool tubs  The  nd B R had its own separate entrance which makes it great for sharing with friends  Pool is open all night  but was never noisy The staff was very helpful and we had no problem with being approached for timeshare presentations once we advised them that we were not interested   Some places just don t take  quot no quot  for an answer   We stayed in Phase II  Rooms     and    A which looked over the pool area  The place was clean and attractive and when we needed additional kitchen accessories they were available upon request   Some items like pizza pans and cutter are available  but not in each room   just ask if you need something that isn t stocked   Each   B R unit had a Washer and Dryer in the larger side  They will furnish all the detergent you will need  so don t bother to try to figure out how to transport the liquids if flying The resort offered excellent shuttle service to two locations on the strip each hour as well as the grocery store each morning  There is a large grocery store a couple blocks from the Club de Soleil so we drove there  but it would be handy if you were traveling without a car  They also offer inexpensive side trips  I would highly recommend going to Red Rock Canyon and the Valley of Fire Park  Both locations were beautiful places to relax after spending time on the strip  The hiking trails are great We traded our Timeshare in Key West through Interval and would consider going to this same place again in   years for the next Con Expo in Vegas  
P =>   nice place to spend a week we are staying at the club du soleil and it is a very nice place  exceptionally clean  beautifully decorated with granite counter tops  professional quality pots and pans  loads of towels  fireplace  The shuttle is very convenient and has been exactly on time all week  the people were all very polite  there are the   complaints though     when we checked in early  pm we were told our room was not ready and we would be called when it was ready so we went to the orleans for a couple hours and came back at    regular check in time  we were told that our room would be ready in    mins only to wait for about an hour in the lobby finally after asking for the  rd time they let us go up to our room     walls paper thin lots of banging and nose blowing        no daily maid service unless you callwe have a   bedroom and would stay here again 
P =>   Excellent Place to Stay  I traded a time share for this unit  After I booked I read all of the negative reviews and I was thinking I made a mistake  This place was everything I wanted We had an excellent room       corner with view of Tropicana Avenue and the mountains  We rented the   bedroom unit with the kitchen  The bathrooms included a whirlpool tub and the master bath had two sinks with many drawers for storage  The beds were exceptionally comfortable with lots of pillows  We used the washer and dryer a few times as well and it worked great  Rooms were exceptionally clean  well stocked with kitchen items  and towels The weather was a little cool so we decided not to swim  I stuck my hand in the pool water and it was very warm  so we could have if we would have brought our bathing suits  I would recommend renting a car because it s a ways to the strip  The shuttle is great and we took it several times to the strip and then took a cab back  This property is within walking distance to the grocery store  Staff was really friendly and helpful  They even printed out my son s boarding pass ahead of time  This helped a lot because he wasn t checking any baggage and could go directly to security  They had a few days supply of coffee in the room  but they also had coffee in the lobby which was free  I would stay here again  
P =>   Good Deal We have been to Vegas numerous times but this time we decided to travel the  quot cheapo quot  way  We were able to get   nights free   Ok  nothings free but from attending the time share presentation  our   nights and      dinner gift certificate were free  Upon arrival to the Club  we began check in  We were traveling with another couple so we wanted our rooms near each other  not in separate phases  there are two building phases here and they are across the street from each other   Before arrival we did make requests through Consolidated Resorts but I guess they never made it to the hotel  After about     hours  they originally had us in the two separate phases   we finally made it into our connecting rooms in Phase    the older phase   The rooms were better than expected  We had the Lock off and our friends had the connecting   bedroom  Both were very nice rooms suites  The one bedroom had a full kitchen  small dining table with   chairs  living room with pull out couch  chair and TV  nice big bathroom and bedroom  Our lock off unit had a normal hotel sized bathroom  small kitchenette  no stove or oven  small table with two chairs for eating  and I believe a king sized bed  although the length felt more like a queen   As for the noise  we never heard anything from above  below  or on either side  The bed was very comfy  the towels were plush  and the room smelled clean  It was a very pleasant stay The hotel in the morning did offer complimentary coffee  hot chocolate  and tea  The free shuttle left on the hour starting at  am and returned back at       during the week and      on weekends  They either picked you up at NYNY  TI  or the Orleans casino  Considering the room was free  we did not mind the shuttle service but we do prefer staying on the strip and being able to come and go whenever we please instead of being on the hotels schedule Would we stay here again  probably not  we like being close to all the action  but for the thrifty traveler  this time share deal was great and very well worth it P S  The time share people were very convincing and pushy  Plan on being there for about   hours   not two if you are not going to buy  
P =>  Las Vegas Goodtime Excellent location  just off strip and within walking distance to necessities such as food  grocery store etc  Outstanding shuttle service  however must take into account the terrible traffic of Las Vegas  but still it is better than traveling on Las Vegas Blvd  The   bedroom suite was a vacation dream of a lifetime  yes there was the usual annoyances that you expect from hotels such as footsteps from room above etc  But overall the size  ammenities  and services provided far exceed the few annoynances  If you get a chance definitely take the Red Rock Canyon tour  you can t beat the price  
P =>  Would be ok except for ONE FATAL FLAW After reading reviews on TripAdvisor I was glad to snatch up a room for reasonable rates during the peak CES tradeshow Pluses  Away from the Strip  this could be a minus depending on your needs  but close enough to get there in   min drive  reasonably priced wireless Internet access  clean rooms  nice bathrooms Minuses  This is the fatal flaw  the room I was in had one of those shared doors with the room next door  It does a horrible job of sound insulation  I could hear the guests next door talking  as in I was able to understand all their words  I could hear them watching TV  I could hear them laughing and using the restroom  I m just glad I didn t hear them    you know  Not only that  the room above me had bad sound insulation as well  I could hear them tromping around like they were moving furniture Summary  With walls likely made of paper mache  I have to give this place a big thumbs down  Most people want rooms that are quiet   is that too much to ask  Apparently here it is  
P => Club de Soleil in ember My parents have a timeshare and they booked the Club de Soleil for a family vacation over New Year s Eve  We stayed in the two bedroom lock out unit  The resort is off the strip and if that doesn t bother you  I wouldn t hesitate to stay there  The units were clean and the staff very accommodating  Different activities are scheduled throughout the week and they offer a shuttle service to the nearby Orleans Casino and the strip  It wasn t warm enough to swim but the pool area looked nice  The condo was close to several restaurants  grocery and drug stores  
P =>   Needs help    I m surprised the reviews are so positive on this property    but there are two different parts to this hotel and we must have gotten the older  run down rooms  Everything was worn and dated  the cabinets in the kitchette were peeling  amp  the stove was pulled out  I guess they were working on it   It is one of the few properties in Vegas that have   bedroom suites w    baths Breakfast consisted of generic toaster waffles  you couldn t even put them in the toaster yourself  a staff member had to do it for you  and ice cream toppings  There were also some mystery meat sausages  not the standard breakfast variety It s pretty far off the strip   you ll do better if you have a car than if you try to make the shuttles work for you  
P =>  So Comfortable My husband andI traveled with friends  and all   of us had a great time  The resort was comfortable  exceptionally clean  great location  being off the strip is a plus   but close enough to enjoy it   I especially like the set up of the two bedroom suite  The fireplace was great to use at night  The shuttle buses were prompt  and driven by pure professionals  If you get the chance  check out the Red Rock Canyon tour given by Norm  You can sign up at the concierge desk  He is fabulous  and the cost of the trip  transportation  guide  and entrance to the park  was only TWO dollars  The trip is absolutely the best bargain in Vegas  I would not hesitate to stay here again  
P =>  Great Off Strip Resort My husband and I stayed at Club de Soleil for    days in ust tember      It is actually   separate resorts   Club   and Club    We stayed in a  nd floor unit in Club    While this part is lovely with a pool and tennis courts  the main part is Club   which houses the office staff and reception  We had some issues with regard to our unit  which was compounded by the fact that there were no staff onsite to assist  and we had to keep going to Club    I would therefore suggest that if you are going to book that you request a unit in Club   The large units themselves are extremely spacious with excellent facilities such as dishwasher  washing machine and dryer  spa bath  full stove with oven and everything needed supplied  including pool towels  washing powder etc  The only real negative I have is that the reception staff were not at all helpful  on occasions to the point of rudeness  Overall however this is a great resort  and we would definitely stay here again  
P =>  Nice accomodations little hassle When we traveled to Vegas from y      this summer  we stayed at Club de Soleil  We had two one bedrooms and two suites because there were   of us  The jacuzzi bath tub was great and the pool and spa were nice too  The kitchen and living room were very nice and the room came with a cd stereo which was great for the nights when I was getting ready for dinner or a night out and needed a little music to set the mood  There was also a DVD player just in case you wanted a break from the lights and slots  Half way through our stay we got a message that there was a leak and we needed to change rooms so they could fix it  That was a pain in the neck and there was nothing we could get comped because it was a timeshare  Also  they turned off the water one night from   p m  to   a m  because of a plumbing problem  Other than those two things  our stay was very nice and the accomodations were just enough  
P =>   A Good Place to Stay In spite of several of the photos and minor criticisms I will include  in honesty I would stay here again in a heartbeat  We were fortunate enough to get a  quot Strip View quot  room  there are very few  so request early if you want one  and virtually every part of our stay was positive  The room was clean  spacious  quiet  and well appointed  deck patio with table and two chairs  full kitchen  large bathroom with jetted tub  washer and dryer  iron and ironing board  fireplace  not needed as Vegas temps reached        tv in the living room and bedroom  DVD player in living room  as well as a small stereo With the exception of one concierge who was brusque  everyone was friendly and helpful  Parking is plentiful  covered  and patrolled by a security guardComplimentary waffles and sausages were served for breakfast Saturday  Sunday  and Thursday  The shuttle to the strip is a great service  and  not to be missed  for       per person  cheaper than if you take your own car   the guided trip to Red Rocks on an air conditioned bus  by the knowlegeable and amiable driver guide  Norm The minor criticisms  A surpising number of things seemed out of order and were not dealt with during the week we stayed  In fairness  none of these bothered me  as I wasn t interested in using any of them  but it seems like these should be addressed more quickly  All not working  one excercise machine  the lobby computer for guest usage  the DVD rental machine  and the water fountain at the pool  Also  as it was windy  the pool collected a lot of leaves and other tree debris  and by afternoon  the pool surface needed cleaning  The pool is not supervised  no life guard   but it is open       which is convenient  especially on warm or hot nights  At The Orleans  by contrast  the pool closes at      pm  which seems awfully early  and that is true at many of the strip casinos also In all  we enjoyed staying off the strip  You are only   miles from NY  NY   Excalibur   MGM Grand etc      minutes from Red Rocks  and less than an hour from Mt  Charleston Top flight  No  Perfect  No  But we liked it very well and it made our stay in Las Vegas all the more enjoyable  
P =>   loved it  I was a little worried about staying here after reading reviews on other sites  We were given this room by consolidated resorts in exchange for a timeshare presentation at Tahiti Village  We arrived on saturday to a very clean and beautiful   bedroom unit  It has a kitchen with a full size fridge  microwave and dishwasher  The living room area has a sofa sleeper  chair  fireplace  and a dining table with   chairs  The unit we stayed in had a small balcony that faced the parking lot  we never went out there cause it was too hot  but other units had the balcony facing the pool  The bedroom was large and clean  the only complaint I had was that the air conditioning didn t seem to cool the bedroom very well but froze you in the living room  The bathroom was large also very clean with a jacuzzi tub and doors to enter from bedroom or hallway  They give you plenty of towels for   people and   pool towels  In the hallway is a washer and dryer that I used every night  I hate the cigarette smells from the casinos  The pool was a good size  heated  the jacuzzi was a little too hot but we were in there at  am  The pools r    hours  The complex was very quiet and no one bothered us  It also has a tennis court and BBQ s but we did not use them  If you r staying for more than a couple of days I suggest you stop at the grocery store down the street and pick up some munchies  they have a shuttle to the store and casinos if you don t rent a car  If it is your first time in Vegas I suggest you rent a car  it s usually to hot and tiring to walk around  There are also plenty of Taxi s and limos but that can add up quick  I personally like downtown Vegas better that the strip 
P =>   Great for families Good for families  We went with our little boy and I especially liked that the pool and the hotel overall was quiet  The rooms were nicely decorated  large and had a nice bathroom with soaking Jacuzzi tub  They have an hourly shuttle to and from the strip which is nice since they are   miles away from  My one complaint is there is no food at the resort nor in walking distance  They do have an early am shuttle to the grocery store which is nice considering there was a full kitchen  
P =>   money stolen from room Just returned from holiday enjoyed nice week at club de saoleil Found accommodation very comfortable and no noise at all The site is a way off from the strip but found the shuttle busto be totaly reliable on time from the accommodatiom  nearly always ten minutes early away from pick up points my only complaint  fifty dollars stolen from my daughters purse accidentaly left out of the safe on a day we left very early for a day trip A formal report was made but notfollowed up as yet 
P =>  Nice comfortable stay   with all the amenities of home  We had an excellent stay here  My husband and I were traveling with our one year old infant  and the amenities of a full kitchen and washer dryer was an absolute must  We had plenty of room  and or son loved exploring the whole apartment  Walls are a little thin though  dishwasher noisy  and the washer is midget sized  but what do you expect in a hotel room  Staff was friendly and we hardly ever felt like we were in a hotel  DIstance from the strip is manageable  We rented a car because we had other business to attend to  but others said the shuttle was great  I would definitely recommend staying here    
P =>  Excellent Loved this resort  stayed in a two bedroomed unit with a lovely balcony and a great view of the mountains  Check in was fast and easy with very friendly staff  The unit was excellent with an abundance of towels and I really liked the small touches  i e  toiletries and washing powder  and the sweets on the pillow  Two bathrooms  one was huge with a spa bath  There was a great shuttle service which we used when we did not want to drive  the shutle went to the strip and the Orleans which was only a few minutes away  The morning shuttle to Albertsons was a great idea  There was even a trip to Red Rock Canyon for only     We visit Las Vegas every uary and have been for over    years and we find the strip a bit to busy so this was a perfect location although only a few minutes away from the strip  I highly recommend this resort  
P =>   Great time at Club de Soliel We spent a delightful week at the Club de Soleil  The condo was clean  well organized  and provided everything we needed for a week in Las Vegas  There are two bedrooms with two king size beds and two baths with a jacuzzi tub in each  The only minor complaint was the couch was getting old and sagging  It needs to be replaced  I did notice them bringing some new furniture into some of the condos  so maybe it is on their list to replace  I did note it on the evaluation form  The shuttle service was prompt and efficient  I do wish they would include a few more drop off locations  But it is free and convenient  One tour I would recommend to do that will take you out of Las Vegas is to go to Mt  Charleston  We drove up there one day for lunch  and it is a beautiful drive  The restaurant there has beautiful views  and the food is very reasonably priced for a tourist location  I would not hesitate to recommend Club de Soleil to anyone who is looking for a nice clean place to stay in Las Vegas  It is not on the strip  but is very convenient to most any place you would want to go  We had a rental car  but we didn t take it out some days as the shuttle was so convenient  
P =>   Week in Vegas  We spent t       on our honey moon in Vegas  We decided on this resort because of some of the reviews on here and its location off the strip  The room was nice  clean  and quiet  Basically our room had it all  laundry  kitchen  full size  Jacuzzi tub  air conditioning  several small appliances  bedroom  stereo    televisions and a nice balcony  The only draw back to the whole room was the lack of working power outlets in the kitchen    in the kitchen and   worked  That didn t cause a problem until you were trying to make coffee  toast and iron something  closest plug to the iron was in the kitchen   But that being said it was very minor in the whole trip  The pool is kept very clean  and at most times during the day you are pool side by yourself  Also on site is a tennis court  and again it is clean and the surface looks to be tended to  Because of the location off the strip they have several shuttles that will pick you up on the hour and drop you off at one of   hotels  They also shuttle you to the grocery in the morning  It seems like every shuttle we took was driven by Eddie  Now what a character  his stories and conversation sure made the rides fun  We rented a car on our trip and they had plenty of parking available  I would recommend if you stay here to try to rent a car  If you want to go somewhere other than the strip you would need to cab it every time if you don t have a car  and consider that you are     miles off the strip  Surrounding this resort are other resorts  and close by are some fast food places and a drug store and several convenience stores  So all in all I would stay here again  my trip was very satisfying and fun  If you want to relax and you don t want the hustle and bustle of the strip I would recommend this resort  
P =>  Nice Time This is a time share  however we were not hasseled and had a good time  We stayed   days  at this hotel it is located off of the main strip and is realatively small   La Quinta size  the rooms were great  ours had a great juccuzi tub and kitchenet  the hotel has a shuttle which leaves every hour to various spots on the strip  the shuttle was great and very punctual both ways  the shuttle will also take you to the store  we loaded up on fruit snacks  and drinks  the pool was nice  small but never crowded and you could always get chairs no matter what the time  there were avtivities to choose from we went on the fremont experience it was great We would go back  however we will go to mandalay bay first mostley because of the beach and pools  we were relaxed here 
P =>  Perfect Perfect Perfect My wife and I just came back from Vegas we stayed at the Club De Soleil  First let me say this  All the negative reports about this resort are untrue  The resort is modern  clean and well kept Our room was beautiful As soon as we checked in we were provided a welcome package that contained many deals and discounts The shuttle service was on time and they even provided a shuttle service every morning that will take you grocery shopping  The drivers were very courteous and informative  For example on the las vegas strip thier is a bus that will take you up and down the strip and even downtown all day long for   bucks  Its called the duece  I would have never known about if it were not for the drivers  Also they promote a trip to red rock canyon for   bucks  The driver Norm is fantastic  To be honest this trip is worth more than   bucks  Norm provides quality information about this historic part of our country  Club Desoleil is a top notch resort for families and couples To all of the people who posted negative comments go stay at the Wynn or the Bellagio where you can spend      bucks a night for a room and lobby madness  
P => Great place to be  My family and I  wife and   children  checked in on a Tuesday afternoon after a long drive from SoCal  Upon check in  the clerk stated that he was closing  and that I d have to walk across the street to the other reservation desk  I started to go  but about    feet out the door  I thought  quot this is wrong    quot   So  I walked back and asked the clerk to fire up the computers because I was not about to walk    minutes away while my family waited in the parking lot  Grudgingly  he checked me in We have a   bedroom timeshare at Club de Soleil which we purchased in ember      This was our first stay  The living room and bedroom were very clean  as was the kitchenette  The bathroom was large  and had a jacuzzi bathtub  The kitchen was fully stocked with all cooking utensils  as well as a coffee pot  large refridgerator  dishwasher  and microwave The staff was helpful  I called for extra blankets and pillows at       p m   and they showed up within    minutes The kids used the pool  I used the gym  which had free weights and a universal gym  There were TV s in both the living room and the bedroom  a vcr was also available in the living room The fireplace was a nice touch  although it definitely is just for looks  and not for heat  Wireless internet was available at       day  or     for   days A grocery store is available further west on Tropicana  and there s a Walgreens and Starbucks nearby  Overall  it was a very pleasant experience  with none of the previous post s complaints about loud salesmen  I will be visiting again for Memorial weekend  
P =>  Good for a Getaway not so much for a trade in I will start this review by saying that I m a riott owner  so like some other reviewers  I have come to expect a certain level of service  ammenity  and quality for the places that I trade my timeshare in for  That said  I got my week through Interval as a Getaway  which means that I didn t have to trade my timeshare week in  but instead paid cash for the week  We got a pretty good deal        for a Wednesday Wednesday  BR week  which was perfect because we were looking to just spend a long weekend there My name was on the reservation  but my brother in law got there before me  and he had no problem checking in  I called beforehand to get his name in there  and they were very receptive and had no problem  My only problem there was being put on hold for literally     minutes  and it wasn t even an     number  Thanks to work for footing the bill there The room was decent  but if you are expecting a riott type appointment  you will be disappointed  The main room was really pretty small  enough room for a couch and a chair  tv and coffee table  but that s it  The couch was big enough for   people  and the chair one  so when all   of us wanted to sit and watch tv  we had to bring a chair in from the dining area  The dining area had a round table for    and behind that was the bar divider for the galley style kitchen  I would say the overall room including the kitchen was probably about   x    which is respectable  but felt more hotel than condo  I don t think it would ve been comfortable with more than   people  The  BR setup is a  BR with a lockoff  and the lockoff side had a small kitchenette  and actually was a little nicer  The other BR was decent sized  decent bed  pretty big bathroom  but really thin walls  so you could hear everything that was going on in the main room very well  The lockoff side had thicker walls We were on the first floor  right at the middle of the pool  but luckily it was either a slow week or the sounds didn t travel too well  so it was quiet enough  However on the other side of the room was the parking lot  and there are a ton of shuttle buses that park there  so every morning we were greeted with the beep beep beep of them backing up  One thing that you will be happy to know is that the fire alarms work  Our last morning there the fire alarm went off at  am  and there is no way you could sleep through that  Luckily no one knew how to turn it off and it continued until     am  long after the fire department had come and verified that it was a false alarm The last thing I would like to mention is that although it is apparently only   miles to the strip  it can seem a lot longer than that  We were dumb enough to return from our daily outings to the strip around rush hour  and the two miles of lights took half an hour each day to neogotiate  So even though it seems close  it s a lot further from the strip than I thought it would be  We took the shuttle service to the strip when we went out at night  and that was convenient  A cab back from the Trop was     the one night  and from Freemont St  it was about     So overall  I m pretty ambivalent about this place  If you re looking for a riott quality place  this isn t it  If you re looking for a pretty good deal on a place in Vegas  and don t particularly care about a bit of inconvenience getting to and from the Strip  it s a pretty good bet  If you re looking to be in the Vegas area and sightsee places like Red Rock Canyon  Hoover Dam  and the Valley of Fire  I think it s a very good base camp  Personally  I would not trade my timeshare in for this place  but as a Getaway it was a good deal  and a lot cheaper than staying on the Strip in a casino hotel  Next time I would probably check out one of the other timeshares on the Strip like the Jockey Club  but I think my experience there was worth what I paid for it  
P => Clean but less than what we expected We stayed for one week at Club de Soleil as a time share trade for part of our riott two bedroom villa in Orlando through Interval International  The picture in the Interval catalogue and the description of the property was intriguing   if not a bit deceiving  We checked the reviews here at tripadvisor before accepting this property as a trade and it seemed that a lot of people liked their stay  We tended to overlook those who gave poor reviews   a mistake  We won t stay here again   there was nothing really wrong  it is just that we have gotten used to the riott level of service and resort quality   Club de Soleil doesn t even compare  We stayed in a one bedroom villa on the third floor in Phase I   overlooking the apartments across the street  The room furniture was dated  the cushions on the couch had flattened and the kitchen and bathroom counters were cheap   laminates instead of granite  hollow core doors in the bedroom and the two doors to the bathroom  We were at the end of the building so we did not have a lot of foot traffic passing our door  and we appreciated the quiet at night   plus we had a nice view of the Sierre Nevada mountains  We were given a schedule that included free breakfast in the mornings   bagels on some days and waffles on some of the others  We went once   stood in a small lobby area where a folding table was set up with a staff member toasting a choice of   different kinds of bagels  We got our plastic knife and foam plate for putting on the individual packets of cream cheese and jelly  We balanced this with our styrofoam cup of coffee with coffee mate   picture    to    people standing around or sitting in the few available chairs  We didn t do that a second time  The property is about   miles from the strip   on Tropicana ave   a major traffic route in the morning and evening   we had a rental car so we did not use the shuttle service  We were able to visit Hoover Dam and Red Rock Canyon   both were excellent side trips less than an hour from Vegas  We are not gamblers so we went to the hotels for the shows  unique attractions and restaurants  We ate at three buffets   Paris for breakfast   a must  dinner at Alladins     pp   fantastic  and dinner at the Bellagio   what a treat  The Club de Soleil was clean and quiet but while in Vegas  we purchased another riott time share   that s where we will stay next time  
P =>  Very Happy with our stay at Club de Soleil We are from Long Island  New York and last year when we visited Las Vegas we bought a two bedroom unit at this resort  This year we decided to spend a week there and try out the facilities  We were very pleased and found all the comforts of home in the unit we had on the third floor overlooking the pool and with our own balcony  The place is attractive looking and very nicely kept  The cleaning people do an excellent job of preparing the rooms for guests and if you stay seven days they clean the room once during the week  We rented a car for the week but would not do that again because they have such an excellent free shuttle service to the Strip on the hour  Not once during the time we were there were they late  The Concierge staff was very helpful in answering questions and offering assistance  I would advise signing up early for any provided activities because sometimes they fill up quickly  The trip to Red Rock Canyon was excellent as was the driver guide  a retired school teacher   We have enjoyed our trips to Vegas and look forward to going back  It seems that there is always something new to see and do  
P =>  Cozy Retreat We enjoyed staying at the Club and would return again  It was a nice retreat from the chaos of the strip  The Club is small but very comfortable  The equipment in the exercise room is sufficient and accessible    hours  Also the pool and jacuzzi were very nice and accessible    hours  The staff and the shuttle drivers were very friendly and helpful  There was coffee and tea available each morning  Waffles and bagels were available four times  a bbq one day and a wine and cheese party  The shuttle went to the grocery store each morning and was always on time  The shuttle to and from the strip was very dependable  Tracey and Angel arranged a helicopter tour to the Grand Canyon for us and we loved it  I have only good things to say about our week at Club de Soleil  
P =>  Club de Soleil    only way to stay in Vegas  You ll love it      We stayed at Club de Soleil on Tropicana in Las Vegas  We had the two bedroom suite and were accompanied by our son and daughter in law  We enjoyed having separate entrances and a common living area and full kitchen  The suites were roomy and the second suite had a kitchenette  We had a washer dryer and came home with clean clothes  Covered parking was a few steps away as was the pool  The Orleans Casino was right down the street so we could do some late night gambling without venturing too far from the room  There were numerous services nearby such as grocery stores  drug stores  gas stations  restaurants  We had a ball and highly recommend Club de Soleil  The staff was very accommodating and went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed  This is THE place to stay  
P =>  Covered with Timeshare lizards This timeshare resort has the following problems  The  rd floor is crawling with timeshare lizards all day  They are running up and down the hallways  hollering and shouting  whistling and clapping whenever they get a new sucker  They are walking the potential suckers up and down the hallways  trying to out loud each other  You cannot get any rest from  am    pm Changed rooms once to get away from it  but that didn t help  Left a book in the first room that magically disappeared when I moved  Left   pairs of gloves on the hot water heater when I check out and they magically disappeared when I came back a couple of hours later to get them Last and not least is the loud road noise from Tropicanna Avenue that runs    hours per day  This is a good place to stay in Vegas  if you never stay in your room  
P =>  Very nice resort My boyfriend and I just returned from Club De Soleil   days ago  Overall this is a very nice resort and we would stay there again  no questions asked  The pool  mini golf course and excercise room were all available to guests    hours  which was great because when my boyfriend and I returned from the strip we found it very refreshing to take a swim to get away from the heat  We even excercised a little in the eary mornings  The location of the resort was very convienient as well  even though we did rent a car   There were places to eat       s and different stores to purchase a few simple things just in case you didn t want to eat out  all within a short drive away  The only thing that kinda got us upset was that the rooms are only cleaned once a week and if by some chance you miss the day of the week your room is scheduled for cleaning you have to be squeezed in on another day  Luckily  the manager that was on the day I was told I missed my chance and had to reschedule  had that problem immediately solved and I had my room fully cleaned    mins later  Basically this resort is at the top of my list of a few places I absolutely would not have a problem staying at again  Well worth it  
P =>  Great time   Inspite of the cool weather The resort is a very nice and spacious and only a short drive to the strip  Its a nice quiet resort  If you want to be where the action is this is not the place for you  My family and friends welcomed the time away from the fussiness of the strip  It was very cool and windy during the end of ch so we didn t get to go into pool  Definately take the Showtime tour to the Grand Canyon and Hoover Dam  See some of the show at the Flamingo hotel too  Gladys Knight and George Wallace was excellent  You can also get discount tickets the same night of the show at an outside vendor by the Riviera Hotel  The list the tickets that are available the same night of the performance  Visit the restaraurants in the Eiffel Tower  We enjoyed the casino in the Flamingo and Caesar Palace but stayed away from the Rio casiono  got lost in there for a half hour   I wouldn t recommend the buffets because the lines and waits are too long so poor to mediocre food  Its better to have a nice sit down meal I definately would go back to Vegas and stay at the Club de Soleil   there is so much to see and do that you can t do it in one trip  
P =>  Bonus  Six of us just returned home from a week in Las Vegas at Club de Soleil  If you are looking for a top notch place to stay with great services  this is it  Free shuttle bus daily to the grocery store for those who like to eat in their suite  free shuttle on the hour to the strip  returning on the half hour    free breakfasts  waffles   days  bagels another coffee and tea every morning  wine  amp  cheese one day  bbq one day  for    a person     hour guided trip to Red Rock Canyon    hour trip one evening to Freemont Street Experience  Nice pool  spa and exercise room  Highly recommend Club de Soleil to everyone who wants a long stay but not in a hotel room setting  
P => Home away from home We have recently returned from our stay at Club de Soleil  We were traveling with another couple and we were so pleased with our   bedroom unit  Each bedroom had it s own bathroom and TV  the  nd bedroom being a lock off unit so there was privacy when you wanted it  Our unit was spotless and had everything you could ask for  full kitchen with utensils and washer dryer  TV  amp  VCR and small patio  We were also most appreciative of a non smoking unit  We enjoyed lounging by the pool which was heated  The staff served breakfast in the lobby most days  There were planned activities like a wine  amp  cheese get together and tours available on certain days  We didn t make use of the shuttle as he had a car  The whole complex was very well maintained and clean  We will definately be going back  
P => Really nice We stayed at this resort shortly after it opened as part of their promotional period  This is a really high end place  The service was fabulous  the amenties excellent  the suite fully equipped with really nice furnishings  There was a balcony  a lock off suite  full kitchen  good shuttle service  I have really no complaints about the quality  the service or anything else  The location was a tad too far from the Orleans or the strip for me but the shuttle service was so good that this small inconvenience is easy to overlook  They have putting greens  outdoor barbeques that anyone can use  internet service  Ahh  I ve stayed at other resorts that are comparable in ratings but this was the nicest  If only I could score that great promotional price again   
P => Absolutely Wonderful My husband and I are Club owners and we love it  We don t like staying on the strip so it s perfect yet it s still close enough to get there within minutes  We drive from Phoenix to Vegas for our anniversary every year and wouldn t stay anywhere else  The hotel is quiet  clean  very comfortable and if you visit the concierge  you can get pretty good discounts on some of the shows  We would definitely recommend it to others  
P =>  Nice resort My husband and I stayed at the Club de Soleil II during the week of uary        This was a time share exchange  using a week from      that was ready to expire  This was a nice resort  small  clean and friendly  The traffic on Tropicana Blvd  can be bad at times but managable at others  We rented a car  but also took advantage of the free shuttle service when it suited us  The shuttle runs to several of the strip hotel casinos and was a nice treat  The drivers were friendly and knowledgable  The front desk  concierge and housekeeping staff were also very friendly  Beware that the concierge is also there to sign you up for timeshare presentations  We like doing them and were awarded several nice gifts for attending  We stayed in a   bedroom suite and it was very nice  Somewhat compact  but very comfortable for the   of us  and we took advantage of the full kitchen and small laundry that were in our suite  This saved us time and money for the week  Beware that there is a Club de Soleil I and II  located just down the street from each other  Club I has a tennis court and Club II has a mini golf course  You may use the facilities at either club  The pools and hot tub areas looked very nice  The pools are heated and open year round  We were not within walking distance to shops or restaurants  but located nearby  When visiting Las Vegas  we would book this resort again  
P => Could be better Like another couple said  we got stuck across the hall from the sales office  Being in Las Vegas  we were on a night schedule  getting in around  AM  The noise was unbelievable across the hall after  AM  I can t believe they put a sales office near guest rooms  We loved the two bedroom unit  although the beds were quite hard and by morning the mattress had fallen half off the end of the bed for no known reason  The rest of the place is great  although the washer and dryer are so small they are almost useless  Good location  a lot of services nearby  and we would stay there again but NOT in the same room  They really do need to address the issue of the sales office location  Waking too early to loud  cheering people is not my idea of a good time  
P =>  Beyond our expectations We had a fabulous time staying at Club de Soleil  The staff was friendly and very accommodating  The rooms were very comfortable even with six of us there  I was overwhelmed when the flowers arrived on the day of my Mother s   th birthday  I had just casually mentioned that we were there for that reason  A wonderful place to stay  
P => the place was great  Just returned from Vegas and staying at the Club de Soleil  We loved the place and have no complaints  We stayed with friends co we had a   bedroom suite  It was really nice  beds were king size and very comfortable  The bathrooms were nice with jacuzzi tubs  Nice size fully equipped kitchen  even a little kitchen in smaller room  would stay there again  It was close to strip too  
P => Disappointing We just returned from this resort and we were disappointed by the place  Our room was directly across the hall from where the salespeople met daily and they were extremely loud and inconsiderate  whistling  yelling  slamming doors  walking up and down the hall yelling to each other  blocking the hallway  standing outside our door talking on their cell phones   We complained to the front desk a few times and were told that there was nothing they could do  The one young gentleman that I talked to told me that they have received many complaints regarding the salespeople but there was nothing that they could do  He didn t seem very concerned that we were unhappy  We cut our stay short due to the inconsiderate treatment and rudeness that we encountered from the sales staff of this resort  They were more interested in making potential sales then they were in keeping current customers happy  The livingroom area and kitchen were quite small and the furniture was uncomfortable  however the master bathroom was very large and the beds were more comfortable than most resorts  The air conditioners were extremely loud and rattled when they first kicked in  The pool was very nice and the location is great  only a couple miles from the strip  But unless the management does something different with the sales meetings and learns to treat existing customers better  I don t think that I would recommend this resort to anyone that I know  
P =>  Split decision  
P => Loved It   
P =>  Loved it

P =>  Never Again  
P =>  Loved it   
P =>  Excellent       
P =>  Excellent  
P =>   F r Familien mt Kindern sehr geignet    
P => 
P =>  Good for Long Stay Although we only stayed one night until our Strip hotel room became available  this hotel would be good for those who may want to save on meal cost by preparing some meals in the room during an extended stay  Our room included a two burner mini stove  along with refrigerator and microwave  There s also pantry space   See photo  Although located way off the Strip  the Hard Rock is across the street and you an catch the HR shuttle to the Strip  Only one shuttle stop  just north of MGM  every half hour Rooms have exterior entrance  There is a computer with Internet access in the lobby for those without a laptop Breakfast has the standard offerings for the Choice brands  
P =>   Perfect if it s what you re looking for  Admittedly  many casino hotels offer better rooms for less money  You also have to park far from your room  pay for internet and other services  wait on line for check in  and be tempted by the casino at every moment  I come to Vegas often  and I ve stayed in this hotel several times  It is clean  affordable  offers fast  free internet  and every room has it s own kitchenette  Plus  you can park right outside your room  It is across the street from the Hard Rock hotel  and provides easy access to the strip  If you don t have a car  do not stay here  But if you have a car and are looking for this type of place  you ll be very pleased  
P =>   Very pleased Was out for a conference and the host hotel was full  Comfort was about a half block away  We enjoyed being next door to the Hard Rock Cafe and Casino  We ate at each   good prices great food  The hotel is very well kept   very clean  The breakfast included waffles  fruit  cereals  lots of bakery  hard boiled eggs  Generous enough to keep you going most of the day  What a deal  Best part was our airport shuttle driver   Peter   who gave us some great tips   took us to and from the Strip  A great personality  The girls at the front desk were very nice and helpful too  This isn t a resort   the pool is small and like everything  its right under the airport path   but it is a great value and if you stay here  you can still go down to the strip and blow even more money    
P =>   great location i came to las vegas for my son winter vac  and every hotel was booked   or the prices were to high   i was driving by and i saw comfort inn on paradise rd  it was a great location near UNLV  Hard Rock hotel   about one   mile from the Las Vegas strip  resturants near by with in walkiing distance  shuttle service was great  Front desk was amazing   rooms were very nice  and quiet    my trip was great and i will be returning to this hotel agian   
P =>  Great hotel for location and cost I stayed here in ust      and was very surprised because normally  I would stay in at least a   star hotel  Honestly when looking at this hotel online is not very appealing  however  when you actually see it in person  it really is not that bad  Granted it is not a new hotel by any means  but it is reasonable for what you pay per night  Breakfast here was served daily for free and was really good  The only thing that I did not care for was that the carpet in our room was really dirty  but again  we did not even notice this until our last day there  If you are looking for luxury of any type  this is not the hotel for you  however  if you want to go to Vegas and have more money in your pockets to gamble  have fun  see a couple of shows and do some shopping  this hotel will allow you to do all that  As for bugs and all that other negative stuff that people are saying  I did not experience any of that  As for the staff  everyone that was there for the week that we stayed there were professional  friendly and very helpful  
P =>  aircraft spotter delight Booked in for   nights last week at a very good rate and was happy with its location off the strip but close to the main casinos  The room was fine with   queen beds  fridge  TV and micro  We found a few things missing such as the coffee pot   batteries in TV remote and although it was      the reception staff had replacements from another room within minutes  The drawback was being situated under the flightpath as from      to      there were aircraft every few minutes  which woke me up although handy on the last day as we had an early start  The pool was fine  for brits   the water was quite warm and clean  with many people congregating around it with beers each afternoon  but the kids and I enjoyed it  Comments about the lapdancing place next door seem way over the top  no noise or fuss from it  Breakfast was adequate  but only having one toaster in the kitchen for numerous guests was quite poor given the numbers staying at the hotel  Also it closed early for breakfast            Didn t use the shuttle to the strip  happy with self parking and a bit of a walk  Overall good for the price  but the early   late flights disturbs your sleep  
P =>  Great budget accomodation Great accomodation for the traveller on a budget Room was clean  comfortable and fairly quiet  as someone s already said  the air conditioner drowned out any plane noise  Staff were helpful  friendly and efficient  courtesy bus was an absolute godsend  Paul the driver is a lovely guy full of help and advice for first time visitors Wouldn t hesitate to recommend the Comfort Inn to anyone  
P =>   Great Stay   the Comfort Inn I m almost packed and ready to leave  This is my  th trip here and  st time in the Comfort Inn  When I arrived in town and drove by  I laughed and just shook my head  I was laughing at how cheap the company I work for was  It s a motel type setting with the doors on the outside  So  I checked in  got my key  went to my room and was surprised  Sure  it s a small room  but it has   beds  a mini coil burner range  a mini fridge  a huge selection of cable channels  free dsl  bring your own cable OR borrow on of theirs    a place to hang your clothes and a decent shower  Other than a minor problem with my key  this stay has been great  I m not here to stay in a hotel room all day so I wouldn t notice anything other than the obvious  There are planes flying overhead every   minutes when the planes are routed on a certain runway  Wow  other than that  everything was great  Can t say enough about it  If you look at other reviews  complaints   there are NO ants  I m not wearing socks  the staff was above average and well  that s it  Next time I m in town  I m going to ask to stay here  Look  I ve been in      night rooms here in Vegas and I m happier here  If you PLAN on coming to Vegas and STAYING in your room  maybe this place isn t for you  But for BUSINESS travelers who aren t in their room  this place rocks  Free DSL that s running at         For me  this location is great  I can get to everywhere I need to be within    minutes  
P =>   Uncomfort Inn This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed at  The front desk is extremely rude and unhelpful  The carpet is extremely dirty  and we had ants in the room  We stayed three days total  and our room was not cleaned even once  I would suggest spending the night at the strip club next door to the hotel rather than staying at this hotel  
P =>  good wake up call We stayed at The Comfort Inn in ember for   nights  The bed was so large I wasn t sure if my husband was there half the time  and being Vegas maybe he wasn t The rooms were comfortable with a little kitchenette and coffee maker Good wake up call  planes landing from about   am flying directly overhead  After a few days though we really didn t notice them There was a shuttle to and from take you to the strip all day  This was needed as it was along walk to the strip and there is a lot of building work going on so pavements uneven The drivers were great  If you need to get to the strip quicker  walk ove rto the Hard Rock hotel and get a taxi Breakfast was a bit of a scramble for the one toaster  so lot of queueing and it was basic I read somone else s review that there were perverts and drunks about  they must have been unlucky  It was very quiet  security guards on patrol at night  There was no noise or problem with the  stripclub  next door  Actually I never saw anyone going in even If you like shopping there is a nice shopping mall about       mins walk on maryland parkway  It is lovely and quiet there  with Macys  JCPenny and Sears plus little shops Not a bad place to stay on a budget  
P =>   Great Location No Problems Here I am a Choice Hotel member and decided randomly to vacation in Las Vegas for a week  I looked for a hotel that was centrally located to the show  Phantom of the Opera  that I wanted to see  and was close to the airport and the strip  which I had never been to  There were no major problems  other than the wake up call not coming in one day  but after we mentioned it to the front desk staff  they were very good after that  It is unfortunate that the shuttle to the airport and the strip only runs until       p m   since Vegas is open all night  and we got in to the airport after       p m   but the taxi was reasonable  even if the exit from the airport was confusing  MGM is the only drop off on the strip  but we used the monorail and got very used to coming and going on our own  We were across the street from the Hard Rock Casino and Motel  so we tried to end up there every night and walked across the street to our hotel at the end of the evening  morning   It did seem a bit strange that our hotel was next to an adult club  but we have a great room and a great stay  and couldn t have asked for much more  considering the very reasonable rate we paid and the fact that we were there for   days  We became very familiar with the shuttle drivers  who were excellent  
P =>  Worst place on our vacation My husband and I just returned to Ohio after a three week tour of the southwest  Of all the hotels we stayed at  the Las Vegas Comfort Inn at      Paradise Road was the worse one of all  The carpet was so dirty that after walking over it once in bare feet or socks  the bottom your feet were black  literally  After talking a shower  if you stepped on the carpet you tracked black footsteps onto the tile bathroom floor  Finally my husband layed down a path of towels to walk on around the room  There were also stains on the chairs that looked suspiciously like human ejaculation  nasty  If it wasn t for the fact that this was a last minute booking and everything else in town was full  we would have found something else  When checking out  I told the clerk about he horrid conditions and he replied that they ALREADY knew about the problem and that we were not the first to complain  and  they knew some of the rooms should have the carpet cleaned  He seemed very unsympathetic and unconcerned  A very unpleasant end to an otherwise great vacation  
P =>   Discomfort Inn If you are traveling on government business you must bring a letter stating it  I was not advised by the Comfort Inn     number reservations that I needed this letter  so I got ripped off paying double my confirmed rate  I m fighting with Comfort Inn s customer service and the hotel  One bounces me back to the other About the hotel  When I checked in the front desk man was drunk and rude  I had a confirmed King Non Smoking on the first floor and was given a tacky room with   double beds  One bed was caved in and the other felt like hard cardboard  The hotel is next to a strip club  It is unsafe to walk at night outside your room  It is motel style and there are drunken perverts roaming around the parking lot outisde your room  The soda vending machines eat your money and the front desk says too bad   Discomfort Inn best describes this tacky hotel room  It makes Motel   look like the Four Seasons  I ve stayed in hundreds of hotels and  Trust me  this one should be converted into a rent by the hour adjunct to that Pink Pussy Cat Strip Club next door  No need to change the front desk  they ll fit in perfectly  There are many better choices in Las Vegas  even on a Saturday night  It may serve you better looking for a place downtown  such as Fitzgeralds  You get clean and friendly there  
P =>  This room was a haven I loved this hotel  the staff was so helpful  the best I had ever experienced  I actually gave them a small gift when I checked out  The room looked nice  very clean  furniture and decorations were above average  nice colors  and it had a little kitchen area  The outside  which first attttracted me   looked very clean and quaint  I remember flowers  They had a breakfast room  where I got some fruit and a bagel on the go  Everything was nice  I loved my room  and felt very safe and secure  
P => only okay got a decent rate over the internet  and was happy about the free shuttle to from the airport  after calling  waited about   min for pick up  room was fine  had a small kitchenette with fridge micro stove top  could hear neighbors talking water and the airplanes flying overhead during the day reminded me of what bombers must sound like  getting back and for to the strip is a challenge at night  just take a cab  during the day the complimentary shuttle to the strip depended on when they came back from their previous trip  so we crossed over to hard rock hotel and took their shuttle to the strip  a lot more options of places to be dropped off at  and a lot more reliable  the shuttle driver shared GREAT information with us  like the     off ticket booths   the real problem with the hotel came afterwards  when we realized we d left a watch in one of the drawers in the room  we called to ask them to go check for it  knowing it probably wasn t still there  and got completely RUDE employees who were unwilling to even check and hung up on us  next time i ll find a deal on the strip  less hassle  less noise  
P =>  good hotel off the strip stayed here     and         The staff was very nice and eager to help out if needed  The shuttle bus goes to the MGM Grand for visiting the strip  They offer a continental breakfast which was very nice  no charge for guests  The rates were very good  a fraction of what is offered on the strip  We also got excellent directions from the desk clerk    always a plus   The Hard Rock Hotel is across the street so you can t get lost  Save your money for the other good stuff stay off strip   
P =>  Nothing wrong with the Comfort Inn The Comfort Inn is part of Choice Hotels  a collection of generally modestly priced lodgings  This particular Comfort Inn might be relatively new  but like most Choice Hotels  it is not now nor will it ever be luxurious  I have stayed at this Comfort Inn a few times  Yes  it is off the Strip  but within a comfortable walking distance for a relatively active person   but even if you re not inclined to walk  there is a public bus to the Strip nearby  And it s right across the street from the Hard Rock   but without the Hard Rock high prices  For the money it s not that bad   fairly reasonable rates  relatively quiet  clean and comfortable  Some reviewers said they had problems with ants    both times I stayed there  I didn t see any pests  All in all the accomodations are pretty much what you pay for  If you want fancy  stay at the Hard Rock for      per night or on the Strip  If you re not that picky  stay at the Comfort Inn  
P =>  Comfort on a budget  
P =>  Ok  
P =>  Very pleased with this hotel  
P =>  good value for money  
P =>  Nice room and good value  
P =>  great location and value offstrip  
P =>  Du bruit      
P =>  Hotel Sympa  
P => 
P =>   JUST PERFECT IT HAS EVERYTHING  it s spacious  clean  good service  polite stuff and the restaurant fantastic  
P =>   New clean convenient hotel off strip in Vegas I agree the bed was very comfortable with very soft pillows  and hotel is new and clean  Perfect for my   year old twins to run around in  and also they enjoyed swimming at the heated pool  There is a small gym with a treadmill  step machine and a bowflex machine so that you can exercise off all the calories from the Vegas buffets  The hotel also offers FREE unlimited bottled water at the front desk which is according to the front desk lady  quot Yared  quot  is one less thing for guests to worry about   they provide the drinking water  The breakfast lady ia still allowed us to get some food even if breakfast was supoosed to end at    AM    there was a lot of cereal and fruit and we did not get to use the waffle machine though  The distance from the strip did not bother us because with kids we do prefer to be away from the hustle and bustle  A newly opened Mexican restaurant eatery across the street in front of the hotel offered very cheap tasty fresh soft tacos and burritos  and a gas station and a convenience store was a few hundred feet from the hotel parking  Over all a convenient and clean hotel to stay in and perfect for small families with kids  although I did see a newly wed couple check in at the hotel  Price is very reasonable  
P =>  Average at Best I stayed at the Comfort Inn and Suites over President s Day Weekend when I was in town for a large volleyball tournament  The hotel was very loud at night  but that was not the problem of the hotel it was lots of kids staying there with their teams Our room was nice and new  The hotel is obviously new  However  we had ants in our bathroom coming out of the wall the first night  When I called the front desk I was told there was only one person working and I had to go down myself and get the spray and spray myself Then I tried to use two vending machines for bottled water  One ate my money and the other gave me pop  The front desk did give me my money back  but come on now  Finally  the TV in our room did not work  After the experience with the ants I did not bother trying to get the TV fixed The hotel is away from the hustle and bustle  Not too sure about the neighborhood down the street from the hotel  but that is part of Vegas They did have free computer to use in lobby and that was nice  Staff was helpful as they could be  but seemed like they need to have two people on duty at night  not one This was a so so stay for me and not sure if I would recommend in future  
P =>   Best  There have been several times that I ve driven by this particular Comfort Inn  I always forget to book it as it is out of the way and the one on Paradise is central to all my locations  This time  I chose the correct one  This is the best Comfort Inn in Vegas  No doubts about it  It s super quiet  away from the strip  the breakfast is good and the ambiance  lol  is excellent  I decided to stop patronizing the one on Paradise Road as I had seen several people walk right off the road and into the breakfast area  load up and leave  I let management know and they looked at me like I was speaking a dialect too difficult to understand     Anyway  I love this hotel and will always book here  The room is spacious  clean  the TV is great and the bathroom is great  I would attach pictures but I left my camera on the plane  Oh  what a night  
P =>  Nice hotel in quiet location Location A little far from Vegas which wasn t really that bad Great hotel inside and out it seems new maybe only   yrs in service  The room was fabulous  nice bathroom it was clean and looked a little expensive   The beds were absolutely phenomenal  we got i think   pillows for one bed and they were so comfy  There was even a little sleeper sofa that you could sit on and relax  The breakfast was not as phenomenal but above average yogart cereal the usual  There was even a big flat screen tv to watch while you were eating Overall  I d say this is better than the Strip hotel and casinos but a little pricy  
P =>   Nice new hotel We booked this hotel because of its proximity to the Las Vegas Speedway  which is where we were going early the next morning  When we arrived  about      pm  we learned the hotel had only been open a month  The room was a good size  and came with a small fridge  which is always nice  Senior rate starts at age    so we scored that  The complimentary breakfast had lots of selection and we left full  The only thing I wasn t fond of  was the noisy heater room air conditioner  The bed was great  and once you were asleep  the heater didn t wake us  We ll have no problem staying there again  
P =>   I heart the El C  I stayed at the El Cortez for   nights  I had a group rate and the price was worth every penny  I had a King Tower room  I didn t have a view  well  it was of the A C and the roof   but the room was very nice  The king bed was ok  with very soft pillows  There was a small loveseat   chair and cocktail table  There was a large desk and they have WIFI for        for    hours  The bathroom was small and the lighting was poor in there but not terrible  Overall it was a great room  The El Cortez is only a block from the Fremont Street Experience  so you are close to several casinos  I did order room service once and I was surprised at how inexpensive it was  Both my friend and I ate for under        with the room service fee  The food was came up fairly quickly and was delicious  I would stay at the El C anytime  the tower rooms look fairly new and it was very clean  Just don t expect a   star resort and you will be fine  
P =>   Pleasantly Surprised This was my first stay Downtown and I decided to book the El Cortez on the word of other TA Members who had stayed there  I had no idea what to expect  When I got to my room  I was pleasantly surprised  I thought the room was big and liked the layout  I had a one bed tower room that had a great view of the Strip and mountains in the distance  The only thing I could see someone having a problem with is the height of the shower  I m short  so it was OK  but a tall person might find it annoying  Everyone I met during my stay was friendly and the casino had a  quot homey quot  feel unlike the huge Strip casinos  I never felt that it was unsafe in the area outside of the casino  For anyone who really likes all the glitz of the Strip  this may not be the place for you  It s not  quot glitzy quot  at all  I would stay there again  
P =>   No not better than expected  What can I say except I was hugely disappointed  I felt like such a fool for picking this hotel for my family and it was devastating when we walked into our room and reality came crashing down around me  I don t know what I was thinking  Unfortunately a big factor probably was TripAdvisor s     rating and all these people saying how  quot not so bad quot  it is Now that should have been an early indicator  This hotel is  quot not that bad quot    quot Not as bad as people are saying quot   Oh that s nice  but is it any good  I mean  how bad were you expecting  Pavillion rooms are above the parking garage  The parking garage where the elevators are not working so you find yourself having to walk up   flights of stairs with all your luggage  It s ok  sometimes things break down  Once at your floor  lighting is insufficient and it s dark and wet as you try to find your room  Oh yeah  this is not indoors  the pavillion rooms lead directly outside The professional photographs are very well taken  When I opened the door I thought there must ve been a mistake  It really is no better than your run of the mill cheapest motel  Much smaller than you d think from the pictures and shabbier  There was a slight odor I d rather not think about  The bathroom is tiny and cheap  There is rusting at the bottom of the toilet  a fan knob that is literally falling out  and barely enough room to turn around I have never walked into a hotel and said immediately   quot we need to go somewhere else quot   At El Cortez  this took approximately   minutes  I call the front desk and after numerous  quot we can t do this quot    quot we can t do that quot    quot we don t offer blank quot    quot you ll have to call whoever you booked with quot   I pause for a moment and let out a deep breath considering my options when I hear   quot uh    bye    quot   click   Okay So I proceed to call Expedia and there are lots of details which I won t go into here  but there are lots of expedia says this  hotel manager supervisor says that  hotel will have to charge      of the   day stay  no wait it s just   day but we don t know how much that is  Supervisor says if I would ve just came down right away maybe we wouldn t have to charge  but it s been about an hour so we have to  My mistake of calling expedia to see if other hotels have rooms available  if this happens to you go straight to the front desk and cancel first Expedia gets an  quot excellent quot  rating from me  The rep was a savior and ended up refunding everything except for       and told me not to worry about the manager s threats of charging for the night and that Expedia would take care of it  After an hour at the Cortez  we wanted the Bellagio or MGM even if it was      a night  Unfortunately all the   stars were booked  He ran down the lists of     star hotels that were available and had no issue with providing details and even calling to ask what their internet surcharge rate was  Just FYI  very few hotels offer free internet  even the     stars  and it s usually         a day In the end  he booked me a   night stay at the   star Golden Nugget which is about     yards away from El Cortez but what a world of difference      at Cortez vs     at Golden Nugget for   nights  Far nicer room  higher quality everything  thank god a clean bathroom with marble  oh wow actual chairs and tables  I would rate the Golden Nugget as average or above average  How Cortez has an above average rating here  I don t have a clue Perhaps TripAdvisor should change the wording from  quot Rate your overall experience quot  to  quot Rate your hotel quot   You could have an  quot excellent quot  experience anywhere if you re high on ecstasy  It s great that you had low expectations and enjoyed your stay but let s have some objectivity here  You must rate the hotel as it stands against all competitors  Not just give it a   rating because it was cheap and you made it out alive I ve stayed at the many   star hotels and I wouldn t rate all of those as excellent but I would rate the   star Homewood Suites Sandieg Del  excellent  Value is an important factor  But even considering price  El Cortez is at best   quot Okay  but some problems quot   There are much better deals out there I ve been to worse hotels and have had perfectly fine stays  I d be ok with the Cortez for some situations but not a family vacation  The rating here is misleading and that s the main problem No matter how good user reviews are  this hotel is a one star for a reason  Just keep that in mind while scanning some of these glowing comments  I didn t and had to jump through hoops to fix things on the trip  
P =>   Fantastic Deal for Huge Room Downtown I booked two nights at the El Cortez via Vegas com for a total of      Yes  A total of     for two nights including the tax and booking fee  They had a special on Vegas com of buy one night get one free and a free coupon book  The coupon book was pretty good  free drink     off meal at the hotel  gambling coupons  gift coupon  etc  This was a last minute trip for us  and we were on a tight budget  We went for my birthday and to see a concert at the Hard Rock on ember     I had to be creative with our lodging so the El Cortez it was  Plus I had not experienced downtown in years and my boyfriend had never seen the Freemont Experience The hotel is easy to find and they valet parked the car  Check in was a breeze  We were given room         th floor  and our window looked straight down Las Vegas Blvd  toward the strip  The nighttime view was awesome  The room was huge  Two queen beds with fresh brand new linens  beds are firm but not uncomfortable   Had plenty of storage for clothes between dresser drawers and hanging space  Bathroom is older but well maintained and clean  The toilet and shower tub are together and vanity outside that room  There is also a loveseat with coffee table and a desk  The desk is a  quot secretary quot  type you don t see often and was perfect for our wet bar  This room was really huge  We had no problem keeping the room warm or cool with the thermostat  Tv worked fine  Oh  NO BLOWDRYERS  Bring your own or ask for one when you check in The casino part of the hotel is so so  It s kind of  quot dead quot   not lively like the strip  It s hard to get a cocktail while gambling  We played only slots and they did not pay out that well  We had better luck gambling elsewhere downtown  The cafe in the hotel is GREAT for breakfast  They make the best bacon and cheese omlet I ve ever had  The lobby bar made a good strong bacardi and diet too  Oh  if you want some good Mexican or Cuban food  go across the street  Freemont  and you will find some darn good food  Can t remember the name of the place  tita s or something  Anyway  people at the hotel will know the name In general  you will find downtown to be more somber and mellow than the strip  We are used to the strip atmosphere and this is very different  The hotel catered more to retired and cowboy types  I felt silly wearing my typical Vegas garb out since it seemed over the top for downtown  but would have fit right in on the strip   Downtown is fun but very different vibe than the strip We did have to go to the Hard Rock on Saturday night for the concert and the cab ride after tip was about      Yikes  Once we got to the Hard Rock we felt the Vegas vibe we were used to  Cab ride home was a few dollars cheaper  he took a quicker route and less traffic Overall I would stay here again if I were to stay downtown but I prefer staying on the strip if I can find a good deal  
P =>  El Cortez a Plesant stay  My dh and i checked into the El Cortez on thurs oct   th       it was around   pm  our room was ready  we got room       nice  clean room and it faced the stratosphere and the big red shoe The room was a king room  King bed  two night stands  a dresser   desk and two big chairs love seat and coffee table  we also asked for and got a fridge The bathroom was the tub and toilet in one room tiny  and outside the bathroom was the sink and counter and a small closet area The tub however fine for us  hubby     and i am      would not be good for tall people or really more than     because of the style of the tub and the height of the shower head  there was always hot water when we showered we asked for extra pillows for our bed  as well as hangers and a blow dryer  all were provided from housekeeping the room was cleaned very nice and they left xtra towels and soaps and shampoo for a small tip each day The Casino is very smokey  and the crowd is older and the feeling is not lively  also when we were there we witnessed the roulette coupiers  sp  were very bad making many mistakes and not in control of the table  i only stayed for   spins that took over    min then they had to review the tape because one of the morons that was causing   the time issues  was cheating or so they thought  they made many mistakes and had to be told by the people playing  and calling the pit boss over and they were wrong each time  so i got out of there  i am still kind of new at this and cant take a chance on getting ripped off the slots did not seam loose here at all   i only won on one machine  monopoly    turned into     got right out  that was the only slot win in the Elcortez and believe my i tried plenty we were always able to find a parking spot in self park with no problems The elevators are old and rickety so slow and do weird up  down and pauses   tower of terror flashback  There is a subway in the Elcortez as well as seattles best coffee  but you cannot charge these two places to your room we ate at the    hour resturant twice once for breakfast and once for a   am feeding  both times food was fine  hot  and okay portions i would recomend a reservation if you want robertas we would have had a    min wait so we went to the    hour joint we had a pretty quiet room although every once in a while i could hear the elevator ding check out was fine no comps to speak of  all in all the Elcortez was fine for us  we were youngsters there  we are fortysomethings  and although the casino is smokey  not a hint in our room  if we found another deal there we would stay again  
P =>  good hotel at down town good location at the down town        conveniant and clean room much better than sahara and stratosphare  
P =>   Another great stay well had another great stay   check in  went smooth took picture and they made me picture key chain  free slots    free nite in the furture  free food  lose slots  and when you are winning at slots  tables and you dont want to lose that streak well if you get hungry just ask for waiter  and get your food brought to you  thats nice my room was nice and fresh and clean  and had a ball on fremont st  check pictures out more later  
P =>   Good Value You ll get what you paid for There s a reason it s the lowest priced hotel downtown Fremont East District  but it s still a good bargain  I wouldn t reccoment the Pavilion section  go with the tower or vintage rooms Note  No pool The gambling is good and Roberta s Restaurant served some very good food for the price  Try it  There are still some old coin in type dollar slots which I liked The noise level outside late at night can be annoying  so you may want to take that into consideration when obtaining your room  You can stay here and visit a dozen casinos or more without having to cab it  If you ve never stayed downtown try it at least once  it s an experience  
P =>   Couldn t be happier We spent two nights at the El Cortez and it was probably the best stay we ve ever had in Vegas  With the help of a coupon from the American Casino Guide  we spent     for two nights in one of their vintage rooms  a huge  clean  and well furnished suite  Yes      total      a night before tax  These rooms seem to get a bad rap  and we re not sure why Our room was clean  quiet  and just a few steps from the casino  very convenient  It had a big living room area with a sectional couch  two closets  a big comfortable King sized bed  and a separate dressing room sitting room  It was a smoking room  but there was very little smoke smell and no noise whatsoever from the casino downstairs  It s a very old building  but it s in nice shape and has lots of character  a rarity in Vegas  Also  there were gobs of storage  Two nightstands  an armoire and a big dresser in addition to two generous closets  And the furniture wasn t cheap hotel furniture either  it was real wood stuff that I d be proud to have in my house The vintage rooms do have a few drawbacks  however  There s no elevator  so you ll need to drag your luggage up the stairs  Also  the bathrooms are very small  And it s obvious that it s an old building  the floors creak sometimes  there aren t many electrical outlets etc  This stuff didn t bother us in the least  but other people might feel differently The steakhouse and coffee shop are great too  above average food at bargain prices  And everyone at the El Cortez  from the front desk to the hostesses at the restaurant to the security guards went out of their way to make us feel welcome and valued  Safety seems to be a concern for a lot of people downtown  but we never felt unsafe  Obviously  it s a city  and you need to be aware of your surroundings and keep track of you re valuables  But we never felt any less safe than on the Strip  We had a great time and an unbelievable hotel value and hope to come back for many more  
P =>   good value Big clean room in the tower  Good location  Great valet  Terrific food at the cafe with generous comps  Weird blackjack sidebets with lots of locals who give you a hard time for not betting the side bet and dealers barely proficient at English  Still  I left with more cash than I arrived with  I may stay there again   it s a good bargain  
P =>   I Surprised My Guests  I booked   nights at the El Cortez for two friends and I just to prove what a great hotel it really is  and they were knocked out with the great room  service and food  just as I had anticipated  First  check  in was quick  and our Tower Strip View room was very cool inside with outdoor temps hovering over        The classic hardwood furnishings and decor pleased my most particular friend  The beds were extremely comfortable  The bathroom was of adequate size  regardless what others have posted here   We re average sized guys and none of us felt confined in there  Plenty of hot water for our   long showers  and the drain drained properly too    The soaps  shampoos and etc were of fine quality  and supplied daily with the thick towels provided  What more could we ask for  The room was quite soundproof  and we didn t hear any noise from other guests at any time during our stay  and we slept at all sorts of hours too  The housekeepers did an excellent job of cleaning daily  so a hefty tip was in order The casino is great for us low rollers  and we were able to play for quite a long time on our budgets  Cocktail service was excellent too  no matter where in the casino we were  That    tip brings that server back often  Oh  the food was great  especially with our     Fun Book  coupons  A large Prime Rib dinner with all the etc in Kitty s for    was primo  The breakfast buffet will have you full all day too  All the El Cortez servers were top drawer and courteous    I now have a couple more friends to join me for a gamblin  vacation anytime for little      and we highly recommend it too  
P =>   great place to stay stayed at the el cortez for five nights rooms were clean front desk and management were very effecient bartenders were helpful and courteous ate in all the restraunts and food prices were economical and never had a bad meal security is visible at all times outside as well as on the floor Fremont expierience is a block away and freeway is close for fast access to all other sites if you drive will stay again  
P =>  Good deal  Booking through hotel com was a breeze  The El Cortez is situated a block from the Fremont Street Experience which means it is quieter and less frenetic  I stayed at a Vintage Room which has the cheapest rate  Sure  you have to lug your bags up a short flight of stairs but the room is big    queen size beds  and very clean  It had none of the smokey smell either Checking in was also a breeze and the staff was quite friendly and courteous  
P =>  If You Want No Sleep Stay Here    I am currently staying here  july        I made a BIG mistake and booked a    day stay  The first two nights i stayed in the older section in which the doors open to the outside  This is noise central  or cell block    The first night and second night both I was kept awake by fighting etc in the hall and security had to come  I was moved to the tower  as a free upgrade  my third night and the people next door were in and out all night   Drunk and LOUD and more  who knows  You can hear every noise from  four doors down  the doors slamming  loud drunk people coming in all hours of the night  In contacting the front desk when there is a problem they are NOT CONCERNED  They pass you on to security and security passes you back to the front desk  DO NOT STAY HERE  In vegas look around  there are so many places that are nice and quiet  THIS IS NOT IT  Stay here if you want a noisy environment  and if you like thinking you are in a old folks home for the homeless  it is digusting and stinks  good luck 
P =>  Save   with ample space downtown  Readers  I spent four nights at the  quot ElCo quot   from       e       I used the  quot Buy   night  get one night free quot  coupon from the American Casino Guide  for a Sunday arrival  I reserved a Vintage room for these four nights  because the telephone clerk told me that I could add Tuesday and Wednesday nights at the  quot Casino Rate quot       per night   FOUR nights      total  before taxes  Wow   To make it even better  at check in  I received a voucher for two FREE nights in tember I arrived at  PM on Sunday afternoon  I was delayed THREE times at the front desk  before I was given a room at nearly   PM  This delay was the only problem I had at the ElCo  I did not use the     bill trick  because I did not think there would be any advantage among the Vintage rooms I moved into a room on the top  th  floor of the Pavilion rooms  This room was VERY large  It was extremely clean  and the bed amp bathroom were massive  YES  the Pavilion rooms are in a combination tower and parking garage  but I was very impressed at how well this worked for me  Since I drove to Las Vegas this time  I parked my car on the  th floor  and my room was just upstairs  a few steps away  The elevators directly into the casino were fast and convenient  opening about    feet away from the restaurant The casino is clean and innovative  with excellent table games  new slots machines  and even vintage coin in slot machines  The blackjack games are the VERY BEST that I have seen in Las Vegas   single deck pitch game  with     blackjack  and a    minimum  The Sports amp Race book is clean  large  and fully equipped  I watched five baseball games at the same time There is Texas Hold Em around the clock  sometimes with     buy in  It s always easy to get into a game  with a wide variety of player quality The food is very good  Careful Kitty s is a    hour diner  and there is also a breakfast buffet Chinese food buffet  If you prefer  there is also a Subway  My favorite food  though  was at the small Pizza Lasagna restaurant diagonally across Fremont Street  Two large slices of pizza and a Diet Coke for exactly    The location is convenient  Two blocks from the highway interchange  two blocks down Fremont Street from the Fremont Street Experience canopy  and adjacent to the neon relics of the new Fremont East zone  If you prefer a serious slice of low rollers  you can look two blocks east to the Western Hotel amp Casino The shortcomings of the ElCo need to be noted  There are no stage shows  but there is a piano bar  There is no swimming pool  and the customer base is very old  This casino is definitely running exactly as it did in the     s  only with upgraded air quality  This is an adult establishment  for gamblers  If you need to stay in a hotel filled with  quot hot bodies quot   fire up the credit card to the tune of      per night and stay at the Rio  Palms  or Hard Rock  I ll prefer the Rat Pack style casino at the ElCo I will return to the ElCo  If readers need to ask questions  contact me at DrGPadgett ms metrocast netwith  quot Las Vegas quot  in the e mail title Gene Padgett Starkville  MS 
P =>   It is OK for the price you pay  Me and my sister stayed at the El Cortez for a few nights in ch this year  Overall the hotel was ok  just what you would expect for the price you pay  The rooms are spacious and clean  Ours had lovely views of the hills  Only downside was that there was no hairdryer and we had a room close to the lifts so it was very noisy  The lobby and casino area were ok  Looked pretty old fashioned and full of old people so if you are under       you will feel a bit weird  Didn t bother us too much though as we only used the hotel to sleep in and not much else  The area around it was ok  It is a good bit away from the strip but if you have a car it s fine and there are also frequent buses running  You also have a good few bars and  very important for us  a starbucks   minutes walk away I would recommend this hotel if you just look for a cheap place to stay while in Vegas or if you are over     If you are in your   s  like us  and looking for a cooler Vegas experience then spend the extra few bucks and book a room on the strip  
P =>  Nice Hotel Away from Strip This Hotel was great  It is away from the strip but a short bus ride to the strip  Everything is cheap down here so it saves you a ton of cash  When we arrived at the hotel to check in they gave us a free  night stay if we returned next month and a room up grade    Take we only paid     a night   Yes     a night  Then we received coupons to the buffet that was there  So we both ate for    at a buffet   Yeah the buffet wasn t all that but it was almost free which made it great  Table start at like    won over      in blackjack  I enjoyed this casino I don t think I will stay on the stripe again  Can t beat the proce the staff is friendly and you get   enjoy downtown las vegas 
P =>  Great Value  Great Location  Great Casino The El Cortez is one of the best kept secrets on Freemont Street  I booked a tower room for     night on the weekend  The strip places are way overpriced on weekends  plus there is a lot to see downtown  The El Cortez attracts a lot of locals  which is always a good sign  The casino is friendly and easy to navigate  Excellent choices for video poker players from a penny up  Players card gives new players a free    in play  The garage is close to the hotel  and free to park  The hotel is just   block from the beginning of the Freemont Street experience  located in the recently cleaned up Freemont East district  This part of town is now safe to walk alone at night  I did during my stay  The beds are comfortable  air conditioning works well  and elevators are quick  The window does not open the full way  and they charge     day for internet access if you need it  The only drawback is the small bathroom  but it is clean and functional  The shower pressure here is probably in the top   best of any hotel I have been to in recent trips to Vegas  I will be staying here again  and the staff is very nice  I was able to check in early  
P =>  A good experience all around My tower room was clean  spacious  nicely furnished  couch  coffee table  desk  comfy king bed    and a haven from the cigarette smoke wisping everywhere in Vegas  The A C was powerful  the bathroom was small  and the decor feels   s without the decades of wear  Hall noise was only occasional and acceptable  Only thing that gave me pause was the door lock  While it s sturdy when bolted from the inside  there isn t a tight seal when you arrive   and gouges in the doorjamb show that once upon a time someone without a key wanted in  Those gouges may be archaic  the El Cortez s neighborhood has improved markedly since my      downtown stay  There s a noticeable amount of riffraff on the streets  but the illumination and guards and tourist traffic prevent insecurity  The friendly Freemont St  vibe feels like a street fair instead of the brassier strip  less crowded  less expensive  more laidback  less youthful energy  good  amp  bad   The slow bus to the strip runs regularly  and does get crowded The EC s restaurants and locals heavy casino aren t glitzy  lots of jeans  pullovers  comfort food  The coupons and comps received at check in were appreciated  Even without them  I d be likely to return to El Cortez  For me  it was a low key  comfortable place to stay  
P => I am now a true believer  I remember the El Cortez as a scary  lonesome place that Fremont forgot  The recent renovations east of Fremont and at the hotel itself has garnered it very good reviews  so I signed up for Memorial Day weekend  I am now a bona fide believer  An early check in was a breeze  I was given an   th floor room in the Tower  facing the Strip  Rooftops by day  great lights and sights   night  The room was good sized  with big  manly  oversized furniture  The sofa in the window alcove was terrific  Great place for coffee and a morning paper  The very small bath and kind of awkward tub shower was functional  Great  new big towels  The king bed was very comfortable Staff was very friendly and efficient  My  st stop was the ice machine  which was not working  I called the desk and reported it  asking if there was ice on every floor  They said  quot yes quot   and in a few minutes I went to the elevator to hit a new floor for ice  When it opened  the repair guy was getting off to fix the problem  The lobby and piano bars are beautiful  with the newest in gaming equipment  The rest of the casino is a blend of new  older and VERY old machines  The deeper into the casino  the more you see the old El Cortez  A bit worn  a bit rough around the edges  But overall  fine with lots of    BJ  opened some    BJ for a while   Free slot tournament daily if you do a small amount of points on your card  The restaurants were night and day  Roberta s was sensational  Good service and an Idaho trout  quot special quot   Flown in daily  it was prepared perfectly  with a great bread basket  salad and sides for                Find that somewhere else    The cafe however was the opposite  Prices looked great  but service was poor and the food was worse  except for great desserts    They had a good  smiling crowd  so maybe I was unlucky  I did not use the buffet Easy walk to Fremont for a terrific  quot Queen Tribute quot  on the big  quot canopy quot   They finally got that right  It was electrifying   Downtown was packed  everyone was having a fun time  with a very good  live band doing covers of great    s tunes  I really like downtown  The Duece bus is a block away from the hotel and will bring you anywhere on the strip  Why  You re downtown  I will be back to the El Cortez for weekends on my Vegas trips  Good room and service  excellent prices  the bartender knows your name and I love that walkway  cobblestone and palm trees  to Fremont  Bob Mp s  try the amazing pizza    huge slices  amp  soda       at Andy s  a     block up Fremont  next to the Griffin   
P =>   El Cortez Always Comfortable  Great place to stay  Very cordial staff  Let me check in very early without question  Tower rooms are the best deal  They are very large and comfortable  This isn t a ritzy strip type place so don t expect it to be  For a Downtown place it can t be beat Probably not the best for first timers or youngsters but for the middle aged crowd and up it is ideal Lots of security and very comfortable  Good food choices in all price ranges  
P =>   Great deal near the Fremont Experience  old strip  Booked this because it was cheap on I vegas comOther than a VERY smoky hotel lobby  we loved it  we were upgraded  the valet service is very quick and free  we tipped  and it is a couple of short blocks to the Deuce   the bus which runs up and down Las Vegas avenue for    a ride or    for the day  It is only a couple of blocks from  quot The Fremont Experience quot  which is the old strip where a party atmosphere reigns  There are street performances  casinos  Chippendales ready to be photographed with you for a fee  drinks at will and on and on  This is a great bargain because you have a lot of money to do other stuff like see great shows  or just watch people  or gamble if that s why you go to LV  Check in was painless as was check out  Definitely would stay there again  
P =>  winner I took a gamble on the elco because the rates were so good I was definitely a winner  Check in was a breeze My wife always checks the rooms first before we sign  we were both very satisfied and comfortable with it We were giving many   for  meal coupons and    off each for there restraunts  We used them all  The food was great  The prime rib at Kittys was one of the best         Downtown has changed Cleaned up expanded  tight security made for the best downtown trip we ve had  the sidewalks have been widend for several blocks up and around Fremont street  I highly recommend the elco for the fun after fifty crowd  sam 
P =>   Nice hotel for the price Just came back from the cortez  stayed in the tower room  nice  clean room  maid service everyday  didn t hear any construction going at all  the hotel is in a good location  no problems  close to fremont street experience  and double deuce about   min  away  all in all nice place for the money  
P =>   Some Good   Some Problems I ve been going to Las Vegas since       I believe that the first two times you visit  you should stay on the Strip  walk around with your eyes and mouth wide open  experience the overpriced hotels  tight slots  high minimums at the tables  and the underpaying video poker machines  By your third trip  you re ready to stay Downtown  Which brings us to El CortezEl Cortez is NOT a place for first time visitors to Las Vegas  I also do not recommend it if you are not familiar with downtown Las Vegas LOCATIONEl Cortez is located on Fremont Street  one block east of Las Vegas Boulevard between  th and  th Streets  It is two blocks from the  quot Fremont Street Experience quot  in an area that used to be considered seedy  but with new construction in the area  a well lighted walkway directly from Las Vegas Boulevard to the front door on  th Street  and the presence of security personnel on Fremont Street  I felt safe walking  The area has plenty of foot traffic till midnight  I cannot account for activity after midnight  CHECK INSmooth  quick  efficient  THE ROOMI stayed in a PAVILION ROOM    so all comments refer to a Pavilion Room only The Pavilion concept is very clever  Half of the main parking garage has an extra floor  and on this top floor is a    room motel  The room was spacious for a motel room  Two people can move around without bumping into each other  The paint  carpet  etc were in good condition  Drawers and closet space were ample  The bed was comfortable  The linens were clean The bathroom was tiny  A rotund guest would find it uncomfortable  The sink was located outside the bathroom  The sink area contained adequate counter space  The shower stream was steady and strong  The water temperature  however  was inconsistent The A C worked very well and very quietly  It was the type of A C that didn t turn on off based on temperature  This will be a plus for those who wake up every time a heater AC turns on or off I did not watch television  so I can t comment on picture quality or station availability The room contained a clock radio  There was no safe  fridge  microwave  There was no desk or table  There was no full length mirror The perimeter of the motel is a walkway which provides a nice view from three sides and a view of the parking garage roof from the  th If you have a car  you can take an elevator directly up to the motel or down to the casino There could be several problems if you re a light sleeper  You can hear the TV in the next room  You can hear people coughing through the air vents  My room overlooked  th Street and I could hear street noise  A major problem for a light sleeper would be the sound of doors closing  We all know that hotel doors make a noise when you close them    a result of the automatic lock engaging  However  you can usually mitigate the noise by closing the door gently  The Pavilion doors  however  would not close from the outside unless you pulled them hard  so that no matter how quiet you tried to be  the door made a loud noise  I was by myself  but I can just imagine the problems a couple would have if spouse   left the room early while spouse   was still sleeping HOUSEKEEPINGI left the room in the morning  When I came back at night  the room had been cleaned  What more can I ask  In addition  my shower tended to drip water on the floor requiring a second floor towel  When housekeeping noticed that I was using a bath towel as a second floor towel  they provided a second floor towel    a minor incident  but it shows thoughtfulness and a willingness to help the guest without being asked  ELEVATORSI was there seven days and never once even came close to thinking  What s taking so long    Very efficient SECURITYCameras cover every inch of the Pavilion area and I often encountered a security guard  No one checks room keys as you access the Pavilion floor  so anyone can access the Pavilion floor from the casino and parking garage  For me the ultimate security test is this  would I feel comfortable if my wife or daughter were staying here alone  my answer would be  no  PARKINGThere is complimentary self parking in their garage  There is also valet parking which I never investigated  The garage itself is roomy and easy to navigate SUMMARYYou don t buy a Ford Focus and complain that it s not a Mercedes  This is an economy hotel  I was here by myself and I m not a light sleeper  so I didn t have to worry about the security and noise issues mentioned above  If you want a quieter  more secure environment downtown for approximately the same price  check my review of the Las Vegas Club  
P =>  Beware of Construction Noise Yes the rooms are large and fairly clean  the hotel entrance and general area much better than it was afew years ago  However  there was a good deal of construction going on at the new tower being built right next door  and it began at   a m  It penetrated our  th floor north facing room and from conversations with other guests during our   days it seemed to bother many on that side  A move to a higher south side room helped  For us  it was just an ok place with a reasonable rate on Easter weekend  we wouldn t return in a hurry  Had an excellent Easter morning breakfast at the cafe  
P =>  Repeat Visitor to the El Cortez One of the few remaining genuine  quot Old Vegas quot  hotel casinos I hate using  quot Old Vegas quot  since that is what the Strip visitors call downtown Fremont Street area  But it is an older Vegas hotel and has that feel about it I like the hotel and the casino  There is some age to the rooms  but they are clean and my room was quiet and it was a bargain The walk to the Fremont Street Experience feels safe now with the block between there and the hotel having been upgraded in the past few years I will definitely return again  
P =>  Another Good Visit to the El Cortez     I made a solo trip to Las Vegas and stayed for three nights          at the El Cortez  I was able to check into a Pavilion Room when I arrived at        It was fine  a non smoking room           There was a good view of the area when standing outside on the cement walkway The bed was comfortable  the room was quiet  the walkway was well lit  and the staff were helpful  I ate in the coffee shop different times   always good  I walked across Fremont Street and ate a breakfast at Mamacita s  which was also good   also  good drink service while gamblinga at the El Co I have been gambling staying at the El Cortez for the past few years and have always had very good experiences  I will be returning in two months  
P =>   A Great Value in Old Las Vegas I lived in Las Vegas for over    years  and recently stayed in the El Cortez to be with family for a family wedding  I was quite surprised at how nice our room and the overall experience were  The El Cortez brought in new management a while back you can tell  bit by bit they are upgrading the property  The  quot gourmet quot  restaurant Roberta s was great  including a great  quot Stone Crab quot  special   Our room was very big and nicely appointed  The location is in the  quot East Fremont quot  area which is currently undergoing renovation  across the street is a large luxury high rise condominium   Many hotels in Las Vegas are nicer  but they are also MUCH more expensive  If you are want to save more dollars for the tables  I highly recommend the El Cortez as a great place to stay  and getting greater by the month   
P =>   Cheap adequate but my room was VERY COLD  I had one of the  quot Vintage quot  rooms  a real bargain at under     a night early week  about     on weekends  But when the weather turned cold on my second night  so did the room  I could not figure out how to get heat  only air  COLD air  I complained twice to the front desk but nobody ever came to help fix the temperature  so I just had to bundle up  Otherwise I would have lkiked this hotel  It s in a great downtown location  away from the hideous and gaudy Strip  but only a block from the Deuce bus that runs up and down the Strip  and it  s only two blocks from the Fremont St  Experience  The casino has a very good coffee shop for cheap home style meals and breakfast at any hour  There s also a    hour Subway sandwich shop and an inexpensive buffet open for breakfast  brunch and dinner  Chinese   
P =>   The last piece of real Las Vegas it s great  Here is the bottom line on the El Cortez and the other downtown properties as well  Reasonably well kept safe  clean and comfortable if you have enough common sense to know what to expect It never fails to amaze me that people expect because it s Vegas that you can get a suite like you see on TV shows for     per night If you want the sterilized non Las Vegas atmosphere of the Strip you must pay the price The    call brand drink downtown is twice that or more there The rooms and food are terribly expensive as well I am a    year Vegas visitor and I left the strip years ago I like the old Vegas feel and I go to Vegas to drink gamble and relax The table limits are much higher on the strip and the stats tell you the payout is generally considerably lower on machines It truly depends on what you go to Las Vegas for Downtown is more like the Las Vegas I like The El Cortez specifically is my favorite The piano bar is teriffic and cheap Low limit games abound The food is good in the cafe and wonderful in the steak house The tower rooms are considered by many to be the best value in town clean quiet and comfortable with great bedding Air conditioning is great water is hot Service as is the case in all of Las Vegas in my opinion depends on your attitude as much as anything else Take the initiative to be friendly and it will usually be returned The Elco is truly the last bit of Vegas left in that is not owned by a big corporation The owner the legendary Jackie Gaughan lives on the property He is regularly seen on the property and plays poker nightly A gentleman Now one final note Before long you militant non smokers will win Las Vegas and smoking will be banned on the casino floor and in the casino bars be it will happen this year maybe next it may be   or even    years For now however don t come to Downtown Vegas and be offended by me sitting at the machine next to you smoking a Camel and drinking a glass of whiskey The downtown casinos are smaller and many of those who frequent them smoke for now at least them s the facts We have non smokers in our group but they are not the type who think that a whiff of smoke will cause them to immediately fall dead In summary I hope my comments are not considered to be smart assed I am just using my experiences to hopefully help others to make the right choices to make their trip great  
P =>   Horrible service and all smoking rooms Booked a reservation through a Vegas package website and ended up at the El Cortez  My wife reacts to smoke so we called the Vegas website to make sure we got a no smoking room and we had selected that non smoking option on the reservation booking  It was also printed non smoking room on our confirmation so we thought no problem Upon arriving at El Cortez hotel for check in we found the non smoking request is only a  request  and ALL their rooms were smoking    Appartently you can pay  much  more for the deluxe rooms suites which are more smoke free but everything else is smoking  The hotel service was terrible and we ended up cancelling the room and finding another hotel on our own which was far superior and cheaper  Everything was dirty and yellowish brown from all the smoke throughout the hotel and casino area I would NEVER return to this hotel  They appeared sneaky in trapping you into booking and then hoping you have no choice upon arrival  That was my impression at front desk too  they had clearly been through this before  I don t mind hotels only offering smoking rooms  probably better business for them  but IMO if you request non smoking room and they can t accomidate they should not book the reservation   Appartently the hotel allows advertises on the various websites to book reservations under  non smoking  even when they don t have the rooms and then tell you it is only a request not binding    Ridiculous and sneaky  it means they are hungry for business and I don t think such practice should be rewarded  
P =>   Hmmm   this one s tough I had a two day in Vegas that I needed to plug with a cheaper stay  It was amazing that  on those travel web sites  the prices are truly moving targets  I didn t move fast enough to get some newer properties on either side of the Strip  so old tired downtown LV it was First and foremost  the price was absolutely fantastic for a decent hotel  The El Cortez was probably a grand dame in its day  It is now in a questionable area awaiting revelopment  so the overall scheme of things is really frayed and tacky but  for the price  it is doable  Just park your car in the garage  which has security at all times  and use your room   and  if you are a casino or food bargain monger  then you can partake in that too The furnishings of the room were ornate and comfortable  I slept well  The bathroom was fine  For the bargain price  the accommodations were totally acceptable and secure In conclusion  if you like tolerate old downtown Las Vegas  then this is definitely doable  If you are looking for a place to sleep that s fairly nice for a bargain price  this is definitely doable  If you want the hotel stay to be part of a memorable Las Vegas experience  then this is NOT the place for you  
P =>   What A Pleasant Surprise  This hotel gets so much controversy that I just had to try it for curiosity sake  On a recent   night stay in Vegas  I chose to stay at El Cortez my last night  ember  nd and booked a tower room since these are advertised as the nicest  Hesitant  yes  but boy was I surprised when I entered the room  Room was large with a small separate sitting room with a loveseat  The carpet was new and the furniture also appeared to be new and it didn t look like the cheap pressboard stuff either  The bathroom is small  reminds me of the bathrooms in the Gold Coast  My only complaint is that the tub had film on it and obviously could have used a better cleaning I enjoyed the casino and the bj dealers were very nice  Good security around the hotel especially at the entrances and valet parking very attentive  Unfortunately  I didn t get a chance to eat at any of the restaurants Would I stay here again  you betcha  
P =>   El Cortez is the place to stay I won t say that I am a seasoned Vegas traveler but have stayed in my share of seedy places  Unfortunately  it seems the negative comments garner more attention  I admit that I was holding my breath before checking in to the hotel  Check in was a breeze for us  I was hoping for an upgrade to a tower room but I guess I didn t use the right approach  No matter  We were in a pavillion room and that suited us just fine  In fact  my sister had a tower room and there wasn t a huge difference in the size The room was very clean and comfortable  The shower and the bathroom are small but who needs a huge room for a shower and toilet  If you are spending more time in your room instead of checking out downtown    you might want to rethink Vegas for a vacation This isn t the place to see or be seen  It s cozy old school Vegas before Steve Wynn worked at the Golden Nugget  I mean where can you play roulette for a buck mimimum  The El isn t a huge place and you won t find it overstuffed with slot machines  The crowd is older and probably filled with more locals than tourists Security  We walked in and out of the Cortez numerous times and I never felt like I had to look over my shoulder  Most of the foot traffic was to and fro to Fremont Street and to the Deuce bus stop  I think we were panhandled twice in four days    that happened near the Walgreens near the Neon museum  The security guys were always outside and visible from both sides of the casino  As a side note  I recommend the Mamacita s mexican restaurant just across from the hotel   Great food with Cuban and Mexican choices  The small party store  next door  is great for a paper   a soda  or any type of novelty purchases  The owner is a very nice guy The hidden gem is the Deuce bus    dollars one way to the Strip or go head and get the   dollar pass for    hours  The Deuce stop is directly across the street from the Fremont Street sign I ll definitely be using the El as home base in the future  It makes no sense to dole out money that could be used for say    I dont know   Gambling Two more things   Al Stokes is the slot manager   Terrific guy  He went out of his way to make sure that our group had a blast   Thanks Al    BTW you have to say you are  quot stoked quot  to meet him lol The drink service can be slow at times  You are at the mercy of the section you happen to be in  We had a server that was sort of huffy after we complained  I can t say I was pleased with the final resolution   a drink  but that was an isolated incident  See for yourself   We had a blast    
P =>   Dysfunctional reservation system but still a great value and fun hotel I had doubts about the El Cortez  but wanted a cheap downtown Las Vegas room for one night  so took a chance  and I was very pleased  Access from the interstate was easy  and my weeknight checkin quick and efficient The El Cortez is possibly the oldest hotel in downtown Las Vegas  and as such is an architectural hodgepodge  The vintage rooms are original rooms from the    s located directly over the casino  accessible by stair  but not by elevator  The pavillion rooms are on the top floor of the parking ramp which stands next to the original hotel  If one parks near the elevator  these rooms are relatively close to one s auto  The tower rooms are in a separate tower added on to the old hotel It is a long hike from the parking ramp elevator to registration  I suggest motorists staying in pavillion rooms who choose not to use valet parking leave their luggage in their car  register  then return for their luggage instead of schlepping it with them to the registration desk I stayed in a pavillion room  which was on the small side  and like all Las Vegas hotels in this price range had nothing in the way of amenities such as coffee  fridge  etc   the idea being that one should be gambliing instead of staying in one s room  The El Cortez casino is a grind joint where they don t expect high rollers  so no room safe  I found the room clean and perfectly satisfactory for a brief overnight stay with minimal time in the room  Pavillion rooms are accessed by outside walkways open to the weather  My room had a great view from the front door  but only a single window next to the front door  Think high rise motel  The pavillion walkways can seem spooky after dark  but are well lighted  monitored by multiple security cameras  and patrolled by guards While on the subject of security  some previous reviewers complained about the unsafe location  Apparently they think Las Vegas is an urban Disneyland solely for their pleasure  and that all non tourists should be banished to gulags  I found the area between the El Cortez and the Fremont Street mall to be well illuminated and patrolled  The local  and perfectly innocuous  downtown residents were outnumbered by middle aged tourist couples in stretch pants I ate in the Chinese buffet  with the    discount coupon supplied upon checkin the price was     Nothing spectacular  but good value and a pleasant meal  I had a large full breakfast in the coffee shop for the graveyard special rate of     Good food  good service My only complaint is the registration system  I phoned the hotel and was put on hold for ten minutes  After a couple such sessions I gave up and booked through priceline com for under     total for a week night room  Apparently this is the norm  I just finished making another reservation at the El Cortez  The hotel website was down  and I spent five minutes on hold before reaching the reservations clerk  after previously being disconnected  only to be told I couldn t stay for Friday only  that I had to stay Saturday as well  I thanked them  rang off  then booked a Friday night only room on i Vegas com for under     total  If I d planned farther ahead I might have gotten a better price  but since my reservation was only three weeks in advance  I find the weekend price increase reasonable I think the El Cortez is a great value with a touch of oldtime Las Vegas ambience  Don t let their flaky reservation system discourage you if this is the sort of place which appeals to you  
P =>  Best Value Downtown If you are looking for a super clean comfortable room then this is theplace for you  The tower rooms are huge and beautiful  It is not superfancy but offers an old time feeling  It is like jumping back in time You might be greeted with a goody bag of deoderant soaps  facial scrubs  body and bath products  toothpaste shampoo  razors  good ones at that  and even aftershave  We had these in our hotel room both times that we stayed during the month The food is pretty good in the cafe that stays open all night  They have very good soups and steaks there  You will be treated like you are family at the buffet and the cafe You will really appreciate the front desk check in for they are some of the nicest people around  They will make sure that you are comfortable during your stay  They really try hard The comps are good if you remember to use your card during play  The comp staff is quick and very nice  They will see to it that you get what you have comming for using the card The casino has some of my favorite old   line slot machines as well as the new ones  You can play pennies  nickles and dimes on most of them  They have a great variety If you are worried about being in a shady neighborhood  don t be  There is security all around the building  in the parking ramp  and they can watch you walk a block down to Freemont Street  You will be glad to return to your quiet hotel room after all of the noise in the street  You are most likely the safest that you will be since securityis always watching over you Yes  there are a few charactors that roam in and out of the casino but secuity has you covered  Watch your purse and wallet as you wouldwalking down the street anyway El Cortz will wrap you up in white fluffy towels and will offer a comfortable night of quiet sleep  It is truely the best downtown  
P =>  great value hotel I had a hard time finding a decently priced place to stay  but found this place on a web site  price was excellent      a night for   week nights  I paid for a pavillion room but was upgraded to a tower room since the pavillions were overbooked  As others have said  this is a decent hotel but nowhere near as nice as strip hotels  comparable to the general downtown hotels like lvc  fitz and plaza  only problem was that it was away from the fremont street experience  a block away from the neonopolis so at least      blocks from the general action downtown  there was a security guard at the corner of the hotel and fremont street  a guard is there       another      guard in the back by the parking entrance  The guard in front looks down fremont street to make sure that people are safe walking down that block to the el co  lots of construction going on  a condo being built right across the street so should provide more safety with the additional foot action there  My first night there I stayed in a  nd floor room  had a problem as I smelled cigarette smoke while sleeping  the next day I asked for a n s room but was told the room was n s already  they moved me up to a   th floor room  great   with an awesome view of the strip  as someone else said  there was a lot of noise from the club on the next block that lasted until   am but the a c drowned out most of the noise  I got what I paid for  a decent  cheap safe place to stay  They provided a nice quattro razor and soaps and shampoo in addition to mouthwash  moisturizer and some cleansing pads  they also offered a coupon book with    cashback on machines  matching     play at bj     off on meals  when signing up for their player s card   generally  nice place to stay  casino is so so  food was okay and rooms in the tower were decent size  could fit   comfortably  
P =>   Good deal for the money If you are use to staying on the strip at the big casino s  then thisplace isn t for you  However  if you stay at places  like Circus Circus  Fitgerald s  then this place represents an excellent value  I stayed in the Towers  which I would recommend  The room was clean  bed was really nice and pretty big size  Bathroom was small and water pressure just average  One thing to keepin mind is noise  I was there Saturday night  and you can hear the loud music from the clubs which lasted until      AM The good news is even though downtown  they are located very close to the Deuce bus stop which you can take to the strip  Also  I found the staff to be pretty friendly  however  didn t gamble there  so not sure how the rest of the staff is Overall  for what I paid on a weekend  which was very little comparedto the strip  I am pretty satisfied with what I got  Myself  I would normally go for a nice casino on the strip if not a huge difference  but if there is a big price difference  I think this is a reasonable alternative that someone can consider if you are just looking for a clean place to crash and just sleep  I think the key thing is remember that you are paying very little in comparison to other casino s  and I think they do a very good job for what you would expect at that price  So good going El Cortez  
P =>   Pavillon Rooms   Read Important Advice Stayed in a Pavillon room for several nights IMPORTANT ADVICE  Do not accept a room numbered in the      to      range  These rooms are located near the elevators  the floors are tile  the walls and ceilings are concrete  the sound echoes VERY LOUDLY  Being Vegas  this is an issue  as people are going into and out of their rooms at all hours  People engage in loud conversations waiting for elevator  Rolling luggage makes a lot of noise being pulled over the floor tiles  If your near the elevators  as I was   you ll hear all of it GOOD THINGS    Price  Got a good price on line  excellent value    Air conditioning and heat  central  worked very well    Bed very comfortable  Good quality soap provided  and they also provided a razor  mouthwash  moisturizer  shampoo     Free parking  Security constantly patrols parking garage BAD THINGS    Room door  and bathroom door  are heavy industrial grade doors  impossible to close quietly  You ll hear your neighbors open and close their doors    Cable TV featured a very limited selection of stations  notably no Weather Channel  I consider not having the weather channel a big omission  considering your on vacation and you want to know what is going on with the weather    Provided shampoo was really bad quality  I had my own  so not a big deal OTHER COMMENTS    Hotel staff is not excellent   not bad  but they certainly could be a little more friendly  Would not play Roulette or other tables at the hotel  gaming staff is surly    Hotel Food  Chinese Buffet is mediocre  Kitty s coffee shop is a quality shop  Note the breakfast buffet costs an extra    on weekends    The Pavillon Rooms all have   Queen beds  and are good for up to   people  Too small for more than    in my opinion    Excellent access to Fremont street  Felt safe doing the walk at all times  Bus stops to catch bus  The Deuce  to and from Strip are conveniently located  Note this bus takes a good    minutes to get to from the strip  The bus drivers can be cranky    The room is not immaculate  The bathtub needed to be regrouted  The wood furniture had many little dents and scratches  Not a problem for me  but if your looking for new and pristine  this is not the hotel for you  
P =>   Got what expected Got two rooms for     each  It is smokey downstairs and on some of the lower floors you can smell it  It was a good way to ease into the Vegas style  where you could be overwhelmed on the strip  Cheap and open tables could always be found  People say that is in the dodgy part of downtown  but i dont think that at all  Never felt that way at any time walking around at night  They have a security guard right on the corner as well  Just one block from the Freemont Street Experience  If you want to save a few bucks while staying downtown I would recommend here  
P =>   Good deal for the price I was looking for a decent hotel on or near Fremont Street for a cheap weekend  The El Cortez was the lowest priced hotel that fit the bill  I had gambled at EC several years back and remember it as a low roller casino in a not so great area  so I wasn t thrilled  But I read the reviews here and they seemed to be overall positive  I m of the opinion that a hotel rooms is just a place to clean up and sleep  so as long as it s not dirty  it s fine with me  So I decided to give it a try I booked a Pavilion Room  much nicer than the super cheap Vintage rooms from what I had read  for     night Thurs Sun  When I arrived I first noticed that the area the hotel is located appears to be much nicer than I remembered  with new condos being built nearby   and the casino itself was quite nice and much more upscale than I recall  Once I checked in  I was happy to find I was upgraded to a tower room  The only downside was that it was a smoking room  I had requested non smoking   but there was not an overwhelming odor so it didn t bother me Our room was on the  th floor and had a direct view of the Strip  well as much as you can see looking straight down Las Vegas Blvd  which was really cool  The room itself is bigger than some others I have stayed in in Vegas  It had two queen beds  plus a writing desk and small couch  The decor was nothing outstanding but nice enough  and not terribly old looking  Beds were very comfy and the pillows and bedding was soft  although the outer bed cover had a couple of cigarette burns There was a decent sized sink area with a separate small bathroom shower area  The shower was fine to use  but very low  I m     quot  and I had maybe   quot  of clearance above my head  and the shower head was about chin level for me  But the water pressure was good and it did the job  One complaint was that the toilet was running all night  As long as I shut the bathroom door it wasn t an annoyance  but it s something that should be fixed  especially with a drought in Vegas   The only other notable thing to complain about was a rattling A C panel on the roof  I tried to stop the rattling with no success but eventually I got used to it  This  and the toilet running were obviously problems with just the one room and not enough to condemn the place overall  In fact  I d stay here again in a second  I ve stayed at the Vegas Club three times and would choose the EC everytime instead  I redeemed a few coupons from the good funbook  but I hardly gambled at all this trip  although the EC is known for loose slots and low limits  Overall  I was happy with my stay and would recommend the EC for a low cost but comfortable stay  
P =>   A Perfect Place to Vacation I stayed   nights in the El Cortez  I honestly cannot find anything bad to say   I booked through their website  It was     during the week and     on the weekend for a pavillion room  The room was nice and clean and the best bargin in LV in my opinion  Be sure and request fun book coupons a couple of times by email before you go  They give you    credit on slots  every    days  and    dining credit in each book  Buy an American casino guide book on the net thru Amazon etc  and tell them when you book the room you have a coupon and you get one night free  Kitty s diner in the hotel has good food at a resonable price and with the    coupon it s really a good deal  The hotel is only a   minute walk to the bus stop to the strip  The bus stop is right on Freemont street  The new double decker busses are great and only    for    hours to go anywhere  Don t believe the reviews that say it s a bad area  They have a securiy guard all day and I think until midnight on the corner by the hotel and of course there are security guards on bikes all over the area  I used to stay at the Stratosphere but this is even a better deal  Sign up for the free shuttle back to the airport when you check in  This hotel is where I m staying from now on  
P =>   Hotel reasonably clean I have stayed at the hotel from                We were   people staying in the room  My firstimpression is that the room was a pretty decentsize for   queen beds  PAVILION   QUEENS   The Bathroom was okay in cleanness  amp  was small   basically you open the door  amp  the toilet is on theright  amp  the bath tub is really close to the toilet  We didn t have any problems with the hotel employees  The only discomfort we had was that we were there for oneweek  amp  they didn t have a coffee pot for our room Please note  there is no charge for a refrigerator coffee pot  ironing board with iron  and hair dryer I enjoyed the short walking distance to the busstop  amp  the Fremont experience  I ve been several hotelsin Las Vegas for business  and I have had a couple ofbad experiences  though this hotel was okay    Now  I cannot comment on the older part of the hotel that has notgone through renovation  Will keep this hotel in mindon my next business trip  
P =>   What a dump and the food was pig slop We will never ever go back to the El Cortez  a real dump  The food is pure pig slop and the management are thugs in cheap suits  We will pay more next time and stay on the strip  The El Cortez is in a dangerous area and dangerous people wander in and out of the casino at all times  What a nightmare   
P =>  Las VEgas Trip Report There were two underagers with me this time        but old enough to drop off at Tournament of Kings  which of course they loved  so I could stop by Bally s for the M amp G  Hiya  As we mentioned at the M amp G  my first impression coming up the strip was YUCK  Not what I wanted to see or experience coming into my faorite get away place let me tell you  I could not believe the cranes and construction and holes in the scenery  I could stay home and see that  And what is going up  the Wynn is elegant but it s not what I want to see a lot of in Las Vegas  Thank God for Downtown  We stayed at the El Cortez  clean  quiet  renovating and big enough for the   girls and their assorted foo foo  Right outside there were   old new neon pieces being installed with a  th on the way  WHEE   I love old school  The Freemont East sign was up and the stores were being spiffed up inside and out  There was no longer the  quot questionable quot  dark block between Cortez and Freemont St  Experience  And for the first time we noticed a significant amount of police and security presence  Squad cars  bikes  on foot  on corners  in stores  they were everywhere  And they were not afraid to look you in the eye and acknowledge you or anyone else in the area  There is rowdy fun and rowdy up to no good  They ll keep it the first  I m going back on my own in t  wheeha   so I can do more of MY stuff  fountains  Slots o Fun   love the sound of the coins  told you I was old school  Laughlin and many many margaritas      
P =>   Wow better then i ever expected I picked the hotel on the price and was very surprised on what a nice room it was  we stayed in the tower and from the looks everything in there looked newly decorated  The beds were very comfortable the room had lots of space with a nice sitting area the shower had plenty of water pressure  big plus  and everything was nice new and clean  Only complaint I have is the lack of signs in the casino  thank goodness I was more sober then most trips to Vegas this time or might have never found my back to my nice clean comfy room  
P =>   Just a clean Place to sleep This place is not really nice or does not even have stylish decor  but if you are looking for a CHEEP and clean place to stay  this is great  The AC worked really good  which is really imortant for y  The Bathroom is probably the original one  but hey who cares  I was just there to sleep for a few hours and and clean up after a long night partyin  Hey a coool club down the street is The Griffin  It is a great place to stop by on the way out for the night  
P =>  El Cortez es El Perfecto  I had the pleasure of vacationing to Las Vegas  Nevada during the middle of y       Originally I considered staying on the strip at one of the more popular Vegas hotels such as Bally s or the Wynn  However  after speaking with a friend who frequently travels to VegasI was set on staying downtown to avoid the crowds and reap the gambling profits  He told me about a little known hole in the wall family run operation called the El Cortez hotel and casino At first I was skeptical  particulary after reading the long list of bad reviews here on trip advisor  My friend encouraged me to stay at the El Cortez and check out Orbitz for a great deal on the trip  Sure enough  I found a   day    night plus airfare package from Hartford  CT for       I was amazed at the deal and couldn t pass it up  I figured that even if the place was a total dump the vacation was still a steal I arrived at the El Cortez on Sunday afternoon  It isn t in the most visually pleasing neighborhood  but as soon as you enter the hotel a very pleasent  and gorgeous  hostess in there to greet you and answer any questions  There was a small trash can fire that had just been put out when I arrived so it did smell a little like burning plastic  Check in was a breeze and I promptly made my way up to my room  My room was very spacious and clean with two queen beds  a    inch plasma tv  and a newly renovated bathroom  The bathroom was generallysmall  but had plenty of mirrors and granite counter tops  About halfof the hotel has been renovated so make sure to specify that you wanta renovated room when you arrive  There is no extra cost  The sportsbook is very tastefully done with a pleasent staff  There are about six    inch plasmas and quite a few smaller plasmas as well  The sportsbook is not as elaborate as the Strip books  but the leather seats are incredibly comfortable and the odds are actually better than most strip sportsbooks Unfortunately  the slot machines are still coin operated  The table games however are wonderful  It was never crowded and the dealers seemed genuinely happy when I won  I won over     dollars at the blackjack table during my stay  I even played a few hands with Jim  the owned and operator of the El Cortez  He is a big drinker but a nice guy The Chinese buffet was excellent  It rivaled any Chinese buffet I have been to in Vegas  I also tried out there sit down restuarant  which is immaculate and reasonably priced  I had a better meal there for    bucks than the     i spent on a   course meal at the Wynn during the week I cannot say enough about the El Cortez  It was truly a pleasure to stay downtown at this hotel  I will be back in ember  Please don thesitate to take advantage of this hotel and the dirt cheap deals that can be found on Orbitz  Travelocity  Expedia  etc  Viva LAS VEGAS    
P =>   Wow    The El Cortez is really nice    I spent   days in e at the El Cortez and found the property and the personnel to be way more than I expected  My room was one of the Pavilion rooms above the garage so it was a great value and very clean  Bed was comfy and the shower was refreshing There were no issues walking from the El Cortez to LV Blvd to catch the  Duece  or Fremont Street Experience  That area is under major improvement  well lit  and monitored patrolled    so you feel safe  Just use common sense as you would anywhere else I ate at all the restaurants there and would rate the food much above average and a great value for your money The gaming was fun  I played mostly BJ and video poker  Don t forget to use the coupons in the Fun Book  I won with the     match play coupon and there was a special deal where they gave me     on my player s card They also gave me a   Free Nights coupon so I am going back to the El Cortez for   nights in ust  Good Luck    
P => The El Cortez is Fine My first Vegas hotel doubled its rate for Friday and Saturday  so I moved to the El Cortez on Friday  e     for the second half of my trip  I stayed five nights  Prepaid      through Orbitz  which included all taxes   I suspect you could do better if you poked around the Internet  but this was as good a rate as the El Cortez Web site offered  so I took it   I checked in around   p m   there was no wait  and they had my paid reservation  They put a     hold on a credit card for incidentals  which was never used My room was in the tower  seventh floor  It was clean and quiet  The fixtures are older  but everything worked  Two queen beds  fairly firm  There was enough soap  wash cloths  shampoo  and towels  The sheets and towels were good quality  not super plush or super high thread count  Good water flow from the shower head  the water was hotter at off peak hours  like early morning or early evening  than at mid morning  but it was never a real issue  The air conditioner was controlled by an older thermostat  The room got cold when I wanted it cold  I needed a wake up call one morning and got one  on time  from a live operator I didn t gamble in the casino except to use my    match play coupon in blackjack and for a little poker  The room is fairly smoky  if that bothers you  Clientele is older and of moderate means   quot Jackie quot  Gaughan  the hotel owner  was playing poker one morning I used the parking garage  There was a guard posted at the entrance or on the sidewalk nearby  Valet is available  The area around the El Cortez is being spruced up  There is a condo tower going up next door  and the section of Fremont Street leading to the main downtown casino district was landscaped and a Vegas sign added in a center island while I was there  The two blocks it takes to get from the El Cortez to the other Fremont Street casinos are not great  but the warnings I had heard were overblown I ate breakfast at Careful Kitty s  the El Co coffee shop  with the    voucher in their coupon book  French toast and coffee  nothing special  but fine  Service was good It s only about    minutes to the Strip if you take L V  Boulevard to Charleston to I    South For a single person with a car  or older people planning to gamble here  this is a good choice  The staff was friendly and competent  The rooms are older but clean  I would definitely stay here again  
P =>   It s not that great but it s bad as well  We booked from tripres for our first ever trip to vegas on  th e  We select first night to this hotel as we want to be in freemont street for a night so we can expore that part of the vegas  when we reached the hotel at arround      pm  hotel was overbooked in the room category we were in  So straight forward  they gave us upgraded room for the same price and added bonus free breakfast coupen for two       casino coupen without even asking from us  Good deal to start with Hotel is kind of older facility  you can tell by look  Rooms are bigger and nicer  Casino in hotel is very small  The whole area is under construction so we were disappointed on our first night ever in vegas  Morning breakfast is ok  Not a great one but it s fine compare to MCD or any other fastfood places  No fresh fruits  All canned fruits  Eggs and waffles are good  Good choices Hotel crowd is more like     so I would not suggest any younger crowd  Infect I would not stay again in that whole area  The way to go is strip hotel  I paid     a night and at arround same rate I stay s at Excalibur next night  So it s far better deal than Cortez for sure  Another funny thing is  owner of the hotel stays on top floor that we came to know as he was with us in the elevator next morning  That said  seems like it is totally family run hotel  Not like those bigger houses on the strip  Overall  it is ok  Not worth trying again  We paid     and got back     breakfast       casino credit     free drinks  that s free anyway when you play        planet holleywood food voucher from tripres com   So overall it is a worth deal like staying for a free  
P =>   Great atmosphere and a nice room  Was nice  I stayed from e    to e    at the Ogden House which is a   storey motel owned by the El Cortez  across the street behind the hotel  Ogden Ave    takes less than a minute to walk across the street to the motel from the lobby   the El Cortez  Room was comfortable  amp  clean  A C worked great  Not large   credenza style dresser  queen bed     quot  TV  chair and night table  Bathroom hadplenty of counter space  Shower was great  Soap  shampoo and hand cream  Housekeeping was awesome      per night  Friday night      Got a fun book when I checked in and another on Wednesday night because the person at the front desk who checked me in was cool  Funbook had a    coupon for slot play     off an entree and a free gift of an El Cortez keychain with my picture on it  There were a couple of other coupons but they weren t of value to me  Check out the El Cortez website for info on the Fun Book Toured the El Cortez office  lots of cool pictures and memorabilia including many gambling chips featuring Jackie Gaughan  All the staffat the hotel were great including the poker room boss and Tracy  one of the dealers  Saw Jackie Gaughan a few times playing poker and saidhi Kitty s Restaurant   the El Cortez did a good vegetarian omelet with spinach but their       graveyard special sausage and eggs was ho hum Enjoyed a free  with coupon  clubhouse with lots of fries inside the casino    quot gameside dining quot  they call it   sat and played at a penny slot machine and they took my order  brought to me on a tv cart with everything right there  Kinda neat although without the free coupon Idoubt I d do it again   maybe The Slot Club Card offered free coupons  gameside dining  extra pointdays  free slot tournament   lots of wrist exercise  and    in free slot play  No points for the poker tables  I left with     points I think and was told I could get a   for   buffet I would stay there again no problem  Right now they are offering two free nights in y or ust for anybody staying at the hotel from il to e  
P =>   El Cortez is good  We stayed in El Cortez for     to      We have had a reservation in hotelclub com and paid for it just    USD per three nights  The hotel is clean  the location is perfect and the staff is friendly  The hotel entrance is a beautiful casino  when we arrived at the Hotel we won a paper that needed to be changed for a discount book and   USD to play at the casino  We won a gift too  one key ring with our photo  so nice  The bed was confortable and the sheets and towels are clean and smell good  There s no refrigerator or microwave in the bedroom  but to eat in Vegas is very cheap  so it doesn t matter for us  
P =>   No Pool Great Room On the way up The place seems to be remodeled  Tower rooms are spacious  well designed and clean  Staff was courteous  There is a lot of construction around the hotel but it was a minor inconvenience  For the price we found we could take a cab to the Stratosphere pool which is way nice  Close walk to Fremont Street  We never felt unsafe outside at any time of day or night  The Casino was not as upscale and peppy as Main Street Station or the Golden Nugget but again  for the price and close walk its a great place to sleep  This is an up and coming place with the urban renewal occuring in the area  The south side has a great view of the strip skyline  Take advantage of the the low price  
P =>   good deal We booked through travelocity and only paid      each for   nights and roundtrip flights from Detroit  We were a little skeptical before the trip  but it turned out to be a really good deal  The hotel is not fancy but it is a good place to stay for cheap  We stayed in a tower room which costs about     more a night but it was definately worth it  The room was really big and there was a little sitting area with a couch and table  There was also a desk and the beds were comfortable  My only complaint about the room was that the water pressure was not good and the shower head is really low but it wasn t really a big deal The casino is not as nice as some of the others  and at times it smelled a little strange  but it was still fun and it was nice to have really low minimums on table games  We ate at Careful Kittys and it was decent but not really good  I think it s a better idea to walk down towards Fremont St  and eat at a restaurant over there  The walk is only about   minutes and we felt safe walking it at all times of the night  Overall  if you are looking for a cheap but clean place to stay with a casino that is near Fremont St  than El Cortez is a great idea  
P =>  Whatta Deal  What a pleasant surprise  Our first vacation in    years  and we came to town for a big convention  While our friends were spending      a night on the Strip  my wife booked us online   round trip flights from Denver and three nights   the ElCo for less than         each  Do the math We didn t do much except sleep  amp  shower here  but it was great place to base out of   th floor tower rooms had a great view south to the Strip    the lights were beautiful  The beds were VERY comfortable  shower was fine  free valet parking across the street was very nice  and got an extra tip at the end of the week  We walked to Fremont St Exp a couple of times and always felt completely safe  Only got quietly panhandled once  and that was in the daytime  My wife said she enjoyed Fremont more than the Strip  because the Strip was overwhelming    too much to see  Plenty of cheap souveniers downtown  too    Only real annoyance        dollar a day wireless Internet  and I always had problems getting online Condo construction across the street  currently remodeling the porte cochere entrance to the hotel  and Fremont St in front of the casino was being repaved rebuilt    you could occasionally hear the construction  but it was NEVER a problem for either of us We ve told lots of friends what a great deal we got    we d stay here again in a heartbeat    thank  ElCo  for a great stay  
P =>  Good Budget Option My boyfriend and I stayed at the El Cortez for two nights during our visit to Las Vegas  We decided to pay as little as possible for a hotel so we can spend the money on good seats at a Cirque du Soleil show and a tour to the Grand Canyon instead  We paid about     a night and got the Vintage room  which is ALL SMOKING and in the old part of the hotel  Reading other people s reviews  I feel like we overpaid for a worse room  since others who stayed at the newer tower room paid about the same and had a better experience   But the price discrepancies might be due to seasonal differences  with the beginning of summer   Our stay was il              and the hotel was completely booked  The hotel is in downtown  away from the Strip  but we didn t mind because we rented a car  The hallways leading to the rooms were dark and smoky  but the room  thankfully  was not  although throughout the night I felt the cigarette smoke creeping in the room  but what do you expect in Vegas    It had nice oak furniture and had a bigger TV than I expected  with basic cable  The bathroom was old  but seemed to be maintained well  Clean sheets and towels saved the day  I didn t find any hair or mysterious stains as I have before in much more expensive hotel rooms  No hair dryer but we brought our own  We walked to the Fremont Street Experience  a block away  at Midnight on a Sunday and I didn t feel unsafe at all  with security guards standing around  Fremont Street Experience was totally awesome  loved the video audio show  There is a Walgreen and an ABC store right there underneath the Fremont Street Experience dome  selling all kinds of things you might need on a trip  like water  band aids  etc  All the old school casinos are right there  too  Frankly  I enjoyed this part of Vegas so much more than the Strip  It was so much more easygoing  The Strip was so crowded and awful  I wasn t having fun at all there  And parents  you might want to reconsider letting your kids see the free  quot Sirens of the TI quot  show in front of Treasure Island  I caught the       show on a Saturday  bunch of parents brought their little kids  and I thought it was inappropriate for them considering it contained mostly adult  sexual  humor and girls dancing in thongs and bikini tops Also  the hotel gives you a coupon book with a voucher for a free drink     slot play credit     off at their restaurants  etc  I thought that was nice  As for the front desk personnel  some were nice  some were not  if you care about that sort of thing  All in all  El Cortez is a good budget option  
P =>  My favorite Vegas getaway Myself and   close friends visit El Cortez at least twice a year  We started staying at ElCo   years ago at our travel agents recommendation  Now I wont stay anywhere else  The tower rooms are by far the nicest  Vintage and Pavillian rooms are fine but not as easy to get to  Stay away from the Odgen House across the street  If there is something you need in your room not provided they are always happy to bring it to you   Refrigerator Coffee pot  etc   Sometimes the front desk staff is flaky so print your confirmation info and bring it with you   The gambling is top notch and they treat loyal customers like royalty  After you have played a couple days go to the slot club and request a host  Your host will do just about anything you ask within reason   Meals rooms tickets  etc After the first visit we don t have to pay for our rooms anymore and I believe the only way to get a jacuzzi suite is to have it comped  Make sure to use your Jackie s club card to get comps The slots are loose Video poker even looser  Plenty of low denom table games  reasonable priced food  Mostly comped  and the best keno in Vegas  The dealers are usually new as others have said but they are always friendly and able to speak english well  Just keep an eye on them for mistakes  Most mistakes I have seen were in the players favor anyway As others have said don t let the neighborhood scare you  I have never had a problem  and the area is really starting to  quot nice up quot  Jackie really knows how to treat people and won t be around forever so please enjoy this landmark while you can  Jackie can usually be found in the poker room early in the morning usually wearing a trademark green tie and giving some good looking woman a hard time Please try to visit before rising property values in the area cause the El Cortez to become another victim of implosion  The El Cortez IS Vegas in my opinion  Good Luck and tell Jackie Justin says hi  
P =>  El Cortez  Great Value Stayed two nights at El Cortez  It is currently under major construction renovation as are the streets around it  so be aware of that  Keep in mind  THIS IS AN OLD HOTEL  ONE OF THE OLDEST HOTEL CASINOS STILL STANDING IN LAS VEGAS  meaning don t expect a  quot strip quot  style hotel because that s not what they re selling here We rented a car and parked in the FREE parking garage attached to the hotel  The first impression we had was of the dingy old elevator which led into a dingier part of the casino  At first  I was kind of nervous  But as we traveled through the casino to the hotel desk  I noticed that they are remodeling the casino one section at a time  so I think it will be all updated within a few months  Check in was great  We got automatically  quot upgraded quot  from a pavillion room  motel style w  exterior doors  to a room at the top of the tower overlooking the strip  Great view  The elevator up to the tower room was much nicer than the elevator from the parking garage  ble  brass  etc We had a smoking room and my husband does smoke  so I can t comment on whether the room smelled smoky or not because Mr  Chimney was smoking half the time  so yes  ours did smell like smoke     The room was a mix of old and new furnishings  The carpet  bedspreads  and wall hangings all seemed very new  The blankets under the bedspreads were very old and not very plush anymore  The wood furniture is solid wood but was also very old  The bathroom was very old  Peach bathtub  peach tile  etc  However  it was clean  I liked the little window in the tub  It opened and let the nice warm desert air in but no one can see in because of the placement of the window  There was TONS of water pressure in the shower  That was great The rooms are big and even had a couch and coffee table There was no iron ironing board or hair dryer in the room  You can call the front desk and they will send them up to you  but if you want them  call way before you need them because I called for a hairdryer and it didn t come and I got bored of waiting and just left to go out w  wet hair We ate at the Careful Kitty Cafe and it was good and a good price  The location of the hotel is great  Only one block from the Fremont Street Experience and Walgreens and the Neonopolis shopping mall  etc  It was nice that its not actually ON the Fremont Street strip because I m sure that can get noisy at night All things considered  we had a really fun trip  I highly recommend renting a car  we got one for     day  and also highly recommend that if you rent a car  you bring your GPS or rent one from the car rental place because GPS is a godsend  We went all over the place with ease  I would stay at the El Cortez again in a heartbeat  
P =>  Nice rooms  We stayed in the old wing of the hotel  Good value for downtown Las Vegas  Clean room  nice decor and god service from the staff  
P =>  great stay Great stay  clean  huge rooms  Good area  cheap price  Nothing better than that if you have a car  it s   miles off the strip   It s got its shopping area    
P =>  Truly classic old school Las Vegas charm I stayed at the El Cortez in late ch of       I got a non smoking Tower room          At about        a night it was comparable to any standard hotel room in Downtown Las Vegas including the Golden Nuggetand I would stay at the El Cortez again  My room had a fresh  tropical decor and had a good view of the Strip and even had a small balcony  My requested king room was not available  so rather than wait  I got   queen beds  not a problem for me  The beds were comfortable and appeared nearly new  at least the one I used but the other was good for organizing my stuff  In general  the carpet  furniture  TV and fixtures in the room appeared nearly new and showed little wear  Furniture included   queen beds  a dresser with new TV  a small foldout desk  a love seat near the window with a coffee table  see the photos  Lighting was good but could have used more light over the desk  Looks like there is a data hookup near the desk  The remote for the TV died on the last day and I checked the batteries and found them original to the TV  e g  same brand  so I knew that it was a newer TV  Sink  mirror and closet space were in an alcove separated by a door from the shower and toilet  Shower had a small window that opened onto the balcony Water pressure was good but you stepped up in to the tub and the shower head came to about   feet   inches above the floor of the tub and anyone much over   feet would have trouble using it  The usual small bottles of useful stuff in the bathroom  Ample towels were softer than at the Golden Nugget  Heat and AC worked fine but thermostat seemed older and was hard to read  No fridge but one was sent up with no problem nor extra cost  No iron or ironing board  one could have been sent up but that was not an issue for me  No coffee pot nor in room safe but again not a problem  there is a coffee place near the elevators and a free safe deposit box behind the front desk In general  the hotel is in good shape and is in the middle of a major renovation matching that of the neighborhood around it  No bugs  mystery stains nor other major issues  I ran into the owner in an elevator  he lives on the   th floor  Nice older gent with his trademark green tie  I complimented him on the hotel and he wished me luck  Casino had a lot more table games and fewer slot machines etc  than I recall from years past  I was told they are opening it upto avoid the crowded look you can still find at the venerable GoldSpike  Weather was warm  in the    s and I missed a pool nor can guests use the pool at the Plaza anymore since they changed owners  I watched a crane lift large air handling units onto the roof of the casino  once they were operational  I noticed a real change in the air quality inside the casino  Ate a buffet  it was ok but was not great  The Subway sandwich shop was about standard for a Subway  Fun Book was OK but not great  Enjoyed all   bars  do ask for the tall glass of Sam Adams at the bar near the check in desk  There is also a fancy round bar with a piano player and a more normal bar near the Fremont Street entrance  Casino hotel security was tight  including officers watching the sidewalk outside the property  Security cameras in the hotel hallways Stashed my bag in my friend s vintage room until mine was ready  it was about as big as a small bedroom in an older house maybe    feet square at the most with a painted over window  Definitely go for the tower room if you can as it only costs a few dollars more but is wellworth it  In general  the area continues to improve from years past and is muchsafer than its reputation from the bad old days  Walking the streets at all hours  I was not bothered much at all  just a few panhandlers and other miscreants but no one threatening  This in now called The Entertainment District  extending east to  th  or the parking lot of the Western Much money is going into civic improvements and there is talk of extending the Canopy down to the Western Trendy new nightspots like the Griffin and the Beauty Bar have opened nearby  Also old standards like the Atomic Liquors  Bunkhouse Saloon and the funky old Western Casino Hotel  A new luxury condo  I ask you  is there any other kind these days   called Streamline Toweris going up just to the north of the El Cortez which will help to clean up the area further Much road work going on and soon the sort of historic neon signs seen under the FSE will advance eastward  Both lead to some disturbing construction noise at all hours when the window and balcony door were open  but this is part of urban life and should be over soon BOTTOM LINE   Although probably not for the Vegas virgin seeking the glitz of the tourist traps on the Strip  with its combination of truly classic old school Las Vegas charm and the new renovations both inside the property and the general upgrading of the surroundingarea  this is a good place to stay and I sure would stay here again  
P =>  Loved it Ok  let me tell you  This may be my most favorite hotel for under         We stayed on a Saturday night when most hotels are charging way over          I booked the room because we were only going to stay for   night and it was right downtown where I wanted to be  I was so surprised at just how nice the room was  I booked a deluxe room in the tower and Wow was it nice  It had a huge bed  really nice furniture  a seperate sitting area  and a huge balcony overlooking downtown vegas  the strip and the mountains  I wish we had more time to spend there  We did have the breakfast buffet in the morning and it was great  The casino is old  but the dealers and all the staff we ran into were very very nice  Dont worry about the area  All you have to do is walk across the street and you are on fremont street its that close  I love this hotel and would recommend to anyone  
P => Good Deal This hotel is above average for the price  We booked a regular room and were given a nice tower room instead  The facility was clean and quiet  The gambling is fun and cheap  Breakfast at Kitty s Cafe is tasty and a good deal  Don t stay here if you want all the bells and whistles but if you want a good value and like the old Vegas  this is definitely a winner  
P =>   Loved it but      We booked a non smoker and got a smoker BUT the room wasn t smoke smelly  was clean  big  had a view of the strip  was well cleaned every day and if you think of the tiny bath as a big shower then this room was excellent  especially for the price  Whatever you specify when you book will go out the window when you arrive  including whether or not you want single or double beds  but I believe the above benefits outweigh the risk  Also  this is a bit of historic Downtown which those at the Bellagio etc will never see  Personally  I didn t think much of the Fremont Experience but the gambling facilities at Binions  the Fitz and the Golden Nuggett are second to none  One last IMPORTANT bit of advice     the front desk personnel leave so often that they know nothing so ask the guys and girls who work there  For instance  wanted to rent a car for a day  Front desk said  try the airport     asked someone who had worked there for a few years who said the Fitz round the corner had Enterprise Car Hire  and I got nice wheels from there  Also the front desk made a complete mess of     toooooo boring to relate but needless to say have as little to do with the front desk as possible   just ask those who have worked there for a while For the price this is one of the best bargains in town  Only gamble at El Cortez if you like smoke  and the poker  room  is to be avoided  although the guy who runs it is a real character  really old school  looks and sounds like he knew Bugsy Siegal   If they paid good money to get good people on the front desk then it would be the best  
P =>  Excellent stay at the El Cortez Plaza vs El Cortez  After seeing the reviews and the recommendations       we chose the El           pm check in time  but earlier check in was no problem We had a great room  tower  with double queen beds on the   th floor  Rm       facing the strip  With our       coupon found in the American Casino Guide  a must to buy  but check the book when you receive it in case there are missing coupon pages if you buy thru Amazon or E bay  and our meager slot play return  we payed         for   nights for a fantastic stay  Soda and ice machines on each floor  Don t put their Vegas tap water in a water bottle to save   from buying high cost water on Fremont St or the strip  Tap water tastes horrid but suitable to brush your teeth with  Front desk clerks were sooo nice and very helpfull  They had lost our information on our stay  so thankfully I had brought a copy of our confirmation that was done thru their web site  I recommend that everyone print it out and bring it We asked for a fridge  which was rolled in on a nice size cart that we were able to set up our own one cup coffee maker on top of  My husband loved that   Also the love seat with coffee table which he loved relaxing on after a long day of walking  The t v was a bigger than what we saw in the other reviewers pictures and worked great with lots of channels  Again  nice to relax to for the short time spent in the room  Plenty of super hot water  great water pressure  even during peak usage times  and tub drained quickly  No water backed up The bathroom and large window in the room opened up    inches  for ventilation  The beds were soooo comfy  amp  very clean  The curtains darkened the room so we never knew what time it was in the a m  Housekeeping never bothered us in the morning when we had the  quot do not disturb quot  sign on the door  Great  We were there   nights  including weekend  and thought we had the whole floor to ourselves because we only ran across two people in the hall on our last night  Very quiet rooms The rooms  rugs  furniture  walls etc  were spotless and believe me  I checked under the mattress for the creepy crawley things that were found  with pictures to prove it from other reviewers  in nice places like the Bellagio  mice  and the Luxor  bed bugs   Nothing to report    yea   In case you forget them  they provide shampoo  conditioner  mouthwash  amp  hand soap  I tipped Housekeeping a couple of dollars each day  which I left on the bed with a note so they would know it was for them  and left them more on our last day  Please show them your appreciation  I also left them some       coupons that I had leftover from other downtown buffets which I m sure they could use because they weren t just for players with cards  We won t be back for another year so no use to us Feeling safe in the casino and area  Yes    for sure  They had security walking around and I played slots by myself until  am while my husband retired back to the room to sleep  They also had security on the corner of Fremont  amp   th Ave to watch the walkers coming back from the FSE  This is also the corner that we had to wait for our Grayline shuttle back to the airport  so we felt very safe  He actually seemed to know the regulars that were coming and going and everyone was very respectfull  We did Grayline      pp  round trip because we didn t know at the time of our flight booking that the El also provides shuttles  If you use the El s shuttle  please make your rez with them as they request  They re not mind readers and need to know ahead of time of your needs to get you there in plenty of time to get thru the airports security There s a  quot lot quot  of constuction going on in that area because the El is fixing up their front door entrance  The road is being torn up  I m assuming because of the new Streamline condo s needs for bigger water sewer lines  This shouldn t stop you for going to the El as the strip is also always seeing a lot of construction and it s just a fact of life in Vegas The gift shop is open    hrs with munchies to buy to enjoy before bed  After doing that at  am every morning  the security at the elevator got to know that I was done for the night and wished me a pleasant beddy bye and never said  quot don t let the bed bugs bite quot LOL  Sorry to say I can t comment on the food other than the breakfast buffet  You ll have to find those reviews with the others  The breakfast buffet is o k  How can they mess up scrambled eggs  sausage  cinnamon rolls and coffee anyway  Our needs are just basic for the a m          quot don t stop the coffee refills    quot Plenty of different denominations on the slot machines with a lot of the old favorites and new ones  Yes     even the penny  quot Cashman quot   They were by far  looser and more available  less people  than the strip but not as loose as the  quot Fremont Casino quot   One bonus round on a Fremont Cashman gave me       Sorry  my secret as to which one  LOL   More hits on other machines but I won t go into them as this is a review about the El Sorry again that I can t comment on the card tables  but other reviewers have written about them  Low bets etc The Duece     for a    hr pass and also good on all CAT buses if going to casinos off the strip   Rio etc  is a short one block walk from the El and FSE is a quick   block walk  If you ride the Duece and going to the Strip  enjoy the ride from the upper level  If you re     quot  or taller  duck your head up there because that s how low the ceiling is  We enjoyd the sick humor of watching people  especially the men  smack their heads when they reached the top of the stairs before they realized the ceiling height     even though there s a sign stating it  Very funny  LOLI hope I covered everything that you might need to know about the El  I tried to talk about the things  quot I quot  might want to ask if I was going to try a new place and hopefully covered it all Go to the El  enjoy its comfort  amp  super clean rooms  feel secure and save your   for all of the other crazy things to see and do while in Vegas Rocky s Hun 
P =>  Roberta s has wonderful prime rib This was my third stay at the El Cortez and it just gets better each time  The entire staff has always been wonderful to me and my friends during our stay  Roberta s has some of the best meals in Town  Very fair prices and fantastic service as well  Good gaming and very nice rooms  I look forward to my next vacation and another stop at the El Cortez  
P =>    Hidden  Treasure If you re looking for fountains and volcanos  this isn t your hotel  Go to the Strip and spend      If you re looking for a nice  clean  large  except the bathroom  room at a great price and don t need your hand held  look no further  The ElCo Tower rooms are for you This place is a classic  Very  quot old school quot  with great personality  Not that it s worn and run down  it s not  In fact the property is very clean and well maintained  with great service from employees who care  One thing that impressed me when talking to the employees is many have been there for    or more years   except the dealers Ahhh the dealers  Craps is geat with low minimums  but the    dealers were recent grads of Joe Blow s Dealers Academy looking to refine their  quot skills quot  and move up to the Wynn   Good Luck In short  If you are looking to stay Downtown with easy access to the Duece bus and the rest of Fremont  without the noise  for a great price   we paid     per night  then do yourself a favor and give the ElCo a try  You won t be disappointed  
P =>  Best   star Hotel in town This is the Best   star Hotel in las Vegas  I have stayed at most and this is above the rest  Cheap rooms  good eats  and easy comps  Large rooms with lots of nice cherrywood furniture   not the average motel fiberboard junk  big comfortable beds  Employees glad to help without an attitude  Yes it is in a low class part of town    block from the Fremont Street Expierence  but at night there is a security guard on the corner  I could not have found a better place to stay  Had a king room on the   th floor  with view of the strip  Cost me        Look forward to going to Vegas and staying were again     
P =>   The best Hotel in Vegas Hi My fiance and i stayed at the Cortez and loved it  I stayed there in the past and told her that its the place to stay  We got a room in the tower and was amazed by how big it was  The bed was soo comfy that I didnt want to get up in the morning  We got married and had our honeymoon there  We visited other Casino Hotels on the strip and liked the bones  elevators  bathrooms  people  valet etc  more that the pricy ones  The valet did an awesome job of taking care of my car  The one big thing about the Cortez is that you can leave all of the hustle and noise of the strip and have a peaceful romantic stay in Vegas  A great place to eat is Kittys cafe  the food is great and priced right  My wife loved everything about the Cortez  The part I loved the most was the thought that I was staying in a place where some of the stars in the   s probably stayed  The Cortez is awesome  
P =>   Glimpse of the past  The El Cortez gave me a glimpse of glamour and charm that Las Vegas must have had in its early days  My room at the El Cortez was beautiful  with antique leather topped mahogany furnishings  a great sitting area with a very confortable sofa and arm chair  The room was surprisingly large  very clean and well maintained  All of the staff were courteous  helpful  and very friendly  The food in the hotels restaurants was so good and reasonably priced  that I ate all of my meals there  I met many locals who are regular customers in the hotel restaurants  which speaks very favorably for the food and the prices  The El Cortez is   short blocks to the Fremont Street Experience  which I walked by myself many times during my   day stay without any problems  The bus stop was one block away so I bought the    hour Deuce pass each day and traveled up and down the strip many  many times  I will recommend the El Cortez to everyone I know  
P =>   Fantastic stay at the EL CO This is a fantastic place to stay  Some of the reviews I read scared the daylights out of me  My room was very clean  There were only small issues    No in room safe   Thermostat hard to read   Bathroom is small  but seriously  how much time does one spend in the bathroom anyway     No weather channelWhat they give you  shampoo  lotion and mouthwash  Also  the bars of soap are big compared to most hotels  I had read and asked about wireless internet and was told it was only available in the lobby  Funny  I had full scale signal in my room  cheetanetworks  and there was a button on the webpage for    free minutes If you want a great room for a great price  stay here  No water pressure problems and plenty of hot water  
P =>  Hidden Treasure on the  Old Strip   What a diamond in the rough   But make sure you stay in the  Tower  rooms  Very good deals and an ok casino where you can really win  We always have a wonderful time coming to the El Cortez  the only negative is the front desk  not very friendly or knowlegeable  If this was changed and they became more hospitiable they would rule the strip  
P =>   Better than expected I stayed Friday and Saturday in a Pavillion room  From the previous reviews  I had expected a seedy dive  Well  that was NOT the case  The rooms in the Pavillion are like motel rooms with outside entrances  I was on the  th floor  The rooms were clean  the towels were big and soft  and the beds were comfy  The TV was unimportant because who goes to Vegas to watch TV  The hotel is within walking distance of Fremont street where I spent most of my time  Played slots and actually left with more money than I arrived with  Also  had a wonderful dinner at Roberta s  It s a bit pricey  but worth it  When I departed  the bell man helped me load my luggage and the front desk arranged an airport shuttle  Overall  I LOVED the El Cortez and will stay there again my next trip  
P =>  El Cheapo For     bucks a night  you pretty much get what you pay for  This my experience at El Cortez  I had reserved a non smoking room  and they gave me the opposite  I had put the DO NOT DISTURB sign outside my door  and three hours into my stay  a maintenance man knocks on my door telling me that he had to fix the bathtub because it was not draining properly and the faucet was leaking  I got hungry  and thought I d try their Chinese Buffet downstairs    it was the worst chinese food I ve ever had  Worst than those fast food chinese places in your neighborhood  The location itself is pretty ghetto and slummy  And the hotel was kinda dirty  But like I said  you kinda expect these things when you re paying bargain basement price  
P => Ok for the price Booked a two night stay on the El Cortez website at        a night prepaid with taxes it was about        total  The room was on the top floor of the parking garage  there were about    rooms on this floor  Absolutely nothing wrong with where the room was  It was quiet  comfortable and clean  Check in was at     pm and since I was early  I did have to wait  Front desk staff was pleasant and check in easy  This is a old hotel  and the lobby and gaming area look it  Again  its ok for the price  in fact there was a promtion going on at the time  any guest staying in y or ust was offered two free nights in t  I was not able to take advantage of this  The only low point was going to the bufett breakfast in the morning         and it was like I would imagine going to a Salvation Army mission  or a bread line for the homeless  It was very poor  at least in my opinion  but again the bottom line  you get what you pay for  I would certainly stay here again  it is downtown  on Fremont St  and two blocks from the Fremont Experience mall  
P =>   Tower rooms are fantastic   Stayed at the El Cortez for two nights at the end of e and was so pleasantly amazed at the room   Had doubts  had read some bad things about some of the rooms and read that the Tower rooms were all recently renovated and very nice  so I gave it a chance  I was on the top floor    th  and had a king non smoking  which was what I requested  The room has wonderful  dark woods  a little sitting area  and the bathroom had a little window in it  similar to some rooms at the Orleans  and I loved it   Very comfortable bed  very quiet and would definitely stay there again Now  the area is not the best and the outside of the hotel is not glamorous  The parking garage isn t top notch  but use valet parking and the problem is solved  Robertas steakhouse is a great restaurant there the prime rib was huge and done perfectly  Can t beat the price and I even had luck on the slots in the casino  
P =>  our stay El Cortez  we found this a great place to stay  rooms large and cool facilities great The service was great and the staff  st class and very helpful  we booked through  quot Boots and All quot  booking agent on the internet  no problems on booking in we were on the   th floor  I would reccomend this hotel to anyone Thanks for the great stay Trevor  amp  Val Service Hamilton New Zealand 
P =>  What a Difference We just returned from   nites in Vegas  I usually stay at the Plaza downtown  however they were all booked on the week end so had to find accomodations elsewhere  managed to get the Fitz for   nites and the only alternative for the week end was the El Cortez  I had only been in the El Cortez once about   years ago  and that was enough I got out of there fast being a single women on my own i thought it was slummy so  I was amazed at the change and our room was on the second floor over the casino  it had new funiture broadloom and completely redone  actually better than the Plaza  I would return in a wink now  
P =>  El Cortez is improving    still has old style charm I spent a four day trip in Las Vegas and didn t stay in the El Cortez  so I can t comment on the rooms  but I visited the casino all four days  The El Cortez has improved alot in the past year     they have redone the ceilings  lighting fixtures and replaced the blackjack tables  The place is overall alot nicer    there is a bar lounge in the back of the casino that I think is new that is really nice with a surprisingly good selection of beers on tap The Tez still has single deck blackjack  but any bet over     will draw a  quot checks play quot  signal from one of the dealers to let a pitboss know that there is serious player at the table  Prepare to be scrutinized by pit bosses at single deck tables The real hidden gem of the El Cortez is  quot Roberta s quot  restaurant       I had the double lobster tail for     and it was worth it  the lobster tails were both very big and well prepared  A buddy of mine had the prime rib and liked it alot    I think it was only      My meal came with fresh bread  an outstanding and very large bowl of corn chowder soup  rice pilaf  and steamed spinach  Only the rice pilaf was mediocre    and actually it wasn t that bad  I had planned on ordering the rack of lamb which was listed on the website as        it seemed to good to be true     instead  when I got there they had lamb chops for        so I opted for the lobster  The service in  quot Roberta s quot  was great and the ambience was relaxing     not spectacular  but very nice  I like the place alot and think it s very underrated and a great value Summary   the El Cortez is a fun stop when downtown to see  quot Old School quot  Vegas    the place really isn t that crummy anymore and you have nothing to fear about the walk from the  quot Fremont Experience quot  overhang two blocks down to the El Cortez  Don t bother going to the Gold Spike or the Western  too trashy   but the El Cortez is worth a look  
P => my vegas trip went to vegas for the third time this april and once again had a blast  I just never get bored with that town  We stayed at the El Cortez for a few nights and was extremely impressed  the staff couldn t have been nicer and we weren t quite sure what to expect with the hotel itself  but I would go back there in a heartbeat  the rooms were very nice  and we even saw about   different ones  they were wonderful  I would definitly recommend this hotel to anyone  We also had a wedding at the stained glass chapel and found the staff there very nice  The wedding package wasn t quite what we had expected but it all worked out ok  I would definitly ask more specific questions next time about how their services work but all in all they were ok  but I would never go through the las vegas wedding authority again  They were misleading from the start  I have been calling since my return for a rebate that was promised for the package and they won quot t even answer my phone calls they got back within minutes to me when I was setting everything up and they wanted my money  but now they are totally ignoring me  so don t deal with the las vegas wedding authority  all in all had a wonderful time and plan to go back for our aniversary this fall  
P => Surreal Experience We were going to a wedding on         in Vegas so we flew in a day early  Due to Atlanta Airport s security scare  software glitch  we arrived in Vegas hours late  I confirmed with our internet reservation site  found through TripAdvisor  that our room would still be available  Our rental car had left hours earlier without us  so we hoofed it on the public bus for       each  It dropped us off   block from the El Cortez  Before reserving the room  I read all of the reviews and many reviews of similarly priced hotels  I  quot bet quot  on the El Cortez due to the location and the price  Pros  Price      incl  tax per night Location    block from Freemont Experience  Public City Bus or Strip Bus Amenities  Gambling  Small C Store  Restaurant  Barber shop on site Ambiance  Classic Vegas as I remember it from years ago Free Parking  We didn t use it but I saw that it was there Room Toiletries  Nice assortment of soaps and girly stuff for the Misses HVAC  No window unit  but a functioning thermostat unit not constantly blowing Cons No elevator to our specific room  Older section  we were on the  nd floor View from room  Rooftop of casino view with privacy screened window Small Room  Not a problem for us as we cruise a lot Due to the time difference and wedding events we were back and forth to the hotel every few hours  I felt safe at all hours If you are a confident person in you own neighborhood you will be fine here  If you are a Nervous Mervis you will feel  quot funny quot   Not necessarily because it is unsafe  but because you are just a more anxious person and out of your normal  quot safety quot  zone  I never felt unsafe and was grateful that such a reasonably priced hotel was downtown  There was police action all over Vegas  I look at it as the police are staying on top of crime or possible crime by being proactive  Any large city will have similar situations I would definitely stay here again without hesitation  It is best for budget minded people  I m to understand the more expensive rooms are much larger and have nicer views  Perhaps on our next trip I will upgrade  If you have Strip related business  you must allow for travel time  You can bypass the traffic crowds on the Strip Bus and take the Public City Bus that almost runs a loop around the strip  If you are driving  yland Ave  runs parallel about   blocks to the East of the Strip Vegas is a fun place to visit for an interesting vacation Due to the   hour time change  the travel delay  jet lag  the bright lights  noises  smells of the city  adult oriented themes  wedding chapels on almost every corner and general humanity it was a Surreal Experience  One that I hope to experience again soon    
P => Great budget hotel casino I absolutely loved my stay at the infamous El Cortez and would definitely stay here again  Arrived at the hotel at about eight thirty and check in took about       min s  Went up to room         and was pleasantly surprised with the cleanliness and size of the room  although the bathroom was pretty small  The hotel s casino has good  cheap black jack and       roulette which was a lot of fun and is only about two blocks from the Freemont st  experience  A lot of people have complained about the neighborhood and frankly I just don t get it  I never once felt unsafe when venturing out of the hotel to walk downtown or to the bus stop which was only about a block and a half away  At only     a night this place is a steal and highly recommended  
P =>  great value    y o who traveled to vegas for only one night and needed a cheap place to stay  Didn t check out the casino  but my room was very adequate for the night  I payed    extra to stay in the tower and I could see that the rooms and hallways had been recently renovated  The room was very clean and water was hot  thats all I was looking for  TV didn t even have espn  but I ll let them slide since nobody spends to much time watching the tube  Overall  I would say if you want a clean  quite room with no frills  this is the place for you  Me  Oh ya  I would stay again  I am already planning on booking another room pretty soon  
P =>  The Good and The Bad   With Photos THE FACTS  Stayed weekday Tower  corner room  rooms in the corner with numbers ending in    or    are slightly larger   THE GOOD     Cheap place to stay          Biggest standard room I ve stayed in  Corner rooms only     Clean for an older room     Parking lot well lit     Air conditioning worked great THE BAD     The area surrounding is suspect  Not recommended for kids elderly     Heard alot of  quot security to    quot  in casino from workers with walkie talkies     Parking is free for everyone  so can be hard to find at night  Upper levels were closed that night for some reason     Bathrooms are small  but typical of older hotels     Hot water more like luke warm in the late morning  Other times fine CONCLUSION  My wife and I would stay here again if looking for a cheap place at the last minute  We thought the rooms were very spacious and generally clean  although we can t attest to the carpet since we travel with slippers  We stayed at the Las Vegas Club on Fremont the night before and The California the night after and El Cortez was much better than Vegas Club  but not as nice as California  both reviewed   We didn t try the restaurants at the El  Check out the photos  but excuse the mess  
P =>  Cheap and Cheerful El Cortez Booked the El Cortez as it was really cheap  Stayed at the beginning of il     When we got there Reception were very slow  however worth the wait as they upgraded us to a Tower Room  which is in the new wing of the hotel  The room was very nice  with fruit  mints and chocolates in and very clean  It was a minutes walk from Fremont Street  We played roulette which had    minimum bets  fantastic  especially when you get free drinks playing on the tables  Dont be put off by anyone saying its a bit rough  if you have ever been to London its a million times safer  I Recommend this hotel if you are on a budget  
P => great I stayed at four different hotels in Vegas  El Cortez surprisingly had the biggest and nicest rooms  There was no pool and the hotel was not on the strip but a   minute walk to the Freemont St  Experience Five minute walk to the city bus depot that will take you anywhere on a bus for     The service was good  I would definitely recommend this hotel for the low price we paid  Very satisfied  
P => Fun stay at the El Cortez My husband and I stayed at the El Cortez ruary    ch    and were very happy with our stay  We stayed in a queen vintage room above the casino  it s probably worth the extra   bucks to upgrade to a tower king  we checked out the tower  and it is a lot nicer   but we liked our room   it was cute and cozy   vintage  is an accurate description  The shower bath was clean and had good water pressure  the room itself and most importantly the bed linens were very clean  I did notice some dust on the moldings however  Our room was quiet  we could not hear the casino noise from our room  only once were we woken up by noise  someone slamming a door to the room across the hall  There was a new flat screen TV with a decent amount of cable channels  There is no elevator to the queen rooms above the casino floor  For     a night      on the weekend  we felt we got a great deal The front desk people were brisk  but not unfriendly  the rest of the staff were nice  Housekeeping was excellent  new bedding  towels  glasses  soaps  etc  every day  Parking was easy  The casino was OK  authentic    s d cor and all  It was laid back  and a good place to hang out  gamble  amp  relax after a long day of running around sightseeing  We didn t try Roberta s or Kitty s  the breakfast buffet was a typical breakfast buffet  nothing great  but not too bad either It s a short walk to the Fremont Street Experience  We felt safe the whole time and nobody approached us except for the time share shills inside the downtown casinos and the porn slappers on the strip  very annoying  During our stay we went to Red Rock Canyon and Valley of Fire parks  both were great daytrips I think most of the previous reviews are right on  it depends on what type of traveler you are  For us the El Cortez was perfect  a clean  comfortable  convenient and cheap place to hang out and stay  but it is not glamorous or glitzy  
P =>  Loved it but know what to expect  As the previous reviews note if you want a classy  flashy  special occasion sort of hotel then the El Cortez is not it   you will need to go onto the Strip or check into the Golden Nugget  However for the prices  generally from about     weekdays      weekends  this is a decent  old style casino hotel  The main level seems to be divided into two areas where you can almost tell the old part  front casino  Careful Kittys restaurant  and the new part  check in  Robertas Steakhouse  Gift shop  etc    the new areas are very tasteful and hold their own with some of the other downtown properties  The casino itself is a little smokey  not too bad though  and locals seem to outweigh the tourists in the place  The gaming is cheap      minimums on a lot of tables and plenty of up to date penny games  Staff are a little curt but I m guessing that being a Brit they seemed to have a little trouble understanding me sometimes  I doubt there are many Europeans that stay downtown compared to the Strip    I had issues with the maid leaving the door open in our room  it did not shut correctly and had to be slammed  and an issue with my leaving date  they got it wrong    apologies were not forthcoming but they did fix it and that was good enough for me There is a free express airport shuttle from early morning to early afternoon  I m not sure it picks you up   just seems to drop you off  and the cocktail waitresses look after more than other properties Poker players might like to know that there is a poker room and it seems the only place downtown which offers a stud game  I will mention the area it is in  If you are used to street people then thats ok   but it is two blocks away from the Freemont Street Experience  and the rest of downtown casinos  and one block from the Strip shuttle buses  In two stays I have never had any trouble other than the occasional request for some coins but some of the people may alarm you  I certainly would not advise you to walk in the other directions alone  
P =>  The best kept secret of the locals    The El Cortez Hotel is far  far nicer than some folks will admit  The rooms have been recently remodeled and totally refurbished to rival any on the  quot Strip quot   In fact  their rooms are the finest in the downtown area  I ve stayed in the tower rooms  and they re comparable to the best anywhere  offering nice views and comfortable  rich furnishings  The housekeeping service was prompt and the staff assured my room was impeccably clean  I asked for an iron and ironing board  and it was delivered within minutes I found the best food in the area at the El Cortez too  especially the breakfast buffet on the weekend  There s a Subway and other Fast Food Coffee venues as well  I particularly liked the  specials  at Careful Kitty s Cafe for lunch and supper  I had a Prime Rib dinner with all the trimmings for less than     and it was delicious  Roberta s is the up scale restaurant at the El Cortez  and I treated myself once to their Lamb one night  Spectacular  Primo  and what can I say    It was the best dining experience in downtown Las Vegas for the price  The only thing could possibly complain about is the neighboring area just east of the El Cortez  If you re driving  please use the valet parking  or the self parking  I ve never had any problem in the    years I ve walked around there  but if you walk from the Fremont Street Experience area  use your  quot street savvy quot   Well  that goes for all of Las Vegas    Check the room rates at the El Cortez and then plan your vacation  You ll be very pleased with your room and the amenities  
P =>  Fantastic Suite The biggest thing I see going against the El Cortez is the location  We booked a jacuzzi suite in advance for      per night and the room was fabulous  It didn t have much of a view since the room overlooked the valet parking lot  We thought that was great as we could keep an eye on our vehicle  The room was spotless  new and I enjoyed the stay  especially the jacuzzi tub   We ate at the steakhouse and the food was neither to brag about nor gag about  It was excellent for the price and the service was good also  As for the casino  we aren t really gamblers but did piddle about a little  It was comfortable  quiet and paid back enough to at least let you sit and play a bit  My only gripe is that I missed the Freemont Street Experience because we were afraid to go out the front doors after dark  The locals in the area are not someone you want to have a conversation with  We stayed in the hotel and felt totally safe  amp  comfortable  but nothing short of a bomb threat or earthquake could have gotten us to go out those front doors  Sirens went all night long  but I expect everyone in that area heard them  not just those of us in the El Cortez so I didn t hold that against them either  Service was very friendly and helpful  Again  my only real complaint is that I didn t feel safe walking nearly   blocks to Freemont so we didn t do it  My best advice if you are looking for a decent room and don t mind hiring a taxi is to book a suite in advance and at least enjoy the room  I ve seen bad reviews on the older rooms  but the suite was really cherry and priced for less than what a standard room costs on the strip  
P =>  A Mediocre Place We stayed there for four nights in a double double Pavillion room  After reading about the  quot open aired quot   quot garage downstairs quot  review  I tried to get a tower room and was told they were all booked  It is a motel like room on the  th floor      are garage   The room is clean  The bathroom is small  and there is no sitting area  Since we spent most of the time on Strip  it didn t bother us much  I hanged the  quot donot bother quot  sign outside every morning  the maid didn t knock our door  but knocked all the others and shouting  quot room service quot  A little uncomfortable for us The casino was smokey  the front desk clerk was OK  But I really didn t think much of the food in the Kitty Cafe The most important part  the safety  which I worried a lot before the trip  The hotel is one block to the bus stop Deuce  and two to the Canopy Although I didn t have any problem walking back to the hotel with my parents at night  the street is well lit and there are people walking around   the neighbourhood didn t look nice  I don t suggest walking alnoe at night In summary  considering the price  it is an acceptbale place  but a strip hotel will definetly be better  Don t forget that you need to take a bus to the strip  Sometimes  the trip would be longer than what you think  We spent one hour and    mins to get to MGM from Fremont  
P =>  Good value if you are open minded I had read the reviews prior to booking about the El and had mixed feelings about staying here but couldn t resist it as the rates were so cheap for the weekend We managed to get a tower room on the top floor with a fantastic view of the strip  We requested a non smoking room  I am a smoker but my husband is not   and they could not accommodate us  however  the room was not smokey at all  and it had a nice big window you could open up  Only negative about the room was you could hear what was happening in the room next to you and people in the hallway  especially housekeeping early in the morning  We hung our do not disturb sign out each night and were not intruded upon by housekeeping  contrary to some previous reviews we had read Yes  the casino is SMOKEY to the extreme  and even being a smoker I could not hang out in the casino for too long  My husband wanted to walk up to Fremont Street on our first night and I was reluctant because of what I had read about it being too risky to walk from the El to Fremont Street after dark  but my husband assured me he would look after me    All concerns were unfounded   it is ONLY about     yards and quite well lit up so we didn t see what the issues were all about  It was fine We didn t gamble too much at the El as they only had single deck blackjack so we did most of our gambling at other casinos  however  we probably had our best meals in Vegas at the El  We had lunch at Careful Kitty s one day which was surprisingly good  and we had dinner the first night at the steakhouse restaurant  and loved the meal and service so much we went back the next night  Do not underestimate this restaurant   better than most we ate at in Vegas on our trip The clientele at the casino we found interesting  however  security was on hand quickly for the couple of minor incidents we witnessed I only had two complaints about the El  One already mentioned about the smokey casino   the other the elevators   scarier than riding up the top of The Stratosphere  Never felt I was going to make it to the top floor and avoided going to my room unnecessarily   I m not one much for heights at the best of times and do have a problem with a bumpy ride  Overall  the casino I would rate as ordinary  the location is not as scary as some people have mentioned  the food in the steakhouse was great  and for the money you pay it is fantastic value if you are not after all the frills and swankiness of Vegas  
P =>  Second Visit and Plan on More This was my second trip to the El Cortez this year  Got another large  clean room on one of the upper floors with a view of the mountains  The rooms are neither perfectly spotless nor exquisitely decorated  but they are a level of clean above reasonable  quiet  and very comfortable  And you won t find rooms this spacious at this price anywhere else in LV  The rooms are more than adequate for sleeping and showering  And I was again amazed at the efficiency of their only two elevators  I don t think I ever waited longer than one minute to hitch a ride going up or down between the casino and my   th floor room  The casino also gets another thumbs up  However  if you re sensitive to smoke  questionable fashion choices  or some  quot fringe quot  members of society  this probably won t be your scene  Being a serious slot player  smoker and people watcher  this is my kind of place  Plenty of newer slots  and some  quot old quot  classics  with loose tendencies   even won a couple of decent jackpots on the same night  Attendants were quick to bring out the paperwork and money and were very friendly  ent drink service most of the time  and for the love of Pete  remember to tip the waitresses bartenders  If you can afford to gamble  you can afford to tip a buck a round while you re playing   No  this is not where the beautiful people hang out  But then  I went to many of the Strip casinos where the beautiful people did hang out  and witnessed more of them being drunk and disorderly than the El Cortez crowd  My only complaint about the casino was the the sound system  this time they had some sort of poor quality smooth jazz   bring back the oldies rock   As for the surrounding area  it s a quick step over to the Fremont Street  not even a   minute walk  area and  if you use common sense and keep alert  you shouldn t have any problems  My sense is that those that wig out about some of the locals hanging about  maybe one low profile hooker  one junkie  and or one homeless person between the El C and Fremont Street  have spent little if any time in a typical city  However  I wouldn t advise walking in any other direction than towards Fremont Street  Take a bus or taxi from downtown to the Strip   do not walk that stretch day or night  no matter what your state of sobriety  physical fitness  or personal weapons  In closing  if you re a seasoned Vegas visitor and just want a decent place to stay and gamble  go to the the El C by all means  I wouldn t recommend it for Vegas newbies  prima donna types  or people under     In fact  this applies for the downtown casino hotels in general  I hope to get back soon  
P =>  Please Please  Reconsider another hotel Please  reconsider your stay at this hotel  you are definitely putting yourself in harms way to save a few dollars  I stayed here for four days  and a past Las Vegas resident  and remember Fremont Street before the  quot experience quot   When someone stays at a hotel casino where people gamble  it is the hotels casino s responsiblity to insure their quests  and others security are priority ONE  but not at the El Cortez  I was threatened by a many casino patron  I am a disabled person  to  quot take me outside quot  just for watching  and when I filed a incident report  they ignored it because the patron was spending his cash at the table  I ended up staying in my room in fear for my life  The room had no security lock  the door didn t close completely  the single pane windows were  quot screwed shut quot   and the ceiling leaked water while the water drain outside the window constantly ran keeping me awake  I am still trying to recover from this two weeks later  The hotel security  and staff were seen in uniform playing slots  texas holdem  and tables games to get advantage over the people  now think about that for a moment  One evening while eating at  quot Careful Kitty s quot  resturant  btw the food is the worse  in the El Cortez  a drunk patron started a fight  threw his meal all over the counter at others  and screamed he wasn t going to pay  trying to get a free meal  hitting me with food  Security didn t show up for    minutes  and when they did  they didn t escort him out  they just made him pay his meal  never asking the other patron  or guests if they were alright  It doesnt do any good to complain  they just don t care  and you are putting yourself in grave danger both in the hotel casino  and the walk down Fremont Street unlit  bums asking for hand outs  and no lighting walking outside the El Cortez  Be sure to carry mase  or something to protect yourself  and honestly  i don t know about you  or where some of these people who stayed are trying to fool  but I suggest you read these other negative reviews  Your safety is more important then saving a few bucks   quot especially in this part of Las Vegas quot   and there are other hotel casino s besides the El Cortez  I had stayed for three days prior at Harrah s on the strip with no problems like this  and with it being the weekend  I couldn t just pickup and go to another hotel casino because they were all booked for the weekend  Also  recall that all hotel casino s have security cameras everywhere  but what good are they if you don t protect the people  I remember downtown not like this  it used to be safe  and with      people moving to vegas a MONTH  many end up on the streets of downtown  not on the strip  Im sure you ve seen the cop show on tv  where do you think the incidents happen  You quessed it  As for the El Cortez  you only get what you pay for  isn t that the truth    In closing  many many people carry cash in these casino s  and what good is it if your life is at stake  I realize some have had no problems  while others have  but for heavens sake  how many complaints does it take before someone s life is taken over money  
P => Pleasantly surprised My father  who passed away almost two years ago  introduced me to the El Cortez back in the early eighties  This is where he and my mom liked to stay when visiting Las Vegas  It has became a tradition for my husband and I to stay at the hotel everytime we go to LV  Recently on our last visit  I walked into the lobby and was very impressed with the new decor  The lobby seemed more spacious and the old carpet had been replaced  At the enterance sat a huge beautiful table with an exquisite flower arrangment  The reception desk  though small  had also gotten a face lift  When we went to our room in the Tower  I couldn t believe my eyes  the room was absolutey beautiful  Beautiful antique furniture  new wall paper and paintings hung on the walls  The comforter matched the wall paper and the theme of the wall art  The carpet was brand new  Even the television was new   The only thing I was disappointed in  was the drastic price hike  We have never paid more then        for our room  and now we paid     for one night     I guess you get what you pay for  Even the hotel guests seems to be  pardon me  of a more sophisticated class  It never bothered me that the hotel was located in a not so  quot good quot  part of town  In the many years that we have stayed here  never have we encountered any problems  Kudos    We even have a reservation booked for ember  Thanks El Cortez for always making our stay a pleasant one  This one is for you Dad  The G s from Ca  
P => Great Stay at El C We stayed at the El Cortez for   nights  out of a   night trip  because it was too expensive to stay on the strip for the weekend  Check in was not super friendly but quick and easy  We were given a nice   th floor tower room with a view of the strip  The room was very nice other than the small bathroom  The room was also very clean and quiet  The carpeting and all furniture were new and nice  The casino isn t bad either although not very exciting  The casino is no longer dark and smokey nor crammed  You can get a free deck of cards or dice for signing up for the slot club  as well as       points and some other good coupons  We did eat at Robertas one night  which was one of our best meals of the trip  The restaraunt was somewhat plain but still felt elegant and the food was very good  If you have a     off coupon Robertas is certainly worth it and still a decent deal if you don t  The walk to freemont wasn t really that bad  and the hotel is as close to the bus as any other downtown casino  It was a great place to stay for   days although not very convenient if you spend most of your trip on the strip  or like to swim  no pool  
P =>  I enjoyed the El Cortez The hotel is old but charming I am    years old and I must admit I only saw a few people who were either my age or younger less than a hand full  It is definately oldschool  but I happen to like that The rooms are large but they have a small bathroom The bathroom does have a window that opens for fresh air My favorite part about the El Cortez is the blackjack They have    tables with good rules and still pay      I love the side bet also This Hotel Casino doesn t compare to the strip mainly because of its location and clientel  sp    But it is a fun experience I understand this hotel is not for everyone though  If you love and are use to staying on the strip than this Hotel is probably not for you If you are like me and just go to Las Vegas to have fun  drink  and gamble with low limits than it s worth a try  
P =>  Don t waste your time When I told the cab driver where I was staying  he did a double take  That should have been my warning but since I had no where else to go  I was stuck To say this place is tired is an understatement  Upon entering  it took me about    minutes to locate the  front desk    which is little more than a recessed kiosk  I got to the elevator and into my room  The room was cavernous   very large and covered in old stained pink carpeting  The doors rattled and the lock didn t seem secure  At night  I wedged a chair against the door for added protection This was a huge room but the sparse furniture in the room was all set around the walls and made the room uncomfortably large  The bed was set against one wall and the small tv was set all the way across the room on an old dresser  It was so far away  the remote didn t work unless I got out of bed and walked up a few feet The casino itself is old   old   old  Carpeting is old  stained and tired  Much like the elephant s graveyard  I truly believe this is where gamblers to go die  I played some texas hold  em there and true to some of the  press  the owner sat down and played with us  He was a nice enough guy but has some serious health problems and drank himself into a stupor while playing  The drink lady obviously knew him well and had been there for years  She was visibly concerned about his health and questioned his drinking   which just aggrevated the owner  It was not a pleasant scene and was actually depressing  The owner eventually staggered away While at the table  I struck up a conversation with the guy next to me  We were having a pleasant conversation and this particular dealer ragged on us incessantly about  table talking   I like social games and that s half the fun but this guy ragged us to the point that we quit tipping him  The other guy eventually told the dealer to go      himself and left and I followed suit  The casino is a block off from the Fremont Street Experience and block you have to cross is a concern  The cab driver warned me not to be out at night in that area  He said there were a lot of crack heads and they were known to mug people  I ended up playing downtown a lot but made my way back before dark each evening Careful Kitty s is ok  It s an old diner  Food was alright and the service was friendly There were lots of old tired looking people hanging around who appeared to have health related problems  I m truly sorry for these people but I was there to have fun and it was just depressing I went back there once with my girlfriend to show her the place  She couldn t believe I actually stayed there  She played some slots and then said that the place  creeped  her out and she wanted to leave NOW   I ll stay downtown anytime and actually prefer it to the strip but I ll never make this mistake again  The room was cheap but I paid a much higher price by sacrificing my enjoyment  I ve been to Vegas many times and this was  by far  the worse experience I ve ever had  
P => Much more than you pay for Wow  I was really impressed with this place  I visited the casino in       and received a room offer with a weekend rate of      I took them up on that and was really glad I did  Just the casino alone has been cleaned up and refurbished since my last visit  I hadn t seen the rooms before  but I was VERY pleased  The room was HUGE  I had a tower king room   The check in clerk was very nice  checked us in early around   am  and offered us a strip view  which we took and was very nice   The room had obviously been recently remodeled  The bathroom was a little small but not uncomfortable  There was the bedroom area and a semi seperate sitting area  This room was easily worth twice what I paid for it  especially for a weekend in Vegas  Highly recommended  
P =>  Loved El Cortez    My husband and I stayed e  th and  th at the El Cortez  Our room was neat and decorated very nicely  We loved playin at the casino and I actually won          on the second night there playing keno  For Friday and Sat  nights  you can t beat the price and it keeps us away from the crowded strip on the weekend  We will definitely stay there again  
P => Hidden Gem   OK area The El Cortez Hotel in Vegas is a great little hidden gem as long as you know what to ask for and as long as you know where you are in the neighborhood  The hotel has a great old school feel to the lobby and casino  Plenty of different slots  video poker and some basic tables    If you are staying in the main part of the hotel  not the motel house  or the extension  but the recently upgraded rooms  then you are in for a treat  The rooms are excellent  Great  tasteful and clean    the bathroom still maintains an old    s look  and it almost feels like you are in a submarine since the enclosure comes up and over your head  Other than that the deal is incredible and hard to beat  The cost for those rooms are next to nothing compared to some less than respectable hotels on the strip  Just keep in mind  you are located well off the strip and a few blocks from fremont experience  Some say its just a short walk  but its what you have to walk through to get there  The neighborhood is not the safest nor is it the cleanest  I am a single man in my    s and would not dare walk the dark street to get to fremont experience  I preferred to stay at the El Cortez  Last note  food is just ok  stay away from the steak  and they don t serve to go orders yet    
P => Would Definitely Stay Again  Stayed at the El Cortez il    through     Here s the rundown Although the front desk clerk was a tad cranky  in her defense  the front desk seems to be understaffed   she was quick and let us check in early  We got a room on the   th floor  Room        which was very large and clean  The bathrooms are tiny  but everything was clean and functional  Comfortable beds  and a very comfy loveseat to lounge on while checking out the view of the mountains  I also dug how the elevators to the rooms are right inside the casino   no hiking through   miles of hallways to get to your room  The three nights we were there were quiet  Maid service was efficient and thorough We only ate once at Careful Kitty s Cafe while we were there  Food was marginal   probably wouldn t eat there again  Didn t get a chance to try Roberta s I enjoyed the casino  Yes  it s a little rough around the edges  but that only added to its charm  Easy to navigate  and the cocktail staff was decent  I only play slots  and found a good variety to choose from  While I didn t hit anything big at the Cortez  the slots are much looser than those on the Strip  The clientele is mostly middle aged  blue collar  and low key  There are a few  quot character quot  types there  but I found them much less annoying than the look at me people and hoardes of college kids learning how to drink at the mega resorts  The casino in general had a relaxed vibe The location of the Cortez was outstanding   just maybe a half block walk to the main Fremont Street scene  As for this being a  quot rough stretch quot  to walk down  I didn t think so at all  I did see a couple of working girls and a homeless person  but big deal  It s a city  Don t bother them and they won t bother you   However  I would not recommend walking down Las Vegas Blvd  from downtown to the Strip  It didn t appear to be a war zone per se  but there were a lot of vacant lots  boarded up buildings and dealers  Take the bus or a taxi   I loved how it was just a few steps from the hotel to the Fremont Street action with its plentiful and accessible variety of casinos  food  and shopping  I ve always stayed on the Strip before  but the Cortez has converted me to a downtowner  My husband doesn t care for the Vegas thing at all  and even he had a good time All in all  I d stay there again  If you re a low maintenance kind of person who wants somewhere clean  comfortable  and safe to stay and play  this is your scene  I m looking forward to going back  
P =>  Love it       I really do like this hotel  Of course it isn t a super resort like Mandalay Bay or any of the other big strip hotels  but it s got that old Vegas charm which is what I like  It s very inexpensive  One of the times I stayed there I received a certificate to come back in a few months for free  It was like if you stayed two nights during a certain month  you could come back again for two nights for free in a few months  
P =>  Pleasantly surprised  Have stayed here twice in the last year  both times in the Tower  On the first trip the room was satisfactory  clean and well maintained  although the decor was a bit tired  They seem to be systematically refurbishing the hotel and on the second trip the room was newly refurbished to a very good standard  The staff  in my experience  are friendly and helpful  The casino floor is perhaps not somewhere you would choose to linger and it does seem to cater for the locals rather than tourists  The hotel is conveniently situated     yards from Fremont Street and the bus stop to the Strip  I have been pleasantly surprised by this hotel  given its varied feedback  and would recommend it as reasonably priced accommodation  
P =>  Worst Hotel Ever  If you love cramped quarters  filthy bathrooms  cold showers  and non functioning basics like the ice machine and room thermostat  then the El Cortez will thrill you like no other hotel I ve ever seen  After my recent stay there  I m convinced  quot El Cortez quot  is Spanish for rathole  While I expect the casino to be smokey  the smell of smoke is pervasive throughout the building   even in the non smoking rooms  The casino itself is the smokiest  and most poorly lit I ve ever seen  as well  The bottom line   if you re a smoker who plans on spending only enough time in the hotel room to wash your face and crash  then this might be the place for you  Otherwise  sleeping in your car and taking spongebaths in the local      will be more comfortable  
P => Vintage Vegas at its Best  Worst  If you re looking for vintage Las Vegas with a side order of seedy  you ll LOVE the El Cortez  It is neither a resort or a theme park like its Las Vegas Strip and Freemont Steet counterparts    it s an old hotel with an old casino where people go to gamble  drink and best of all  avoid children  It s a little stinky and a lot smokey  but that just adds to its retro charm  The room rates are fantastic  the slots are loose and the tables have low limits  It s like stepping back in time  While there have been complaints about the neighborhood  a recent effort by the city to clean up the downtown area has proven positive  You might still run into a pesky bum or two on the street  but they seem harmless enough  Again  its part of the experience  And there is plenty of security at the hotel and on bicycle around the premises  Perhaps the El Cortez isn t the right choice for Mr   amp  Mrs  Middle America who are looking for Las Vegas as portrayed on the Travel Channel  Those of you would be better off to STAY on The Strip and  frankly  avoid downtown all together  But those of you who are looking for a taste of vintage Vegas  those of you who are looking for an attraction that  quot just is quot  and not developed by some marketing team  those of you who like it a bit on the sleazy side  the El Cortez is possibly the last great piece of Old Vegas  
P =>  Great Weekend   Stayed at the El Cortex                 Was pleasantly surprised how clean and large the room and hallways were   stayed in      with a postcard view of the strip   everyone there was friendly  check in was fast and courteous and housekeeping was fabulous  appreciated the    dollar food coupons   variety of slots are the best downtown  and they pay much better than the strip    If you stay downtown  this is the most economical and best place to stay  
P =>  El Cortez My wife and I just loved staying at the El Cortez hotel in Las Vegas  The rooms were very inexpensive compaired to other places we stayed at  There weren t any hidden cost The cafe had a wonderful steak and lobster dinner for       and all the other meals we had were great  The staff from the bell hop to the dealers were so friendly and helpful  Our rooms were cleaned every day and no one rushed us I will stay again  You save money to spend on other things in Vegas  I was very pleased with my stay there Tom GilliamTennessee 
P =>  Primo  I was pleasantly surprized with my room at the El Cortez  The furnishings were that of a hotel room costing   times more on the  Strip   the housekeeping was superior  and the bedding was very comfortable  All the amenities one could want are for the asking  including a mini refrigerator  iron ironing board  or a hairdryer   quot Roberta s quot  restaurant is a fine downtown choice for supper  but the  quot Careful Kitty s quot  coffee shop is best only for breakfast  both with good menus and reasonable prices  This is the best value of all hotels in Las Vegas  
P =>  great experience We Had The Fortune Of Staying At The EL CORTEZ From      Through             We Found The Rooms Bright  Spacious And Extremely Clean  The Service Throughout The Hotel Was Fantastic  Especially At The Restaurant Where We Ate All Our Meals  The Meals Were Very Inexpensive And Delicious  Wether It Was Breakfast  Lunch  Or Dinner  The Casino Was A Pleasure To Play The Gaming Tables In  And We Hardly Had To Leave The Hotel During Our Five Day Stay  Thank You For Making Our Vacation So Trouble Free And Welcomming We Will Definitely Return Again And Stay At The EL CORTEZ  
P =>  Great place to play but avoid the  double double  rooms    Just a heads up to anyone staying at the El  make sure you reserve a Tower room  or even one of the Vintage rooms if you re a smoker  Steer clear of their  quot Double double quot  rooms    or at least know what you re getting into  They claim these rooms are in  quot the main building  quot  but they re actually in an open air  motel like annex built on the ROOF of their parking garage  Spring the extra    and get a room IN the hotel That said  gambling at the El is terrific  No problem finding    single deck blackjack on Fri Sat  nights  I even sat in on a    table during prime time Friday hours  Dealers were fine  and the cocktail waitresses were on the ball  They ve cleaned up the place and turned up the lights a bit since I was there last summer  but it still has the feel of an  quot old Vegas quot  gambling hall  for adults only  which is nice  Crowd is mix of locals and tourists with its share of characters  One complaint about the casino is the smoke  I m not a prude about smoking by any means  but after a night of gambling here  I was ready to cough up my lungs  Whew  The El should definitely invest in some air cleaning equipment  
P =>  Solid bargain  I stayed at El Cortez for two nights  Yes  the lobby casino area has that stale smoke smell and looks as though it hasn t been renovated in decades  However  the room we had was very clean and surprisingly large  If you re after luxury  this probably isn t the place for you  otherwise  it s a great value and the restaurants in the hotel are cheap and serve decent fare  I found the staff friendly and helpful  though I didn t push the limits with unusual demands  Overall  this is the perfect place to stay if you re looking for a bargain and don t require pampering  Staying downtown isn t for everyone  though it was nice to avoid the hordes spilling out along the strip  One plus is that it doesn t take you twenty minutes to exit the hotel as it does in one of those mega casino hotels on the strip  
P =>  I don t care what anybody says this is a great downtown hotel I have just returned from a weekend at the glorious El Cortez Hotel on the eastern edge of downtown Las Vegas  I have previously been amused at the range of comments about the El Cortez  I feel sorry for those who did not enjoy their stay at this hotel  I found it wonderful  and I would sooner stay here than in any fancier hotel on the Strip  The stay came as a result of my golfing buddy  Silent Jon  He is a Vegas fanatic  The guy gets multiple letters in the mail offering him free rooms and meals  Silent Jon is the kind of guy the casinos love  He is not a high roller  or a low roller  but a mid roller  And dedicated mid rollers end up getting comp rooms at the El Cortez Silent Jon and I were rewarded with a penthouse suite  on the house  Amazing  This was the finest room layout I have ever experienced in downtown Las Vegas  Silent Jon is like Vegas royalty  so I gave him the king sized bed  I used a convertible sofa bed  which was in a room adjacent to the master suite  Topping off the master suite as a full sized Jacuzzi  I found the roiom both comfortable and useful  The Jacuzzi got a workout on Saturday after we finished a round of golf in     degree heat  We both got off to a fast start on the El Cortez crap tables  Others have commented about the low minimums on the El Cortez gaming tables  They are right on  Silent Jon and I engage in a tag team crap roll in which we each kick in    bucks  I stunk when it came my turn to roll the dice  But Silent Jon was scintillating  Torrid  You name it  He did it  There was a black guy at the table who is a dead ringer for Laurence Fishburne  He must have made about        himself by betting judiciously on Silent Jon s ability to throw the dice  And there was another Vegas urchin who looked exactly like Christina Ricci  She was squealing with delight when Silent Jon parlayed a hard eight  Christina missed out on a lot of excitement  By the time we walked away  Silent jon turned our combined    bucks into      We split evenly down the middle  which is how we deal with our tag team rolls All in all  I am delighted to have stayed in a penthouse suite at the delightful El Cortez hotel  I augmented the early crap roll with four aces on a video poker machine  and a new record for second tier keno payouts  I have a standard eight spot ticket that has rewarded me many times  On this visit  I reocrded one six out of eight  ten five out of eights  and ten four out of sixes  So there was never a dull moment at the El Cortez  
P =>  Get what you pay for I love the   dollar ante single deck black jack   You definately get what you pay for though  It s cheap and i wouldn t recomend eating at their restraunt  Freemont street is a block away  the bus stop is right there  hell i just need a hotel for a place to sleep i hardly stay there when i m in vegas so it doesn t matter to me what it looks like  the beds are comfortable and the rooms are clean that is what matters so i give it a solid   star it saves you money so you can do some gambling    overall i liked the place 
P =>  Okay for chain smokers If the only thing you want to do in Vegas is smoke  drink  and gamble  then this place is perfect  Place is great given the price  as low as     a night if you book direct   I thought the food and service was very good too  However  the entire place stinks to high heaven of cigarettes  even in the non smoking rooms  There was dried blood on the boxsprings and one of the lamp shades in my room  The place isn t too far from the strip  but it can take a long time to get there because of the traffic  For a little bit more  you can get a much cleaner place on the strip that will be closer to the shows and attractions  
P =>  comfortable and a great time I really enjoyed the Casino and Hotel  It wasn t too crowded with loads of people and the food was good  I never had to pay for a meal  they give you a coupon book worth       and I stayed for   days  Some waitresses were not as quick in busy areas  Has a bit of old charm as well as all the newer slots  Its also close to the old strip walking distance  and there is a bus every    minutes to the new strip   hrs  which is a few miles up the road  
P => You get what you pay for I suppose The desk clerk was rude  the security insulting  the place old and decrepit but it was a comfortable bed and a reasonably quiet place to spend the night when we were only in town   hours  
P =>  As good as ever    The El Cortez hasn t changed much in thirty years  and that fact thrilled me and my wife  My first stay at the El was thirty one years ago   celebrating my twenty first birthday  il          was my first trip back in over twenty years  and we loved it  The staff is friendly and helpful  the value is unbelievable  and the gaming excellent  I stayed in one of the original rooms  for old times sake   and it was clean  modern and comfortable  The food is wonderful and always a bargain  I got to watch Jackie G play Texas Holdem Sunday night  but the table was full and I couldn t get in the game  That would have been a thrill If you want to experience Old Vegas the way it truly was  the El Cortez has to be your first stop  Liberal slots and probably the best Black Jack in town  Sorry if this is coming off sounding like a commercial  but Mr  G is getting older and I m afraid the El will eventually change into just another slick money pit  We  quot low rollers quot  have a home just now  and for those who come to Las Vegas for the gambling instead of the glitz  I suggest you take advantage of this fine old hotel while you still can  I know we ll be back as soon as we can  
P =>  worst hotel i ever stayed Its the worst hotel that i have ever stayed in las vegas  The staff never responded to anything we asked for and worst of all the hotel corridors and rooms are so worst and very difficult to find parking space  water always clogges in the bathroom and the TV never worked  
P =>  Want lung cancer and bad service to chase it with  The El Cortez is for you    My wife  mother in law and I ended up at the El Cortez over a ch weekend    college basketball and spring break bookings forced our hand  nowhere else could accomidate us I wish we never set foot there  The tower rooms looked ok  but we were in the old building which is only slightly more appealing than a rescue mission Between the seedy characters  serial chain smokers  spring break alkies and the steet people who seem to make the El Cortez their    hour shelter  it s not possible to feel comfortable for a moment there If you have no choice but to stay in that run down  hard scrabble area  try the Days Inn across the street  Fremont Street   
P =>  Great Gambling Excellent place for your gaming  Craps consistently offer    minimum with   x odds  Blackjack tables have reasonably good rules  The machines have good payouts  I ve stayed here three times  Don t expect great ambiance like the palaces on the Strip  but you get great hotel deals and staff is friendly  I ve stayed and played all over this town for many years    places like the MGM Grand  Mirage  Luxor  and Golden Nugget    and find there are nicer rooms but I always seem to end up on Glitter Gulch for playing  and the El Cortez tables especially get most of my action  
P =>  Super deal  I stayed at the El Cortez during the NASCAR race week       Did not know what to expect because of the mixed reviews  If you are looking for a clean hotel  with a great restaurant  good casino   which is one block from Fremont St  casinos then stay here  The rates are super  phones optional  but this was a comfortable hotel  If you are looking for the glitz trip stay on the strip and spend all your money  I will stay here again  
P =>  The Best Casino Hotel in Vegas  The El Cortez is the only hotel casino my friend and I ever stay  we spent many trips with the   Seasons Club  The gambling machines are almost always loose and we won our share of jackpots and shirts and jackets  The rooms have always been clean and kept that way as long as we stayed    I had one bad experience where I was haveing a winning streak and had        in a case in my purse and it was stolen and never found out if it was recorded on tape or not  but in the around    years that we were going thats pretty good  The cafe has great food at great prices and Roberta s Cafe has the best prime rib   I have been in bad health so haven t been able to go in the last few years but when I can afford to go again you better believe the El Cortez is where we will head for our food and hotel and gambling  N  J  Thomson Long Beach  Ca   
P =>  Okay Stayed at the El Cortez over the weekend and surprisingly found the facility to be okay The El Cortez has five categories of rooms  ranging from expensive to cheap  the mini suite  usually     regardless of day   the double double tower room             the latter price on weekends and holidays   the king tower room           the latter price on weekends and holidays   the double double main building room      and up   and the queen vintage building room      and up   We got one of the uper floor double double tower rooms  High and overlooking the strip  the view was nice  The room and bathroom were spacious and clean  water was fine  numerous clean towels were provided  and the beds and pillows were comfortable  The TV even had cable  Accommodations were definitely comparable to the large hotels on the Strip Hotel staff was okay  housekeeping people were particulalry friendly Our casino experience was good   saw a number of winners  one could play on the tables for a minimum bet of     There was also a relatively big number of   cent machines for those not into big time gambling The hotel has garage parking  so vehicles aren t directly exposed to the elements  sun and dust  We found the Immediate vicinity to be scary  but Las Vegas Blvd  and the Fremont Street Experience are only a block away  so if you re able to survive that one block walk  you should be fine  within that one block walk  you will find stores that sell nice souvenir shirts for   for        shirts that sell for     each on the Strip  Two things did bother me      the smoke situation  which was really bad  my nose bled from the assault of smoke   though I ve experienced pretty much the same thing in ALL other Las Vegas hotels  they really should have no smoking casinos in this supposed tourist friendly paradise   and     the lunch buffet at the hotel s Careful Kitty s restaurant  which at       on a Monday  was very expensive by downtown standards   Tip  Try the food at Golden Gate Hotel s City by the Bay Diner   you can get a good and heavy meal for        We ll definitely come back to this hotel if we can get the     rate for one of the tower rooms on a weekend  
P => the Lowdown on the El cortez The El Cortez is the best deal in Vegas  It s not the Bellagio  Heck  it s not even a Motel    But for       bucks what do you expect  The        rooms are worn  but clean  The carpets have stains but not gross  The bathrooms however are very nice snd modern  I fly in and always stay here my first night  I usually get in around midnght and I don t want to pay big bucks for a place that I am barely going to use  It s a   minute straight shot walk to Downtown  The next night I usually migrate up the strip where I can enjoy my room Overall  the El Cortez is just a cheap place to crash  If you are looking for frills or to be pampered then it s not for you   Big Rob in Portland 
P =>  always a great stay i have stayed at the el cortez quite a few times and it s always great  they have vintage rooms that are only accessible by stairs and they are refurbished snd lovely  they are original rooms from the      s  i ve also stayed in a huge suite they have on the other side of the hotel  all rooms except for the vintage rooms come with a couch and coffee table   i always find my room to be very clean and housekeeping has no problem keeping you well stocked  it s definitely   of the best downtown  you can t hold them responsible for the area downtown las vegas is like any other downtown 
P =>  Bargain I have stayed at the El Cortez several times  The Tower rooms are roomy and comfortable  For the price  it is a bargain  However  don t go for the really cheap rooms in the  quot old quot  section of the hotel  I hear that they are not very nice The staff was always courteous  
P =>  Gotta Love It  
P =>  Dump  
P => The old Las Vegas  
P =>  El Cortez smells horrible and is equipped with it s own bum s and wino s  
P =>  stone mtn ga

P => Great stay at El Cortez  
P =>  Mes   jours   Las Vegas   Hotel El Cortez  
P =>   Tr s bon hotel exept  le bruit  
P =>  Carino  
P =>   Me pareci  un magnifico hotel  
P =>   Relaci n calidad precio buena  
P =>   Que demande de mieux le peuple     
P =>  Herrlich  
P => 
P =>  Business in Vegas is never just  Business  Stayed here and it has all the amenities a vegas traveler needs  Truth is no one ever plans to stay in when their in Vegas if they are what are they doing in Vegas  The Hotel rooms are tasteful great bathroom and comfy beds  The free breakfast was delicious and not to mention the open bar     hotel is conveniently located a walk away from the strip  restaurants  and convenient stores      
P =>   Off the Strip but quite nice  Not the Bellagio but    what are you expecting from a hotel called the Embassy Suites Honestly  the hotel was quite clean  well done and the parking was free    and you could literally walk downstairs and out to the car  not miles and miles away or     a night Breakfast cooked to order was very nice and complete Excellent value The ONLY negative things i can say  a      miles to the strip is a bit of a walk so buyer beware that it s not ON the strip b  the shuttle service they offer is available    but not frequently  i missed the    pm and would have had to wait til    pm  no thanks The Envy steakhouse at the Renaissance Hotel next door offered a terrific     prix fixe dinner Would stay here again as long as i had a car or walking shoes   One last thing  if you have a chance  don t miss the Red Rocks recreation area about    miles out of town  Gorgeous and great hiking and bike riding  
P =>   Truly A Gem and well worth every dime Went to Vegas for my friends B day but didnt have the funds to splurge on the hotel the rest of the group stayed in  I went here expecting Embassy Suite Hilton quality of course but this place was great  Aside from the great Embassy Suites room  full living room  balcony  cozy bed in bedroom and luxurious bathroom  cooked to order omeletes and the breakfast buffet  pancakes  french toast  eggs  sausage  bacon  cereal  juices and MORE      The hotel also provided a Happy hour everyday from           with free drinks  wine and snacks  Good times and good place to network  The location is a little far from the Strip  approx    mile or so I believe  but only about a     minute walk to the convention center monorail which takes you directly to the strip  The monorail runs til about   or  am after that you just have to catch a cab which isn t so bad  Aside from that you re away from the hustle and bustle to enjoy quiet at your leisure  My friends stayed at the Palms Place and MGM which were GREAT    but they didnt get the free happy hour and breakfast  though my friends suite at the palms place was       WHEW   thats all i can say   So if you re traveling on a budget this is a great place  plus Hilton Honors is always having deals  I just happened to luck out with   nights at like       What a steal    I would definitely stay here again  possibly for my trip to Vegas again in ember lol  
P =>  Great place to stop with family We don t normally like to stay in Las Vegas but since it is half way to our destination we chose to stay there  We are not into the Las Vegas scene at all so wanted a hotel without a casino  We have   children and were looking for something affordable  We came across Embassy Suites on Priceline and for a family of seven it worked great  The room had a living room sm  kitchenette area and then a separate bedroom  The room would sleep   and we put the baby in his own playpen and also had the staff bring up a portable single bed  The kids loved the pool and their favorite part  and mine  was the made to order breakfast in the morning that was included in the price of the room  That kind of breakfast would have easily cost us     at a restaurant  We were cozy in the place but it certainly worked for the one night we stayed and was clean and comfortable and the staff was helpful and the hotel was very nice  The kids loved the glass elevators as well  
P =>  Great Stay Great Stay  We stayed here one night due to the close proximity to the Convention Center  we then moved to the Bellagio  and immediately moved back to Embassy Suites What a wonderful experience  The staff went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable  Having the option of an evening cocktail at the Manager s special is a nice benefit  and the breakfast each morning was steaming hot and fresh  making it so convienent when needing to get to an event at the Convention Hall The workout room was clean  equipment is updated and it is included with your stay  If you are a Hilton Honors member  the wireless internet is provided at no charge  a nice added benefit  The hotel was quiet and clean  You don t have to schlepp your luggage for miles into the hotel  parking is plentiful and free  We didn t mind being off the strip  it was a welcome respite from the craziness  You can easily drive to the strip  or walk to the monorail station for an evening of fun When in Vegas again  the Embassy Suites gets my business  
P =>  Great Experience  Great hotel  off the the strip  Not as upscale as some Embassy Suites that I have stayed in  but still nice  Enjoyed the breakfast and manager reception  The shuttle came in handy to the Convention Center and Fashion Show Mall  You have to call the front desk for pick up  Downside  in door pool  but had an outdoor hot tub and lounge  
P =>   Beautiful rooms friendly staff The hotel was fantastic  Off the strip  so quiet  but only   blocks from the strip  Hotel provides free shuttle drop off and pick up to strip  All the staff members were extremely friendly and helpful  Rooms were very spacious and clean  Bed s were huge and felt like heaven  Cleaning service was thorough and friendly and fantastic with our belongings  Hotel food was wonderful  Laundry facilities located on floors    and   for convience  Free bar from      to      every night  Hotel was in mint condition with lovely fountain in lobby  Free computer priviledges  I loved the hotel  
P =>   Very nice Really nice place good staff and very clean Comfortable suite with nice furnishings and a step out balcony  good if like me you smoke  Plenty of parking out front with security at night Fantastic breakfast in the morning  don t miss it Great hotel shame about the town  giant construction site full of well fed tramps and hookers  not a place to bring your kids  Good tip for a day out is lake Mead  hire a boat really nice and not expensive  
P =>   Disappointing Stayed at the hotel for   nights  Travelling with   kids   teenagers   Thought that a   room suite will be a good alternative to booking   rooms at a hotel on the strip  Bad decision Reasons           Very far from the strip     Neighbourhood appears  quot shady quot     Sofabed unfit for sleep      kids very upset     Park your rental vehicle at your own risk        see      Poor housekeeping      had to call housekeeping daily about multiple issues In conclusion  while the rooms were not bad  the reception staff reasonably friendly  and the amenities average  the resort falls far short of anything I had stayed in the past  that belonged to the Hilton chain  
P =>   Forbidden word  Lesbian   net sites for GLBT blocked for this reason       pm Saturday   I was very happy with the set up  a small living room with a nice bedroom and bath  The front desk staff was helpful as could be       pm   The happy hour was great  free drinks  nachos  chips and popcorn        am   Used hotel pc s in the business center to try and look up information on a mainly GLBT club  The site was blocked because it contained the forbidden word  quot lesbian quot   Facebook was also blocked  Is this the US or China  I ll never stay at another Embassy Suites again  That perhaps goes for any Hilton Honors hotel depending on what I find out about GLBT sites being blocked       am   Went to bed  I could hear my neighbors  particularly the ones above me in their bath  the water running  hair dryer  everything  There was also some strange loud noise like furniture being moved on a tile floor  It went on for some time  There were various other noises as well       am   Woke up  The strange noise started again  be it was kids blowing on something  With that and the noise from the other rooms there was no hope of going back to sleep  I could also hear kids playing in the pool two floors below  
P =>  Fantastic   We rented a two room suite and stayed here over the weekend of  th of y We arrived around      in the morning and seeing that we were exhausted had lots of baggages as we were only stopping by Las Vegas for   days en route to Nevada before heading home to New Zealand   the staff checked us in straight away  They were friendly and very helpful  The rooms were huge and the beds very comfortable The toilets were big and the towels soft and plush  The suite has a dining table and a lounge where everyone could stretch and watch the big TV  What I liked best was the managers  special which runs from      to    o every afternoon where you get to have free nibbles and drinks  any kind of drink my husband enjoyed this very much   The free breakfast was just great  a wide variety of continental and cooked  You can even ask your eggs to be cooked the way you want them You can not get better value for your money  The place is quiet  a bit far from the strip but hey  it is only about    minutes walk  It has a convenient store and a McDonalds just next door  One nice thing is you can use the internet they have   computers  at the lobby and it s free  We enjoyed this place and will definitely stay here again  Thank you  Embassy for making our holiday an enjoyable and a memorable one  
P =>   Nice alternative to the Strip We booked this hotel at the last minute and got a good deal  I believe  with a AAA rate of      for a King Suite with a balcony  We arrived at the hotel at  am and were promptly checked in  The room was nice and clean  The king bed was very comfortable which was welcome since we were exhausted  The sofa bed was not comfortable at all but I suppose they are not made for comfort  The hotel is non smoking  They have an indoor swimming pool that we didn t use   I would have preferred an outdoor one but I would think the indoor version is welcome in winter We had the free wi fi which was a nice touch and came in handy  There are not many places to eat within walking distance   a McDonalds nearby but not much else  The hotel is a short drive from the strip   we enjoyed the proximity without the noise and traffic of the Strip The best part of this hotel is the free cooked to order hot breakfast  It was awesome    It really makes this hotel a great value  Cold Selections  fresh fruit  assorted cereals  bagels  breads  muffins  danishes  Hot Selections  Bacon  Sausage  French Toast  Eggs  Potatoes  Oatmeal  and the BEST omelet bar that also makes fresh cooked eggs  Omelet choices were  bacon  sausage  ham  onion  bell pepper  jalepeno  mushrooms  tomato  and spinach They had juice dispensers  coffee and tea  They also had a soda dispenser that had Coke products We didn t participate in the manager s reception but they had nachos and popcorn the one night that we walked by Overall  this was a great last minute booking for Vegas  For a nice quiet  non smoking  non casino hotel this was perfect  
P =>   Great value Stayed a Friday night   cost around      including evening drinks and snacks and full breakfasts  Wow Had a great room  lots of room and very comfortable beds etc Pool looked great A little far to walk to strip  but monorail close by Nice people  
P =>  Exceptional Value   Great Staff Just returned from a week at this property  The staff were friendly and tried to accommodate all needs  Room was clean with flat screens in both rooms  and free WiFi if you are Hilton Honours member  Food  breakfast was great and cooks were professional   Great location away from all the commotion of the Strip  I found this to be a great value and a nice property  
P =>  Why would you stay anywhere else  We stayed at this hotel over  th of y weekend  and we loved it  The staff was great  the rooms were immaculate and very comfortable  The sleeper sofa even had an innerspring mattress  The bathroom was very nice  and the towels were very plush  Breakfast was excellent   great variety and very fresh  For overall value  this was the best hotel I have stayed at in Las Vegas  Sure  the casinos on the strip have glitz and marble everywhere  but if you want quiet  affordable and family friendly  check into this hotel  I recommend you pay a few dollars more and get the large balcony  Ours was at least    feet x   feet with two chaise lounges and three chairs   all overlooking the south end of the strip The hotel is easy to get to from the airport and is convenient to the strip  the parking garage for the Palazzo and the Wynn are just a   mile up Sands Blvd  
P =>   Typical Embassy Suites I found this property to be pretty typical of Embassy Suites  I think a few of the previous reviews were a little harsh   you have to understand that this hotel is not on the strip  it is not a casino  and it is not a resort  It is located near the convention center  We found the hotel to be clean and very quiet  and the staff was courteous and helpful  Our only negative observation regarded one of the two breakfast cooks  who was not as good a cook as the other one  Overall  a favorable experience  and we would stay here again  
P =>  An ok hotel   a little ran down The hotel was ok   definately overpriced for its condition  Upon check in into our room  one of the beds didn t have the cover placed on the bed  the bathroom sink was making some really loud noise   old piping i guess   the corners of the room were very dusty  the business center was off order  and thy don t have flat screen tvs  The staff was pretty frendly but nothing overly impressive  
P =>   Good business hotel  Right now  Great Vegas hotels are booking rooms at very low rates  esp midweek  So  if you don t mind staying in a very nice hotel  that happens to have a casino  I would go with that option  However if you are in Vegas for business  or passing through with family and wish to avoid the Vegas in Las Vegas  this is a solid choice  Good Breakfast  nice rooms  it felt slightly dirty  but I couldn t put my finger on an exact problem  just felt like it was a bit old and could use a scrub  Parking is good  the pool is inside  which is kind of odd for a place that has pool weather   months out of the year Overall a good choice  but you can get a nicer room for less at a hotel with a casino  
P =>   So So I was a little disappointed with this hotel  The rooms very outdated and look dirty  It s hard to tell if anything is clean as the decor is so dark  Our bedding had holes  No free WiFi  no flat screen tv s  It was okay for a night  but I would hate to spend a vacation at this hotel  
P =>   Great place for Christian non gambler  or smoker  with young children We stayed here with four young girls          months  when my husband had an engineering convention   Yes kids in Vegas for the Hoover Dam  Grand Canyon  The Shark Reef      The Children s museum      The Lion Habitat  The fountain and Garden at the Bellagio  The chocolate factory and the Dolphin habitat   We picked this place primarily because we did not want to stay on the strip and we always stay at an Embassy Suite because of the free  or included  breakfast  The service was excellent  They have a fountain that was fantastic for the children  It had thier undivided attention  It was very entertaining for them We have seen more extensive breakfast at other Embassys but it was more than sufficient One thing to watch for  We had dinner at the restaurant the first night and my   year old burned herself on the on table candle  The flame comes over the top of the votive  The staff was very attentive and the dinner was free  
P =>   Perfect for what we wanted We choose the Embassy Suites Convention Center  because we had our    year old with us this trip and did not feel as we would be able to take advantage of a casino  Plus the added value of the free breakfast and the managers receptions  We arrived a little after noon  and our room was ready  We upgraded to one of the  Large Balcony Rooms   and I m glad we did  They all face the strip  and the view at night is spectacular  I am convinced the view is better than anywhere we have stayed on the strip because you can see it all  The balconies are about    feet by    feet with several chairs and lounges   See Picture  We only made the managers reception one night  About the same as any other Embassy Suites  This one how ever does not give you a limited number of tickets for drinks like I have run into at other Embassy s  so it is all you can drink  The free breakfast is very good and the quality at this one was above normal  The room is typical Embassy  but I think they had just been re done  Everything looked new and fresh  The bathrooms were above average size  The lobby has a computer to print out your boarding passes  but it was down  so the clerk offered to print them for us  Nice touch on their part  We rented a car  and this hotel is very conveniently located to the strip  and makes a good starting for doing all the touristy stuff  We had no issues parking at any of the casinos and malls  Day trip to the dam and Green Valley was only about   hours total  and worth the trip to me  but my daughter was not impressed with driving that far to see a  Brick Wall  holding back water  She would have rather just shopped that day  Did the sign  They have a parking lot now  Guess enough people were killed running across the highway that they decided it would pay for a lot  Once you park  you pretty much get in line and the  tourist etiquette  takes over  You offer to take a picture of the person in front of you with their camera  and then you ask the people behind you to take one of you with your camera  and so on  Pretty much crammed all the tourist stuff we could into our trip for our daughter s sake  Volcano  Fountains  Conservatory  Sirens  Lions  Dolphins  M amp M World  Caesars Shops ect  We did see Cirque du Soleil KA at the MGM  I will put up another review of it  but we really liked it  I do have to add  that I thought the porn slappers did a very good job of pulling back when my wife and daughter went by  They did put them back out for me after they walked by  but hey  at least they have tact  Overall  we enjoyed our stay at the Embassy Suites and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone else  Feel free to PM me if you have any other questions  
P =>   Fantastic Staff  Nice Location  Great Vacation We re HHonors members  It took awhile to get into our room  Past check in time  But when we got it was just as we asked  on a high floor and a quiet room  Nice view of the city and the mountains  The next morning our tub backed up with very unappealing matter  but the front desk staff gave us another room to shower and dress in while they took care of our bathroom issues  The housekeeping was great  the front desk staff amazing  I heard more than one knucklehead complaining over silly things and they handled each complaint with grace and diplomacy  It was New Years Eve and the place was packed with all different types  The hotel is a typical embassy Suites with a very nice breakfast spread and atrium layout  The location is good and the front staff must have a way with the local cabbies because they show up within minutes  They even have a shuttle that they run back and forth to the strip hourly   which is not highly advertised  No charge We ll definitely stay here again  Great place but the staff made it fantastic  
P =>   A hidden gem for meetings and families with kids  I just returned from running a seminar at this hotel and I was very impressed with all aspects of service as well as the beautiful lobby  very well appointed meeting and sleeping rooms  the great indoor pool and the awesome full breakfast in the morning  We had some attendees just coming for the seminar and some were staying at the hotel and they were all very happy  My husband  one and four year old came with me and we stayed the weekend and I loved that we were close to the strip but in a very kid friendly  non smoking environment  We all took the monorail and did go to the strip one day and it was a very easy walk and I didn t feel that the neighborhood was bad at all  Also  I think that the indoor pool at the hotel is the only one in Las Vegas so if you are coming in the winter with kids  having the pool  a frig and microwave in the room as well as the full breakfast makes this the only choice for me in Las Vegas   now that I have been here  I wouldn t stay anywhere else  
P =>   Loved the Room   Think twice about the location and neighborhood The breakfast was great and the room was oversized and clean but the location of this hotel is less than ideal  There is no shuttle to the strip they just tell you to head down the block to catch the Monorail but the neightborhood is very scary and I wouldn t walk it at night  My vechile actually got broken into and the hotel didn t even care even though it was in their parking lot and under a light  They actually made me feel like it was my fault and have signs posted saying park at your own risk  What is that  Where else do I park  They obviously have a problem but won t do anythig about it  Now I m stuck with a      bill to fix my car  Thank you Embassy Suites  Do not recommend this hotel  
P =>   GREAT HOTEL BUT A BIT FAR OFF STRIP The Embassy suites is a lovely place to stay  the rooms are huge  we went with my    year old daughter  There is a bedroom with   queen sized beds  then a living room with a pull out sofa bed  chair  TV  fridge  microwave and kitchen area The breakfast was divine and is complimentary  It ranges from healthy fruit and yoghurt  cereals  bagel and muffins to eggs  sausages  bacon  waffles  pancakes    the list just goes on and on We walked to the strip on the first night and it took us    minutes  brisk walking  to the middle of the strip  The temperature was    degrees at  pm at night do it wasn t a pleasant walk  There is a shuttle that is literally   to    mins walk away that takes you to the strip but it costs    each for every trip so can become quite expensive  al so the station inside the hotels for the shuttle  takes you at least    mins from going in the hotel door to getting to the station to board the shuttle  you could have walked there by then  I love walking but with the heat and humidity it wasn t pleasant If I go to vegas again I would probably stay somewhere ont he stip or a little closer to the strip  
P =>  Great Place for Families We stayed here for   nights at the beginning and   night at the end of our vacation to Zion  Bryce  Page  Sedona and Grand Canyon  Perfect place for our family of   kids enjoyed a swim and although pool is small and indoors they just wanted to cool off  Breakfast included was a bonus Very helpful staff and clean through and through Good choice for off of the strip  
P =>  Typical embassy This was a typical Embassy Suites  Away from the Strip  this hotel offers a much more peaceful stay that is still within a couple blocks of the action  The stay got off to a bumpy start when the key card would not open the door   however  we went down to the desk and the problem was remedied easily  That was in fact our only complaint  because other than that the service was excellent and the room was spotless  The breakfast every morning is amazing  and I m sure there are not many places that can rival the selection offered there  especially considering it is free  All in all  great experience and definitely a good alternative  
P =>   Very very average Typical suites accomodation but service was very slow   took half an hour to get a TV remote and even longer for some simple room service  Breakfast was a real self service rush about but the omlettes were first class The pool is a massive dissapointment  small and indoors and the outside heated spa is even smaller  Not a place for those after a pool scene Hotel seems popular with resident and visting  mainly military  Brits who flock noisily to the free beer in the bar at five thirty  It is not exactly convenient for the strip and you will mount up taxi costs All in all very very average  it s OK but it will not be my first choice next time  
P =>   It is very close to the LVCC Fantastic staff    Everyone was really friendly and helpful  We were there for a convention at the Convention Center  The business center was nice  Great food for breakfast  No taxis to be found however  You have to call for a taxi and it may take a while  Not your usual smoky loud hotel in Vegas  It is a non gambling hotel so it would be more suitable for kids  I do agree with everyone on the sink and shower being really loud  You can hear everyone around you when you are in the bathroom  It was clean but it is dark in the room  Most people are not going to be hanging out in the room though  It is really close to the convention center and an easy walk  There is a little store next door  Not the worse area of town but not the nicest either 
P =>   Great place to stay     First time staying  off the strip   The Embassy suites Convention Center is ideally located just a few minutes walk from the monorail so access to the strip is easy  The hotel is modern and clean with huge rooms  Additionally  you get a full cooked breakfast to order as part of the cost of the room AND free drinks from           every day  My wife and I saved      at least over our    day stay   If you don t mind quiet rooms and no gambling in the hotel then this is the place for you   great brewery and restaurant about a mile down Paradise Road  
P =>  A Quiet Rest This hotel is off the strip and offers the sensitive traveler a quiet respite  Check in was impeccable and swift  the room was clean and comfortable  Breakfast was delicious  The only disappointment was my call to the Front Desk for more towels was either forgotten or ignored The hotel is located behind the Wynn and it s about a mile walk to the Wynn entrance  There is a Las Vegas Monorail station a   minute walk away  
P =>   This Embassy Suites is a little past its prime The bad points outweigh the good for this tired Embassy Suites about a mile from the Las Vegas strip  First the good    it is clean inside  I had no issues with housekeeping  It is quiet  I was not bothered by outside noise  And the wi fi is consistent  with a good signal  and as a Hiltons Honor member  there was no charge for it  But the bad points are numerous  The hotel is past its prime and the hot water roars like a bull when it s turned on  I am sure my early morning showers disturbed other guests  The entire time the water was running it sounded like a jet engine  The hot water handle on the bathroom sink came off in my hand and I had to screw it back on  The small refrigerator was turned off and smelly when we first checked in  and once I turned it back on it dripped annoyingly through the night and disturbed my sleep  The vending machine on my floor was not well stocked and would not take dollar bills for my entire stay  There are only two guest washing machines for a hotel with    guest floors  and I could never find one that wasn t being used  The hotel does not offer a shuttle to the Strip  so if you don t want to face Las Vegas traffic  you re limited to taking the monorail  calling a taxi  none hang around the Embassy Suites  or walking  And while there is a monorail station about four blocks away  the hotel is located in an area of Vegas that borders on seedy  and I would not recommend making that walk at night  Lastly  I found the hotel staff to be a little on the impatient side and not overly anxious to help with routine questions  Overall  a less than pleasant stay  
P =>  Highly Recommend Very nice hotel  Breakfast was great   Sleeping was quiet and comfortable  
P =>   Consistantly Embassy Suites This is not the place to stay if you want Vegas action  but that said  being in Vegas  it does have a more active and lively happy hour and bar than other Embassy Suites I have been in  which can be good or bad depending on your tolerance for the sound of people enjoying themselves echoing through the place  Especially if your room is close to the  rd floor Atrium  I didn t mind  and I liked the lively atmosphere The breakfast was better than other Embassy Suites I ve been to  It had more hot plate offerings  such as french toast and more diverse ingredients for the omelettes  The room service food was surprisingly excellent and affordable  The fitness room is small  three treadmills  a few mulit use weight machines that I didn t want to try to figure out what a couple of them were for  But nice and bright  with a view of the pool The rooms are looking slightly dated and are a little dark  I found myself utilizing every lamp as the bulbs weren t very bright and the color scheme was dark And the person that wrote about the fridge freezing everything was right on The front desk was super nice about allowing me a later than usual check out  The parking lot is convenient and while the hotel is off the beaten path  there is plenty nearby with a quick drive or walk to get to  
P => Pass Pass on this one  To far from anything with a very marginal cafe   staff was rude and unwilling to help  Checked out after one night  paid      a night  Checked into Hilton Grand Vacation Club at      Las Vegas Blvd   now that is a great place  and I paid      per night    
P =>  Our family s favorite hotel For a fmily of    with   teenage kids  this is the best place to rest  have a delicious breakfast  and even a  quot happy hour quot  complementary quot  
P =>  Didn t care for this place I almost hesitate to express my views here  as so many Trip Advisor posters seem enamored with this hotel  In fact  I booked this hotel based on the reviews I read here We d booked a room for five nights  but ended up checking out after the first night as the hotel just wasn t what we had in mind Yes  the suite concept is handy  and the happy hour and breakfast is a nice touch  However  it was difficult to get a drink due to the small bar area and the masses of people bellying up to the bar at Happy Hour  Breakfast was a similar mob scene  and while the food was tasty  the crowded breakfast area was a major drawback for us We also found the hotel noisy  as all the rooms face the atrium and the noise really travels Our room was in desperate need of an overhaul   it was dark and gloomyand the living area furniture was soiled and worn  The bathroom really needed some attention   the tile around the showercould have used a good scrub and repair   tiles were loose and some had fallen off  Chunks of grout were missing and the rest was just plain dirty  Thecold water spigot came off in our hands every time we turned the water on  and the toilet paper spent most of its time on the floor  as the dispenser was hanging from one nail Every time we turned on the water in the bathroom we were met with a loud howling noise from somewhere within the pipes The room left us with an overall impression of neglect and dinginess We were looking for a comfortable  quiet off strip hotel experience and this particular Embassy Suites didn t fit the bill  so we left andfound a cleaner  well maintained hotel in a much quieter  less chaoticarea Parking at the hotel wasn t a problem  but it was a bit of a pain to get in and out of their parking lot  as the monorail runs through hereand it s easy to miss the turn This hotel might work well for some  but it didn t work at all for us  
P =>  Typical Embassy Suites My wife and I generally choose Embassy SUites over other hotels  as wehave found them a great value  This ine is no different  Excellent happy hour  the bartenders are great and very friendly   Breakfast was very good  though you need to get there before  am to avoid the lines and have a place to sit in the atrium  If the atrium gets filled  they open one of the conference rooms  but there are no windows  Instead  take your food to the thrid floor and eat in the bar  also in the atrium  The rooms were the usual size for an ES  and had the usual amenities  including a microwave oven  If you keep milk the the fridge  turn the firdge to warmer or the milk will freeze  They use shower doors instead of curtains in the tub  thank you      but as with most hotels  the shower head isn t quite sufficient for a good rinse  When will hotels stop putting flow restrictors in the shower heads  They do not save water  It takes x amount of water to remove x amount of soap  It can be done in    seconds or     seconds  but it is still the same amount fo water  There was a tiny bit of mildew stain on the tub calulking along the door  Generally the batroom was in pretty good shape  not perfect  like        We would stay there again  
P =>   Bravo    Best Embassy Suites I have ever stayed at  We came up for Thanksgiving week and spend     nights there  We love staying at Hiltons and Embassy Suites is our favorite of the chain  We booked one of the rooms with the large balcony  Anyone can book this room it just costs more and they are limited as they are the top       levels only  Most of the other rooms had a smaller balcony  but are cheaper   This balcony we had was huge   probably as big as our room  two lounges    chairs  two tables  our toddler could ride her tricycle with plenty of room  The room didn t seem to be upgraded any other way  but it was clean and nice  The breakfast was very good and kept us from oversleeping mornings  If we made it the manager reception was good  better then at most Embassy Suites   The staff we encountered were nice  Our cleaning person was nice  and they don t try to get out of cleaning your room each day  They keep a good watch and get you when you leave the room  You don t see them they just clean  I would leave notes with tips as I deemed and were all completed  They even tucked in my daugthers doll  It was nice to stay away from the stip with the kids and there are four daycare centers in    miles and two closer then   miles  I give my best recomedations to this hotel     
P =>  awesome awsome rooms really comfy and spacious  the atmosphere is nice and still close to everything esp  if your in town for a convention  
P =>   Best Hotel off the Strip We stayed   nights  Mon Fri in ober  after a wonderful road trip through Arizona  If you are looking for quiet place to relax  then this is the one for you  The hotel was in good condition  the rooms were spacious with a living room  large chair  sofa sleeper  TV  table and chairs  plenty of counter space  we used the mini frig  coffee pot and microwave every day  The bedroom had   double beds and TV  The majority of their rooms face either north or south  We were on the   th floor    floors total  and faced north  A beautiful view of the Hilton  Stratosphere and surrounding hills  Noise was never a problem  If you don t have a car  then it is quite a hike to the strip  We drove to all the major casinos  nearly all have free parking and elevators that take you right into the casino  of course   The breakfast was great  a large selection  The only problem during the work week is that they close at       The manager s reception is a plus  they have plenty of snacks and appetizers  hot and cold  The bar area was kept very clean  Yes  it does get crowded so get there right at         or take your beverages to your roomWe found the hotel staff very pleasant and gave us a late checkout with no problems The only down side is that the hotel pool is indoors and being from the wet Pacific Northwest  even the sun in ober makes you want to sit out  They have a large hot tub and chairs outdoors for the sunbathers  It would have been nice to be able to swim in the sun  The entire hotel is non smoking  another plus for us I would definately recommend this hotel and would stay again  
P =>   How perfect can a hotel be  We stayed at the Embassy Suites for    days from tember    to ober   and everthing was absolutely perfect  We have stayed at some of the worlds top hotels such as the Peninsula in Hong Hong or the Imperial in Vienna and never have we been treated with such sincere courtesy and comfort  After an unfortunate initial experience with the front desk associate   Amanda  we were immediately taken over by Rickey who had us settled in our room in a matter of minutes  The room was the usual Embassy suite comfortable bed and totally sound proof with central air conditioning  two TV s  fridge and microwave in the living area  The room was spotless as was the bathroom  Towels soap and bath ammenities were first class  Breakfast was terrific especially the made to order waffles  If you eat in the Grill Room try the hamburger as it is the best I have ever had  The prime rib is to die for as is the pasta and we shared each of these dishes  ia is a super waitress Happy hour s  are well attended and say hello to Tad at the bar to see what NFL team he is going with this week  We used the pool almost every day as the temp  was in the high    s and it was always spotless as was the outdoor huge hottub and tanning area Supervisor Angelo Lim always seemed to be around ensuring that the guests were well taken care of and several times went out of his way to assist us  It was a pleasure to be off the strip and to have lots of on grounds parking which was never a problemWe cannot think of a single thing to complain about as our entire stay was simply wonderful  I should also mention that the houskeeping was great  We requested that our room be serviced every day before   PM and they never missedWe then moved to the so called   star Ritz Carlton for two nights at Lake Las Vegas and what a dissapointment after the Embassy Suites We already booked the Embassy for next ruary and can t wait to go back  
P =>    nd stay Enjoyed staying at this location off the Strip last year so decided to stay again this trip with our    year old son  Our suite on the  th floor would have been a little cramped with our son sleeping on the sofa bed so we asked for a larger corner suite  No problem   we were given one on the  rd floor  It was next to the restroom for the bar  but as the bar closes at   pm it was never a problem  The staff at this hotel are very helpful  the breakfast buffet is excellent and sets you up until the evening  
P =>  An Oasis in Vegas We stayed at the Embassy Suites from    t to          We were very impressed   First of all  the Hotel is all non smoking  a huge bonus to us non smokers There is no Casino which to us was another bonus  After being out on the town for most of the day and evening it was a delight to return to the tranquil atmosphere of the hotel You are only a seven minute walk to the mono rail and can be on the strip in   minutes Being a relatively small hotel there were no crowds to contend with  I dont think we ever waited more than    seconds for an elevator   The suite we had         was spacious  very clean and quiet The staff are very efficient and politeBreakfast is included and was delicious The nightly Managers cocktail party was another bonus  kudos to the staff who run the bar in such an efficient and friendly manner There would be no question as to where we shall stay whenever we vist Las Vegas  The Embassy Suites is truly an Oasis in the middle of such a fast paced and busy city Go there  you will be pleased with your decision    
P =>   Outstanding Value Booked at the Embassy Suites for a Saturday and Sunday in tember  My wife and I were in Vegas to see a couple of shows but the rates for the major casino hotels were pretty outrageous  especially for Saturday  Embassy s rate       night  was favorable and the Trip Advisor reviews were generally very good  so we made our reservation Our experience was excellent overall  The rooms are currently being updated and are very attractive  The service from the staff was top notch  The hotel is very well maintained  Embassy is just a few minutes drive from the Strip and offers a complimentary shuttle to the casinos  We would definitely stay here again  
P =>  Good off the Strip option This is a good location pretty close to both the Strip and downtown Las Vegas  I like the fact that there is absolutely no gambling in the hotel  it s a nice change from everywhere else in town  The manager s reception was pretty nice  and they had some nice snack options  The area is small and can get filled pretty quickly  The breakfast was good  the omelets were great  My daughters didn t really like their muffins  though  The staff was nice and very helpful  Our room was nice enough  but there was a little mildew around the shower  Oh  and the sink made an awful noise when turned on  Not a big deal  but I think they are getting due for a renovation  We had room service one night  and the food was good and came pretty quickly Overall  it was a good value for the location and the class of hotel  We d most likely stay again  
P =>  Needs some updating but a good value in Vegas I stayed at this property for one night  I have not stayed at an Embassy Suites before The front desk person was very friendly and helpful  Parking was easy and free  My room was very big  larger than the apartment I lived in during school Bottled water was waiting for me in my room which was nice  The breakfast had great coffee and a popular made to order omlette bar The room is somewhat rundown which detracted from my stay  The AC was making weird banging noises for part of the night  The walls are quite thin  I could hear the telephone ringing in the next room  
P =>   Pretty good place all things considered It s clean  it s quiet  it s smoke free  The breakfast in the morning was very good  The afternoon complementary snacks and drinks are okay  The food consists of nachos  popcorn and a snack mix  We did not eat lunch or dinner at this hotel so I cannot comment on the restaurant  The decor was a bit above the usual Embassy Suites  When I asked for early maid service they were more than happy to oblige  The wireless internet connection was very good  I was a bit surprised that there was a charge for local calls  I think it s good that there is not a slot machine or other game of chance in the building  If you want to gamble  it s not the place for you  In the summer  it s probably advisable to have a car since the monorail station is not that close  Being from the northwest I am not used to    F  temperatures and I found it difficult walking in the heat  Thrifty has cheap rental cars and there is always lots of parking near or on the strip  Would I stay here again  In a heartbeat    
P =>   Nice place to stay with family I stayed here while on a business trip  My son and husband also came along  Very nice hotel  The complimentary breakfast is awesome  Nice variety and saves money on breakfast  The pool is quite small  not too big  The Manager s reception in the evening is okay  I don t drink alcohol  so it wasn t a big attraction for me  The snack was always nachos and cheese and chex mex  The hotel gets a little noisy when the reception is going on in the evening  Otherwise  it is fairly quiet  It is a nice place off the strip  Overall  I would recommend it for someone who wants to be away from all the glitz on the strip and have a nice place to stay  The internet is not free in the hotel rooms  but there are two PC s in the lobby area that can be used for free  The front desk staff seemed pretty helpful and knowlegeable too  
P =>  Quiet smoke free hotel I chose this off strip hotel because it is smoke free  which was a welcome relief at night  Our room and bathroom was very clean and the layout with two rooms  a living room and a separate bedroom  is great if one person wants to take a nap while someone else wants to work on a laptop or watch some TV in the living room Be sure to remember a cable to access the high speed internet  I forgot mine  and there is a       charge per day for wireless access in the rooms  Another important thing to know is that there are no in room safes available here  I tried to check in my laptop at the front desk  but their safe is too small for my thin and light laptop so I had to end up lugging it around  didn t want it to fry in the car   So I suggest bringing a laptop lock if you want to keep it in your room There is no hair conditioner provided  so bring your own and don t assume that it will be supplied  The made to order omelettes were a hit with my family  but the pastries donuts weren t very good  Our room was right next to the elevator and you can hear it running up and down  so if you want more peace and quiet ask for a room that isn t directly next to the elevators  
P =>   Definitely one of the best off strip options   A little apprehensive ahead of arrival as have previously stayed on the strip  at Luxor  However  the benefit of The Suites is that it s situation is no more out of the way than Luxor  Mandalay Bay or similar and the monorail station which links this and the neighbouring Renaissance to the Strip is about   mins walk   exit reception and turn right  infront of the convention centre What to say  great hotel  very modern  bright atrium reaching    floors high and very welcoming ambience  with a cafe   restaurant on the ground floor  as well as a mid size indoor pool  plus a bar on the first floor balcony  Our room was on        as high as you can go and wonderful views  even not over the strip itself  Watch out for LAS air traffic turning right on final approach  just outside your window  but not a hint of aircraft noise  Suites are HUGE and ours had a sizeable lounge with atrium view  kitchenette  very nice bathroom and a wonderful bedroom looking over the city  All staff were pleasant and swift in attention  very helpful should you need their assistance  parking out front is included in the rate  What s more   the price puts this as maybe the most attractive hotel in its class in all of Las Vegas     a definite winner for us and should we be back in Vegas soon  I d definitely book the Embassy Suites once more A plus for car rental users  the hotel is on Paradise Rd  exactly   mins from the airport terminal without a need to turn left or right  
P =>   A good Embassy Suites The rooms are standard ES layout  but decorated and furnished a notch above most other ES I ve stayed in  I noticed the atrium area is smaller than most  causing some congestion at breakfast  although they have a second buffet set up in a meeting room for the overflow   This does not affect ROOM size  just the atrium  Also the managers reception in the evenings is in a small area with too few tables seats  I just skipped it  I m on the   th  top  floor and the AC is fine  can hear noise in the atrium from the living room  can t hear a thing from the bedroom  Walking to the strip is quite possible if you like walking  good    mins   Just take Sands westbound and you pop out between Wynn and Venetian  would be uncomfortable in summer though   Overall I would gladly stay here again anytime  
P =>   Good Off StripNon Smoking Option I spent two nights at this property last week with my wife and adult daughter  The facility is well maintained with ample free parking  The rooms are spacious and quiet  The monorail runs right down Paradise Road in front of the property but the nearest station is at the Convention Center  You certainly can walk to the Strip from this property but I would suggest driving your car and parking at The Venetian or The Wynn which are both minutes away and easy to get to There is a very excellent business center with two computer terminals in the lobby  The breakfast area was clean and well maintained with multiple choices  The indoor pool is of reasonable size but the outdoor hot tub is spacious I think that this is a good choice if you want a non smoking facility off the Strip and have a car at your disposal  
P =>   Great Find in Las Vegas Grabbed one night at the Embassy Suites The hotel is in great shape  the room was spacious and clean They offer a free breakfast and a free happy hour in the evening No casino at this hotel  Quiet location  They have a pool but it s not a Vegas pool scene  This hotel is close enough for those adventurous and in decent shape to walk to the strip   Takes about    minutes   I walked in the    degree heat  For one reason or another  I ve stayed at most of the hotels on the strip  The accomodations at this Embassy Suites are as good  if not better  than many on the strip For Vegas convention goers  this hotel is certainly far ahead of the Las Vegas Hilton Only drawback was a Guest Services clerk who was somewhat difficult when asked about a late check out  
P =>   Great value and extras as well  Great value  I was concerned with some bad reviews but some people just love to complain  This hotel offers free high speed internet   can t even get that at Ceasar s  large fridge  and even free bottled water  Check in was prompt and if you want a no smoking room just reserve a king suite as they are all non smoking  Bring your own DO NOT DISTURB sign for the door they check rooms at  AM  Only minor problem was therre is only one ice machine and it runs out of ice and then the bar is quick to fill your ice bucket just ask  The casino is small no like there aren t others right out the door though a slot machine is the same everywhere  
P =>  Great break from the strip My husband and I needed a one night stay in Las Vegas as were were traveling on to Arizona  This Embassey Suites was great  There is no slot machines or smoking which was one of the reasons I chose them  They have a business center with two computers in it  The front desk was wonderful with directions  quick check in and check out  Breakfast was great  a typical Embassey Suites  They have a small gift shop on the main floor  There is a fun water fountain in the lobby  Our room was very nicely furnished  Our king size bed was very comfortable  It was a little warm in our room and no way to control  I think the front desk can control room temperatures  I enjoyed the fact is was off the stip and was quiet  It was and easy drive to The Venitian  Parking there is free from the back streets  There was a pool area  we did not have time to use it so I can not advise on it  If you are looking for an off strip hotel this one is nice and close enough to drive to everything  
P =>  Great Hotel The hotel was great  except for one day  Newer hotel  rooms are great  The only problem we had was with the air conditioner  One night      AM  we woke up in a pool of sweat  The air conditioner decided to turn it self off and turn on the heater  When we woke up the room was at    degrees  We called the front desk and I guess that this has happened several times because he had a sheet of a paper with directions on what to do  The only other problem was with the room key not working  They told me not to have the key next to my cell phone  If you read some of my reviews this is an event that has happened to me during the entire month of il  The breakfast was great as was the manager special  This is the first time that I had chilli cheese fries at the manager night  This hotel is faces the back of the Venetian  Wynn  The monorail runs right in front of the hotel  but to catch the monorail you will need to drive to the station  I think the reservation desk tells you that there is a shuttle from the hotel to the airport  but the hotel will only take you to the airport  
P =>  Loved it  My wife and I stayed at this hotel from ch       and enjoyed mostly everything about it  the location is great   not too far off of the strip  we rented a car for the weekend so it was not a problem to get to the strip and back  I would recommend renting a car versus taking the monorail or walking because the monorail is not that close to the hotel and parking is free all over the strip The happy hour was fantastic and so was the breakfast  The only downside about the breakfast was the line got a little long  but it moved fairly fast  Plenty of choices and they kept bringing food and more food when it was getting low The hot tub is huge  We didn t use the pool   so can t really comment on that  The rooms were big and the beds were comfortable  The only downside was our room smelt like smoke  It was a  quot non smoking quot  room but clearly there was smoke in there  It didn t really bother us after a few mintues so we just stayed in the same room Everything in the hotel was really clean and nice  I would say it was above average for the typical Embassy Suites  It was nice to be a little of the strip to receive a break from the lights  people  and casinos I will definitely stay here again  
P =>  Glad to have stayed here I was in the riott Courtyard on Paradise Rd  and was so disappointed that I moved after the the first night  The Embassy Suites Hotel Convention Center was bright  clean and inviting  A complimentary happy hour was offered every evening and a full breakfast iwas served in the morning  I was very pleased with my stay here  
P =>  Great Place The Embassy Suites hotel is fantastic  QUIET      Great morning buffet type breakfast  great large outside hot tub  plenty of room in the suite  I d highly recommend it  The higher the rooms   the better  Also stay away from the lower floors     near the front because of the nightly noise caused by the manager s reception and stay away from the first   floors in the rear of the hotel due to the free breakfast area  
P =>  Sin City Fun Embassy Suites    what else can you say  Actually  this is a nice set up There are some pluses and minuses  For the pluses    a convienent place to stay if you are involved with a convention  The happy hour  complimentary  has a nice spread of appetizers  not just chips or pretzals  The sun through the atrium might be a problem if you are facing the front of the hotel but it does light up the rest of the hotel  The breakfast  as with most Embassy s  is good  Seating is adequate and there is a TV to catch CNN or ESPN or what ever is on  The rooms are decent with the normal suite set up  small refrigerator  microwave  sink  and living room and bedroom   The hotel is not very noisy which is a plus For the minuses    you are not on the strip  It is a very long walk to the strip  You are better off walking to the convention center        minute walk  and catching the monorail to the strip  The pool is indoor s and not much compared to the set up of the pools at the top casino s  Parking can be difficult depending on how full the hotel is  If you have a gambling fix    there are no slots or tables at this hotel Overall  I still enjoy staying at the Embassy s  If you are a Hilton Honor s member you can even check in online    hours before hand and select your room  Good luck travelers    and even better luck to you gamblers  
P =>   nice hotel away from the glitz but close enough for fun stayed here for business        th        Overall a very decent place  friendly staff  convenient location  no problems at all  Because I work Las Vegas frequently  I m not a big gambler and have seen most of the sights  This hotel is a nice change of pace  no slot machines in the lobby like the majority of most establishments in LV  The rooms are nice  as with all Embassy Suites  it was a   room suite  the bedding was comfortable  the mini fridge was handy for my soft drinks I usually have on the road  the breakfast was very good  fresh prepared omelets and other selections  The location is fair to good  It is on Paradise road which is just east of the strip  it s not an area I would recommend to walk around in late at night like you can on the strip  but I felt safe and secure  It is very convenient for those visiting the Las Vegas Convention center  I didn t have business at the convention center this particular trip but I have stayed at other hotels in LV when attending conventions and it s either a cab fare  monorail ride  or long painful walk   Not so from this Embassy Suites  I did go out one night  walked to convention center monorail station  caught a free shuttle to the new Wynn Resort  WOW    then walked south on the strip to Paris Bally s then caught the LV monorail back to hotel which is a   minute walk from the convention center monorail station  Something I always rate a hotel by is the quality of their internet connection that I need for work  I easily connected wireless and had an  quot excellent quot  connection from my  th floor suite  Overall a nice stay  I would recommend this hotel for anyone not needing a gambling casino on site  
P =>   Great place off the strip We recently stayed at this hotel from              The room was huge  Every room is a two room suite  which would be great for family  I can t comment on the housekeeping because we kept the  do not disturb  sign on the door because we didn t require new sheets or towels for a few nights stay  The full complimentary breakfast every morning was great  made to order omelettes  potatoes  bacon  scrambled eggs  etc  were all included with beverages  Definitely worth getting up for  The only drawback to this hotel is the location  If you plan to spend a lot of time on the strip  you ll need transportation because it is not within walking distance  We utilized taxis and the monorail mainly  but it became pretty costly  The Las Vegas Convention Center was within walking distance  however  this is also the nearest monorail stop  
P =>  Off the Strip but convenient to Monorail Stayed here in early ember for three nights  Typical Embassy Suites property  maybe near the top of the range for this brand in terms of overall condition of rooms and hotel  If you are a Hilton Hhonors member  this is maybe one of the better choices in town Location is on Paradise Road  which runs parallel to the Strip  LV Blvd   It is an easy    minute walk north to the Convention Center monorail station  and an additional   minutes to reach the north hall of the Convention Center  We found it convenient enough for our leisure trip  Tip  across from the monorail station at the SW corner of Paradise and Desert Inn roads is the waiting area for the Wynn shuttle  Our room had a small balcony just wide enough to stand on and get some fresh air  Rooms at the end of the halls on  th and   th floors have gigantic balconies with lounge chairs  If you are an Hhonors Diamond member  you might ask to be placed there Property attracts business travelers and families  Considering the free breakfast and happy hour  it s a good value alternative to a casino property on the strip especially if you are renting a car anyway  Monorail is    one way  buy a two ride ticket for      two people can use it   or a taxi to mid strip  Paris  is      
P =>   Great free extras   We spent a night here over the weekened and the price was excellent compared to those a mile away on the strip  Located close to a Monorail station and with comfortable rooms this is a wise budget decision  The best thing about hte hotel is that from     pm to     pm they have free drinks  anything you want  and bar snacks pretzels nachos  for all residents  A great way to start off your Vegas evening and the hearty breakfast is well recommended for when you return the next morning  
P =>  Great Breakfast  It s nothing fancy like some of the big resort casino on the strip  The   bedroom suite is   star quality  Not nice  but at least it was clean  The sofabed needs to be replaced since it s very bouncy and I could feel the springs  The included breakfast was really good  They make omlettes by order and there re plenty of other hot items  
P =>  Great Hotel In Vegas If you want to enjoy all vegas has to offer  then sleep well at night  stay at the Embassy Suites at the convention center  The hotel is very clean  quite and the breakfast is great for a pleasant start to the day To enjoy this hotel  rent a car and drive to all of the hotels on the strip plus downtown at night  Once your night is over  drive over to paradise road and over to your hotel  It is very safe to park on the lot and there is a convenience store next door to get any beverages you need Hotel staff will not go out of there way for you but who cares  you are in vegas  Cechis in is the only time you will deal with them  and that takes less than   minutes compared to   hour on the strip Have all of your tourist information before you go or get somewhere else in vegas  hotel has none and staff acts like the do not live in vegas Remember  rent a car  it only cost about        per day at thrifty p s  get a convertable you will be glad you did 
P =>   Good Off The Strip Value We spent three nights at this hotel and we enjoyed our experience  The hotel was clean and neat  although the carpeting was being replaced in the hallways during our stay  the rooms were spacious and comfortable  and the hotel staff was friendly and helpful  Each evening  from            there was a free happy hour at the  rd floor bar  serving beer  a limited selection of mixed drinks  and snack foods  like chips and salsa  popcorn  and snack mix  Each morning  the free breakfast buffet offered make to order omelets  other hot foods  and fresh fruit  Both the breakfast buffet and the happy hour were great perks and popular ways to start the day and the evening While this hotel is off the Strip  a short cab ride and         with tip  can quickly get you to any on the Strip hotel  The front desk staff were very helpful and ready to call a cab for us at any time Our one  big disappointment was in the pool at this hotel  It was small  indoors  and not at all what we were expecting  There was a small hot tub type pool outdoors  but we didn t spend any time at either  Instead  we went to another hotel s pool to enjoy the type of experience that we were hoping for but didn t get at the Embassey Suites  Overall  we enjoyed our stay in this quiet  clean  friendly hotel  If you are looking for the excitement of the Strip  then this hotel may not be for you  There are no casinos or shopping in this hotel so you will need to go to the Strip to enjoy those activities  but if you are looking for a more laidback  easy going vacation in Las Vegas then this is the hotel for you  
P =>  loved the Embassy Suites Spent three nights at the embassy suites and would thoroughly recommend it to anyone  Large  modern suite with huge balcony overlooking the Strip and beyond  Panoramic views from the bedroom  Good value room service  Generous happy hour  Plentiful and varied breadfast   although too little wholeweat for European tastes   Good value cab ride to the Strip  cabs always available    minute walk to the mono rail  Excellent  cheerful staff and wonderful location  an oasis of calm after the bustle of the Strip  Very good value   Excellent calming water feature in lobby  Well done Embassy Suites  Paradise Road  
P =>  Great Value  I was pleasantly surprised during my stay  My room was great  I like the separate livingroom bedroom concept  The beds were great  The bathrooms were fantastic and huge  I dined in the restaturant for breakfast and dinner and got a great meal each time  The only thing I didn t like  which had nothing to do with the hotel  was the time it took to get a taxi  It was a great value for the price  I would stay there again  
P =>  Great choice Great choice  We had a top floor suite with large balcony which had views over the Wynn s golf course towards the Strip and the mountains beyond  The rooms were well appointed and clean  The staff were helpful and quick to help  The water feature in the foyer has seating around it which guests like  The breakfast buffet sets you up for the day with a range of cooked and cold foods  
P =>  A Nice Escape    Needed a short escape and chance to introduce a friend to Las Vegas  without all the gaming and noise  This hotel definately fit the bill  Safe  comfortable and convenient to the Strip without being on it The staff was excellant and helpful with a couple of minor problems that could have quickly turned into serious ones The room was clean and well appointed  The beds were very comfortable and there was enough space for five adults Attractive interiors but not showy and free of gaming  this hotel not only deserves but guarantees a return visit  
P =>  Wonderful stay at the Embassy We were looking for a non gaming hotel near the strip for our brief visit to Las Vegas  We found the perfect establishment at the Embassy Convention Center on Paradise Road  They were very helpful and friendly whenever we needed assistance and the room was very big and comfortable  It was just like being at home  We had a  rd floor room  with   queen size beds  as well as a living room with a sleeper sofa  The   TV s came in handy as our grandson could watch what he wanted and the wife and I could watch what we wanted The prize of our stay was the free breakfast buffet  They had eggs to order  bacon  sausages  potatoes as well as a bunch of other continental items  Go early to beat the business crowd The hotel is near the strip  but not as crowded  You should get a car if you can as the walk to the other places can be far  The monorail is down the road  but it is a generous walk  It is located near the airport  Paradise Road runs straight to the airport  maybe   minutes away Overall  we enjoyed our stay and will definitely stay there again  
P =>  Typical Embassy Visit Stayed there for CES  if you are going to the convention center  consider this property  The front door is   minutes from the convention center and a safe walk in daylight or dark  I had a room with a balcony that overlooked the Wynn      a round golf course  Not too difficult getting a cab to the strip and the steakhouses at the Renaissance and Ruth Chris are in walking distance  
P =>  End of a Perfect Trip We had just completed a whirl wind trip thru the southern end of Utah and finished the visit off by staying at the Embassy Suite hotel  The rooms were large and comfortable  The breakfast was very good and free  We will stay here again if we end up in Vegas  We stayed at the MGM Grand at the start of the trip and were very disapointed  
P =>   The walk is farther than you think    This is a nice  clean hotel  But be warned  when you view the location on a map it looks like it will be located a lot closer to The Strip than it actually is  We attended a Convention at the Sands Expo Center and we thought we could walk it everyday  No way  Between the actual walking distance to the Expo Center and having to dodge traffic because of the lack of sidewalks  we took a taxi to the Expo Center everyday    about     each way   The Embassy Suites shuttle will drop you off at Harrah s  which I did once  If you are lucky they will let you jump out as you pass the Sand s Expo Center  That was an adventure   in high heels What I liked about the hotel was  it was nice to come back to a quiet hotel room after spending the day on The Strip  The daily breakfast was also a plus  We were able to grab a quick bite to eat and arrive at the Sand s Expo as it opened in the morning If I drive myself out to Las Vegas for the next Convention I would stay at Embassy Suites  If I fly again  I will be looking for a hotel a little closer to The Expo Center  
P =>  Consistent Quality This hotel is a place to feel safe at which is important to us while staying in Vegas The rooms are spacious  as they make your beds and replenish your towels everyday  We left our mp  player on the table when we left the room for the day and came back that night and it was still there to no suprise The staff seem to really care about your every need Also  this hotel is also about value especially when it comes to the free breakfast and cocktail hour every day  The food is great and the cocktail hour does include some premium liquor  If you are looking for plush  elaborate art and decor and a lot of glitz and glamour  this is not the hotel to stay at  However If you like to come back to a clean  quiet hotel after being out all day then you may want to consider booking a trip here We saw reviews that people were complaining about having to wait forever for a taxi  You will have to wait alittle longer because this hotel is slightly off the beaten track  but we never in the   days we were there waited more than    minutes You may want to call or go downstairs to let the front desk know ahead of time that you need a taxi only if you are insistant that a taxi is there for you right away when you come downstairs We would definetly stay at Embassy Suites again if there is one available in the area of our next trip location  
P => Very Typical Embassy     I am a Hilton chain kind of traveler  Diamond to be exact  and this property is about what i come to expect for Embassy Suites     it is overall clean and acceptably maintained  yet nickel and diming at every opportunity  for instance the business center and internet access is over priced  They use the same internet provider as McDonald s which is free wireless at Ronald s with a happy meal purchase  about    yards up the road  also  Sprint provides free wifi access at the mono rail station for the true junkie Downside to this adventure is the location for other than conventions  There is no shuttle service and it is a hike to even the monorail about a mile up the road  The tourist maps suggest the strip is a block away  and yep    it s a really LONG block  Cab rides from to anywhere are    bucks minimum with tip  and getting a cab to the hotel at times is quite a challenge Upside is the price was on the lower end for this time of year  the breakfast bar was well stocked with variety and plentiful fresh food  For me  this being a non gaming property  it was quiet and peaceful after coming in to get more money from the lock box If I were asked  would I stay here again  even when the last night morning there was NO  hot water   I would never say never  For conventions it is a decent location  but for pleasure  I would pick another property  
P =>  Great off Strip Hotel Stayed here for   nights Room was much larger than the average Embassy Suites on the  th floor with great views of the valley Breakfast was well organised and not too crowded Check in was swift and staff were professional and accomodating The only negative aspect about this hotel is the small indoor swimming pool but you don t ususlly go to Vegas to spend time in the pool Given the opportunity I will most likely stay here again  
P =>  Better than the Rio We have stayed at the Rio maybe six times in the last ten years  However we just spent one night at the Embassy Suites at the Las Vegas Convention Center and they have my business from now on  The price was lower       versus over      for a Saturday night   They let us book for only one night instead of an obligatory two on the weekend  We were passing through Vegas on our way from Colorado back home to southern California We love Embassy Suites anyway because we have two kids     and    and really enjoy the separate rooms and TV s  the breakfast and happy hour  We actually ended up at the wrong Embassy Suites because there are two within a mile of each other  The atrium is very pretty and our room on the   th floor had a great view of the city  The problem  for some  is that there is no casino on site  no shows or Voodoo lounge  But you don t have to walk through    minutes of lobby to get to your car and the check in took   minutes rather than    minutes of waiting in line  The Rio Suites are not real suites but just a bigger room  I do like their sandy bottom pool versus the indoor pool of the Embassy Suites  
P =>   I will never stay on the strip again   The Embassy Suites was wonderful  Great breakfast buffet with cooked to order eggs  great pool and jacuzzi  and the happy hour was a nice touch  The room was great  We were on the   th floor  overlooking the airport to the south   Lots of private jets coming and going    The bed was comfortable  The suite was roomy  We had no problem with the room being made up early  as was stated by another reviewer  My only complaint was that the internet is wired and cost        per day  Wireless is only available on the first floor  Just a note  it is NOT close enough to easily walk to the strip  We had a car and the parking lot was fine and well lit  It was a very short drive to the strip  I will definitely stay there every time I go to Vegas  
P =>   Not bad for the money Stayed ther on busines for one night in il  Basically an average Embassy hotel  Comes with the standard suite room and complimentary breakfast which was fine  I m Diamond VIP at Hilton so I don t know if I got an upgraded room or not  The room condition was fine  The downside for those who aren t familiar with Vegas is the area  The hotel is in a seedy part of Paradise Road  Need to excercise caution when walking around the area  Its also not on the regular cab routes so I waited about    minutes for a cab in the morning and ended up grabbing one that had just dropped off a faire  
P =>  Nice conveniently located We were there on business at the Sands Convention Center which was only a few blocks away  The cook to order breakfast was good and plentiful  The best part was the honesty and helpfulness of the staff when I left   bags of jewelry worth several hundred dollare and several items of clothing  They found everything and sent it off the next day  I was so thankful for their efficiency and integrity  You can be sure that we will stay there on our next trip  
P =>   Always consistent Regarding the previous posting by the person who was upset because the hotel did not have the beds made until   or  pm     quit being so nit picky  These are not your motel   sized rooms here     they take a lot of extra time in each room so  yes  it DOES take extra time to do each floor     they are doing the empty rooms   vacated   first so that these can be turned around for arrivals  Standard procedure in any hotel  Give them a   rating just for that  Sheesh  I have absolutely no reservations about recommending this hotel to anyone  It is a first rate place  and I come back to it even if the stay is not work related  I send out    employees to this hotel for    days each il for the last   years and have never  never  never had a single problem with this hotel  Guest services has always been curteous and kind  the breakfasts are excellent  the evenings  free drink get together is always pleasant  AND  since there are not any slots in the building  there is NOT the constant ding ding ding of slot machines  Only complaint is that getting a taxi sometimes is a pain since they are off the strip  Plan ahead by about    minutes since it takes that long to get a taxi to the hotel  especially on a Friday or Saturday evening    in which case you can usually expect a    minute wait  The new monorail has an access point a   minute walk away in front of the convention center  so for     it s a lot easier to get to the strip than taxi     back as well  or you can buy a day or weekend pass  
P =>  Great Stay Last ember we spent four nights at this hotel  I loved it  great room  free full breakfast and easy parking  
P =>  Convenient and Family Friendly We just returned from our trip to Hawaii via Las Vegas  On the way out we stayed at the Embassy Suites Convention Center   it was perfect  With four children  we quite often stay at Embassy Suites  and although this was one of the smaller suites we have stayed in  it had the usual exceptional amenities  It was clean  quiet  and away from the strip   a bonus in our opinion  The breakfast is always a treat  and in this case the food was fresh with quite a variety of choices  Staff was helpful and friendly  A very good value for families  
P => one night at Embassy Suites We stayed one night at the Embassy Suites Convention Centre on       The internet rate was only        including breakfast  The value for that date was outstanding  considering that the strip hotels had already boosted their rates for new year s  The suite was spacious and clean  and even had a small balcony with a view of the monorail and the strip  Breakfast was almost as good as the buffet we had the day previous at Treasure Island  
P =>  Great for those with children and savings on breakfast What an excellent choice we made  We stayed at both of these great hotels  The one closer to the airport was a lot nicer and newer  Our room was very good and the breakfast saved us from having to take our three grandchildren out every morning  The breakfast buffet was beyond our belief  What a great assortment and if they didn t have it made  they graciously cooked whatever we wanted to our specifications  Didn t have to take the little ones through all the crowded mobs in the bigger gambling casinos  The one closer to the airport is within a block of the Hard Rock and another casino so we could just walk there  Would take us to the strip and pick us up  Didn t even need a car  Beds very comfortable and room for more people on the queen couch comfortable also  Great vacation  Thanks to the Embassy Suites staff  
P =>  Would stay there again  We stayed at the Embassy Suites Convention Ctr y    amp   nd  This hotel is part of the Hilton chain and it shows  The suites are beautifully decorated and impeccable  The whole hotel smells clean  There is no casino in the hotel so it is relaxing and quiet  The staff was very helpfull The generous all you can eat breakfast  included  is delicious  The only negative part would be the pool  It is a small indoor pool with nothing special compared to other pools we ve seen in other Las Vegas hotels  I would definetly recommend this hotel at the     night rate that we got  
P =>  Not as quiet as anticipated I thought the Embassy Suites would cater more to business travelers but the weekends were packed with family reunions and the weekdays were still busy with family travelers  The rooms all face the inside lobby and people often shout from floor to floor  The morning  quot Cook to order quot  breakfast was very good and had a large variety of foods  The staff was nice and helpful and the rooms were generally clean  There is a nightly manager s reception in the  rd floor bar area which also overlooks the lobby and adds to the noise level after a busy day  The indoor pool is located on the  st floor so the smell of chlorine is powerful at times and you can hear the kids screaming from the pool area   My room was located on the  th floor so may be quiter if you get a higher floor     
P => An excellent choice We held our family reunion     rooms  at this hotel the weekend of e        they gave us what we considered a very fair rate  considering that it was a weekend  We were very pleased  as the suites were clean and pleasant  the complimentary breakfast was excellent  and the staff was very accommodating  The lobby is beautiful and was a great place for various members of our family to gather and visit informally  My husband and I also had lunch at the on site restaurant two afternoons  and thought it was good  This hotel is away from the noise and crowds of the Strip  yet close enough to go there easily  The only negative is that the pool is indoors  and is small  However there is an outdoor spa It is hard to please all members of such a diverse group as our  but that is exactly what happened  Everyone agreed that this was a good choice  and a key component in the success of our reunion  I definitely would recommend this hotel to any individual  family or group  
P => An excellent choice  
P =>  A Nice Surprise  
P => Nice Place Consider Staying Here for a Convention  
P => Bluefish Reunion  
P =>  One of best stays in Vegas   
P =>  Happy with this choice  
P => Read all the fine prints  
P => very enjoyable hotel   
P => 
P =>  STAY HERE IF YOU ARE MILITARY Went TDY to Nellis AFB and stayed at the ES because I thought we would get a great rate  got     per night at the Tulsa ES back in e with the Military discount   Per diem for Military is      per night  ES charged me      plus tax because my Gov Travel Card had the wrong  th digit  go figure  In the end my money man back in albuquerque paid the tax The free All you can eat breakfast and   hours of STRONG free drinks makes this THE place to stay  Great parking  good food  swans   Needed towels and a phone book  they were at my door LITERALY    seconds after I hung up I faced south  no airplane noise  The only complaint is that the shuttle to the strip ended at     pm  However  the driver took my group to the strip a couple of times when he didn t have to  Very nice people  
P =>   Credit Card Stolen Do not stay at this hotel  Yes the hotel is nice  however  someone from the front desk stole our credit card and racked up          in illegal charges  The Embassy Suites and Hilton corporation have not been helpful in retribution  The only thing I can say nice about this hotel  is the breakfast chefs are very funny  
P =>   Excellent Hotel Very nice ES  Staff was very nice  especially Brian in Guest Services  Rooms were clean  It was fun to see all the Koi Fish and the two swans they keep at the hotel  Nice quiet hotel off the strip  Would stay here again  
P =>  Leave the craziness of the strip behind This is my second year at this hotel  Usually I stay for a week at a time each year for the Computer Hacker s conferences  Blackhat  amp  Defcon   If you have never been to Vegas  then this location is probably not the right one for you  If you have been to Vegas and have a car  this is perfect  Right across from UNLV on the East side and across from the Hard Rock on the West side  Parking is right outside  The staff are great from the front desk to the breakfast folks to the Coconuts staff  Absolutely the best  The breakfast is fantastic  Be careful about asking for  quot alot of bacon quot   You could get a whole plate  The evening reception is fun  The pool is great with the little waterfall and hottubs The rooms are very good  They are extremely comfortable with two flat screen TVs and numerous phones  Does anyone ever use the phone any more  In the last year of traveling  I have only used the phone to leave a wake up call  hmmm  We had a room facing Swenson and did not have any of the plane noise in the room that was noted in a previous request  If your looking for an  quot off the strip quot  experience  you couldn t ask for a more comfortable and better bargin than the Embassy Suites Las Vegas Airport  Oh yea  don t forget to visit Mt  Charleston  the Hoover Dam  or the Red Rock Canyon  but those are other reviews  
P =>   Good value quieter than on Strip and great staff  Shuttle to strip and airport  Embassy suites are always good value as you get two rooms and a good breakfast included in the price  This hotel was away from the strip  which is what we wanted  and so was much quieter than hotels with a casino  All staff  receiption  waiters  cooks or cleaners were very friendly and efficient  The breakfast was very good   plenty of choice of cereals  bread  cakes  fruit and drinks   and the freshly cooked omelettes were excellent  The hotel runs a free shuttle to the strip between      and       am and between      and      pm    and also to the airport  Shuttle drivers were helpful and polite  I feel it would probably be better for guests if the shuttle to the strip ran between   and    noon as most people don t want to miss breakfast or have to get up so early on holiday  The decor in this hotel on Swenson Street was a little  tired    but not scruffy and it was immaculate  We felt a little sorry for the chefs and waiters as hardly anybody ate in the hotel in the evening   I suppost some people used room service  We ate there twice when we were too tired to go out again   the service was fine and the food was good though not gourmet   It was fun to see Elvis and Priscilla the two swans who live in the pool in the atrium   they seemed very happy to be there  Our one complaint was that whilst we were there a group of teenage girl basket ball players were staying   and they were very noisy   leaning over the balconies and calling to each other   in typical giggly l  year old manner  We felt the staff should have asked them to consider other guests  Once in our room we did not hear any outside or room to room noise  As the hotel is family friendly there are often a lot of children staying  The swimming pool outside was very pleasant  All in all a very reasonably priced hotel with great staff  Oh and there is also a business centre with two computers for you to check in online or check your emails   rooms are also set up for wi fi if you have your laptop with you  
P =>   Great Off Strip Hotel We stayed here for one night before heading to Utah  The hotel was recently renovated  and our suite was spacious  clean  and beautifully decorated  There were two large flat screen TVs   one in the bedroom and one in the living area  with a fair selection of channels  There was also a wet bar with a mini fridge and microwave  The bathroom was a decent size with a tub shower combo  Breakfast was delicious with the usual Embassy Suites offering   cooked to order omelets  pancakes  and an assortment of hot and cold cereals  bagels  muffins  yogurt  and juice  The staff at the front desk was very friendly and helpful  We asked one staff member for directions and he wrote them down for us and even drew a map  There was a statue of Elvis in the lobby and two swans named Elvis and Priscilla swimming in an indoor pond  The hotel is only a few minutes drive from the Strip and a great place to stay  
P =>   Comfortable friendly convenient to airport and UNLV Nice place for a business or pleasure visit  Very close to airport and across street from UNLV if you have business there  Friendly  international reception staff but a bit unorganized  Glass elevators and wide open atrium of hotel lobby is not great for privacy but comfortable to sit and enjoy the indoor greenery  water features  and swans names Elvia and Priscilla  Breakfast selection was not great  always crowded  but the food manager was great and worked hard along side the servers and cooks  Nice to have free parking and an easy couple blocks to the Strip  Spacious  comfy rooms  basic bathrooms  two large tvs  sitting and work area  though lighting was not the best and not all functional  Overall nice place and good location away from the hustle and bustle but close enough to get there in a quick couple of minutes by car or even on foot  Easy walk to the Hard Rock Cafe and Casino  
P =>   Nice place KILLER Breakfast   My wife and I stayed here for six days in early ch of       Very nice hotel and the staff was exceptional  No complaints  Our room was on the  th floor  HHonours guests are allocated top floor rooms   Three elevators let you get there easily  The rooms aren t huge but good enough for the low price Great value because of the evening  quot Happy hour quot  and the breakfast buffet  Their  quot Made to order quot  breakfasts are to die for  Try the meat lovers omelet with some extra bacon and sausage  hash browns  french toast  milk  juice  toast and fruit  A real heart attack special  You can gain weight at this hotel just like on a cruise ship Just kidding      but their Omelets are really tasty The rooms are quiet but sometimes the incoming planes look like the could land on the roof Thanks for your time  
P =>  Great Stay during CANAM Hockey Tournament We stayed at the Embassy Suites  About six rooms  for three nights during the CanAM Hockey Tournament  Adult over    ice hockey   The hotel staff was great   front desk clerks actually were interested in how our team did when they saw us gathering in the lobby   We won  by the way   Breakfast as always was great   the food and the cooks have great personalities  and are never troubled by small requests   I actually watched them make Mickey Mouse pancakes for the little girl in front of me   how sweet  We look forward to next year s tournament and another stay at the Embassy Suites  
P =>   Good Hotel   Lousy Bed  We stayed at the Embassy Suites over President s Day weekend for an extended weekend  The rate       from the Embassy website was excellent compared to other hotels for the holiday weekend and was why we stayed at the Embassy instead of on the strip The hotel is reasonably clean  I did find some stray hairs in both the bathroom and bedroom  had very good check in staff  and had a very good breakfast included The bed  though  was lousy  We had a king bed and it was super springy and cupped  My wife continually found herself rolling into the middle of the bed and any movement by one of us sent the other bouncing all over  We also has noise issues due to thin walls and hearing conversation from the adjacent bedroom It is too far to walk to the strip and walking to the Hard Rock across the street is not as easy as it once was due to construction at the Hard Rock  Also  the Embassy has no strip shutte in case you want that  We had a car and that suited us well Most people at the Embassy seemed to be staying not for vacation  but for other events being held in Las Vegas  For that  it would be a very good place to stay Overall  price being the major consideration  we feel we got a very good value for the weekend and would stay again  
P =>  Great  I stayed at the Embassy Suites recently for   nights with my wife and    year old son  Our room was on the top floor  HHonours guests are allocated top floor rooms   We had absolutely no problem with noise  despite the proximity to the airport  In fact it was extremely quiet  The suite was spacious and spotlessly clean and well maintained with reasonably stylish furnishings  We had      quot  HD TVs and a kitchenette  fridge  microwave etc   which was a bit of a bonus  The hotel is located off strip  although it is possible to walk     mins or so  or use the hotel shuttle  which didn t operate frequently enough   Parking is complementary and plentiful  The cooked to order complementary breakfast was excellent  as was the happy hour complementary drinks nibbles from           in the bar  The pool hot tubs were lovely  and the pool area was invariably deserted despite the temperature being in the high   s with constant sunshine  We really loved this hotel and would definitely return  It may only be a little cheaper than the well known casino hotels around the strip  but it is definitely a lot quieter and more pleasant  
P =>   Very nice  We stayed here as part of a Wydham timeshare  This hotel is very nice and clean  Staff is very nice  The breakfast is great and all free  Good water pressure  very quite  I would highly recommend this hotel  
P =>   Had a nice time This is the perfect non gaming hotel  It is only a few blocks from the Strip for those in your group who want to see the casinos but otherwise it is a nice break from all the chaos  Breakfast was served quickly despite large groups of athletic teams staying at the same time  Front desk staff very helpful in giving directions  Rooms were clean  attrractive   Embassy chain has made huge improvements in their fitness centers  The gym was great  
P =>  Off strip    mile away  non gaming but comfortable  Typical Embassy Suites  Atrium  Cook to order breakfast  all suite  Manager s reception in the evening although I have seen better  that is not too far from the strip  Walking distance to some of the strip casinos  They have an hourly shuttle but I never took it  Call for a cab in advance particularly on the weekends  Friendly staff  Affrodable The negatives are that the hotel is pretty old   includes sheets  bathroom fixtures  carpet etc  Location is not ideal if you want to be close to the strip  
P =>  loved it  We had a wonderful stay at Embassy Suites  Staff very courteous and helpful  Free shuttle van to strip  Walking  it would take about half an hour  Happy     hours every night any drink you wanted titbits  Accomodation was very good my son especially liked the large tv s  Good on site dining and ample free breakfast cooked to order  Lovely pool area  
P =>   Super Stay We picked this hotel based upon discovering TripAdvisor  Although the reviews set the bar quite high  our experience exceeded our expectations This hotel is extremely family friendly  At the restaurant  when my wife brought the baby and our toddler for breakfast  while the rest of the family slept in  the staff stayed at the table with the kids while she put her breakfast on her tray Poolside  and all over the hotel  the staff was great  and we all raved about our experience on the drive back to Los Angeles  We shall return  
P =>  Did not live up to expectations We stayed at this property for   nights e      Paid for one night  used Hilton Honors points for  nd night  I was looking forward to ending a    day vacation at this property  and ended up being disappointed  Below are pros and cons Cons    Partly selected this property because of the nice outdoor pool area  Then the Health Department closed the pool our only whole day there  it was still closed upon checkout e     That in itself raises some concerns about the pool service  The management offered to shuttle us to the other Embassy Suites to use their pool  We chose to drive ourselves  and my kids did enjoy the indoor pool  but it was not nearly as nice as the Swenson property     We were in room       NOT an updated room  although my mother in law in     had an updated room  flat screen TV s  newer entertainment centers   Do I really care about watching a nice TV in Vegas  No  But why is one room updated  the other not  both on the Hilton Honors floor    A C issues   both nights we had problems with the room getting stuffy and the air not running properly  Tried turning down the temp   not much happened  Not great sleeping conditions    Walls are thin between rooms  Each morning I heard the phone ringing for my neighbors wake up call  AT        and then could clearly hear their cell phone ringing several times   I even got out of bed thinking it was my phone ringing PROS   As others have said  the breakfast service is great  Nice selection  plus the cooks are personable and efficient     Beds are very comfortable  and the rooms are spacious  the reason we chose this hotel   Nice large refrigerator and microwave  in case you have leftovers from one of the fancy restaurants in Vegas     Parking is easy and a short walk to your hotel room  I like that there is no casino  especially when traveling with teenagers     Location is good  and although I did not use their casino shuttle  it was nice to have it as an option  Would I stay here again  I would probably give them another chance  But this trip did not work out the way I had hoped  
P =>  Close to the strip but way better  I have stayed at this Embassy twice  Both times were excellent experiences  I like the fact that is very close to the strip but that it does not have a casino  This latest trip we were there on business but easily walked to dinner at Treasure Island and a show at the Mirage Saturday night  it is an easy    mnute walk to the strip at the intersection where the Fashion Show Mall and Wynn are  The rooms are very spacious  clean and the staff are all very cutomer oriented  I like that you can park near and don t have the    minute walks fom the parking lot to the hotel at the typical strip hotel Toss in breakfast and happy hour and count me delighted  
P =>   A Jewel In The Desert One Of The Best     We stayed at Embassy Suites on Swenson last month to attend a conference and have a short vacation  This stay was a completely positive experince  Cristina  the meeting manager was very helpful to our group  the front desk staff were helpful in getting me directions to other locations  and eveyone greeted us with a smile  I ve stayed at Hilton Grand Vacation and the Embassy Suites on Paradise in the past  and they have nothing on Embassy Suites Las Vegas  The hotel also has just completed the their renovations and the suites are welcoming    even have flat screen tvs  The outdoor pool is an oasis in itself  Highly recommend  
P =>   Can t praise it enough My husband and I stayed at the Embassy Suites for   nights in early il  After a long flight and getting lost on our way to the hotel  since we forgot to print directions   we checked in and were given a  th floor room  which is reserved for Hilton Honors members  facing Swenson right next to the elevator  Because I had read negative comments about being right near the elevator and hearing planes  I was a little skeptical  To my delight  I never heard anyone in the hallway or at the elevator  and was never woken by a plane  and I m a light sleeper   In fact  even during the day we hardly ever heard planes overhead Ralph went out of his way to welcome us and greet us every morning during breakfast  and evening at the manager s reception  All the staff was friendly  and at least attempted to be helpful  we asked for directions and we were sent completely in the wrong direction     The breakfast is amazing  I had cooked to order omelets  pancakes or French toast every morning  The grill cooks are efficient and the food is wonderful  We only had more than a couple minute wait the first day when we got in line behind a group that was staying at the hotel for a convention The facility is very well cared for and the rooms are very comfortable  The beds were better than most hotels Throughout our week there were always conferences going on  and lots of kids running around  but they never disturbed us  Even the       yr  old cheerleaders were well behaved and kept in their own row of rooms several floors below us The  quot restaurant quot  is in the atrium  It is sort of segmented off  but it definitely doesn t work for the upscale atmosphere I would like in a more expensive restaurant  We had lunch there one day  and a light dinner another evening  the Strawberry Chicken Salad is heaven  The one thing that was consistently negative was that the service was extremely slow  We didn t have plans to go anywhere  so it didn t matter  but it was still a nuisance The pool area and fitness center are exceptional  The gift shop is a joke  Go to a real souvenir shop and save yourself lots of money  two postcards with stamps cost me over     As we were preparing to leave  we were offered the chance to store our luggage in the bell closet until our plane left several hours after we checked out All in all  I would rebook with this hotel in a heartbeat  Being away from the strip  but within a   minute drive was great  We could get away from the hustle and bustle when we were ready to relax  and had a great time while we were there  
P =>   Ideal get away from the hustle and bustle We stayed at the Embassy suites for   nights  Initially I was afraid that we would be too far out of things but the hotel offers a free shuttle bus to the strip every hour  and also one to the airport   The driver will pick you up at other times if you require  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and feel the choice not to stay on the strip was the correct one  We visited several hotels and found them too big  The queues to check in  out were long and I found the atmosphere a bit anonymous  On the other hand we saw our hotel manager several times during our visit  He mucked in clearing tables etc if required  I liked the family feel to this hotel  The kids loved the pool and we used it as a way to break up out day  The adults loved the mangers reception with free drinks and snacks between             The cook to order breakfast is fabulous with omlettes with several fillings to pancakes and waffles  There is also a hot buffet or fresh fruit  cereal  pastries  Really great value for families  Our kids loved the resident swans and got to feed them  The accomodation was very good with   LCD TV s  I was annoyed however by the table in the centre of the room which was an obstruction when preparing the sofa bed for the kids every night  The room had a safe and fridge  If i was visiting Las Vegas again I would definately stay there again  We did hear some noise from the planes but not enough to be a problem  
P =>   Fabulous    Wonderful family hotel  Every staff member from the front desk to the maids were helpful and friendly  Ralph was especially helpful during our stay  Room had   flat screens  fridge  and microwave which is WAY more than you get in some of the  quot on the stip quot  hotels  Breakfast was PERFECT   and the chef had a great sense of humor  Happy hour was better than some of the other Embassy hotels we have stayed at  Pool was clean and there were always towels available  I just can t say enough about how great of a value this hotel is  
P =>  Great Hotel   Great Service Stayed at this hotel for   nites with our  kids  Here are the things we liked about the hotel    Best exercise room ever for a htl  Great elypticals and treadmills with cardio theatre on each machine  Good free weights  Just an outstanding exercise room  Even provided earphones for the tv s    Breakfast was great  If you were a little later in the A M  the line for omelets was a little long but you could go to the separate station for scrambled eggsand bacon and continental with no waiting  A  service down there    Nice van service to both airport and the strip that ran once an hour  Definitely take the van to the strip and not your car  The strip is wall to wall cars all day and is absolutely no fun to drive at all in  Don t bring car to strip      Occasionally I could hear a plane from the airport but for the most part the hotel was really quiet considering how close to airport it is and the fact there were a bunch of kids in the htl for spring break    The suite was really nice with great flat screen tv s and lots of channels  The living room seemed a little smaller than some embassies but not much    My kids loved the   swans in the lobby  Also  loved the fresh  lemon water in the lobby  Nice touch   The help at the front desk was first rate  I had a couple of requests that I called down for and they responded very quickly When we would come back in for the evening the help at the front desk would always welcome us back which was a nice touch    Had dinner in the restaurant and that too was great I have stayed in many embassy suites over the years and this one is as good as it gets    I enjoyed the free internet and printing in the lobby  They only had one computer but there was big sign saying there was a   min  max  time so the computer was free much of the time If I had one wish it would have been to have a little more heat in the outdoor pool  They said it was heated but it was mighty cold in that pool If you are looking for a non gaming htl this is a great option  
P =>   Excellent Stay  Stayed one night a the ES Airport on Swenson after coming in on a late flight with family  Our room was ready and waiting  paperwork complete  which was much appreciated at      a m   I had alerted the hotel to our late arrival  and the necessity of two queens  non smoking with family along   We were on a Hilton Honors guest floor  Breakfast was wonderful  made to order omelettes with fresh ingredients  awesome french toast  fruit  juices etc  Lots of choice and volume  along with excellent quality  The cooks were entertaining and skilled  full of good humor and pleasant morning conversation  Don t forget to tip them  they deserve it  The pool area was great  Plenty of lounges  pretty waterfall area with a walk through cave  access to sun and shade  Our son enjoyed seeing the swans inside the lobby  Great option for families and value conscious travelers who still want quality  
P =>   Awsome We just returned from Embassy Suites  after many visits to Las Vegas this hotel was a breathe of fresh air  It had made to order breakfast  which was very good  They had a gift store  pool  gym  bar and restaurant  In the evening they had a managers reception which had snacks  finger foods and drinks  They have a shuttle bus that would take you to the airport and to the strip  The drop off and pick up area is at the Planet Hollywood shops  The shuttle ends at    pm  There is a small mini strip mall around the corner with a Johanny Rockets  pizza place  CVS drug store and a few other stores  Hard Rock Cafe is about a block away  A must see Our room had a micro  fridge and sink in the living room area    flat screen tvs  wireless internet  The suite was very nice  This is my first time staying off the strip and I would stay here again the next time I visit  I highly recommend this hotel  It was a perfect stay in Vegas  
P =>  Warning WARNING  The hotel is currently under construction and they do not let you know this  The outside is being painted and all of the windows are covered  We only stayed one night and the front desk suggested we park our vehicle on the south side of the hotel  We parked under a light for extra security  That night someone broke into our vehicle and ripped out the DVD overhead monitor and player and went throught the entire vehicle  The front desk said they had security but they don t  Because of the contrustruction there is no way to see someone breaking into your vehicle and the thieves know this  The hotel management will not return telephone calls  You are better of f spending a little more for a more secure area because it certainly costs more when you have to replace things  My youngest son still can not sleep in his own bed because he is still scared  When we reported it to the front desk they said that they bring in their stereo equipment when they get to work so this isn t the first time this has happened  On a positive note  the breakfast was really good  
P => Fantastic Breakfast This hotel is relatively inexpensive considering the whole package available so is a good choice for off strip  The rooms are nice and include a separate sitting area  The pool and spa are pleasant enough  The real plusses though are the excellent free breakfast  the happy hour  a good range and some nibbles and the shuttle to and from the strip  
P =>  Great Place to stay away from home  Me and a male friend stayed at the Embasst Suites off Swenson Rd  The hotel was very nice and clean and the staff was wonderful  We had no problems at all  Most of all  the hotel cooked breakfast each morning which was awesome and helped us save alot of time and money so that we did not have to go out to eat breakfast  The also had a managers special which was very good for drinkers to have a nice time at the hotel instead of going out for a drink  It is also great for non gamblers to have a nice time at the room  The room was very spacious for two  I had a GREAT TIME at the Embassy and I would encourgage others to stay here  
P =>   inexpensive but great quality my husband and i received a paid stay for four days at a hotel of our choice  of course within a certain category  just for buying new windows for our home  we paid minimally for the airfare and our feeding at the hotel but their breakfast buffet is the best  Our view was not the best considering construction was going on just beyond the pool and the busy streets which is most of what we could see but for FREE  hey you cannot beat that  just watch out though  everyone in Vegas is trying to sell u a timeshare 
P =>   Close to airport and freeway access off the strip serenity If you like to get away from the craziness of the Strip  but want to be within walking distance  we recommend the Embassy Suites  Close to the airport and across the street from the Hard Rock Casino  We stayed there on our Hilton points  for free   so I can t speak much about the cost  I would imagine it s fairly expensive Quiet and peaceful rooms  despite the proximity to the airport  We went to an absolutely awesome sushi place in the strip mall a few doors up from the hotel   walking distance  Kaizen Sushi   YUM  The pool at this hotel was great and uncrowded   red rocks  waterfalls  nice landscaping  big pool  quiet shaded nooks here and there  Very nice  Loved the free breakfast in the morning and free cocktails in the evening  especially since Vegas has gotten so expensive  Clean  large two room suite  There was free wireless internet in the atrium and lobby area  but you had to pay for it if you wanted to use it in your room  No biggie for us  since there were ample cocktail tables and chairs available in public areas  When we were there  it happened to be the same week as the Country Music Awards  We soon found out that the hotel was full of families of soldiers who d lost their lives in the Iraq war  Country Star Tim McGraw had flown them in to take part in a special song he sang at the awards  Needless to say  we met a ton of wonderful people who had a lot of sad stories to tell  And we saw Tim McGraw himself  who visited the hotel to meet the families  sign autographs  and take photos  We ended up going to the CMAs unplanned  and had a great time  This was a special  unforgettable visit There are two swans that live in the indoor fountain pond in the atrium  I think their names were Elvis and Priscilla  It was a nice touch  and they didn t hiss at people  They were very well behaved  for swans  
P =>  Peaceful atmosphere Excellent location Overview  We found this to be a very pleasant  peaceful retreat not far from the Strip  After visiting all of the large casino s and hotels  we were very happy to return to the Embassy  where there were no large crowds milling about  no loud music or games  and we could park our car right outside the hotel door  The airplane noise was very muffled and did not disturb us at all  We would definitely stay here again on a future trip Accomodations  The sitting room was fairly spacious with a comfortable couch  chair and desk  There was a good sized refrigerator and lots of counter space in the kitchen area  The bathroom was large  although it could have used more counter space  The beds were comfortable  One note that might be of interest to those with families  although the sleeping area and the sitting area were separated somewhat by the kitchen and bathroom area  there was no door closing off the bedroom  Both the public and private areas of the hotel were kept very clean Food  The free breakfast was good  One caution is that the line for the cooked to order portion of the food can get a bit long towards the end of the breakfast hours  We also ordered room service a couple of times for dinner and were happy with our meals  The food was tasty  the portions were large and the price was reasonable  especially considering the price of food in general in Vegas  The selection of food offered at their evening happy hour was also excellent  better than in most of the Embassy properties at which we have stayed  Each night the selection included vegetables and dip  cheese and crackers  popcorn and one hot item such as meatballs or fried mushrooms Location  With our rental car  we found it very easy to visit any of the casinos on the Strip and parking was never a problem  The Hard Rock Hotel and Casino is across the street behind the Embassy  a very short walk away  
P => Nice hate the airplane noise This Embassy Suites is excellent when it comes to cleanliness  breakfast  free and one of the best in Vegas IMHO   happy hour  and customer service What I didn t like was being woken up by airplane noise   nights in one night  There isn t a lot that this hotel can do about that  but you need to be forewarned  maybe it was the location of the room and others won t I constantly stay at Embassy Suites  I am a Hilton Honors member and seek to stay whenever I travel at a ES  
P =>  Better than I expected I have mixed opinions about Embassy Suites hotels and I was not sure what to expect from this one   However  I was pleasantly surprised  I arrived and checked in quickly  I was allocated a suite with a king sized bed on the  th floor  which is the last floor and has been allocated for the Hilton HHonors card members  The building has   elevators on one end and   oddly for the other end  My room was a comfortable one and had a small living room with a working desk and a sofa cum bed  It led into the bed room with a king size bed  The bed covers were bright and appeared very new  A good bonus was the complimentary high speed wired internet access  Breakfast was complimentary as well and was served from   am onwards in the restaurant and had a reasonable selection of hot and cold items  the usual fare seen in all Embassy Suites properties  The cocktail hour had a good choice of hot snacks as well like spring rolls  burritos   meatballs etc served daily from    pm  The staff were very friendly and ready to assist  Check in and check out could also be done by a self service machine placed near the reception which i was more than happy to use  It could also print out boarding passes for a variety of airlines  Overall i found this property a very good one for those who prefer a home like atmosphere without and casinos etc  Its not too far off from the strip although you need a car to drive there  Fro that matter the hotel occupancy was near full for the entire week i stayed there  
P =>   Great choice This place was good all around   The staff was very friendly  the room was perfectly clean  the pool is a little on the small side  but very well kept  every evening form i think   to   is coctail hour  and they serve free beers and some other drinks  so that is kinda fun  and I cannot say enough about their breakfast  It is made to order  and the cooks are so great and fast  they just get it done  and they do a superb job with it all  I visited this place with my hubby and   babies  and so we are not the partying  clubbing type   we just wne to vegas basically so see that architecture  so this place was perfect for us   not too far off the strip  but far enough to be quiet and peaceful  Great place to stay  Oh yeah  and they have   swans that just hang out in there  and their maintenance guy let my son feed them lettuce  so he was super excited about that  I can not say enough about how friendly the workers were   everyone from the cleaning ladies to the maintenance guy  
P =>   Another great Embassy Suites stay Our family of   had a great two day stay here in il       Located across the street from the UNLV campus  and far enough away from the strip to provide relaxation when needed  The amenities are just perfect for weary parents with children  the terrific complimentary breakfast  the great pool  the complimentary evening managers reception  The rooms are large enough for the family to spread out and relax  Despite the disconcerting proximity of jets landing at the airport  my sleep was never disturbed by noise  I would definitely stay here again  
P => Great Value and Recommended We stayed at this property for three nights and were very impressed  It is located off the strip and away from the crowds  They have a shuttle which can drop you off at the Aladdin every hour and also free shuttle to the airport  The room itself was large and very comfortable  Bathroom was clean and large  The breakfast is awesome and can be cooked or continental  all is included in the price  When there  say hello to Elvis and Priscilla    swans who live in the hotel atrium   In relation to aircraft noise  there is some but nothing too noisy  There are many hotels closer to the airport  including the Mandalay which is   times the price  and that is right across the road from the airport  Thoroughly recommended for families as it is in a quiet area of a very lively city   
P =>  Great Off Strip Hotel I ve stayed at Embassy Suites in New York  a few times and this one is equally good There s a complimentary breakfast  cooked to order  although the queue can be quite long  so we stuck to the buffet There s   hours of complimentary drinks in the evening and you were able to take the drinks to your room  There s also free coffee throughout the day As with all Embassy Suites hotels  the rooms are very big  with bedroom  living room and kitchen area and two televisions  They are also clean and comfortable  although the sofa bed was a little lumpy  We chose this hotel because it was one of the few  in Vegas  that had   beds    double bed in the bedroom and   double sofa bed in the living room  There s a free gym and free in room internet access  if you bring a laptop It s off the strip  which can be good or bad  It s nice to get away from it all  but if you re going to be partying on the strip every night  you might be better off staying there The staff were friendly and helpful  The only down side is that the free strip shuttle bus only runs once an hour  so we ended up getting a taxi most of the time         I would definitely recommend this hotel for families and people wanting   separate beds  like a group of   adult friends  
P => Embassy on Swenson a four star stay My wife and I have a timeshare at the Hilton Grand Vacations Club on the Vegas Strip  and we are also Hilton Honors members  Just want to you to know up front whether we have a  quot dog in this fight quot   We hadn t the opportunity to stay at an Embassy Suite  and we were very pleasantly surprised by this property  We had one glitch during our stay  they missed a return shuttle from the Aladdin  but the front desk comped us a cab ride back  so we were very pleased by that swift make up call  The breakfast is hearty  plentiful  and cooked with a positive morning gusto  The hotel atrium  which the hotel rooms face inward to  is peaceful  quiet  and a welcomed sight after the  quot hustle quot  of the Strip  Excellent place for a family or business traveler who wants to avoid casinos  And for me  a perfect oasis for a trip with golfing buddies    hmmm  need to discuss that with the better half Happy trails 
P =>  Highly recommended quiet hotel I stayed here with   friends from   th ember for   nights  The suite was a comfortable size for the three of us  We had   double beds and a sofabed  What I liked best was the quiet aptmosphere of the hotel  even over the busy New Year  To stay in a non gaming hotel like this is quite a relief after a day on the strip  There is a shuttle to the strip  but we used taxi s the whole time  which the front desk will call for you   or you can walk the   minutes to the Hard Rock Hotel  amp  Casino where they come by often  A taxi to the strip was usually about     The hotel lobby is pleasant and we took advantage of the free drinks and snacks at the bar each evening from    pm  The complimentary breakfast was good   I enjoyed the yogurt  toast  fruit and donuts  The breakfast area amoung the palm trees was pleasant  but you could take food back to your room if you wanted  This hotel is ideal if there are   of you   it is hard to find any hotel on the strip that can accomodate you  We also stayed at Harrah s on the strip which was fine  but the room at the Embassy Suites was superior  There are some shops close by the Embassy Suites  including a CVS chemist which stocks most things you might need  You are also only a mile away from TJ Maxx and Target   which are good for bargain shopping  We had a laptop computer with us so we were able to make use of the free internet in the room  The staff were friendly and helpful  and the swans Elvis  amp  Priscilla are a nice touch  
P =>  Great food drinks and value for off strip suite hotel This is the Embassy Suites on Swenson Road  back parking is across the street on Paradise from the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino   If you have a rental car  this is a great location  Cabs are a little hassle in Vegas and can be expensive if you come and go The free drinks for guests start at      and full breakfast in the morning make this a great value  Suite rooms are fully decked out  If you are a business traveller in Vegas  this is a great place away from the noise of a Casino hotel  
P =>   Beautiful hotel wonderful service close to the strip  We loved this hotel and will stay here again if we ever return to Vegas We booked our stay at this hotel directly through the Embassy Suites website for the same rate as all the  discount  websites  plus we got a free large pizza    free drinks  free breakfast daily  AND free alcoholic beverages between   and   each night  my husband took full advantage of this  but I am pregnant and stuck to the free sprite and water      This hotel is outstanding  It is within minutes of the strip  but would be quite a long distance to walk  so they offer a complimentary shuttle to The Aladdin hotel on the strip each hour  and by the way  the shuttle driver was an incredible friendly retired gentlemen who gave us some wonderful tips  as we were first time visitors of Vegas   The service at the hotel was exceptional  we were there   days and saw the same woman and young man working each time  and every time they were very friendly  always greeting us with a smile and were quick to help and answer questions  The restaurant staff was also very nice and were quick to clear the tables after we finished breakfast each morning  My husband did have a small issue with the girl who worked in the hotel store he handed her a     and she seemed irritated and asked if he had anything smaller  he apologized and said  quot no quot  and she made some comment about him wiping out her cash drawer we found it amusing considering it was Vegas and the majority of people were carrying around      s and she was upset about a measely     bill  The room itself was very clean and spacious  We took advantage of the free in room internet  The maid service was great and we always returned to a clean room with a perfectly made bed and fresh towels  Personally  my only complaint  and this is a small one  is that the bathtub is extremely  extremely slippery  no big deal because we are in our mid    s and good shape  except that I am pregnant  and a fall could have resulted in a trip to the hospital for me and could have changed the course of our vacation drastically   While on our honeymoon we stayed in various hotels  including riott s and Hilton s  and although this hotel wasn t as luxurious as some of those we stayed in  the service and the  quot extras quot  at this hotel  free breakfast  free drinks from      etc  were by far the best   We would HIGHLY recommend this hotel to anyone who wants the fun atmosphere of Vegas without paying the absurdely high prices of staying at the hotels on the strip   Oh  and the Hard Rock Hotel  Casino  and Restaurant are right across the street if you want to hang out near the hotel without going down to the strip  Lastly  I wanted to reply to the previous review in regard to the airplanes flying over head   the name of the hotel is the EMBASSY SUITES HOTEL AIRPORT   not quite sure what that lady expected  We did not find that the airplanes were loud at all  I am a light sleeper and I was never woken up by them  To be quite honest  motorcycles can be louder than the planes were  
P =>  Too Close for Comfort Just returned from Las Vegas where we stayed at the Embassy Suites for   nights   a treat for our   boys after a long Southwest vacation  We ve always enjoyed staying at Embassy Suites  We usually don t splurge  but once in a while  it s worth spending more and we felt this was the perfect treat after having been in many hotels during the vacation Everything about this property was fine  except for the location   right in the flight path of the incoming airplanes  Normally  I love watching airplanes   honestly  I d love to work for an airline  However  these airplanes were literally coming in directly above the building  My husband assured me that they were at least    feet above the building   I wasn t so sure  This was way too close for comfort  It wasn t even the noise that bothered me  although that was loud   I really was concerned that a plane would be strafing the hotel  
P =>  Great hideaway from the non stop life of the Strip First stop on the family roadtrip  and a   night stay to acclimatise before heading off to the Canyon Great hotel  good enough suite for   of us  brilliant pool  decent food  and  just about  a walk away from the Strip  Okay  so in that heat  we should have taken the free shuttle   Would highly recommned it for those not into gambling or using Vegas as a staging post for a trip into Utah or Arizona 
P =>   Business Traveler Bargain I spend a lot of time staying at various Embassy Suites hotels across the U S  and can say that this hotel holds its own as a quality stay even though it is located away from the strip and in the flight path of landing planes at McCarren Airport Nothing new to say about the stay here except that it is a typical Embassy Suites inside  The hotel is a little older than most in the chain but holds its age decent  The furnishings and quality of the room were good  Breakfast was great every day and I enjoyed the accomodations for a training classs I attended at the hotel The only issue I encountered was a problem with Internet access following check in  Fortunately for me  I was moved to a room that had working access and was online within   hours of my arrival  
P =>  Loved the Embassy  We choose the Embassy Suites because we were taking the family toVegas and wanted a non gaming hotel  We love the energy of Vegasand the sights  there is so much to do that doesn t involve gambling  We wanted a hotel that would still be nice but without a casino to make the kids feel more comfortable  We were not disappointed  this hotel was top notch Our room had   double beds and a separate living room  there was a tvin the living room area and one in the bedroom  how great is that I must mention that the beds are very comfortable All the staff we encountered greeted up with friendly smiles The room was spacious and clean  room service did an excellent job each day The grounds and pool area was clean  The pool was never too crowded  which made for a great time for the kids The lobby was beautiful  there is a statue of Elvis in it and a pond with different gold fish and   swans  Elvis and Priscilla that the kids loved The made to order breakfast was excellent  this is a big value if you havea family  The omelets were excellent  The chefs are great cooks In the evening from          pm you can get   free cocktailsat the bar and free snacks  nachos  popcorn  etc   The elevators even run fairly quickly  unlike other hotels we ve been whereyou have to wait forever on the elevator Free parking in their parking lot and no parking garage to deal with  We never had a problem finding a parking spot day or night This area of Vegas seemed fairly safe which is a big plus  After a funday on the strip you can come and escape to peace and quiet I would highly recommend this hotel  
P => Clean relaxing hotel good for families Our family liked this hotel a lot   beautiful room  king bed bedroom and then a fold out queen hideabed in  living room  area  Microwave  refrig  coffeemaker  GREAT breakfast and breakfast chefs one of them had quite the entertaining personality and the kids loved it  Another staff member invited my younger daughter to help feed the swans  The lobby  creek  area with the koi fish and the swans is quiet and relaxing  The only down side was the front desk staff  not overly helpful or cheerful  
P =>  great hotel   The hotel staff was very friendly and very good to our   year old son  Our son loved the swans    Great breakfast  nice managers reception    both included in room rate   Rooms were very clean  and the pool area was nice  We would stay again     
P =>  Nice Hotel Stayed at the Embassy Suite Airport from     to            Nice hotel with a great breakfast  This is not your typical hotel breakfast  They make any kind of egg omlete and french toast and pancakes fresh for you along with fresh fruit  yogurt and bagels  Load up at breakfast and skip lunch    Rooms are very nice and roomy  The complimentary computer hook up is a bonus for buisness travelers  The shuttle runs hourly and takes you to the Aladdin on the strip  Friendly drivers Problems with the front desk about rooms are resolved quickly The   hr Happy Hour was a great chance to relax and have a drink on the house I would stay here again  
P =>  Top notch stay great place  superb and clean amenities  and polite staff  the complimentary breakfast every morning sure saved a lot of     and kept us going all day  the pool looked great though we never tried it  Overall  it is a definite that we would stay here if we come back this way 
P =>  Comments for Parents with young children Our children are   and   years old  They loved the elevators  glass   you can see out into the atrium   the swans  Elvis and Priscilla   The pool was wonderful  This is a nice hotel and the made to order breakfast is really good  The staff was friendly and helpful  They provided Starbucks coffee every morning by the elevator  free   The fitness room has several treadmills and a small weight deck  No complaints about the hotel or the price  The main comment I have is that the bedroom door does not lock  Apparently some rooms only have an archway between the  quot living room quot  and the bedroom  If you are selecting a suite so you can have some privacy this is something to be aware of  
P =>  Clean hotel amenities and service below par First of all  this hotel was clean and quiet  In the overall hotel quality  it is on par with all the other Embassy Suites I ve stayed at  Now for the negatives  There weren t enough towels or pillows in the room for the number of people staying  I booked months in advance  so they should have had that taken care of   The managers reception was good  however they limit the types of drinks and number of mixes  In other words  no Long Islands at the free reception  We asked for a mattress pad for the pull out bed  and had to ask for it   times before it was delivered  The wired in room internet access didn t have an included ethernet cable  so you need to bring your own  There was no notice of the free wireless internet in the lobby  I had to figure that out on my own  The restaurant isn t exactly full service  and misses some basic amenties  they serve fried shrimp  but no cocktail sauce    The free shuttle to the strip is nice  but not advertised any place  and isn t always on time  They were over    minutes late to pick us up  and the load of people filled the bus  The breakfast in the morning is fantastic  All of the basic breakfast foods are there  cooked to order and delicious Next time in Las Vegas  I will definitely stay at an Embassy Suites  but not this one  
P =>  Nice getaway  
P => Everything you could want  
P =>  Clean and Convenient  
P =>  Comfortable and Quiet  
P =>  Nice Hotel Loved Elvis and Pricilla

P => Perfect We went up for Football Championships had   teams ages from      yrs  we stayed here as a team  Had a great time at the Emerald Suites  The staff was very polite to all of us and gave us anything we needed during our stay that we forgot or ran out of  Very  very great laundry rooms for us we definitely had lots of uniforms to get washed  These suites are perfeclty located by the freeway  grocery and gas station  This will definetly be the place we come back to every year for the football championships with the great price  great rooms  great staff you can t beat it   Thank you Emerald Suites  
P => What a great place to stay  What a great place to stay  im from salt lake city utah and have been doing alot of business with clark county over the past   years and have stayed at the emerald suites everytime  its quiet  comferdable  and a great pool  its home away from home  the staff is always great and very helpfull when i call  i would recomend the emerald suites to everyone 
P => A Great  Get away  place Being a Las Vegas native  I have had the pleasure of staying at the Emerald Suites many times this past year  And for many nights at a time too  The location is perfect for touring the strip and shopping at the nearby mall  Everything is very quiet and you hardly get any noise from nearby neighbors  It s a great  get away  from the rest of everyday Las Vegas chaos  Having the two separate rooms for a living area and the bedroom still made it feel like home  The small kitchen made it easier to bring food to the hotel and  eat in  rather than spending too much on a expensive resturant  The hotel also has a convenient laundry room to do any last minute laundry The service from the staff is always friendly and courteous  Anytime we needed new sheets and towels or decided to extend or shorten our stay it was never any problem  They were always ready and willing to help  I always recommend this hotel to any friends or family  whether they are visiting from out of town or just want to spend a few nights out away from home  
P => Feels like home  My wife and I have enjoyed our first couple weeks here   we re part of the snowbirds group that comes to Las Vegas every year for the winter months  Its so nice to feel like your welcome and at home  That s why we come each year back to Emerald suites  The service we get from the staff and the way they all treat us makes us feel very good and that s why we come here  And the suites are so big  enough room for all the stuff we bring with us  The best thing is the potluck they throw for all of us around Christmas time  it s just like were family  
P =>   The Best Place In Vegas My husband and I stayed at the Emerald suites in Las Vegas for Bike fest  and we were amazed at all the comforts for    times less than any other place in Vegas  There is no way we will ever stay at any other place in all of Las Vegas  The Emerald Suites were truely AWSOME     
P =>  Home away from home The Emerald Suites is a wonderful place to stay in Las Vegas on a budget  It s great for people who don t want to be crowded in a room  Our room had two bedrooms  a family room  a kitchen  and a bathroom  There was plenty of space to get comfortable  I really enjoyed having a kitchen to cook as much as possible  saves money    The location was nice  Not too far from the tourist area but far enough to feel sane at the end of the day  There was a mall close by for some leisure time outside of the strip  The best part of the room for me was the walk in closets and lots of drawers  Many hotel rooms give you two hangers and maybe a few drawers  My family and I stayed for five days so it was nice to unpack  relax  and feel at home especially after coming back from a full day on The Strip  I would definitely stay there again and recommend it to others  
P =>   A Great room with great staff the best in Vegas  My hubby and I went to Vegas for his birthday and loved the cheerful staff and clean rooms  We loved that they were large and roomy and very CLEAN  The staff were GREAT   I love this place  I ALWAYS want to stay there   
P => 	kids   dogs This hotel was a great choice for us  We enjoyed having the  quot apartment quot  feel for both the kids and the dogs  The front desk was very helpful and upgraded us to a   bedroom suite since I was travelling with   kids and   dogs  
P =>   a decent budget minded option in Las Vegas My husband  amp  I are members of a vacation club  so the Emerald Suites accommodations were essentially chosen FOR us when we said we were going to Las Vegas  It s nothing spectacular or glamorous  but it worked well for us  We were in L V  for a week  and the kitchenette allowed us to save some money by having some meals in our suite instead of having to eat in restaurants   meals every day  We also appreciated having laundry facilities on site  and a workout room  There was some sort of biker event in town  and some of the bikers were staying here  so I was a little concerned at first about some of the other guests that I saw in the lobby when we arrived  However  the property was quiet throughout our stay  and we never felt the least bit unsafe  Staff frequently patrolled the premises  picking up stray bits of garbage  and generally keeping an eye on things  The parking area and the inner courtyard were well lit at night  Everything in our room worked properly  and it was clean  amp  non smoking  One caveat  in theory  this suite could accommodate up to   people  as there were   queen beds  and also a sofa sleeper  However  there is just one bathroom  and  for some unknown reason   the closet is attached to it  so when one person is using the bathroom with the door locked  nobody else can use the bathroom OR get to the closet  It was perfect for the   of us  but would have been a headache for a larger   of people  
P =>   Avoid at all costs I wanted to go to vegas last minute and this was all hotels com had at a good rate  I booked it and came only to be horrified  There were people all over the parking lot talking loud  having a bbq  shaving       just awful  The cops came within    min after we arrived and I never had a chance to unpack before I felt soooo unsafe  I took my bags and got the heck outta there  I dont know why its called suites  they are motels  It stinks inside thre room and its very disturbing as soon as you check in  I didnt even bother to cancel it  I just gave the keys back and left  Oh yeah  and the blinds are so cheap  anyone walking by can see what you are doing       
P =>  Excellent value though car essential After enquiring at South Point  our  apartment  at Emerald Suites  just down the road  represented incredible value with a separate bedroom and fully equiped kitchen for many dollars less a night  Yes  the location is somewhat distant from The Strip  but as nearly every casino has free parking  the location only becomes an issue if you want to indulge in a raging night life  and then there are taxis   Looking for the luxury finishes   not here  looking for proximity to restaurants   not here  looking for nightlife   not here  However  if looking for accommodation that is super clean  has daily service and represents excellent value for money  then consider Emerald Suites  We spent three nights there and had no reason to regret the decision  
P =>   NICE QUIET AND ROOMY AHHHH  The Stay was great   Quiet  and relaxing  The only problem was no elevators for my mother  she has arthiritis on her knees and had a very hard time climbing tree flights of stairs   Next time we will ask for a first floor  
P =>   Comfortable affordable CLEAN SAFE Clean fully loaded rooms  Great laundry room and gym is half decent  Pool in very nice  Hot tub could use some work  Staff is friendly and helpful  Choose the right building and ask for a quiet spot if it is important to you  Some of the rules around the pool and grounds are not enforced too diligently unfortunately  People smoke on floors they ar not suppose to and around the pool  Overall  my stay was very satisfactory  I would definitely return and reccomend to others  
P =>  Good option for families We stayed there three times  It s not spectacular but ok  Good time to relax for a few days or between trips to national parks  One time we were given a room that was not properly cleaned and smelled  We reported it and were upgraded instantly  so no complaints there  Only drawback is the breakfast which is almost non existent  Pool area and fitness room  on the other hand  are pretty nice  What really sets this hotel apart is that you can have   bedroom suites for a really low rate  which is a very good option if you re traveling with older children  
P =>   Inexpensive alternative to the las Vegas Srip I stay at the Emerald Suites several times every year  I attend vintage Mustang events in and around Vegas  The Suites are less than     the price of staying at a casino  Its located at the south end of the strip so i avoid all the strip related traffic  The rooms have a full kitchen so I save money on my extended stays by eating in  I have stayed here   times already this year  
P =>   the best family trip ever Our family stayed at the Emerald Suites on Las Vegas Blvd last month for a two week stay We chose this hotel because it had kitchens and it wasn t right in the middle of the craziness on the strip We were able to go to the store and grocery shop just like we were at home  We saved a bundle cooking our own meals We had a two bedroom suite  so our son had his own bedroom and we had the privacy of our own bedroom both bedrooms had king sized beds Our room actually suite was pretty large and we even had a TV in our bedroom Our son enjoyed swimming in the pool everyday and my husband was able to do his regular exercise routine in the fitness center at the hotel I didn t have to find a laundry mat the hotel has two This hotel is one of the best family hotels we have stayed at in Vegas  It is clean and quite and the price we paid was great  
P =>   You get what you pay for  This is definitely a get what you pay for hotel  It was not what we had expected based on the pictures posted  The rooms are ALOT smaller than what they show  I do not recommend the pool  it s FREEZING  The rooms come with certain kitchen utensils appliances and if you don t check to make sure it s all there the hotel will charge you for what is missing  Also  we had asked for a crib for our daughter to stay in and they brought us a pack in play  Thankfully we had brought our own  They did have a great staff  They brought us whatever we needed when we asked and housekeeping did a wonderful job  
P =>   Very Impressed I am a single mother traveling with   small children   Attending a wedding and never being to Vegas   I was apprehensive  This hotel was the best decision     they have free shuttle service to and from the airport and also to the Mandalay Bay which is just a straight shot from the hotel   The room was like a mini apartment  It had a full size kitchen  pots and pans upon request  so we didnt have to eat out all the time  The staff were great from the shuttle driver who picked us up to the desk clerk to the gentleman she had help with luggage  I am coming back this summer with some friends to check out the nightlife and I already have reservations at Emerald Suites  
P =>   Great Value when in Vegas on a Budget The hotel is maybe    minutes from the main part of the strip if you drive straight down Las Vegas Blvd  It was nice and inexpensive  The rooms were clean and the shower was nice  If you are going to Vegas for fun  and simply need a place to lay your head or somewhere away from the limelight to rest  this is the place  The only negatives are that there were no elevators  we stayed on the  rd floor  and no wireless  
P =>  It s a cool place to stay    I will deffinately return to this hotel  The location was cool for me because it s away from the traffic of the strip  yet right down the street from the strip  It made me feel like I was at home  the set up is like an apartment  full kitchen and all  
P =>  It was nice until we went to bed     The grounds were clean and well maintained  The staff was friendly and helpful and offered tips upon check in  They say free internet is included  which it IS but it s dial up  not wireless  The room was a great value for the money  it was basically an apartment with a full kitchen      square feet with a livingroom and bedroom each with their own TV  wonderful if you have kids  They also are pet friendly  No elevator so if you have trouble with stairs  stay on the bottom floor  The hotel was a few miles from the strip but a   minute drive had you at Mandalay Bay and there was a CVS and mini mall with Starbucks ect about a   minute drive away  I was very satisfied with the place     until I went to bed  The matress was probably about    years old  It was so sunken in in the middle that it was visibly sloped and was like sleeping in a hamock  My husband and I slept rolled into each other  The worst part though was the springs  The bed was so worn out that the matress pad covering the springs was basically gone  It was like sleeping on a matress spring with a sheet over it  I had to lay my sweater down on the bed to keep the springs from digging into my skin  You could actually see the springs to the naked eye  And the worst part was that there were   beds in the room and they were both equally bad  It was late and we have   little kids so we didn t ask to switch rooms  it was just a one night stay so we decided just to get through it  Very nice hotel but I would never stay there again for fear of getting a similar room  It s a shame too because besides the beds  this is the kind of place that you decide to stay at everytime you go  There is no way that the management staff was unaware of the condition of the beds  Their deterioration was very advanced  The beds were a sharp contrast to the rest of the hotel  Really disappointing  
P =>   Best value for your dollar Friendly staff very helpful on every level of service  Our   week stay was the best value and we plan on staying again next year  
P =>   Very nice  Definitely a great place to stay  Wasn t sure what to expect  but was pleasantly surprised how nice it is  The staff was very nice  the rooms were spacious and clean  the grounds were well maintained and clean  The pool  gym and laundry area were great  The location was awesome  just south of the strip and  I don t know why anyone would complain about the area  it is in a quiet area on S  Las Vegas Blvd  just moments away from everything  I would definitely stay here again  
P =>   Great place to stay for a reasonable price The hotel room was awesome as well as the staff  The price was very reasonable  The rooms were very clean and were cleaned everyday with good care  I would recommend for anyone to stay there  Thank you for the great stay  I will be staying there again  
P =>  What more could you want for the price  I stay at Emerald Suites on South Las Vegas Blvd about once a week  My business has an office nearby  It s clean  comfortable and consistent  You get free phone calls  free internet and a full kitchen in every unit  They have kings  doubles  one bedroom and two bedroom units  all for very reasonable prices  The nicest thing is that this hotel is on the strip  but south of the hotels  away from the traffic and the bustle of the city  It s a quiet place to stay  I won t say that they don t have goof ups like any other hotel  But the staff is extremely responsive   I ve stayed here a hundred times and if I ever had a problem  they were very quick to respond  They have a good corporate program here too  and many large companies use them  Try it  
P =>   Jail is more comforting  UNBELIEVABLE   Good place to score drugs and hookers if that s your thing  If not  you would be better off turning youself over to Las Vegas Metro PD and asking them to furnish you with a cell for the night  You would be safer and certainly more comfortable  The staff was pleasant enough and the lobby looked inviting and that s about the most positive thing I can say about this property  First  take note of the fact people actually LIVE at this property  We re not talking about folks who are temporarily staying while their home is being readied  No  we re talking cat litter boxes out in front of rooms  whole families returning from the grocery store  etc  The toilet in our room didn t flush  The blinds were broken  taped  and missing ensuring my wife wouldn t sleep during the night  People will regularly walk by your room choking  joking  and yelling to one another ALL hours of the day and night  The shower backed up into the sink which wouldn t drain  The room looked like it hadn t been cleaned in quite some time  The bed was nearly as comfortable as the curb stone I found myself asleep upon during a rather forgetable night in college  We booked for a week and left within    hours pointing out the problems to the management only to find they charged my credit card     of what my whole stay would have cost  this is after a partial refund   They have an exhorbitant pet  quot fee quot  which is a joke considering most pets are cleaner than any of Emerald Suites  guests I saw and I can t fathom what possible damage a dog cat could do to one of these rooms that hasn t already been done  You won t have to look long nor hard to find something better for your money  I lived in Las Vegas for    years up until this last trip to retrieve things from storage and I can honestly say this is THE worst motel no tell I ve ever seen in Vegas and that includes Budget Suites and Downtown weekly rentals  Motel   next to the Tropicana Hotel  Tropicana  amp  Harmon I believe  is a better value and better location  Travelers beware  
P =>   Great staff service We stayed onthe night of uary          with Reservation ID           The check in was done with great attention by a fine staff  The facilities pretty good and the suite is ample with very good furnishing  including a full kitchen and free internet  The only thing is that they need to upgrade their towels  they were small and old and this does take from the hotel overall rating  The staff is excellent and helpful and corteous  that is their main asset  
P =>  hidden jem A great hotel  close to the strip with great front desk staff  Free internet   great TV channel selection and a kitchen to help save some money by etaing in  The room was clean and spacious  Loved it  My person favorite when I m on the Strip  
P =>    Great accommodations wonderful stay great value  My boyfriend and I stayed at the Emerald Suites for four days and three nights  When we arrived at the hotel  we were greeted pleasantly by the staff at the front desk  We arrived to the hotel earlier than our scheduled check in time  however the staff at the front desk checked the computer for an available room and checked us in right away  When we arrived to our room  we were very surprised at the quality of the rooms since the price was such a steal  The rooms were an A   very clean  spacious and had many amenities  We really enjoyed our stay at Emerald Suites and would definitely stay there again  
P =>   Enjoyed stay at Emerald Suites My partner and I stayed at the Emerald Suites   weeks ago and really enjoyed our stay  The suites are well equipped and spacious and very very clean  Only negative side would be the blinds didn t seem to work but otherwise we would have no hesitation in staying there again  
P =>  Terrible    I found myself at this hotel after being bumped by US Airways and they put me up for a  quot free quot  night at this  quot timeshare quot   This place reminds me of my college apartment  it even has the same furniture  These couches are uncomfortable  the bed has no support and although it is clean  it is a one start motel at best  
P =>  Not a Bad Place A group of us was booked at Emerald Suites for a couple of weeks on a business trip  Most of us stayed in the   bedroom suites  I must say  when we first heard where they were putting us  I was a little aprehensive about what the place would be like but I was suprised when we got there First  the rooms were very clean and pretty up to date  Some suites had flat panel TV s with computer access in the living room while others did not  I understand they are slowly upgrading all the suites this way  Only one bedroom had a TV in it  Every suite had a full Kitchen with stove  microwave  refridgerator  toaster and dishwasher  When you used dishes and left them in the sink  most of the time housekeeping would load the dishwasher and run it  The bedrooms were neat with king sized beds and the rooms had walk in closets  My only complaints about the bedrooms would be to have more drawer space and to have an air conditioner in both rooms  One of the bedrooms had an air conditioner while the other had a fan in the wall that moved the air from the living room into the bedroom  The fan was noisy and when you closed the bedroom door  it didn t help much  Housekeeping was in every day  If we had a proble  we let the front desk know and they were promply there to correct the problem Our group did have a problem with some noisy guests  some of us were on second shift  and when we complained to management  they asked them to leave  I think the only real problem with this place is the location  Next door is a gas station and a country night club and across the street there is a liquer store  If you want to go out to eat you either have to get in a car to drive somewhere  walk a half mile to the South Point casino or order out  Nothing is close to the place  Whould I stay here on a personal trip  probably not  But as a group out there for business for a couple of weeks  it is not a bad place  
P =>   Shabby Not Chic My two friends and I have just returned from a conference in Las Vegas and have to say that we were all VERY disappointed in the quality of the Emerald Suites on Las Vegas Blvd  While the room was quite spacious  with two bedrooms and a living area  it is shabby beyond belief  The phone didn t work  the TV didn t work  one bed had a very visible horizontal slant to the left  which nearly rolled you out of bed after awhile  The bathroom cabinet door was at least   inches too narrow and you could view most of the contents inside without even opening it  There was no air conditioner in one bedroom  only a fan in the wall with major gaps all around it like someone cut out the hole with a kitchen knife To make matters worse  we left at   a m  and returned  exhausted  at    p m  to a dirty room that had no maid service  The beds were unmade  we had no fresh towels and the phone didn t work so we had to make the trek to the office and deal with everything ourselves  We were told that the maids didn t clean the room because we were still there and the door was locked  That was completely untrue  as the maids started at   a m  and we were long gone be this used to be a nice place when it first opened but it needs major repairs and TLC  While the front desk staff were friendly  it is no substitute for a hovel of a room  Save yourself the trouble and look elsewhere  We certainly won t stay there again  
P =>   Suite time What a suite time  I was completely impressed with my stay atEmerald Suites  Close enough to the casinos to play  and yet the property and room were quiet and relaxing The room was in  like new  condition with a full kitchen and completely separate bedroom  unlike some  suites    and the bed was so comfortable I must have slept half the time  Great for business travelers too  as I am  The staff was attentive and helpful  the grounds were clean and groomed  and even the fitness room was in good shape I recommend Emerald Suites  and I will stay again  I just booked another   nights  Happy traveling J McLeod 
P =>   Nice  I have been at the Vagabond Inn  trahsy  and Circus Circus  but I like this one much better It s nice and clean  the bathrooms are small  but it comes with a full kitchen and it s very cheap  The swimming pool isn t as big as it looks like The tv got many chanels  but I don t think it had HBO  
P =>   True Gem My family and I stayed at Emerald Suites and loved it  The pool was great for the kids and the staff was very helpful The kitchens were wonderful and the rooms are large and clean  We will be returning to las vegas and when we do this is where we will stay  
P =>  Awesome Stay I am from San Diego and do a lot of business out in Las Vegas  I always stay at Emerald Suites  The rooms are clean and spacious  the staff was very friendly  and the location was amazing  Would definitely recommend this for any business traveler  
P =>   good for its price a good place for a good price my friends and i stay at this hotel for a weekend  it was a two bed suit rooms were big  it had a kitchen in case you like cooking  not fully equip but had the necesary this place is quiet and away from the strip  it s good for its price the only thing that we did not like about was that didn t have enough towells and they don t replace them that often i had to request them as well as pillows  but the staff was very polite and nice they supplied my request really fast so if you planning to come here for just remember to bring a pillow and extra towell if don d wanna be requesting them a good place to stay if you are on a budget   
P =>   Love my stayed at Emerald   its like home    Stayed in Emerald Suites for  days  nights in a two bed and it was awesome      it has its own terrace  kitchen  w  a large frigde n stove   which not many hotels offer that      I felt like if I was at home   lol    the rooms are nice and has lots of room too   I would definitely stay over again    and the price was worth every dollar         and the staff was very friendly   Thanks Love  Grace 
P =>   great grounds  Grounds  amp  pool were great  The rooms were ok  didn t have curtains that worked very well  Need blackout curtains Only   drawer in dressers opened  
P =>  Extended Stay accomodations There are several Emerald Suites in Vegas  this one is located at      South Las Vegas Blvd  about three miles south of I     I just got back from a business trip to Vegas and dealing with the management staff at the Emerald Suites was an absolute pleasure  I spent approximately three weeks at this hotel where my folks occupied over sixty five rooms  The extended stay accomodations where well maintained  security was excellent and the grounds facilities received attention  daily The hotel itselt is located in the surburbs  which is convienent to the downtown area yet located close to a Pharamacy  Grocery Store or even a Target  The hotel is located minutes from I     a major casino  South Point   chain resturants and just about anything else you would need during a business trip or vacation Again  I can t say enough about the staff at the hotel  All hotels have problems that arise during your stay  the good one make it a point to ensure that the problems are minimal and taken care of immediately  Emerald Suites did both   I too read the reviews on this hotel prior to my departure  They have done some remodeling since most of them were written and the reviews listed just don t do them justice  Try it  I believe you will be pleased with your stay    
P =>  Great Find A few friends and I decided to do a spur of the moment Las Vegas trip for the  th of y and stopped at one of the first places we saw  The prices were great for broke college students and for the price the rooms were big and very clean  The shuttle that took us to the the strip and picked us up was great  If you looking for somewhere to stay for great prices I suggest staying here  
P =>   Loved the Emerald Suites I have stayed at both this Emerald Suites and the Emerald Suites Cameron on a few different occasions  Every experience I have had at both locations has been great  Their locations are great because they are very close to the strip but you don t have to pay the price of the big hotels  The rooms were clean and the staff was incredibly helpful and considerate  If you ever make a trip to Vegas and don t want to spend the money of a major hotel on the strip I highly recommend staying here you won t be disappointed  
P =>  Best for groups or families I m from Southern California and have spent much of the last    years coming to Vegas  so I am quite familiar with all the hotels and such  For this trip we needed a bit more space than usual  I needed a place that could accommodate my family of five plus one  my    yr old daughter begged to bring her friend along   So looked online and found this place offering a two bedroom suite at     per night and that sounded sweet to me There isn t much to say  this place is your average extended stay facility  The place was as advertised  no frills  What I got was a small two bedroom apartment  the rooms were decent however the living area was smaller that I expected but acceptable nonetheless  If you are planning to cook as we did you may need to bring or buy a few things as they only supply the bare  bare minimum for kitchen needs  I was surprised by the closet space  one walk in in each room that seemed bigger than a hotel room I had in New York last year  Pool wasn t awesome but again acceptable  And one fact that I just loved was that it was quiet  It s located way down Las Vegas Blvd just a few blocks away from South Point and it s a      minute drive from the Mandalay Bay  There we only a couple things that bothered us  first  Housekeeping  This had nothing to do with the cleanliness of the room but rather that old Vegas issue   towels  As stated above we had six people in our room and only two sets of towels and getting more wasn t a speedy process  I have done a fair amount of traveling so I will say in their defense that they were par for the course when compared to similar hotels I ve been in but it s still a pain in the butt  Second was another guest had his vehicle broken into  The place and the neighborhood feel very safe and there isn t much traffic at night  plus being from Los Angeles I have seen this sort of thing happen more times than I can remember  Just don t store valuables in the car All in all it s a split decision for me  if you are single and ready to mingle then this is NOT the place for you  stay on the strip where you are sure to have some big fun  But if you are well into your    s married with children that you have happened to bring to Vegas and are staying a few nights then I think this place it right up your alley  
P =>   Everything I Expected The staff was super friendly and it was a very quiet place to stay considering how big it is  There was plenty of room for me  amp  my fiance  Had a full kitchenette  refigerator  plenty of closet space  and very comfy bed  The only downside was that there weren t enough hangers in the closet  the disposal had a weird smell  only when you let water go down that side  and the t v  in the room didn t have the cable cord  we were hardly in the room   too busy   the casinos   
P =>   Awesome Deal Stood at the Emerald Suite for the first time  usually stay in the casinos but wanted to try something away from the crowds but close enough to the fun and I found the suites to be big for the price  its brand new  the front desk people were very accomodating and the location was awesome  I am definately staying there from now on  
P =>  Excellent Hotel This hotel is so convenient and accommodating  There is a full kitchen in each room which make a hotel stay wonderful  The staff was very friendly and the room service attendants were very efficient  I will definately stay at Emerald Suites again the next time I am in Las Vegas  
P =>  Best Las vegas Trip    I booked my reservation Via the toll free number and spoke with a very friendly Woman  When i checked into the Hotel The front desk was very nice and very helpful  All the staff the i came across were very pleasant The property itself is has a very relaxing atmosphere  When i walked into my room i was so excited to see it had a full kitchen with all the necessities  We saved quit a bit of money not having to go out to dinner all the time  It was very comfortable in the room  My family loved the grounds and enjoyed our time in the pool  Long story short i will comeback and stay here every time   As far as location it is not right in the middle of everything but it is just a quick drive to the main attractions  There is also a nice casino just down the street with very good resturants  There is even a mall just down the street  I loved it here    
P => 	 A DIAMOND IN THE DESERT             They have so much to offer and all for a price you can t beat As an extended stay guest I took the money I saved stayinghere as opposed to the high priced hotels on the strip andbought myself a couple nice dinners and hit the casinosthat are close by   Southpoint and Silverton Casino  The rooms are spacious and I love having a seperate bedroomfrom the kitchen  amp  living room to have guests in  Also I love having a TV in the bedroom and living room  The staff wasawesome and very helpful  when I asked for towels etc  theywere at my doorstep in   minutes  The room I stayed in was immaculate and very homey  I also took advantage ofthe beautiful pool with a cascading water fall and their workoutroom  There is no restaurant on the property but there are tworestaurants within walking distance so that is not a problem My recommendation save your money for the other thingsto enjoy and stay here you ll be glad you did  
P =>  Quiet and big rooms We stayed   nights at the Emerald Suites  We had chosen this motel because is had rooms far away from the highway which meant that they might be quiet  And it is true  as long as you have a room in the blocks at the back  The  quot suite quot  is a large bedroom with bathroom and a living room with a small kitchen  It is nothing fancy but we got a great price as Drop ins and it was clean  It is a    Minute drive to the Casinos on the Strip  On the way you pass a huge Outlet mall where you can spend hours and lots of dollars  You have to pay for the Wifi in the room but it is free in the Lobby  The staff at the reception was very friendly and efficient  As soon as you miss anything in your room someone comes around right away  We don t know about break fast as we did it ourselves in the room  but there was the usual coffee available  For someone who doesn t need to stay in a Casino this is a great alternative  We would go there again  
P =>  GREAT PRICES I stayed at Emerald Cameron in ch           Great value  Across for the Orleans Hotel and Casino  All Suites with Kitchens  Great for traveling with kids  Very Clean and Pool was great Had to return for a conference at Southpointe last week  Stayed at Emerald Las Vegas BLVD  Nice Experience  Shuttle picked me up at Airport and took me and picked me up at Southpointe  Great properties for the budget concious traveler 
P =>   You can do much better Accomodation here is not exactly cheap so you might be disappointed by the standard provided  Whilst you do get plenty of space  the room we had was below par  The furnishing were very old  outdated  stained and worn out  The staff were not very helpful and  all in all  it wasn t a very pleasant experience Dollar for dollar you can get do much better and in far more central locations  My advice   avoid it unless you are desperate  
P =>   Vile place to be Save your self the hassle and stay in one of the major and reputable hotels in town  If you want a  quot bargain quot  you have better options  The staff is rude and incompetent  The property is just gross  The rooms although they are big  that s it  The website is a joke  I can assure you  you will not get what you paid for here  There are plenty of better hotels near this MOTEL that are near the same price  In fact  the word MOTEL doesn t even describe this monstrosity  I suspect the staff has written the  quot good quot  reviews as I can t imagine that anyone would ever enjoy their stay here unless they have stayed in worse places on a regular basis  One last thing  be sure to bring bug spray  YOU LL NEED IT  
P =>   crap service stayed there for   weeks   paid      a week and got my room serviced for towels and made my bed   times   what a jokealso on the second week  tuesday  my tub started to drain really slow and by thursday it wouldnt drain at all so i called and asked for it to be fixed   times and they got it done on friday  i could not shower at all on thursday and then they had the balls to tell me i never called   times to have it fixed   i spoke to the manager a women what a        and to top it off they have these goofy mexicans knocking on doors and asking if your checking out an hour before checkout     beware of creepy people slipping coupons in your door all night 
P =>   Nice for family vacation We had a   bd suite   each bedroom with a king size bed  The mattresses were very comfortable  I have a bad back  and did not wake up stiff and sore in the morning  The suite was very clean and had a full kitchen  fully stocked with dishes  pots  pans  coffee maker  coffee  sugar and creamer  Towel sets were plentiful   the bathroom and each bedroom were stocked with towels  soaps  lotions  and shampoos  The pool and fitness center were very clean  and not crowded  The hotel staff were pleasant and helpful  and late maid service was offered with a smile  The hotel is at the South end of the strip   very close to interstates    and     access  yet far enough from the strip that the traffic is light  We were very pleased with our stay and recommend this hotel  It s not luxury  but a great over all value if that s what you are looking for  
P =>  okay place for the price Traveled with some buddies who made the reservation for thier last minute vegas marriage  If you look up the directions for the hotel and put in a more popular hotel on the strip you will find that the hotel is about   miles away  For the price and last minute arrangements it was okay  The hotel was clean  the people at the counter were courteous and there was ample space for us to lounge  As the lucky couple got ready  the remaining group walked over to a bar  think it was called jack s or something and had some ice cold beers  The atmosphere was relaxing  
P =>   did not like it suites   they had a kitchen but we had   rooms and each room had like   fork    knives  no plates  no pots  one glass  etc  there is a fridge  toaster mine never worked I told the reception and they never change it  the bedrooms are small and the beds are not comfortable the sheets didn t look like clean also it doesn t look like a safe place to stay  there is no elevator and the stairs are narrow so don t carry much luggage for us it was imposible we were   families  The big long big train wakes you up anytime during the night the railways are just next to it and room service is not goodI do not recomend this hotel 
P =>   A Good Value If Not Perfect I was in Vegas celebrating my younger brother s   st birthday with a bunch of my cousins  For a   bedroom suite w  four full sized beds and a love seat in the separate living room  we comfortably accomodated   people and on one evening    We were in Vegas to party and needed a clean place to get some sleep and take a shower  The hotel shows slight wear and tear  but the value was very good at     per night  Fri and Sat   There are spacious walk in closets in each bedroom that we used as changing rooms as there was only one bathroom  I booked the basic quad    room   beds  but there is a more sophisticated upgraded room available w  better tvs and such  The pool was lovely  but the chairs need replacing The place could use some updating and a little more attention to detail in the kitchen wouldn t hurt  the paring knife was dirty   However  all the glasses were clean as was the fridge and that was all we needed  for our liquor and lots of bottled water    On the whole  the suite was fairly large and clean  There is an updated self serve and large laundry room  Too bad there are no elevators  It reminded me of some college dorm suites apartments Important  It is not close to the main Strip  You will need to take a cab  bus  something  We rented a mini van and split the cost and had a party bus of sorts  It is not a place for a romantic getaway but I would reccomend it if you are traveling in a group and are budget minded  The reservation staff was excellent but a few members of the front desk were not up to par  At     am I called for and got a late check out for  pm  Check out was generally at     I felt harassed by someone on the phone who unprofessionallyasked without introduction  quot are you checking out  quot  She used a terse  ghettoish tone that peeved me especially since I had already called It serves it s purpose as a place to crash with your buddies after a long night on the town  
P =>   totally fine my company booked us at Emerald Suites on S  Las vegas blvd while on a temp  job assignment for   months  I cannot believe the negative reviews and you shouldn t either   The place was very clean  modern and very well kept  These are  quot extended stay suites quot  so yes  some people are there for more than a night or two  I work in the hotel casino industry and work at a  quot   star resort quot  and I can tell you you wouldn t be rubbing elbows with the  quot rich and famous quot     or quiet  respectful of their surroundings  types there either  Clientele at emerald suites typical of what yu will find anywhere in LV  I loved the location   on the strip but still out of the middle of major traffic and easy to drive over to stores nearby  The convenience store in front of the bldg  was a great to have  an easy walk   and a real plus  One tip   the shuttle from airport was very slow    I would spring for a cab as the airport is very close by  the shuttle Only goes to Mandalay Bay and airport   not  quot anywhere in LV  quot    but that is the So  end of the strip and you can walk the strip from there  True   some of the front desk people aren t Einsteins but I found overall the staff there  esp  maintainence on the ball and friendly  
P =>   Not what I had expected AT ALL     DO NOT BE MISLED BY THE WEBSITE  I was sent to Las Vegas on a business trip for one month and my lovely company and they put me up at the Emerald Suites on Las Vegas Blvd  The place really is ghetto  I found roches in my room and when asked for a new room it was almost a hassle for Rhonda  the front desk clerk or manager   I trapped two of them under a cup for the managers to see and they could care less  The actually asked me if I wanted someone to come and  quot spray quot   I demanded a new room instead  The walls really are paper thin  I heard dogs barking from the adjacent room ALL night long  Yes  they allow pets to stay w  you  It was also evident to me that some people use this place as their perm  residence  There were often many  unsupervised  children running around the courtyard all day and night  They claim to be the  quot Jewel of the Suite Life quot   that is seriously the funniest thing I have heard in a long time  It was an absolute nightmare  Very trashy  One plus  they had free high speed internet  but it didn t always work  
P =>   Don t believe the website We stayed here because we couldn t get a reservation anywhere else  Yes  there apparently were bugs  because they announced that they  quot were spraying for bugs quot   Rooms were very drabby  The furniture was stained and I didn t want to sit on it  No tv in the bedroom  Fortunately  the kitchen and bath area were fairly clean  The pool looks big on the web site  but is actually small  There was also a discrepancy between the price quoted to us on the phone and what they tried to charge us  The shuttle to the strip was a plus if you caught it at the right time  
P =>  awesome value i dont understand some of the bad reviews  this hotel is a steal  only a few minute drive from the strip and it was     a night on weeknights through expedia  my fave thing about the hotel is the free high speed internet in the room  very clean  you can park right next to your room  full kitchen  great price  also  i got maid service every day  i read a couple reviews where they said they didnt get maid service  i have no complaints about this hotel  
P =>  Nice place away from the strip Hubby and I stayed here for   nights over Memorial Day weekend  We had a one bedroom suite on the  rd floor  After reading reviews  I was a little hesitant  but we found the Emerald Suites to be very nice  clean  and the staff to be accommodating  Our suite was a one bedroom unit on the  rd floor  Our only complaint was that there is no elevator  After walking all over the strip  by the time we returned to the hotel at night  it would have been nice to take an elevator to the  rd floor  We found the suite to be clean and it fit our needs for the weekend  It was nice having a refrigerator to keeps drinks and snacks cold The pool area is very nice  however  there were a lot of out of control kids there who s parents guardians were not watching them  A security guard came around  but didn t say anything to the kids or their parents  Apparently a child had an  quot accident  in the spa and it was closed on Sunday  Security really should handle out of control kids so those of us without kids and those customers who s kids are behaving don t have to deal with it  Overall  we enjoyed our stay at Emerald Suites and would stay there again  
P => Roaches here   We stayed here only because we had nowhere else to take our dog  But it was a big mistake  We had roaches  We saw at least one each of the   days  GROSS   This place is too much of an extended stay hotel that people have mistreated and trashed  I could only imagine the disgust that attracted the roaches in the first place We will never consider staying here again  
P => Wonderful time here  I had booked my stay here before I read these reviews  After reading them  I was ready to cancel  But I decided that I would wait until I actually saw the hotel myself  I m glad I chose to do that  because the hotel was great  I had booked one bed  but they only had a suite with   beds and it wasn t even an issue  There was enough towels for   people  and our suite was made up perfectly every day  Oh  by the way before I forget  I booked it through hotelhotline and paid only     a night except for Sunday  which was     Memorial Day weekend  too    Since I had prepaid  my check in took   minutes  no kidding  The suite had a complete kitchen  including a stove  microwave  dishwasher  fridge  etc  The grounds were immaculate and even though there was a lot of children I had my son   it was VERY quiet  I didn t use it  but there was a large laundry room with    new washers and    new dryers that also had soda and snack machines  I didn t go in the pool  but whenever I was coming or going I saw plenty of people in or around it  so it must have been nice  My only complaint was that the remote for the tv only went up and down  which was kind of boring when you would look for something to watch  But then again  I was in Vegas  There was a lot to do other than watch tv So I don t know what happened with the other people  All I know is that I had a great time  Oh yeah  they have this thing called IDL  which means that they forward their registration list to LV police  So they know who is staying there and if they have warrants or something  they ll get picked up  Very safe  
P => Perfect for a family trip  We were so pleased with this hotel  The price was right  and the space was just perfect for us  Having a kitchen in the room let us save a lot of money  The pool was great  The housekeeping wasn t great  but they would do what you asked    it was just surprising to have to ask for it  If you re staying here  be sure to bring pans and plates because they aren t provided  but are available for an extra     day   We really liked being able to actually shut a door between the living area and the bedrooms  This is better than at some  quot suites quot  where the bedroom is really just a section of a big open floor plan  All around we were impressed and would definitely stay again  
P =>  Disappointed We were disappointed in our experience at the Suites  There were some wonderful features about the place but we had some odd things happen for a   star hotel  One was when we had to call down to the office to ask for a roll of toilet paper and the response to my quest was I could walk to the office and get one  The Security guard brought it up    minutes later  Also  I still can t believe that there was no bed spread on the bed  Usually there are at least   hangers in the closet  The housekeeping was a little bit to be desired There was chocolate on the front of the fridge the whole time  they vaccumed made the bed and changed the   towel sets and we were there for   days In the full kitchen  we had no glasses to drink with we had a micro and fridge worked great and electric stove no oven  it was nicely painted and nice furniture the people were pleasant 
P =>   bon rapport qualit  prix  
P => 
P =>   Great Staff Great Location Great price Thanks to the Orleans across the way being booked on the day I needed  I got to stay at the Emerald Suites  In fact they suggested it  It was perfect  When booking  thought I picked the wrong property  When this was realized the staff did not hestiate to make the change with no issues or rudeness that other hotel staff would have done  Even the trip from the airport was great with a shuttle driver that was delightful  knowledgable and engaging  If you didn t know anything about Las Vegas  you everything about Las Vegas by the time you reached the property  I will be back at the Emerald and I will be taking friends and referring friends for their trip to Las Vegas  
P =>   Not bad   but a mixed bag    The Emerald Suites on Cameron is kind of a quirky place   likely a converted apartment building  instead of a purpose built motel  I suspect this because of several things   although the buildings are   story  they don t have elevators  which can be difficult for persons with mobility issues or a lot to lug around  and probably gives the housekeeping staff a good cardio workout    I wound up on    but didn t mind since it meant no chance of some heavy footed plodder above me   the rooms aren t laid out like most  quot extended stay quot  ones   they have separate bedrooms  without a phone   which can be a challenge  and large kitchens   the finishes aren t motel like  including the absence of drapes   or anything to hook them on  the importance of which is detailed below  That being said  my room was comfortable  with a trim level akin to a discount chain  Red Roof  Econo Lodge  and was waaay cheaper than the nearby Orleans  especially with their  quot activity spa quot  fee and daily internet charges   where I was attending an event There were  however  some issues that keep me from giving this facility an robust endorsement    The internet service is via an ethernet  quot cat   quot   cable  instead of wireless  and while it s free  the service was maddeningly inconsistent  constant stalling  failures to load pages  and response that frequently reminded me of the wonderful days of  quot dial up quot   The staff tried resetting the server  which helped once  but the second time when it got no better I was advised that  quot if someone s downloading a movie it can get really slow quot   Great I wasted a LOT of time trying to just do things like check e mail or research attractions   if you need reliable service for work related things there s a good chance you ll be pulling on your hair after a short time They have some cables to lend  but the one I got was in bad shape  I originally thought it might be the issue  so I got one at Big Lots  just        The lack of drapes  just blinds on the sliding balcony door and bedroom window  lead to a big surprise when I went to bed the first night  an annoying level of light leaking into the room  from the fixtures that illuminate the sidewalks between buildings   I could face the mirrored closet door and see myself   with the lights off  Luckily I could borrow a tablecloth and clips from a vendor friend at the event to cover the blinds     My unit  and others  it appeared  had a noticeable gap at the bottom of the door  this increased hallway noise and meant that the smells of pan fried chicken and charred toast wafted into my room  with the latter giving me a start   thought it might be a fire    Got a towel from housekeeping to put across the threshold     There s a business just north of the property that appears to do metal fabrication and feels compelled to bang a lot of large metal containers around very early in the morning   it sounded like a dumpster truck driver training class  My room was on the south side  so I only noticed it on the days I was outside early   no issue if you re not sleeping past  AM I have to say that everyone I encountered on the staff was very pleasant and courteous   must ve had a turnover from the staff from other reviews As for that other reviewer s complaint about hot water   I take showers that only last about     minutes  and the water was ankle deep in the tub when I was done  If you re still covered in soap    MINUTES into a warm hot shower  you ve got bigger issues to worry about   like avoiding bankruptcy from budget busting home water heating bills  Just what a desert town needs   people taking    gallon showers  
P =>   Friendly Staff and clean rooms  Loved the shuttle bus staff   st impression was a good one  The livingroom is nicely decorated  Kitchen very clean as well as the bathroom and bedrooms  The reception staff were friendly and helpful  The maid was helpful with extra coffee and soap shampoo when we needed it  Loved the pool and hot tub  The hot tub was good and hot and the jets were great after a long day of walking and sight seeing  J  Connell  Hamilton  Ontario  Canada 
P =>  loved my stay loved my stay got the   bd suite and i loved it  it was big 
P =>   Free Internet   You Get What You Pay For  I ve stayed at the Emerald Suites Cameron for   week stays in      and      It offers the features I m looking for    Unlike the casinos  I don t have to walk six miles to get from my car to the room    It has much more room than a standard hotel room   a separate bedroom  kitchen  and small balcony    It boasts the rarest of features in LV   free internet  Trouble is  the connection is either dead slow  or non existent  especially during the evening hours  when other guests are sharing the line Despite repeated calls to the front desk  the service never improved  It seems that with any hotel with free internet access  the front desk has a different method of accessing the internet than the guestrooms  The reason  I suspect  is that the front desk needs a rock solid connection  which the guestroom internet service does NOT provide So  I won t be staying here next trip It s a shame  because the location is right across from the Orleans  which offers a shuttle to the strip For those not concerned with internet access  The Emeralds Suites Cameron provides basic accommodation  I paid around     a night  
P =>   Quiet Roomy and close to everything  This place is like the  quot residence quot  hotels with kitchens  bedrooms  living area  The kitchen was fully equipped  Great for people with young children who might want to have snacks or meals in the room  We wanted a separate room  with a door  for our    year old visiting with us  Place is a little worn  but not noisy or smelly like a lot of the Vegas Strip or off strip hotels  Perfect if you have your own car  it is about       miles from the strip and   minute walk to a great casino hotel with tons of amenities  
P =>  Great place to stay on a budget We stayed   nights in y      and paid only     in total   A great big suite  bedroom  living room  kitchen and bathroom  Kitchen equipment was a little sparse though  Had a top floor suite but no lifts unfortunately so getting heavy baggage up was a problem  Room was very hot on arrival and it took about    hours to get the temperature down with the air con on full No breakfast on site   go across the road to the Orleans which is adequate  just  The location is very quiet   most noise on site was other guests and their families  However  we were well away from the pool which is a problem area for noise Staff were very helpful   security guys were ever watchful  
P =>  The best Place to stay while in vegas This is the perfect place  We have stayed here on more than one occasion and will not stay anywhere else  The staff and hotel is perfect in all aspects  
P =>  Very accomodating Great location  Staff very accomodating staff for special needs 
P =>  Clean Quiet and Conveniant made my trip a success  Location was important and this property provided a quiet atmosphere with a very clean room and all the amenities that made you feel right at home  With familiar stores nearby  quick access to major streets and a large popular casino within walking distance  this location was perfect for all my needs  Being able to prepare small meals was a real plus and helped me stay on schedule  I am looking forward to my next business trip and another stay at this facility  
P =>   What a Great Hotel Apt  Wow   We loved staying here and want to go back with our kids  It snowed in in Las Vegas and the Airport sent us to Emerald Suites They picked us up at the Airport in a shuttle  took us to the Hotel where we were treated with the utmost respect and joy despite the despereate wet  and snowy conditions we were in  For        a night  west of the strip closeby  we were so surprised to see it was a SUITE  with an Apartment like feel to it  A great Kitchen  Dining room  Heater  Yeah    TWO BIG rooms  a Super clean environment  the Bathroom was just ample enough  extra towels and blankets in the hall linen closet  and in the living room a Huge TV with delivery menus  In the morning we saw it had a pool  laundry  soda water machines  etc and we walked across the street to  quot The New Orleans Casino quot   HUGE  great restaurants  lots of choices for Casino Playing   There is plenty of parking and they told us it is  appx       a week for a   BR  We will definintely be coming back with our whole family   
P =>   Great VALUE  Full blown suites  includes stocked kitchen  no food of course  just the other stuff    the kitchen comes with pots and pans  dishes  utensils  and coffee pot  microwave  etc  This is a REAL suite  separate bedrooms  separate kitchen and dining  The laundry room is very nice  and the pool is clean and has a jacuzzi  Excellent location  right next door to a casino  VERY close to the strip  A must see to believe deal in LV  
P =>  Just what we needed We were out in Las Vegas for the weekend for our son s basketball tournament and we stayed at this hotel  The hotel was located just by the tournament  the rooms were clean and spacious  and the staff was very helpful with anything we needed  
P =>   One of the Best in Las Vegas This is probably one of the best in Vegas  First of all the location was great   close to the Las Vegas Strip  stores and gas stations  We had been driving around trying to find a hotel with vacancy and I m so glad we came across this one  The check in was easy and the staff very helpful  Of course  once we walked into our room we were impressed  The two bedrooms had plenty of room and were separated from the living room area  The kitchen had everything    stove  refrigerator  microwave  toaster  it even was stocked with all the dishes we needed  This is a Great Hotel with everything I would definitely go back again and again  
P =>   A Great Stay This hotel is centrally located just off the strip and is walking distance and a short cab ride to all major casinos  The rooms are very spacious and clean  also it was nice having a full kitchen  The staff was excellent  Very nice  
P =>  Excellent Hotel My family and I stayed at Emerald Suites Cameron during the month of ch        The convenience of having a kitchen in the room was so convenient and saved us a lot of money  which is what most people need right now  We stayed in a two bedroom suite and I have to say it was one of the cleanest rooms I have ever stayed in  The staff was very friendly and helpful  I have already made my next reservation and will always stay at Emerald Suites whenever I visit Las Vegas  You can t beat it   
P =>  worst hotel in usa worst hotel in U S A  rooms are stinky staff is outrageously rude especially the female with chinese looks is very very ill mannered and not apt for hotel industry  no elevators does not deserve any sort of rating 
P =>   Great Rates Great property with great rates  I stayed while attending a convention  Can t beat the price  The property was very clean   It is an older property but location and price was great  Pool area was very nice Small kitchen was great for morning juice and coffee Just steps from the Orleans Hotel Casino Give it a try           Great if you are traveling with kids  
P =>  Probably the worst place I ve stayed in    years My experience with this hotel was so negative  I almost don t know where to start  The room was dark and poorly lit  the view from the window was of an opposing brick wall balcony  the bathroom was a disaster  with sharp broken ceramic tiles on the floor next to the tub  and a stained shower curtain  The bath towels could ve passed for hand towels at any other hotel The  quot free high speed internet quot  worked only intermittently  and they had no wireless  The bedroom had no TV  There is no food available on the premises  The picture on the wall over the desk was an empty frame  with the matting and border damaged   apparently a previous guest stole the actual picture  I have pictures of the bath and room to prove my statements When I called the front desk to ask for another room and explained why  it was as if they couldn t have cared less  Before checking out I asked if I could leave my bags in my room an hour past check out  and the manager rudely refused  The only positive thing I can think of is that they re a close walk away from the Orleans Casino  and a small mall with a variety of small restaurants Now I know why they were still available when I was looking for last minute accomodations to attend CES  I have travelled extensively across the globe on business for the past    years  and the closest thing I can compare this place to is an Eastern European hotel  Very subpar  Avoid it unless you re only other alternative is to sleep in your car Jim from Boston 
P =>  Loved it  We stayed over the christmas weekend   got a great deal on this hotel   loved it for the price    if u rent a car  this is a nice place to stay   its quiet and away from the strip   abt     miles maybe   stayed in a   bedroom   we didnt use the kitchen  but loved the fact that there is a tv in the living room as well as the bedroom   very cozy   we got a  st floor apt which was great   u might want to request  st floor apt  if u have too much luggage  
P =>   Great It had some things I was not use to  This included a kitchen with dishes  pots  pans  a refrig and a dishwasher  The maids to the dish washing  It was right accross the street from the Orleans      yards accross a quiet street   If you require two rooms it would be less money to reserve a suite at this place  The size was good  The distance from the car is short  Parking is ample and the rooms very nice  If we are going to the Orleans again with another couple  we are going here instead  
P =>   It s an excellent place  We stayed   days in a   bedroom apartment in e this year  Of the   hotels that we stayed in various cities in Western US during our US trip  this is by far the best value  I was looking for a hotel that is outside the Strip without a casino as I have young children  but preferably close enough to take a short trip to the Strip attractions and the airport  We were also looking for one that has coin op laundryfacilities  and a kitchen or kitchenette in the room  Well  this hotelfit the bill perfectly  I was delighted to find out that the room ratewas the lowest of the   hotels that I have booked  And after staying for   days and many encounters with the staff  I can tell you that the service of the staff overall was very good  at least for those that we met  The check in and out were fast  When my wife has a request  they send their man down to fix it promptly  They have a hotel shuttle which we took to go to the Strip as well as the airport The staff who contacted the driver for us  gave us an estimated waiting time  to see if we still want to take the service  And when the shuttle took a little longer than the estimated time  she called the driver again to check where he was  and was apologetic towards us  So even though we have to wait a while for the transport to the Strip  we didn t feel frustrated at any point of time both because of the responsible service of the staff as well as the fact that we were not rushing for time  The driver was very courteous and helpful too  For the trip to the airport  I told the staff in advance and stressed that I have to catch a flight at certain time  This time the shuttle was on time  and we arrive at the airport well in time  I guess booking the shuttle in advance helps them to fit us into their schedule  In fact  the receptionist always checked with the driver before committing to our request for the shuttle  In the small reception room  there were a restroom and a pantry  which I think is for staff use   but we were allowed to use them  Our apartment was reasonably spacious  and air con  It was such a relief from the    degrees temperature outside  And the temperature was adjustable  There are a lot of storage space  we didn t use all of them  The small pool was always full of people trying to cool down  Two suggestions for improvement  there were only two dining chairs around the dining table in our   bedroom apartments which can house   persons  Shouldn t   chairs be given in a   bedroom apartment  The management may also want to consider building a covered link way from the reception area to the various blocks so that guests do not need to pull along their luggage and walk under the very hot sun  We were delighted to find out that the hotel is located near to a cheap Chinese restaurant  Panda Express too  Overall  I can comfortably recommend this hotel to families who are looking for a safe  quiet place that is conveniently located near the attractions and airport in Las Vegas  
P =>  Stay at The Orleans I got my rooms at an auction site for     plus     additonal for weekend  Cheap flimsy furniture   drab sparse kitchen    flights of stairs to climb with luggage  Asked for lower floor and was denied  said they were full  Later that day I was near front desk and   people came in without reservations and clerk asked them if they would like lst floor rooms    The Orleans is right across the street and has far superior rooms and very pleasant front desk personnel   plus the rates are about the same as Emerald Oh yes  The Orleans has elevators  
P =>   Great Place   So there are   Emerald suites in Las Vegas  The one we stayed at was      Cameron St  Its right across of the New Orleans Casino which is OFF the STRIP about a mile off the strip   The one or two bed room suites are setup like a mini apartment  with a kitchen  full size refrigerator and separate bed rooms and on site laundry matt   We got our room for about        a night  This place offers a FREE shuttle serves to and from the Airport and to the Strip     We used it a lot and the drivers are really really nice and if you are the only ones in the van they might take you right to the casino that you want to get to  otherwise its the Tropicana Casino as the main pickup and drop off area  The shuttles run all day and night long         you just give the emerald suites a call when you are ready for pickup or drop off and its any where from    to    minutes  most of the times its no longer than a    minute wait      The room was very clean and nice  lots of furniture   One of my main pet peeves when staying at a hotel is cleanness  This hotel is a great deal and even better if you have a family  you can save a lot of eating out money with the kitchen    It was just   of us but why pay      on up a day for a room at the big casinos when you are really only going to sleep there  if you even go to sleep   Las Vegas is a lot of fun           Anyway you won t go wrong with the hotel    I will defiantly will be back       
P =>   Comfortable and Functional I m about to spend my third night at the Emerald Suites Cameron location in Las Vegas  After exhaustive research for my budget vacation  really just a side trip on the way back from somewhere else   I selected the Emerald Suites Cameron because of price and reviews  and got a great deal on the rate  partly factoring in the free high speed Internet My experience has not been without problems  but overall I ve found the hotel to be comfortable and convenient  It s the newest of the Emerald Suites properties in Las Vegas  and although the decor isn t anything special  it s up to date and doesn t look shabby  The staff has been friendly and helpful When I arrived late at night and checked in  I was initially put in a  quot non smoking quot  room that reeked of smoke and contained an ash tray  The man at the front desk was apologetic and explained that on busy weekends they sometimes allow people to smoke in the non smoking rooms  Although that seems to defeat the purpose of having non smoking rooms  they managed to get me into a different suite that smelled far less strongly of smoke   I ll note  though  that of three rooms I ve been in  all had at least a light odor of stale smoke  as did the hallways  If you don t want to haul your bags up the stairs  request a ground floor room  There are no elevators  However  I found that I didn t feel as secure in a ground floor room because it had windows and a sliding glass door which faced the parking lot and walkways  The actual door to the room is inside a secured building  but the building doors are often propped open  It seems like a safe enough area  though I had trouble getting the high speed Internet to work  It told me I was connected  but I couldn t access the web  check email  or set up a VPN connection  They had me try a different cable and also try accessing it from a different room  but I finally gave up  I ended up using a wireless network that Emerald Suites claimed wasn t theirs and which had spotty service in my room  They speculated that it might be coming from the Orleans next door Speaking of the Orleans  it s right across the street and very convenient  especially if you re there for the poker room  which is directly inside the closest set of doors  I ended up spending most of my time there  It also has a shuttle to the strip  which I didn t use  Guests staying at Coast Hotels properties have priority on the shuttles It was very convenient having a fully functional kitchen  minus pots and pans  in my room at the Emerald Suites  My grand total for food purchases during my entire three day stay was around      thanks to the kitchen and my car rental  which allowed me to travel a short ways up Tropicana to Albertsons for grocery shopping  Parking was easy at the Emerald Suites  It was also a very easy drive from the airport If I didn t need reliable high speed Internet access while away  I d stay there again and would recommend it to others  They say most other guests don t experience such problems  but I did  and I haven t had connection problems at any other hotel  Overall my experience was a good one  
P =>  extended stay type hotel This hotel has a good setup of different rooms for kitchen  living room  bathroom and bedroom  It has a full refrigerator freezer  microwave  stove oven in the kitchen  It has a full size couch in living room  The tv has many channels  even the tv guide channel  The sliding glass door for balcony is nice to get some fresh air  The bathroom is big but doesn t have many shelves or counter space  The bedroom has a sliding glass door for the closet  They have a long narrow dresser drawers but the drawers are too small to put many things inside  On property  they have a laundry room  I was glad that my room was next to that building  There were some problems      At check in  they didn t tell me that had to have a special cable for the internet  When I did call them  they did give me one free      The batteries on remote control went out  They brought me a new one  That one didn t last long either  They gave me one that had to be programmed  I couldn t figure it out so I gave up and changed the channels manually      There was some smell all throughout the building that I couldn t identify  
P => OUR FAVORITE PLACE Most internet sites rate this hotel a  star  We rate it a   star  It s more an apartment than hotel room and family or business friendly My husband travels for work      days a year  Once in a while he actually stays close enough to home that the kids and I  wife  can drive to Las Vegas to spend a night or   with him before he takes off again to parts unknown    months ago  we discovered Emerald Suites on Cameron near the Las Vegas strip  across from the Orleans Hotel Casino  Totally awesome  Not too fancy and NOT a dump  Totally refurbished and clean rooms  Guest services are friendly  My    year old daughter got food poisening and after we checked in she vommited everywhere  Waaaaaa The maintenence man came right away with a steam cleaner to tidy up  The kitchens are great little units and the pool and laundry room are real nice too  We wish this property would allow pets so we could stay longer  The rates are good but we have found BETTER rates on the internet that we wish we could get by booking directly with the property  CLEAN  FRIENDLY  just like home  QUIET and located near everything you need from shopping to restaurants to casinos  There is even a theatre in the Orleans casino across the street  What could they improve  A TV in the bedroom  The only TV is in the living room area which is also comfortable  
P => 			
P =>   N importe quoi  
P => 
P =>   highly recomended    when i first booked this i was kind of skeptic because of the reviews i read on it  aftef finding out at the last minute that   other people were going on vacations with my husband and me i booked a   bedroom  when i got there the staff was very friendly and welcoming  it was a very comfortable location    the rooms are very big and very clean    i highly recomend this if you have a big family   they do all they caould to accomodate you with as many rollaway beds  plus if you wait til you get there its complimentary    they also have complimantary shuttle and coffey this was trully a great place    will be back there in a month    
P =>   Great Stay   After reading some reviews about how bad the service was and of how awefull the rooms were etc etc  I was hesitant on staying there   But unfortunately  I booked the room BEFORE reading all the negative reviews  Upon arriving to the hotel for check in and receieving my room keys room         I was quite suprised on the size of the room and the cleaningness of the room  We were very satisified with the room for what we paid  Dont believe all the negative reviews that are on here    Sure there might be some nasty photos of blood on the pillow case  but how do we know that the blood wasnt put there by some disgruntled guest  Overall  I give this hotel high marks and recommend it  If something is wrong with your room  The staff will be more than happy to put you in a different room    The only negative things I have to say are that the bathroom would close  but the lock didnt work    But it was no big deal    The other thing is that we had asked for an ice bucket and were told that it would be brough to our room    It was never brought    Understandable though considering that it was Memorial Weekend and the staff was very busy    Plus  the ice machine was right around the corner so we just used one of the bowls that are provided for you and went to get the ice    Again   NO BIG DEAL    We are thinking about going back to Vegas in y   Guess were we are staying   Thats right   Emerald Suites Tropicana    
P =>   Good Value for the Price Went to Las Vegas for the first time this il  Read all the positive and negative comments  decided it seemed like a reasonable choice and found out that it certainly was  In fact  for us  a family of    it was close to ideal  Rooms were clean  When we needed more towels and the like they were easy to get  in all honesty we usually just brought the old ones to the cart and grabbed more   The workers were friendly and polite  When we went to the front desk to use the computer to print our return boarding passes  it was broken  So the staff let us use the computer and printer behind the desk  They were very accommodating  Beds could have been a mite softer for my tastes but my girlfriend and our kids were fine with them  We were on the train side of the complex and they certainly went by but didn t bother us  It doesn t have elevators  but we can walk up and down a few stairs  we were on the  rd floor   The kitchen area saved us    on food  Kitchen utinsels and dishes were not overly plentiful  but paper plates and plastic utinsels are fine for us  All the appliances were in good working order  For budget travelers who have a larger group and are staying several nights  it worked great  
P => Not Deserving of   Stars  We stayed at this hotel after our Alaska Airlines flight was cancelled following a long delay at the airport  According to the Alaska ticket agent this is the only hotel for which the airline would provide a voucher and or guarantee payment  Since I had never heard of this hotel  I asked the agent what kind of place it was  She told me it was  quot like a Doubletree quot  and  quot about three stars  quot  This was not an accurate description Meaning no offense to the polite and helpful people who were working in the office of this motel on our arrival  I have no idea how this place could merit   stars  It s also not remotely like any Doubletree I ve ever seen It is a   story budget motel  not within walking distance of even a       let alone a decent restaurant  The motel is surrounded by pavement  has no elevator  no shop or cafe of any kind  a broken ice machine  aged and very dirty carpets  an extremely noisy air conditioner  a pool surrounded by motel windows  in the case of our  quot suite quot  a torn and uncomfortable old sofa bed  a sticky table and old beds  It didn t smell like someplace you would like to sleep and had only the most basic amenities  I can say that the sheets and towels were clean  but overall it didn t feel clean or comfortable and is very outdated   Remember teal carpets and stiped couches  The people were nice  polite and friendly  They can t help that this is a fourth class facility  It s extremely difficult for me to imagine anyone paying      per night to stay here and thinking it s a good deal   especially in Las Vegas which is full of very nice rooms at reasonable rates  I sincerely question of the authenticity of some of the positive reviews I ve seen here  Don t let your airline get away with sending you here after cancelling your flight  And if you choose to stay here make sure you get a really  really great bargain rate because the location is horrible and very unattractive  
P =>  Great place I read all the reviews about this place and I was not looking forward to it  For the price I thought what the heck I will only be sleeping there  Everyone that wrote a bad review about this place is either too picky or very cheap  The place is not on the strip nor does it claim to be  the shuttles are a little slow but you have to realize you are not the only people staying there  if you call ahead and show some patience you can get to the air port or the Tropicana very easily  The staff were very helpful I thought they did a great job I got house keeping everyday except the time I didnt want it  so for the people who said they didnt get it maybe you should look into taking the do not disturb sign off the door  If you rent a car this place would be great  I got a pizza and put in in the fridge and ate that for the couple days I was there  the diswasher and microwave were great I never made anything on the stove but I am sure that would have been good  All I can say is this place was real nice for the price it was     times better that my buddies place at the Saharah and he paid alot more than I did  I will stay there again 
P =>   Great place to stay for a reasonable price  I read all these reviews only after we have already booked the hotel   we could not cancel  so I was prepared for the worse  I brought my own blankets towels and linnen  cleaning detergents and toilet paper  since we traveled by car      Stupid    Should never read those useless reviews   Check in took us just    min for   suites  the stuff at the front desk did not smile a lot but was quick and helpful  The suites  we stayed in two  were clean and shiny  stove  fridge  dishwasher micro oven  coffee maker and toaster  our kids liked that we had it in our kitchen  were brand new  hair drier was clean and in working condition  Suites had enough toilet paper and soap  each   bdrm suite had two q size beds and   sets of towels  Linnen and towels were changed every day  we stayed in hotel for   nights   Kitchen had dishes  silver  cups  measuring cups  kitchen towels  bowls and drainer Swimming pool looked great and shiny  hotel was quiet though there is trully a railway beside it the train passes aprox  every   hours but we were so tired every night that did not hear it at all It is clean and nice around the hotel and it is located just   min driving from the strip Check out took us just   minutes and overall impression about hotel was great I would recomend this place to people on a budget   it is excellent place for the price and you can enjoy having your own breakfast there  it was important for us since we traveled with kids and they need their peanutbutter sandwich and milk for breakfast even in Vegas   
P =>   This gives the phrase ROACH MOTEL new meaning  The moment that I got there and saw how horrible and dirty the outside of the hotel was  I knew I was in trouble  I never saw housekeeping once  The stove  coffee maker  garbage dissposal  and ice machine did not work  The hotel had roaches  The carpet and flooring were dirty  The room had a stench  an odor that I could not describe  maybe dead rats   The ironing board was broken  The hair dryer had hair and grease all over it  The beds had hair in them all over the pillows with grease  I asked for a refund  I was laughed at by management  
P =>  Hotel rooms were good I stayed here for   nights               and I was impressed by the size of my room  It s a  BR suite  with kitchen and living and dining room  Apparently  all rooms are this style  The room was clean and no problems with bugs or dirty sheets and linens  and the price of     night  was a bargain  Taxi to the strip is only     so I saved a lot of money  I will stay again if I decide not to stay in the strip  Dan 
P =>  Trashy  Please avoid ruining your vacation  I stayed at the Tropicana Emerald Suites location  It has a train passing through behind the buildings that do not let you sleep at all  The maids are lazy and they do not clean daily  nor do they change the sheets  leave towels  or toilet paper  I had to call the office daily for the basics  I returned to my room one day to find that the maids had left my door open and my      digital camera was stolen  There is also heavy traffic around this location  so while it is only a few blocks away from the Strip  those three blocks turn into a     minute drive  The location is also hidden down a small side street so kind of have to guess what street to find it on  
P =>  Great Suites for the price My family stayed here during the Nascar race weekend in ch  All hotels on the strip  off the strip and downtown were over      a night  This place was only about       The pool is nice looking  but that weekend was too jam packed with race stuff to take a dip  The landscaping was beautiful  The staff was friendly  Two complaints   when we were given our room key and room number was circled on a map  it wasn t our room  We had to go all the way back to the lobby  which is actually a drive with all the buildings  and then work it out  The other complaint is that we asked for a ground floor room and we ended up with  rd floor   rd floor is the max  and there are no elevators  so we had to use the stairs with a lot of luggage  It was not fun  The room had two good size bedrooms  each with a king bed  and a kitchen with all the amenities one would need  It s about   miles south of Mandalay Bay  but worth it for that weekend  
P =>  Beware appearances can be deceiving could ve gotten a lot better for      night  The train runs through the back of the property all through the night  The heater is VERY loud  I couldn t sleep through it and my sp  says I could sleep through anything  The local homeless hang out at the back of the complex  along the train tracks  However  I didn t really feel unsafe at any time  The staff were nice and friendly  very helpful  It looks very nice from the outside  and the rooms appear to have been recently painted  I hope the furniture is next  My husband sat down on one of the kitchen chairs and he barely missed ending up on the floor  Same thing happened to friends that were staying in another room  The furniture is just plain worn out and threadbare  
P =>  Unfortunate miscues make this a must avoid for business travel Like others  I doubted the negative reviews of this property    seemed inconsistent with others  experiences and lacking in detail  I also find  quot princess with the pea quot  reviews annoying  and during a recent trip to LV decided to roll the dice and stay here  I travel     for business  am an experienced business traveler  but take each property on its own terms The Emerald Suites had some issues that made me feel compelled to warn other travelers away from here  read on if you are considering staying Positives   located near the Strip and I     reasonable enough room rate  staff try hard   pleasant attitude  basically clean and well kept propertyNegatives   some may not like being across the street from a large  but clean  adult bookstore  I don t care  but it s not a  nice  block   Internet speed is inconsistent  suggesting a shared cable router  Evening speeds were slower than dial up  and rendered the internet access almost unusable  the worst problem  maintenance went into my room to fix something  and LEFT THE DOOR AJAR ALL DAY LONG  There were valuables there   I am lucky and glad nothing was taken  but I repeat  not just unlocked  but actually left the door open all day long  The manager said she would speak to those responsible and follow up with me  and she never did  though she did understand that this was a very bad thing  and said the appropriate things at the time   I would have expected an apology  and perhaps a token offer of a rate reduction  etc   only one treadmill in exercise room   not enough for a property with this many roomsEssentially  the Emerald is clearly trying to be a nice mid line suite property  but until they can get past the mistakes  this is a poor choice for the business traveler  and not highly recommended for vacation stays  
P =>   Not everything that happens in Vegas stays in Vegas    This is a motel  not a hotel and definitely not a suite  This is a motel deceptively trying be something it s not on website  My room had a living area and a separate bedroom area  so I guess they get off on a technicality I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived  as the office staff  yes  office  this is a motel and there is no lobby  was friendly and my room was clean and that was good enough for a last minute business trip  However  my departure experience was a completely different story  I called   hours before I was to leave for the airport and asked for a preferred cab company  The woman answering sounded like she was asleep  and she told me the motel offered shuttle service and asked me to call    mins  before I wished to leave and the shuttle would be ready  I repeated what she said and she confirmed  So  I did just that   I called and the woman answering the phone called me a LIAR  repeat  I WAS called a LIAR  after she asked the woman I supposedly spoke with earlier and she said I was a liar   I do not know it in fact it was the woman I originally spoke with   It was SO unprofessional  The woman continued to call me a LIAR and told me I would have to wait for the shuttle or a cab  even after I explained what I was told and that I was going to miss my flight if I had to wait  the woman was still SO rude and showed no remorse for the miscommunication  I noticed a woman standing in the back listening to our conversation and I asked if she was the manager  She said she was the GENERAL MANAGER  Then  another GUEST offered to take me to the airport and then the GM also offered  but the GM let the GUEST take me  In a city as traveled as Las Vegas  a motel like this should have no business being listed on travel reservation web sites with other quality hotels  At the very least  it should be classified for what it is  a low class motel  After my departure experience  I recommend staying here on your   th birthday with your buddies or if your car breaks down and there is no other place to stay  Actually  scratch that  stay in you car  
P => Just what it promised I don t know what everyone is complaining about with this one  Unless you go in with a snobby attitude expecting people to kiss your butt  the staff here was very nice and quite helpful  While my mother and I were walking around checking out the place  the staff smiles and says hello  asks if you need help  The pool was nice  clean  big clean laundry rooms also  The train is very close  but unless you can t sleep though a snoring person  it s really not a big deal at all  The place gives just what it promises  Two giant rooms with King beds and a den kitchen area  The kitchen is not fully stocked  but if you are expecting it to be  who are you  a chef  Go out and enjoy Vegas  There are some reviews where people complain that there are only measuring cups  what are you people making in there  You let your kids sleep on the floor  YOu sleep on the floor  and let the kids have the bed  don t make us feel bad for you  When we were checking in  two men came in and were told they had to have a king bed  They very nicely said that was a mistake and would like separate beds  They were accomodated on the spot  A lesson to those of you complaining about the rude staff   if you are rude and nasty  they will be too  The staff even sent maintance to fix our remote control for the t v  The only complaint I had were rude guests  but that is not really the hotels fault at all  I quot m sure if I had complained they would have helped  Some guests left early in the morning and were noisy  yelling slamming doors and even smoking marijuana all hours of the night  and you could smell it in the rooms  I was tempted to call the desk  but I wasn t there long enough to cause a problem  For those of us who have stayed at the classier places know  even they have noisy rude guests  Also  distance to the strip is not an issue  It s really close  If your lazy  stay on the strip  If you have a car  can figure our how to take a taxi or don t mind walking a little bit  it s exactly as far as it says  Even a nice view from the balcony by the room  
P => This hotel sucks and so did the staff We stayed at this hotel for a weekend and I was very disappointed  The staff were rude  when I checked out no one asked how was my stay or if I would be returning  There were no paper towels in the room  our room was missing the iron board and the staff were not even aware of the fact  Which lead me to question when was the last time they had the room cleaned  The TV has open wires sticking out of the back and the reception was lousy and the staff gave bad directions to every place we tried to go in Vegas  We did better with the map the rental car company gave us  I would never recommend this hotel  because the website misleads its customers about what type of room you will get  they put pictures of modern room with Internet connection and flat screen TVs and our room had none of these  Don t waste your money or time by staying at this motel you will be very upset and have lousy experience  
P =>  Don t have anything to do with this place I haven t even stayed here yet and can tell you it is a waste of your money They have teamed up with an outfit called SkyAuction    and will not honor any dates you submit  even after you paid for the room   The same nights I submitted showed availability on Expedia  I have been denied a room twice  I will try it one more time and then I am submitting this problem to the BBB of Las Vegas  
P => what a joke This place was a terrible motel  The desk staff were rude  and the shuttle took almost two hours to show up for an airport pickup  Rooms needed a good cleaning  and the air conditioner was turned totally off  
P => Excellent Hotel After booking a reservation at the Emerald Suites Tropicana  i read a lot of so so reviews and a few bad ones as well  this made me vary wary  Reviews mentioned that the hotel staff was rude  there was never any hot water  a train rolled by once an hour all day and nite long  the beds were uncomfortable  etc  Well after staying at the Emerald Suites Tropicana  i can say without a doubt in my mind that i had nothing but a GREAT time there  The hotel staff were very friendly  i had very hot water at all hours of the day  a train would roll by rarely but i hardly even took notice  and my room was right next to the tracks   my bed and room itself was very comfortable and inviting  Bottom line  this is a GREAT hotel to stay in if you re going to be visiting Las Vegas  You won t be disappointed  
P => What a joke   Sooooo deceiving      
P =>  Terrible    
P => Truly a Jewel  
P => Nice little place   
P =>  nice and quiet   
P =>  what you should know before booking this hotel  
P => 
P => Excellent   one of the best hotels in Vegas  We go to Vegas once or twice a year and this time opted for the Encore  Overall very pleased with the room  the service and the price  Checkin on a Saturday early evening was easy and smooth  no wait at all  with a friendly welcome and an upgrade to a high floor panoramic room  The room was very nice  decorated to a very high standard with a great bathroom and a very comfortable bed  Room service was good quality and very quick  less than    minutes    which is extremely good for Vegas  Didn t bother taking any photos as the room looked identical to the pictures on the website  Litterally my only complaint would be the slightly low shower pressure  but nothing like as bad as the Palazzo last year    Overall extremely pleased and would definitely stay there again  
P => Over Rated As a person who has stayed at some every nice hotels  the service was average at best  In the Casio it took someone    minutes to come fix my machine after asking   people  The rooms are nice but small if you stay in the regular rooms  There was no turn down service which you would expect at a hotel of this class  The food choices were limited with breakfast expecting to pay over    for breakfast with just eggs and no alcohol  On a Saturday night the music from the club can be heard for till   am and we were on the   st floor  In my opinion  over priced and not worth the money  
P =>   Would stay at the Encore encore This is a lovely hotel and the thought that has gone into the design and decor is truly inspiring  I loved the red although I thought the butterfly theme was a bit  girly  for such a huge  sprawling building I was surprised by the lack of complimentary water in the rooms of a hotel of this level the tap water tastes awful   The sound proofing  lack of  is also a surprise  The vents for the air con are by the window  where the controls are  If you sit in the lounge area to read a book or use your laptop  at        per    hrs   you freeze  If you go to bed  between lounge area and bathroom  you re too hot at night  and the bathroom is just like a sauna without the water  One of our party was doing hand washing in the evening and it was dry the next day after a night hanging up in the bathroom  Saved on the laundry bills I suppose    I m surprised more vents weren t engineered into the building at the time of construction We were woken up by drunks wandering up and down the corridor on a couple of the weekend nights when the Encore s nightclubs are open  Make sure you ask for a room well away from the nightclubs as I understand they can be heard   another obvious sound proofing problem  We could also hear rooms around us flushing their loos  some muffled speech coming through a vent in the bathroom  sadly not an air con vent   and showers being switched on and off  However  there was never any problem with water pressure or temperature considering so many people must have been showering at the same time The spa is fabulous   really luxurious and well worth a trip  It s a shame that you can t use the facilities unless you ve had a treatment that day but I suppose they have to limit the amount of people in there because of the hotel s capacity  You can pay     a day to have access if you re not having a treatment The pools lose the sun at about lunch time  due to it disappearing behind the Wynn  I m surprised new hotels in Vegas bother to build pools because of the size of all the buildings  Even in ember it was warm enough  just  to lie out in the morning although once the sun went behind the Wynn tower  it was too cold to stay out We had breakfast at the Society Cafe every day  as well as a couple of evening meals there  and couldn t fault it  We also had an evening meal at the restaurant by the sports book in the Wynn  can t remember the name of it  which was also good Even with the air con and sound proofing problems  we would stay again  
P =>   The hotel is wonderful but check in was a nightmare If you can make it through the check in mess  you will enjoy your stay  I was traveling with a car group through Arizona and Utah  The tour started at the Encore for two nights and ended at the Encore for two nights five days later  Making arrangements for rooms and dinners was handled well by the hotel  They allowed us to park our own cars in the valet lot which worked out well  But when we got there for check in  it was a nightmare  and we were booked at the Tower Suites  which has its own check in area  At      the rooms weren t ready  at      the rooms weren t ready  at      some of the rooms were ready but not on the requested floors  If the wife s name was not on the reservation they would not let you check in  even if the husband called and confirmed with the credit card  but even that rule was not consistant  Five days later when we returned it was the same craziness  rooms weren t ready  They told me they were going to put me in one room and when I went back to get my key after   hours  they had given my room to someone else  For a top notch hotel the check in process is a mess  The rest of the stay there was very nice  The rooms are nice  the staff  except check in  were very friendly  The view from the rooms is fantastic  The restaurants in the Encore and Wynn are great  The shopping is great  
P =>   I don t think there will be a repeat of this The boyfriend and I make it a point to come visit Vegas at least once a year and we e always stayed at the Signature  which by the way has always been an EXCELLENT stay   ided to try something else this time and picked the Encore  Don t get me wrong  the hotel  the decor  the room were all beautiful  I m a fan of red despite the fact that it made the lobby and casino look bordello ish  The room was nice    loved the bed and the drapes and of course the view  Bathroom was nothing spectacular  still prefer the SIgnature s huge jetted tub  I did not like the toiletries at all  Oh but the robes are awesome  One thing they really need to work on is the soundproofing  It felt like we could hear each adjoining room s toilet flushing and door banging while we were in that room  Oh and if you re out in the hall walking past rooms you can hear the conversations and whatnot going on behind closed doors  No microwave  no fridge  no coffeemaker  Be prepared to pay for every little comfort  No comp  bottles of water like the Signature  If you want to use your laptop during your stay  be prepared to pay        for    hours of internet access for EACH laptop  Steer clear of the minibar and the goodies found in the rooms  And I mean don t even touch them and lift them because you will be charged for it  Housekeeping was great  Roomservice was expensive but you have got to try the ribs  It was to die for  I also didn t like the fact that there was someone from security  i guess  standing by the walkway to the elevators asking guests to show their room keys  
P =>   Wynn Encore Luxurious suites with elegant decor  the food is amazing  and the balcony bar behind the falls is a must see at night  
P =>   How do they do it  The Encore did a great job during our stay in Las Vegas I don t know how they train and motivate their staff to provide such a consistently good experience but every single person with whom we interacted with went beyond helpful and pleasant Our room on the   th floor was right sized  Not too small but not particularly big  However the decor and details are amazing  You can open or close the drapes  change the privacy sign  adjust the lights  and that s just from the bedside controller  The bedside phone is cordless  the desk phone is business sized  and the bathroom phone is just convenient  The very large flat screen tv swivels for watching from the bed area or from the living room  The large bathroom had a bath  a nice glass shower  a tv  a separate toilet  and a large  two person counter top  A full sized professional style hair dryer was provided Our room was on the back of the hotel and the view was impressive from the wall sized widow   It must be amazing from the front side overlooking The Strip Everything in the hotel is expensive although the quality of food in the restaurants and room service is good  Try for easy comps to the Society Restaurant in the casino  The esplanade stores are for the very rich  Get snack food and drinks from the nearby Wallgreens  The mini bar refrigerator can t really be used for personal stuff but within minutes of a phone call to housekeeping we had our own little refrigerator for the duration I suggest  like us  you rent a car and use it to travel from casino to casino  valet park for the price of a tip  and out to Hoover Dam etc  Bring your own GPS or rent one with the car  
P =>   Beautiful Property Service Not Up To Par My husband and I arrived for a three night stay at about   pm Sunday afternoon  The lobby and check in was a zoo of people  and although about a dozen people were working the front desk  we waited about    min to check in  It was so noisy that I literally could not hear the woman who was checking me in  although we were leaning close to each other and practically shouting  When I made the reservation  the agent told me I would get a room with a strip view on a high floor  This was not the case  They tried to upsell me a room in the Tower Suites on the   th floor for     a night which I declined  and finally  on their fourth offer  they upsold me for     a night to what they call a  quot Panoramic View quot  on the   th floor which had a did indeed have a great view of the strip  We were staying there on a promotion  where one night was complimentary  and at check in I was told the     upsell would only apply to the two paid nights  but at check out  it was a different story  They wanted     extra for the complimentary night   By contrast  when we stayed at the Four Seasons in Las Vegas six weeks prior  they upgraded us to a gorgeous strip view at no charge   I got the feeling that Steven Wynn spent a pile of money on this place    it is absolutely gorgeous  but now he is nickeling and diming his guests to get a return on his investment  However  this is irritating to the guests   Also Steve Wynn s photo pops up throughout the hotel  and he is the narrator on the in room video selling the hotel  And you ve probably seen the tv commercials where he is sitting on top of the building  This is a bit too much for my taste  It seems Steve Wynn is a bit full of himself  and he has passed that trait on to many of his employees  who have a pretentious attitude    which is a turn off to guests  The room itself was beautiful  but took a bit of getting used too  as it is decorated a bit loudly for my taste  One wall is covered in a large black and white houndstooth design  The amenities in the bathroom are nice  but not great  Bring your own Q tips  the ones they supply are so flimsy  they will poke your ear out if you are not careful  Two other negatives are there is no coffee maker in the room and you have to pay for internet access  Coffee for two from Room Service is over      and if you go down to the lobby bar you can buy morning coffee for about    a cup   By contrast  when we stayed at the Four Seasons  they has an in room coffee maker  and complimentary morning coffee and tea serice in the lobby  and a choice of three complimentary morning newspapers   The Encore s spa costs     per day  while the Four Season s is included  We used both hotel s spas  and IMO the Four Season s was nicer  though smaller  One morning we had breakfast at the Terrace Cafe in the Wynn  The service was so bad    food had not arrived after half an hour  and when it did arrive it was cold    that they comped us for     of the meal  Well      percent of the service was bad  but I guess the restuarant manager would have had to get an OK from Mr  Wynn himself to comp us for the entire breakfast  Another day we ate breakfast at the Encore s Society Cafe  Service was good    they even gave us a  quot free quot  USA Today to read    if you get there before they run out  But for two regular entrees and two cups of coffee  the bill came to      This is breakfast for two  We also ate at the Wynn Buffet which we have eaten at several times before  It is stil very good  but not as good as it once was  Also ate at the Z something deli which was tasty though pricey  A highlight was seeing the show Le Reve  Quite a spectacle of dancers  gymnists  muscle men  etc  Another lowlight of our stay was one evening when I was walking over to the Sinatra restaurant to have a look at the menu  Now  there is only one destination when you are going to Sinatra and that is Sinatra  A big security guard stopped me  and said   quot Are you going to the restaurant  quot  as if I was a criminal   quot Yes  quot  I said  thinking  where else would I be going  Guests should not be treated this way  Another problem is the mini bar  I picked up a bottle of hand lotion and looked at the lable for    seconds  A     charge appeared on my bill  which they took off when I complained  So don t touch anything on the minibar unless you are going to buy it  Further  Mr  Wynn provides a little booklet hawking many of the items in the room  Like the sheets  You can buy them for a mere       Etc  He ll even sell you the bed for about         However  nowhere in the room was there a comment card  to ask guests how their stay was  I guess Mr  Wynn doesn t care  When we checked out on Wednesday  it was again a zoo  and I had to wait    minutes as only   people were staffing the check out  They did have a guy asking people to express check out but everyone declined  as I guess they wanted to see their bill  to make sure no weird charges slipped on  Final thought  this is a beautiful physical property  but employee service training needs a big shot in the arm  and Mr  Wynn should make his guests feel welcomed and relaxed  not like they are being watched and hit up for money at every turn  BTW the hotel just got awarded the   Diamond AAA awarad  and they will waste no time in tooting their own horn about it  Postscript  The shortest line in the hotel was in the casino at the cashier  No one was cashing out  
P =>   Beautiful Hotel   but expected more  My wife and I stayed here six nights this past e         The hotel is beautiful and the staff was courteous and proffessional  The check in process was quick  but that could be due to our early arrival time        AM   The room was large  which was one of the reasons that we chose this hotel  The food was excellent in the restaurants and  lentiful in serving size  However      the air conditioning system is a terrible design  The unit is located in the living room with no other vents in the bedroom or bathroom  So it s    degrees in the living room and    degrees in the bathroom  The casino is a yawner  pool is packed  which is to be expected  and the clubs do not offer any advantage to gaining entry  even though you are a guest of the hotel    probably because at the this time they are the hottest clubs    although on a phone call before our trip  we were told that our room key would gain us entry   this policy is not adhered to  
P =>   Luxurious place with only little cut backs Great rooms with lots of space and all comfort but lacking coffeemaker and free wireless lan which almost any budget motel chain in the U S  offers  Service was always great  very nice staff  For our taste the swimming pools are to crowded and in the afternoon most of the pool area was shady  Great location with lots of food options in the hotel and if you are traveling on a budget in the Fashion Show Mall on the opposite side of the street  Make sure to visit the La Reve show in the hotel  It was fabulous  We recommend the champagne circle seats which offer private drink service and video screens  
P =>   Wynn Encore should be renamed The WORST Place to Stay in Las Vegas Guess what as a VIP invited guest you get a crap view from your hotel  it costs me        for a local call  didn t dare try the internet service of         day  which is free in every other hotel I ve stayed  a simple cheese omelet was         after all of the fee s  no HBO or Showtime  But lots of TV about Steve Wynn  Don t touch anything in the fridge or the snack stand it costs a FORTUNE  I didn t play and lose enough money in their casino      hours play in   days and a loss of               as tracked and graded by my casino card which was wrong  I guess I m not rich  enough for the Wynn hotel s  dealers and supervisors are so hungry they have to go out with customers so they can eat gt  gt  gt  gt  gt  gt  gt  gt  I m sure the next time I go back to Las Vegas my stay will be back at Caesars again  THIS PLACE IS A RIP OFF 
P => 	star resort   star service  out of    Stayed at the Encore       thru       room        and at the Wynn            room        Here for the Sema Aapex trade show  We stayed at Caesars       Aladdin  PH  in       Venetian       Wynn       Palazzo       The Wynn  amp  Encore are the best properties by far Web sites that book the airfare and hotel together  Expedia com  Vegas com  offer packages about     lower than booking hotel and air apart  You can select amy hotel you like When taking the taxi from the airport  fare will be about      Give the driver     when you get in if you want the fastest route to the hotels  It s only a       minute ride depending on traffic When you get to reception you might put a     on the counter  but the staff will not accept a tip until after you are signed in  They will still want to upgrade you for     a night to one of the top    floors  Well worth the upgrade  Spoke with someone staying on a lower floor and they said the noise from the club was quite loud  Also  the Wynn properties place a      per night hold against your credit card for potential charges  If you use your Amex card you will never notice this charge  Option B  bring a charge card with    k of credit available  If neither of these work for you  you are checking into the wrong hotel  No shame in staying at TI  Mirage  Paris  PH  All fine properties  But if you stay at the Encore enjoy yourself  spend some money  tip well  Also  we usually arrive early and our room might not be available until late in the day  Leave your luggage with the bellman  relax and enjoy yourself  Although last   years we had a room available early in the am   A day before you checkout see a casino host  If your level of play is strong they will comp you quite a bit of the food beverage tab  Remember at all times  your attitude will be mirrored back to you  Come in happy  positive  and you ll almost always get that same vibe back When we stayed at the Wynn we thought that was incredible  The rooms at the Encore are huge  All the views are terrific  The beds are incredible  The  nd day we told the maid not to bother with our room  Everything was clean and stocked and we did not need any new towels  Later in the day another maid came by to see if we needed anything  A few hours later the housekeeping manager came by to make sure we were ok  The service here was amazing  There is NO charge for the room safe  You can enter a   digit pin number OR use the magnetic strip from your room key or a credit card to lock it  A few reviews mentioned a charge for the safe  There is a     day charge for wifi  If you brought a laptop you should be able to expense that to your business  If you only plan to check email a few times during your trip you could use the business center or one of the wifi cafes on the strip   ok Steve Wynn  here s one area for improvement  Room service trays were left out overnight  No need for dirty dishes in the hall  Please pick these up more often Ate at Wazuzu  portions a bit large but excellent  Terrace Pointe Cafe  full cafe menu but no longer open    hours  Zoozacrackers deli  excellent  huge sandwiches  The Buffet  wonderful  SW Steakhouse  dress warm to eat outside and see the show  At the cafe when a waiter finished clearing a table he placed a napkin over the dirty dishes before carrying the tray past guests  A waffle came out a bit cold  The replacement waffle was brought out quickly by the manager himself  He bused a table on his way back to the kitchen  At Wazuzu when pouring water the waitress placed a napkin behind my glass to catch any stray droplets of water  At SW our party of   split   entrees and a number of sides and salads  The waitstaff made us feel very comfortable  bringing plenty of clean plates  In The Buffet the cooks behind the line were cheerful and polite to everyone  Whoever is running the food services at the Wynn properties could not be doing a better job The casino at the Wynn and Encore both have something to offer If you want the excitement and flash of Vegas try the Wynn  The Encore casino is much quieter and less smokey  There is a beautiful walkway connecting the two  Less than a   minutes walk from Encore elevators to the Wynn poker room  all walk times assume a brisk  but not running  pace   We did not play any of the table games but won big on poker and slots  Poker is a game of patience sometimes helped out by a bit of luck  Slots I can teach you how to win     avoid any machine with a jackpot of more than     k  We have won over       many times this year  never even seen anyone who won     k       and higher payouts are not uncommon     play    or     denominations  I am convinced casinos make their money on the smaller   players     you MUST play all the lines on these new video slots  These machines use the concept of stacked wilds  If you only play    lines on a    line machine you will never win enough to offset your bets     When you win smaller jackpots       and up  get off that machine immediately  move on     If you win enough to fill out a tax form take some of your winnings in check  Takes a few minutes longer but worthwhile     Tip out anyone who does anything for you in Vegas  Instant Karma  MOST important Walk from Encore elevators to the Las Vegas convention center    minutes  To the Sands Convention center    minutes  Walk whenever you can in Vegas  keeps your vacation  calorie neutral  Our favorite shows  in order or WOWness  KA  do not sit in the first       rows  looking up too much  Dine at Shibuya   Penn  amp  Teller  funny  clean  and amazing   Love  dine at Fin  skip Stack   Bette Midler  check out Mon ami Gabi for late lunch at Paris  get a table by the sidewalk    quot O quot   get in line at      at Todd English Olives for  pm seating on the patio  Closest you ll get to the water show at the Bellagio  Dress warm   La reve  not my favorite   Also worth the trip is Aliza  a beautiful restaurant at the top of the Palms  While you are there you can see Ghostbar and the Playboy club  one admission covers both  The Venetian Palazzo are nice properties with large rooms and a lot to offer but they are not in the same league as the Wynn properties  Wynn Encore furnishings are better quality and the Wynn Encore service sets the bar for all of Vegas Side note  We got to the airport on      to go home  Flight was delayed  Continental said we would miss our connecting flight to Tampa but they would put us up for the night in Houston  I called a casino host at the Wynn who comped us a room for the night as well as our full food tab         Vegas is a much better place to be delayed than Houston  
P =>   Wynn does it again Steve Wynn took Wynn Las Vegas and made it better with larger rooms  all suites   a toned down decor and some great restaurants  Service was perfect  though I didn t make any special requests There are two places that are a little less desirable about Encore    the pool is sort of boring and    it is fairly far north on the Strip I will be back 
P =>   Great   th Anniversary Beautiful Hotel Get Rid of the Music   Before finally booking this hotel in particular I scrutinized every feature of this and the others that I was comparing it to and although I was a bit apprehensive about choosing this one due to it s location  I m still glad that I did Upon arrival at this Hotel you can tell that everything about it was done first class  There s some things that are obviously being worked on outside but everything else is just top notch Check in was a breeze  I didn t even need to slip the clerk a     bill  yet still got a great room with a view  The view was amazing on the   th floor  To our Left was the Golf Course at the Wynn and to our Right was the Montainous region toward the Northwest  At the same time  our view also included the pools and the wonderful Gardens that surrounded each of them The Room itself was the Resort Suite King and it was amazing  It was very spacious and nicely decorated  The Entry Hall Foyer was clean  long and led you to all of the right places  To the right off the Main Hall is a very nice bath with a Stand up Shower  a Bathtub  no Jacuzzi   twin sinks  a lighted mirror and a seat for the ladies to do their makeup  Enter a doorway to a nice separate   by   toilet room with it s own door  There s a nice       quot  LCD TV in the bathroom that we left on continuosly with some nice classical music on one of the cable channels Further down the Hallway to the left leads you to an Armoire full of niceties that you can purchase  including and intimacy kit  if you lift something up for longer than    seconds  On the right is a closet with an Ironing Board  some hangers  a couple of garment drawers and a safe that was easy to set and use Continuing down the hall leads you to the Bedroom which is nice in size  decorated nicely  has a nice sized LCD TV that swivels     degrees towards the bed or towards the separate Living Room area The Bed is ultra comfortable and although it s advertised as a King  it seems to be closer to a Queen The Living Room lncludes an L shaped couch  a separate desk and a great view The positives  The very comfortable bed and pillows  which my wife convinced me to purchase and send home from the WYNN store   The view  The or  The Bathroom overall  The European Bathing Pool  The luxuriousness feel throughout the Hotel  The Waterfalls throughout the Grounds of the Encore Wynn The negatives  The lack of a Jacuzzi  Having to pay for Wireless or Ethernet hookup  Lack of explanation of  quot what s included with your stay quot   a Heat Lamp of some sort in the  quot coldish quot  bathroom  The Cesspool scent outside on the grounds  especially near the Valet area  The Loud Euro Disco throughout MOST of the innards Overall this Hotel is Awesome and I can safely recommend it highly Just wish that it was closer to the main part of The Strip  was completely done without any construction Big NEGATIVE  the foreigners that just don t understand that in America   slower people should stay to the right as well as oncoming traffic should YIELD to the right    HELLO   
P =>  This is one of the best places I ve ever stayed  The Spa was incredible  I loved the Encore  From the valet to check in the service was very professional and the people are down to earth  I felt right at home and that they would do anything to accomidate me  The atmosphere was romantic  relaxing  and exciting  We didn t even have to leave the hotel  I would suggest that anyone who is going to Las Vegas should pay the extra money to stay at such an extravagant place  It was well worth it and made our trip one we will never forget  The spa is the most beautiful in the world and just delicious  I felt like a million bucks after being pampered there   
P =>  beautiful rooms great location The rooms are great   not huge but very stylish mini suites well appointed with big flat screen TV and black and beige furnishings including wrap round sofa in sitting area  A good place to crash after a night on the town or in the casino  Good sized modern bathroom  The reception area is very busy and service impersonal but no surprise given the number of people passing through  The casino is very big as you would expect but croupiers and restaurant staff friendly  Food good  Conference rooms very good facility as is business centre  Don t miss XS the club located on the walkway between the Encore and sister property the Wynn  Do not miss it   opens out onto pool area   great music great crowd  Location just at the end of the strip is perfect for dipping in and out of the madness that is Las Vegas  
P =>  Over the top designed hotel for the wannabe rich and famous Stayed at this hotel after two days at the Palazzo next door and I m not quite sure why but the whole butterfly over the top design that it shares with the bellagio and the Wynn itself is just not quite my cup of tea  Room was nice but smaller than the suites at the Palazzo while costing significantly more  Service and general staff attitude was polite but I couldn t help thinking they have their noses a bit high up in the air  This matched most of the guests who seemed mostly like the typical big shot wannabes you d expect to blow their family s savings on a gambling table in Vegas  Other than that  clean and airy rooms and a good location at the lower end of the strip  Pool hours were rediculously short as it seems standard with most luxury hotels in Vegas which is something I can t really understand if even the dodgy little motel down the road can have thri pool open till    at night  Buffet restaurant at the Wynn is highly recommended and probably the best quality buffet in town  
P =>  Encore Well worth it  We stayed for   nights from      to     and enjoyed it immensely  We travel to Vegas     times a year and usually stay at the Mirage  but wanted to try somewhere new since we found the Mirage was getting old and the service was not what it used to be over the past few years  We decided on Encore Wynn having heard positive things from family that have stayed there  Encore did not disappoint  We initially got a room for      night by calling marketing  and keep in mind that if you are a gambler  that rate may well be significantly reduced or fully  quot comped quot  by the end of your stay We arrived aroung   am and was pleasantly surprised that there was not line up at registration and they gave us a room right away and were given a choice of which floor we would like and which view we would like without having to pay extra    Having read previous reviews where others have had to wait several hours for a room to be ready  we were prepared to leave our bags at the Bell hop desk and wait for a phone call when our room was ready  We stayed on the   st floor  facing the mountains  Tip    st floor is the first floor in the group floors that the elevator stops at  Great because you are the first one off going up  and the last one in before going down to the lobby    no constant stopping at other floors to let people on and off Our room was immaculately clean  and we thouroughly enjoyed all the amenities in our room that have been previously mentioned in previous reviews  The one best thing that both of us loved was the bed    best sleep we ever had  One minor glitch was the TV was not working  About    minutes after notifying housekeeping  our doorbell rang and there was an employee holding a leather lined tray in front of her with a lone remote control on it when we opened the door  After trying the new remote and finding that the TV still didn t work  the employee apologized repeatedly and promised a techinician would be up shortly to fix the problem       minutes later  our techinician arrived  fixed the TV  and apologized again and then thanked us We had no problem with noise on our floor  not once did we hear doors opening closing in the hallway  or people talking  It felt like we were the only ones on our floor during our stay  Downstairs in the adjoining walkway of shops joining Wynn and Encore was another story    Being it was Halloween weekend  lots of club goers going to Tryst and XS  causing congestion and we literally had to push our way through when we were coming from Wynn back to Encore on Saturday night Housekeeping  casino floor staff   restaurant  and registration check in staff were all very friendly and accomodating  However we did notice that the  quot girls quot  at Society Cafe did have a bit of an attitude when seating us when we requested a table away from the bar area and on another occassion  appeared irritated when we asked them to repeat what they had said when we didn t hear them correctly the first time  The woman at the check out although not rude  acted like she would rather be anywhere else but there and didn t even ask us if we enjoyed our stay Restaurants here tend to be on the more pricier side  however most of the restaurants were offering prix fixe   course menus from            We did the       course meal at Society Cafe and found the portions huge  quality excellent  and the food was delicious  this menu included wines by the glass at     price For the regular gamblers out there like us    we didn t gamble any more or any less than usual and found that at the end of our stay we were  quot comp ed quot  the same for room and food as we have been at our other  quot usual quot  hotel we stay at when in Vegas      and Encore is definitely a higher quality hotel  so we felt we got more  quot bang for our Buck quot  here  The slot host here are very friendly and made it a point to contact us first  and leave a message for us on our phone introducing themselves and letting us know they where and when they would be in the hotel if we wanted to say hello in person  My previous  quot senior executive slot host quot  never did this when I was in town  and wasn t that friendly when I did see him  At least at Encore you feel like they do appreciate your business and you don t feel as bad when you lose at Encore Wynn LOL  The casino itself was quiet and the machines muted  even when jackpots were hit  also very clean with someone always wiping down the machines of fingerprints  not smokey  and the casino bathrooms were extremely clean with individual closets for the toilets instead of the usual see underneath stalls  Overall a less rambuctious  party like crowd than you would find at some other hotels  and most were people were decently dressed  ie  no short short skirts or tank tops  but still overall casual attire was the norm throughout the casino and eateries If your looking for an indulgent  Vegas experience than treat yourself to a stay at Encore  If you are young and or looking for the  quot club experience and nightlife quot  then this may not be your first choice  
P =>  THE BEST OF EVERYTHING  We had received an offer in the mail from the Encore offering us a stay for     per night with an upgrade to a suite    so naturally we jumped at the opportunity We were celebrating our   th Wedding Anniversary on ober     so this was good timing   We had just been to Vegas in ust  stayed at The Paris  but what the heck   you only live twice   lolThe room was magnificent   everything brand new and absolutely top shelf  There is a very wide selection of restaurants between the Encore and The Wynn and everyone was very cordial and friendly  The place was packed and you never would believe there was a recession All I have to say about the Encore is that it is absolutely the best     If you have the opportunity to stay there do so  Check it out I think they may still have this     per night promo going on  But if you have to pay a little more it is asbsolutely worth it  
P =>  butterflies and luxury my husband and i recentley went to encore and enjoyed our stay   we had a suite tower room they have there own ck in did not know waited in a zoo to ck in no lines   the room was very pretty in black and beiges and very roomey with a great bathroom   only problem i the pools no sun after   in the afternoon  had dinner at switch amazing  the show at the wynn is alot of fun  only con is that is a long walk to the middle of the strip   overall very happy  
P =>   Sorry Bellagio you ve been replaced  Traveling to Vegas once a year  we usually spend it at the Bellagio  We had been hiking around Arches and Zion National Park for most of the week  and decided to spend the last     days at Encore   great deals going on Check in was about    minutes and at  PM the place was hopping  It seems Encore is pretty popular at night  We didn t bring dress clothes with us this trip because of the hiking  and we did feel a tad out of place at that time of night in jeans hiking shoes backpacks  I m not saying it s a requirement or anything  it s just that a lot of the people that were frequenting at that time were dressed a little more formally We had paid the extra     for the panoramic view and I suggest everyone do the same  Upon making the reservation I requested a high floor and a strip view  Both requests were granted and not even mentioned  The room was spectacular  better than any Vegas hotel I have been in  especially for the price we paid  Flat panel TV s  wonderful bed   bath   living areas  Nice touches like our names on the phone and television menus  Remote controlled lighting schemes and drapes  Noise was never an issue  it always seemed like we were the only ones on our floor  Contradictory to other hotels we ve stayed at  housekeeping respected us turning on the privacy indicator   It s electronic along with an intercom at your door Location is probably the only slight strike against the Wynn   Encore  It sits off the strip a ways  and the most convenient way to get in out of the hotel is through the shops  We still prefer the Bellagio location  but this hotel was still a leisurely    minute walk from that area  Casino s especially in Encore seemed a lot quieter with a lot less smoke  A  for that  Checkout was quick  less than   minutes  we were offered assistance with our bags and with entering the cab  
P =>   Wonderful in every way  We stayed at Encore in Las Vegas for   nights in their panoramic room at the   th floor  From the time we stepped into the hotel  the attention to detail was everywhere  The place was amazing  It was luxurious in every way  from the roomy  marvel bathroom to the comfortable down covered bedspread  to the separate sitting area    it was hotel room like no other  A large flat TV separated the bedroom from the living room and it can swing     degrees  This was my hubby s favorite feature of the room  I don t think we can stay at any other hotels in Vegas now  because nothing else will do  Our room did not face the Las Vegas Blvd  but we had a wonderful view of the mountains  much nicer   The highlight of our stay was watching a sunrise one morning  It started with a red glow on the right side of the wall to wall window and eventually lit up the entire sky  It was absolutely breath taking and highlight of our trip We booked our room through Hotel com and it came with a     credit  We used this credit for dinner the hotel and had a wonderful eating experience  Here are a few tips I like to pass along    Book a room at the Resort rate and then ask for upgrade at the check in  It s cheaper    Don t touch anything in the fridge or the snack stand  If you removed anything for more than    seconds  the sensor will charge it automatically to your credit card    The safe in the room is not free    The panoramic room comes with two robes and slippers  If one is missing  ask the housekeeper  They are very accommodating    The room comes with essential toiletries but their moisturizer  while smells wonderful  is not very effective  Bring your own lotion if you have a dry skin    There are two electronic control panels in the room  one by the door and another one by the bedside  If you need to open close all the lights in the room just push a button  To open close the sheer curtain or and heavy curtain  just push a button  If you need a room service or privacy  just push a button  It s all at your fingertip    Your red keycard can be used as your casino players  club card at Wynn and Encore  It s yours to keep when you check out    Across from the hotel is a shopping mall  You can get water  wine  beer  and other necessities from ABC Stores in the mall for cheaper prices When we go on a trip  we want to have a wonderful memory  We certainly did on this trip  
P =>   Best Spa I have ever visited  I chose the Encore because it is one the newest and most luxurious hotels on the Strip  It did not disappoint  The lobby is amazing and the rooms are to die for  Our room was a panoramic room with an incredible view of the Strip  The room is spacious and the bathroom is amazingly comfortable  Everything was spotless Everyone in the group we were traveling with booked treatments at the spa  I am a spa junkie and try to visit whenever I am on a trip  I have to say that this spa made all of the other ones that I had visited look like a joke  What an amazing setting  The greeting area looks like something out of a movie  The dressing changing rooms were very luxurious  robes were comfortable and the treatment rooms were gorgeous  I was in such a state of relaxation that I feel asleep during my treatment  The water shower whirlpool sauna area is divine  I spent two hours there with my friends  When I had previously visited other spas  even five star ones  their whirlpool sauna areas have been less than inviting  Sometimes  there is no cold plunge pool or the steam room is not working  Not so here  They even had heated stone benches for relaxation I have to say I would come back to this hotel just to go to the spa  it is that good  Aside from the spa  the food is great Customer service needs a little improvement  especially at the front desk  but overall this hotel is a winner     
P =>   Most Beautiful Hotel in Vegas The Encore at Wynn was amazing  Although it had all of the necessities of Las Vegas  Casino  Restaurants  Pool  it was also like a hidden treasure to escape to  If you prefer to luxury not typical casinos  then this is your place  The casino is not huge but easily connects to the Wynn Hotel and Casino  Sports Book in Wynn ONLY   If you stay at Encore you have access to both their pool and the pool at the Wynn  which honestly I preferred  The rooms were great  the staff was great  overall BEST place I have stayed in Vegas  AND the SPA is like no other  just beautiful  
P =>   Encore highly recommended Hi   just back from a   night stay in Encore and overall it was really great  Stayed on the   th floor with a view of the strip  Did hear a little noise coming from other rooms at times  but nothing that kept us awake  Room was really nice  very good room service etc  Only thing I would say is the food at the pool is expensive and not great  I paid    dollars for nachos and a dip and it was nearly frozen it was so refrigerated  bit of a rip off  Cocktails were great though  Encore s location is just that bit out of the way compared to the Wynn and is not as well serviced with bars and restaurants  If I had to choose between the two  I would stay in the Wynn   just as luxurious and more central with more of a buzz  The recession is clearly affecting the resort as the Terrace Point Cafe was open    hours last year  but now only serves until     Went here for dinner one evening and the waiter was a string of misery  The Society Cafe in Encore is way better  great menu and food   
P =>   Absolutely worth your money I stayed at Encore   th oct     th oct and it was my first visit to Vegas  The hotel was wounderful and the staff very service minded  I loved every second of my stay  I had a Panoramic Suite with view over the strip  the suite was so nice  Really feels like a   star hotel and it s very very clean and neat  I will come back for sure  Since I love shopping I thought the location was great   next to the Fashion Show Mall  It was also a nice walk to the center of the strip  The weather was really nice too  like    degrees C  so I was hanging out by the pool getting served by the wounderful staff  Love love love this hotel  
P =>   The weather was beautiful Encore was so luxurious  I loved it     we had one of the top top rooms so the view of Las Vegas Boulevard  
P =>   Excellent luxury  Wonderful service  Modern  elegant  trendy  entertaining  part stuffy  part amazing  I would highly recommend  It s on the main strip and need a few days to absorb it all in  It can easily feel like your every day can feel that way   
P =>   Loved Loved Loved Encore  This was our first time staying here and it will not be our last  Arrived at check in around   pm on a Monday night and only waited about    minutes to check in  Excellent service from the front desk staff  Got a great room on the   th floor with a beautiful view down the south strip  Loved everything about the room  The sheets were so soft on a very comfy bed  The bathroom was spacious with great amenities and oversized towels  Never had one issue with the room  never heard any noise from the hallway  and had great housekeeping service  Received turndown service each night as requested and the room was always kept perfectly clean Enjoyed the smaller casino and the easy walk to Wynn for more slots and restaurants  Self park in the garage was very convenient We really enjoyed our stay and can t wait to stay again  
P =>   Excellent but not yet Perfect This was our third visit to Las Vegas in the last two years and we were looking forward to some sun  R amp R  night life and shopping  On our previous two trips we stayed at the Bellagio and the Wynn and enjoyed both trips  Brits tend to include Las Vegas in a round trip to LA and San Fran but we tend to go for a full week to Vegas  The journey is    hours flight with an   hours time difference We picked a car up at the Las Vegas Car Rental Centre  thereby hangs another story  but we eventually got to the Encore  Tip one  don t drive down The Strip it can take an hour  utiliise the highway and come off at Sands The valet service is free and efficient and the staff  followed by a quick and uneventfull check in  Our room      was large and pleasant  with one wall an entire picture window overlooking The Strip and part of the golf course  Obviously by British standards the rooms were enormous but strangely felt somewhat under equipped  Besides the lack of a coffee tea machine there was a serious lack of magazines and information on Las Vegas There is  in this day and age no unearthly reason why WiFi should not be free to resident guests in this type of hotel  We settled down for the first night and were happy that the Encore offered the same type of bathroom and fittings as we enjoyed at our previous stay at the Wynn The first day was extremely good where we opted for the pool  We preferred the larger pool to the European pool where chairs were plentiful as well as towels and a pleasant supply of free bottled water  The pool staff were excellent and helpful  Drinks and snacks like at most   star hotels are not cheap but they were presented nicely  If you feel like renting a Cabana  a double four poster bed or a large sun lounger for six in the pool there are plenty to choose from  we left these to the younger set  Like the Wynn there is even opportunity to play Blackjack or Craps near the pool  The Spa and the Gym were deserted probably because of the charge made to residents for using them  This is just profiteering on a grand scale and obviously has back fired We returned to our room at      pm to find it had not been made up  and on further inspection  we didn t notice the night before as we crashed out  there was dust everywhere  My wife went beserk and they quickly sent a team up to clean the room  From that point on the room was made spotless and they even turned down the beds and gave chocolates as per cruises The Encore is truthfully not a separate hotel but just another wing of the Wynn  your red resort card can be used anywhere on the property There are enough dinning places to suite most tastes and pockets with special occassions being easily catered for  For our part we like deli food and enjoyed ZouZou Crackers in the Wynn quite a few times  its a popular location  The Wynn buffet is hard to beat especially at weekend and I will defy anyone to come away hungry  We went for breakfast and dinner  Tip number two try and avoid the lines by eating later than normal at the buffet  i cannot commend it more  it is probably the best and most comprehensive of its type anywhere in the world Tip number three  Good walking shoes are essential in this hotel  its a hike to the front door and at least    minutes to the front door of the Wynn opposite the Fashion Show Mall  The walk from the Bellagio to the Encore is at least    minutes  To sum up for Brits who want to explore Vegas its a great place to stay  For Americans who fly in for a few days you have everything here don t leave the hotel One last tip  the shops on the Esplanade of both hotels feature some of the biggest top names in fashion  jewelry  as well as some excellent Wynn Encore merchandise  Bring plenty of money  you will need it           
P =>   Good Stay Stayed three nights for        a night and        free slot play promotion  We got the        a night upgrade to the   nd floor  for a great view of Las Vegas  The hotel room was beautiful throughout  The food and drinks were expensive in the hotel  A coffee was       and a    oz bottle of Coke or bottle of water was        The only good deal I found was the morning newspaper for        
P =>   Great hotel Wynn quality stamped all over it    Great looking hotel on the strip  I was a little disappointed that it was a bit on the far side of the strip away from most of the  quot action quot  but then again it s ON the strip so it really wasn t that bad    the inside furnishings of the Encore were simply stunning  Visual masterpieces at every turn  The front desk area  the casino  the pool  and the rooms were AMAZING    I didn t gamble here  my fave is New York  New York so that was my choice of places to play  but the table areas looked nice and clean and weren t bogged down with cigarette smoke  The staff were all VERY nice and welcoming and I wish I could remember the name of the guy that brought our bags up to our floor because he was one of the best surprises of the trip    he answered our questions about the hotel and about the ins and outs of our room  lighting controls  blinds and shades controls  etc  etc  and just went out of his way to make us feel welcome  Our view was amazing  overlooking the pool and providing a view down the strip towards TI that allowed us to view the fireworks at night  Getting in and out of the hotel  many times to see the other stuff in Vegas  was a cinch with no problems at all  If you can get a great value for staying here make sure you take advantage of it like we did    we ll definitely be back if we get a great offer again  Otherwise  I might look towards staying more towards the middle of the strip if you re looking for a more centralized location  All in all  I was very pleased with my stay at the Encore and everything it had to offer  You can tell that Wynn did everything he could to make sure that the place carried his name with style  Definitely recommended    
P =>   The Best My new favorite hotel  We were only there one night   I can t wait to get back to it  High Style at it s best  amazing views and outstanding service  
P =>   Love Encore This review is from il             We were there when Danny Gans passed away  RIPWe spent   glorious nights at The Encore  We got in on a Sunday morning and tried to check in early about      pm   The lines were crazy with no ryhme or reason  it was a big pain to check in  We were just happy to get a room around  pm  It was room       the view wasn t the best but we were just happy to be there   We loved the room once we got settled  I really liked all the extra drawers  over by the tv and in the closet    I don t like living out of a suitcase and The Wynn was lacking the extra space  Although I wish the closet was a tad bigger because we like alot of space  The room was a standard resort room and plenty big enough for us   we liked the layout  The bathroom is my favorite part    it is great to lounge in a soaking tub listening to the music  I like the area to put on your makeup but I think they could have better lighting there  thinking they might do that on purpose so you wont see what you really look like after so many late nights    lol   Their bed what is there to say that hasn t been said before       it is so comfortable  We ended up going to the homestore and buying a set of their king sheets and pillows  they will ship them and fast    so we can enjoy a piece of the Encore at home  We did alot of late night room service for their delish sundaes and other fast food and the breakfast room service  We was not too crazy about the breakfast  I had the lobster bendict hubby had ham and cheese omelet     mine was fine but he disliked his very much  but late night was beginning to be a problem because it was so easy and yummy  I think we gained    lbs  I got a    minute in room massage from Cheryl   I believe she said she was the head therapist and did the hiring at The Wynn  She was very good    I like a deep hard touch and she did not disappoint    We did a couples massage at the Bellagio   we had free two nights at Bellagio   so we took advantage of one night  left our stuff at Encore just took overnight bag  just so we could see how it was because we never stayed there  Anyway it was an awful experience  I will do a separate review for that stay and couples massage   It was the first massage that actually ever put me in a bad mood     I was very stressed and upset  Husband suggested calling Encore and setting another one up there  I was thinking about going into the spa to get it done but I decided against it for a couples massage in room  Well just what we needed   I had Denise and hubby had Stephine  he enjoyed his very much     Denise was WONDERFUL her techniques were different then most massages I ve had  She had good skills for a deep firm massage  She was my favorite of all the therapists I ve had at the Wynn and Encore and I will certainly be asking for her at our next visit  A couples massage in room was a great treat for my husband and I  We did not go to the spa  just the in room massages so cannot give an opinion on that We dined at Botero  did a separate review  loved it We went to Society Cafe a couple mornings   it was kinda like terrace point cafe  one day I got the frosted flake french toast I read about    yes they are yummy but very sweet more like a dessert  once was enough  We liked the layout of the Encore  We usually valet park but found it much more easier to come and go to the self parking there so we used that quite abit  Also took advantage of the business center to get boarding numbers  no cost for this  it is located down near the self parking We don t use the pool or do the nightlife so we don t have an opinion on that   Overall we really love the Encore and will be back in the spring       we spent most of our gambling time there as well  the casino is very comfortable and the one we liked the most  
P =>   Excellent Again This was the second stay at Encore and another really excellent stay  After staying earlier this year  I believed it has improved and some of the early opening concerns have now gone  Rooms are being kept well and the restaurants have settled down although our meal at Botero was a little rushed espacially for Tuesday evening  We didn t try the spa the first time but made full use of it this time and having been to many of the resorts in Vegas this spa is the best by far  if your staying at the Encore or the Wynn use this wonderful spa  We ll be back again  
P =>   Excellent room smaller and quieter brother to Wynn This is a great addition to the Wynn property  You now have even more options for dining  nightlife  the pool  etc  I didn t leave the property after the sun went down on my   night stay because Encore Wynn kept me occupied  The restaurants are all top notch and there are plenty of bars and clubs with XS being the hottest place in town and Tryst still very good  The room was very well designed and appointed very nicely  My only complaint is that the TV location makes it difficult to sit on the couch and watch TV the way the room is laid out  But if you re going to Vegas to watch TV you re in the wrong town  The Encore feels a bit smaller and less busy than it s neighbor Wynn  
P =>   Lived up to my expectations  except for room floor I booked a room at the encore for my    year anniversary  I called ahead and told the booking agent at the hotel it was my    year anniversary and would appreciate a room on the upper floors  Upon my check in at the hotel  the receptionsist informed me that the request was made  but unfortunately the rooms on the upper floor were not available  but if I wanted to pay for one  I could   So much for a  quot  Happy Anniversay  and glad you chose our hotel to stay at  quot  Either way the room we stayed in was very nice and comfortable  I must say that the attention to detail was evident  and the service was great  I did golf at the Wynn golf course  It was a beautiful course and the greens were in great condition  I do think there are better course in Las Vegas for the price         I did eat at the country club restaurant  The food was just ok  not sure why there is all the hype  My wife used the spa at the encore hotel  It is very beautiful  but also very big  almost too big  giving you the sense of over commercialized  The pool at the Encore is nothing great  Acutally it is somewhat small  and overcrowded  I guess Mr  Wynn wanted to make sure folks are in the casino and not spending too much time at the pool  I would recommend the Encore to friends as it was a great hotel   eventhough there were a few mis steps  
P =>   Beautiful Property mediocre service The Encore property is beautiful  The strip view room I had was quite spacious  There were no noise issues as some have mentioned from outside  The downfall came in service  The front desk was generally reluctant to answer questions and the workers there seemed cold and unfriendly  The only employees who seemed particular friendly were the housekeeping staff  Not what I would have expected from what is trying to be a   star hotel  Since many people  myself included  realize that the hotel is a good value for a room but the prices are high in other respects  I have a few suggestions on saving on the extras     Taxi from the airport  always tell the driver to take Paradise Road  If not  once he hears Encore  or Wynn  he will likely take you on the highway and it will double the cost     Water snacks  walk to      about     blocks north of Encore on same side of street  Caveat  the area is not as nice as most of the strip south  Upside  bottled water for    instead of    in the hotel room     Fashion mall  across from Encore Wynn  Starbucks for breakfast is half the price of the cafe in the hotel  Also  Sushi Ra has good half price sushi from      pm      Boarding pass  Encore Wynn lets you print it for free in their business center instead of paying their usual    per minute internet rate  
P =>   Encore is Top Notch We stayed at Encore for four nights to celebrate our first wedding anniversary  We had a wonderful experience  Check in was seamless  and we were upgraded to a panoramic suite  The only difference being the panoramic suite is on higher floors than the resort suite and therefore has  quot panoramic quot  views  The room was plush  comfy and spotless  We really enjoyed the spa and fitness centre  as well as the pool  The only downside of the pool is the     hour of shade that starts around  pm because of the closeness of the Encore and Wynn buildings  We ate at various of the Wynn Encore restaurants and each was excellent  Sinatra s was especially good  The Encore is located at the far end of the strip  so it can seem far from other attractions  On the flip side  it is very close to the Fashion Show Mall and the Palazzo Venetian complex  so it is very close to high end restaurants and shopping  It goes without saying that everything is expensive  from    coffee to     cocktails  But it is all part of the high end luxury  The only negative for us happened at checkout  We booked directly through the Wynn with a promotion that included     credit per night  At checkout  they advised that the promotion is a total     per stay  While we acknowledge the website currently offers the     per stay credit  we booked under a different promotion but with no proof we were left with only our word  We weren t the only ones at check out making this complaint  We are going to follow up with the hotel because we think it was at best a poorly executed promotional item and at worse  deliberately misleading  It was an unfortunate way to end an otherwise great stay  
P =>   Great Room Great View So so Service and Cleanliness my family and i were staying at   connecting suite rooms at the   th floor  the upgraded room with view facing the south    view of the beautiful las vegas strip view  the view was breath taking  especially at night  the room was great    but it doesn t feel like      sq  ft as the hotel claims  one of the rooms was dirty   with a rotten apple left from previous hotel guests that was not cleaned up and removed  then we found out if you do special request  there will not be a nightly room make up  i would think for such a high end hotel  nightly room make up would be a  quot must quot   rather than a special request  the room has fancy amenities like electronic control of window coverings and light switches    the bathtub was also deep    but it would be better if it is longer  i would stay at this hotel again  but i am hesitate about its housekeeping services  
P =>   Bravo Encore  The Encore is a beautiful hotel  The rooms are spacious and the bathrooms are huge  The views are terrific  The staff is very attentive I would definitely stay there again  
P =>   Beautiful Hotel in Convenient Location Overall  I enjoyed my stay at the Encore  My only complaint was that the bathroom could have been cleaned a little better  especially for an upscale hotel  There were soap stains on the counter and shower ledge which made it seem as if they weren t as clean as they should have been  Although the rooms are suites  the basic rooms do feel more like a regular hotel room  They are larger than the average hotel room  but a foyer is included in the square footage and the bedroom and living areas are not as distinctly separate as they are in many suites  The bed was very comfortable and I especially liked the pillows  I didn t have any problems with the staff at the Encore and they seemed friendly and helpful  except the concierge always seemed to recommend taking a taxi even to nearby places within walking distance  
P =>   Wonder Hotel Not crowded at all  Very nice room  Valet parking is fast and easy  Pools are great  
P =>   sumptuousluxuriousspotless stayed at the encore for   nights from oct  th  it s luxury on a grand scale  the decor and furnishings are of the highest quality We booked a  standard  room which is a suite  you don t need to upgrade  and were blown away by the quality   the bed is to die for best sleep we had in ages  lots of attention to detail and everywhere is spotlessly clean It is real   star and prices to match If you re wealthy the in house shops and restaurants will please you but for the rest of us there is plenty on the strip The pool areas are well laid out but get very busy at weekends Great service  everyone is very helpful I m trying to think of a negative but can t find one  
P =>   Encore   the perfect mix of style and substance  Enjoyed a wonderful   night stay at Encore in early ober  Was aware of some noise issues other Advisors had given  and upon check in requested a room on a higher level  Paying a little extra got us a room on the   th floor  Resort Suite King  and we didn t encounter any noise issues  The Room is beautifully designed with a large bathroom  large bedroom area  and separate living area with couch and work desk  It felt more like a private apartment than a hotel room  spacious and inviting The Casino is medium sized with just enough tables and slots to be buzzing but not to the point of being overly crowded  The area is brightly light with windows out to the pool area  windows are a rarity in a town notorious for you not wanting to know the time of day  The Restaurants all offer a  quot taster menu quot  at set times each night and they are a great way to experience fine dining without being overpriced  I highly recommend Switch  which over the course of your meal lives up to the name   great food  great service The Spa area is a world of its own and any description will not do it justice   let s just say WOW  The Pool areas  general and European  offer great sun and drinks  Tip  get to the pool early as in the afternoon it does become shady due to the shadow the hotel casts Location  opposite the Fashion Show mall it s at the end of the strip which is great if you want the Vegas experience without all the non stop neon  The shopping in the hotel is great with all designer brands  but for real value cross over to Fashion Show or get a taxi to the Designer Premium Outlet mall and grab many great designer names and unbelievable bargains As part of the Wynn empire you know you are going to get great service and luxury  You really do feel like a VIP even when you are playing a     table or   c slot  
P =>   Worth the Splurge if You Seek A Young and Hip Vibe  If you are on the fence about this one folks  just go ahead and book it  Be sure to compare their own posted room rates with the ones floating around the web  I found my deal through USAirways Vacations since  this time  I didn t feel like driving six hours each way on my honeymoon  The check in process feels reminiscent of the Wynn since the front desk people are still just as moody  Our front desk person  I believe her name was Natalya  was clearly not glad to be there and provided little help with our room selection  I discovered that both sides of the Encore tower have a view of the strip since its floor plan lays perpendicular to it  It just depends whether you want the south side  views of Mirage  TI  Bellagio  etc   or the north  Circus Dumpus  Riviera  etc    I was delighted with my   nd floor south side room  The room is clearly an upgraded version of the Wynn experience  The lighting system and privacy features are smart and easy to use  The room feels large  quite  and comfortable  Room service value is good considering the location  Entrees such as burgers and sandwiches cost about     each plus a    room service fee and mandatory     gratuity  Guys  seize the moment one time and order a breakfast room service The casino is tight overall but tends to become more generous in the evening  I was disappointed with the sports book since the Encore does not have one and the drink service in the Wynn s sport book was impossible  This sports book does not cater to the    bet taker at the horse races  You need to bet at least     each time up to      before you can get complimentary drink coupons  But the most frustrating part for me was that you were not even able to buy a drink from the cocktail lady as she went by  Location  Friends  a big plus for the Encore is that is located right next to a Walgreens  McDonalds  and Peppermill restaurant  This means that you have plenty of reasonable food and grocery options  Just walk south  towards Circus Barfus  But if you do feel like having a special evening  without doubt  you must visit Sinatra  This restaurant is a personal tribute to Mr  Sinatra from Steve Wynn himself  As of this review  each restaurant in the Wynn property is offering a three course menu for a pre determined price  The course at Sinatra was     and included a glass of wine  Please give yourself this experience Overall  if you are a Vegas fan be sure to check this one off your list  The Encore is a grown up version of the Hard Rock but is chiseled from the rare stone of the Vegas hay day  You will be sure to make some memories at the Encore  Have fun  
P =>   Encore to what  I am just finishing up   days here at Encore  Check in was not easy  We had   rooms and only   were ready  All   were to next to each other  We reserved   months in advance    rooms were on the   nd floor  the best they can do was   th for the  rdmroom  The problem is the    is a different set of elevators  So each time we wanter see our family  we had to go to the lobby and switch elevators  In each of the rooms  you could hear the people in the next room drying their hair  talking and flushing toilets  Also  the hall noise is really bad at  am  The room has   tv on a swivel so it blocks the view from the bedroom to the sitting area and outside  The AT M charges       to talke out       I would nor recommend this hotel  
P =>   Our new Las Vegas favorite We love this hotel  Had a room on the   th floor with a mountain view  The room was elegant and tasteful  Just the right size  Amazing bed and linens  The remote control for lighting  drapes and privacy is a nice touch  We are early risers and watched the sunrise every morning over the peak of the mountain  Spectacular  Usual amenities but top drawer  No coffee maker in the room but we brought our own kettle and instant coffee supplies so not a problem at      a m  It is an expensive hotel  From a purely value proposition perspective  probably not the best choice  From a feel good  spoil yourself proposition perspective  it is the only choice  It is memorable Did most of our dining at Encore and Wynn  Highly recommend Daniel Boulud  more later   Society  delicious fixed price menu    and Terrace Pointe Cafe  great breakfast  free WIFI   Wazuzu had great food but the service was a little spotty  We had issues with SW steak house  Had a reservation for      and had requested a view for the Lake of Dreams show  We arrived on time and were told it would be a few minutes  We approached the desk at      and were told that it would be another    minutes for a Lake view  We said we didn t want to wait and could we be seated at another table  They sat us against the back wall  as far away as you could get from the Lake  We were disappointed with the way we were treated and left  After waiting so long and with a reservation to give us the worst table in the restaurant was not acceptable  That s how we got to Daniel Boloud  Much better choice with an excellent menu and we had a Lake side view  Service was amazing  Sommelier was extremely knowledgeable  All in all a great evening  One of the best meals ever  sauteed foix gras  seared scallops   yum  Had the buffet one night   is it my imagination but was it better last year    Gambling here is fine   feels a bit tight but the casino is bright and elegant and the staff are terrific  Participated in a daily slot tournament  Didn t win anything but it was fun The location is not terrific but renting a car in Vegas is inexpensive so renting one is no big deal  I wouldn t let the location be a deterrent to staying here  We did walk from Encore to Planet Hollywood Hotel and back one day  Everything in Vegas looks closer than it really is  My advice is to take the car and tip the valet If you want to golf here take note  The course is one of the most beautiful I have seen  We did not golf here but it s now on my bucket list  The green fees are      per person       during the summer when the thermometer reads        Includes green fees  caddy  mandatory   clubs and shoes  Someday     We did not take advantage of the fitness centre but be advised that there is a charge to use it  I think     per day  unless you have booked a spa treatment  Then it is complimentary  The pools are lovely  No children allowed at the European Pool  topless optional  Not a child friendly hotel  Strollers are not permitted  although I did see some  but Vegas is no longer targetting the family demographic We usually stay at the Venetian because we are lucky enough to be comped for our rooms  However  now that we ve found Wynn Encore there is no other choice  There are Vegas hotels and there are Wynn and Encore  These two properties stand alone As an aside  I did see Steve Wynn one morning just strolling through the hotel and shopping esplanade  Nice touch  He was very friendly to everyone who approached him  He should be very proud of these two hotels  
P =>   Classy Escape Nice rooms Friendly staff Amazing SPA Highly recommended 
P =>   beautiful the best We ve been in may resorts  This one is the best  I will come back again  
P =>   Every offer is a Scam  We ve stayed here before and have a recent trip coming up  I can t stand that they try and manipulate people with these empty offers that they email  They recently offered a  quot Free quot  night   So  I decided to see if there was any value in it  Of course not   sure  you can get a free night   if  you re willing to pay MORE than what they offer if you weren t using the free night  So  if you want to take them up on the  quot free quot  night    go ahead  you ll pay more  We ve stayed in Vegas often  primarily at Palazzo and Venetian  We ve used different offers they ve provided over the years and they ve always been fair and legitimate  The fact that Encore Wynn tries to scam people is reflected in the attitude of customer service  I ve yet to post my experience about having a Wedding with Wynn and the manipulation  scam artists in the Wedding Salons and Catering is so pervasive it s amazing  They totally ruin the experience with the lack of value and the constant feeling of  quot gotcha quot  with another minimum or surcharge you were never told of in the beginning  We are so disappointed we selected Wynn Encore that after this trip we ll never stay there again  Don t be fooled by their initial presentation    they want your deposit    after that   how they scam you will have you laughing at times that they actually try to charge you a surcharge for serving drinks in a venue that only serves drinks  That s one of many examples that will amaze those who ve experienced this  
P =>  Great Service and Cleanliness but    The rooms at this hotel are very clean and service is excellent  However  the hotel is a bit far from the main part of the Las Vegas Strip and you have to pay extra to utilize the fitness center  
P =>  Luxurious retreat with amazing pool  Encore is a beautiful hotel with great dining options  beautiful rooms  and an amazing pool  There are   pool areas  one of which is  quot European style  quot  which means tops optional  Staying at the Encore  you also have the access to the Wynn pools  but the Encore side is much better  The Encore is nice because the main casino area is not as bustling or crazy at like other hotels  more quiet   but you make a quick walk through the hall connecting to the Wynn  and then you ll see the typical crowds you expect in Vegas  They also have the new hottest club there called XS  Be warned that the bouncers there are pretty rude  Try to go into the gift shop in Encore to get some coupons for a reduced price to XS  The Encore hotel rooms are so big  and the bedding is very plush and soft  Service is great too  I just recommend that you don t miss the pool experience if you go there  but it gets crowded fast  Try claiming two poolside chairs in the morning and sleeping in them until you re ready to wake up  
P =>  A Delightful Suprise Won a trip to Las Vegas with a   night stay a the new Encore at the Wynn  Had never stayed at the Wynn and was very excited when I checked out the Encore on their website  Upon arrival we were treated like royalty and I was amazed at every turn  Let s just say that  quot I am spoiled rotten now  quot Our room had a view of the strip and with the floor to ceiling windows and all the beautiful appointmentsthroughout the room and bathroom  I was in awe for   days  I love the hustle and bustle of Vegas but by staying at this end of the strip it was less congested and I now have a new place to stay  A cocktail and a dark room sitting on the setteee facing the bright lights of the strip at midnight was the perfect nightcap  WOuld do it all over again in a minute  
P =>  the best The Encore is amazing  The hotel and casino are bright  open and beautifully decorated  The King Suite was huge and comfortable  The bathroom is large with giant bath and shower  We stayed on the   th floor on the North  great views  From the valet to security to front desk   the entire staff was genuine and knowledgeable  We ate at the SW Steakhouse    the steaks melt in your mouth  Le Reve is awesome  The only drawback was that my budget did not fit well at the Encore  
P =>  exceptional quality and service Beautiful hotel  exceptionally spacious rooms  lovely pool  and wide variety of restaurants  Perfect for all ages 
P =>  Very nice rooms somewhat inconvenient location Stayed here last month on a short trip to Vegas  I met a friend at the airport  and we checked in together  My room was available at check in  his wasn t  but they called his cell a couple hours later to let us know it was ready  and gave us rooms next to each other  I had read on this site about the noise from the nightclub  so asked for a room on the other side of the hotel  The room was lovely  with floor to ceiling windows that let in a lot of natural light  and convenient buttons next to the bed to control the shades and lighting  The king bed was extremely comfortable  I never used the TV except for room check out  but it was large and blended in well  Amenities were just OK  but the bathroom was mostly well laid out  and the separate shower was large  with good water pressure  The tub looked a little crammed in  and to me seemed slightly claustrophobic  I am a woman      quot   not overweight   The casino floor was subdued  with good access to the Wynn  but it was difficult to find a  regular  blackjack table at either one without some kind of gimmick  The dealers and pit bosses were friendly  and I liked the system of using the room key as your players card  etc Overall  I would recommend the hotel for anyone who wants a luxurious room and doesn t mind that the hotel is quite far from the other end of the strip  
P =>  best hotel in Vegas The Encore at Wynn is by far the best hotel in Vegas  It s luxurious  beautiful  over the  top decorated with the friendliest and most courtiest staff I ve ever encountered  Starting from the bell hop to the shoe shine man in the men s bathroom we were blown away  First the lobby  When you get out of the taxi and enter the lobby you know you ve died and gone to heaven  Frest flowers are everywere  All throughout the hotel the chandeliers are incredibly beautiful  Each venue is decorated with a theme of color  but all the colors blend throughtout the hotel  Check out all the bathrooms  marble like you ve never seen before  And so clean Our room was beautiful  Floor to ceiling windows overlooked the strip and we were even able to see the show on the waterfall  The couch was so large it could fit in my living room  Controls closed the draperies and lights on the side of my bed  The bathroom was so big and clean all we wanted to do was shower all bathe  The robe is to die for  Silk on the outside  terry on the inside  The casino was super clean  We didn t win but the beauty of the casino made up for it  First time I ve ever seen fresh flowers in a casino  Housekeeping cleaned the casino all day  Everywhere you looked someone waseither wiping down or dusting the top of the slot machnes One day we sat ourside at the pool  It could have used more waitress service  but otherwise we enjoyed the pool Shopping was out of our league  All the shops were high end but fun to go in and dream  I was the first customer at the new Taste of Wynn shop We definitely will return to this wonderful hotel soon  And when we do we won t go anyp lace else  
P =>  The most Beautiful place I have stayed in USA  This is truly the most amazing  lavish  plush  sophisticated hotel I have seen in this country It is world in itself  Amazing shopping  food  spa  casino  shopping etcThere was no need to leave this place Huge suites facing the city  breath taking view  Loved it   The show LE REVE was out fo the world    
P =>  Classy fancy beautiful extravagant BRILLIANT     Hi  My husband and I stayed at this Hotel a few weeks ago while on a weekend trip with friends  Some of our friends stayed at the Wynn  and others further up the strip  This hotel is really gorgeous  it is alot more updated and modern than the Wynn  although the Wynn is also nice  the Encore is just a bit more glam  I could imagine Madonna or Pdiddy would stay here when in Vegas We were on the   th floor looking out at old Vegas  as cool as that was  think the next time we will ask to face out over the strip  but still     floors up we could see the dessert and the mountains too  brilliant It is about a   min walk to Treasure Island for some more easier on the wallet gambling  the min at most Blackjack tables at the Encore was     A few mins away from the hotel is a huge liquour store for pre going out drinks in your fancy room When you check in you get a     gift card  which we used for breakfast and internet in our room   The rooms were VERY quiet I would love to stay here again  
P =>  My new favorite place to stay in Las Vegas This was my first stay at the Encore and it won t be my last  I traveled with friends and we had separate rooms  one with queen beds and one with a king bed  Both rooms were extremely  quot roomy quot  and exquisitely decorated  Attention to detail was evident in each of the rooms  Each and every hotel staff member that we encountered was friendly  polite and helpful  Housekeeping services were excellent  Rooms were cleaned quickly and  again  attention to detail was a key  We ate only one meal in the Encore because the Wynn buffet was a favorite  The one meal at the Encore was at the Society Cafe  Again  the service was excellent and so was the food  The prices were quite reasonable considering this is not generally an inexpensive property  I truly have no complaints about the hotel except that the soaps and hair products provided for use cannot be purchased anywhere except at the hotel gift shop  The products  Desert Bambu  manufactured specifically for Wynn properties  were definitely of a high end quality  not the typical hotel product  Unfortunately  I thought I could purchase them online after leaving  but I could not  This is just another reason to plan a return visit in the near future  
P =>  The only flaw   noise One absolutely amazing hotel  I couldn t wait to stay there  Some people don t dig the decor of the casino  but I totally get it  I stayed in one of the resort suites  The room itself was incredibly well furnished  The place looked like a little apartment  The color scheme was muted and tasteful  Personally  one of my favorite things in the room was the gadget by the bed that allowed you to open and close the shutters  Again  some people have complained about the placement of the television  but I thought it was perfect  I had no trouble checking in  I think it was one of the quickest check ins I ve had in a Las Vegas hotel  The staff was polite  changed my reservation at the last minute and  even though it was the y   weekend  accommodated my request for a specific location to see the fireworks  Extremely professional front desk staff Now  the bad part  Unfortunately  the place is noisy  Hall noise  toilets flushing  doors slamming   och  It was almost too much  I will admit that I turn in for bed around the time that most of Las Vegas is leaving for the evening  That surely had a bit to do with my frustration  However  it is disappointing to note that Mr  Wynn went all out to create a spectacular hotel in every way  but cut corners on the soundproofing  In a hotel as fabulous as Encore  I should not hear toilets flushing I would go back  despite the noise  The place is just that fabulous  
P =>  Elegant Beautiful accomodations My wife and I stayed at the Encore at Wynn resort last tember              It was our first stay at this resort and I have to admit that it is one of the best resort casinos in Las Vegas  The rooms were nicely appointed  the beds were comfortable  pillows were super soft and the comforters were suple Our check in process went well and the staff at the front desk were courteous and carried themselves in a professional manner The Encore s pool area is one of the nicer pools in Las Vegas   they provide nice thick and newer towels and you can get poolside service as wait staff is always inquiring if you needed anything at that time  There s a European pool area with a pool bar and gaming tables such as blackjack and craps   so you can cool down at the pool  have a drink at their bar and play some games at your own leisure I like the accessiblity of the hotel to the Fashion Show mall which is right across the street from it and being at the heart of the strip   accessing other casinos was not a problem We will definitely be back  
P =>  Clearly the best place to stay in Las Vegas  As i always do before travelling  I consulted Trip Advisor to see what people were saying about Encore  The Wynn in Las Vegas  To those reviewers out there that wrote less than wonderful remarks  I am pleased to say that nothing you mentioned was even remotely accurate during my stay First off  the location is fantastic  Vegas is as pedestrian friendly as it gets and Encore is not  out of the way  or  poorly situated  at all  Each morning we walked through the Casino and through the shopping areas to the Wynn  From the Wynn we were a short stroll to the Palazzo  the Venetian and everything else  Walking from Encore to the Bellagio took less than       minutes More importantly  the rooms are spacious and opulent  We had a room on the   th floor  to the right off the elevator which made for an incredible southern view down the strip all the way to the Bellagio  The layout of the room allowed for a view from every angle  We could see for miles   but at night  the lights made the view arguably second to none I found this hotel to be far and away the best  I have stayed at Bellagio  Wynn  the Venetian  Mandalay and Caesars  None really come close   well the Wynn does obviously  but Encore s rooms are bigger and the pool area at Encore is superior as well as it captures more sun late in the day Dining at Encore Wynn was ideal   you had so many choices  The coffee bar off the elevator stack was a godsend in the morning and truly everyone from the front desk attendant to every dealer pitboss waiter waitress was more than eager to assist us Check in was a breeze  Yes  they pitched me on the     upgrade   but it was so worth it to get a south facing room  We were highly impressed with just how well appointed the rooms were  Steve Wynn really thought of everything this time  By comparison now  the Bellagio looks tired   and i would stay at The Wynn   but Encore is the new kid on the block in many ways I suppose it helps that i proposed to my girlfriend on this trip   and this hotel offers many romantic spots to get the deal sealed  Im not surprised she wants to go back very soon  And when we do   it will be an encore at Encore    nothing else compares  
P =>  Stunning Beautiful hotel  the basic suite I had took my breath away  I also got to experience the most expensive room service sandwich I ve ever paid for   and it was delicious  The bright and opulently decorated casino was easy to navigate  I can t wait for my next visit in     
P =>  The Encore was a Horrendous experience  After staying at the Encore at the Wynn in Las Vegas I would not recommend staying in the hotel if you want piece of mind  During the entire stay they were doing repairs on in the guestrooms and constantly were accessing the rooms  The room service was mediocre at best and the final touch of class the Encore added at the end of the trip was to rip our bag when they loaded it into the cab for our return trip home  I noticed the tear in the bag when we got to the airport and photographed the damage and sent it to the security department of the hotel along with a phone call  It took them     days to return my call after numerous attempts  They finally issued a report and stated that the tear was not their responsibility because they could not find the video  If you value piece of mind and you property  I would recommend staying as far away from this hotel as possible  
P =>  Excellent Hotel Hands down this is the best large hotel I have ever stayed in  I was there with my husband  parents and brother for   nights in mid tember and we all loved it  The rooms are stylish  comfortable and very large with fantastic views of the Strip  The service is excellent   only downside is all the extras   mini bar  spa etc   are very expensive  However this is to be expected in Vegas  We will be back again and will definitely stay at the Encore  
P =>  Beautiful Hotel Great hotel I think the Bellagio has better service but the rooms at Encore are probably the best on the strip  
P =>  Fabulous    The Encore is absolutely FABULOUS   Everything about this hotel is simply fabulous  We had a room on the   th floor overlooking the pool  There is a controller by the bed that allows you to operate all of the lights and drapes in the room  Very nice sitting area with large sofa  There is a large flat screen TV in between the bedroom and sitting area that can be spun around to face either area  arate tub and large shower with double sinks and a separate toilet room in the large bathroom  The casino area has huge red glass chandeliers  I have stayed in many hotels in Vegas and this is the most beautiful one yet  
P =>   Fabulous Hotel great staff amazing food and yes classy  Wow  WOW  I loved Encore  I recommend it to anyone traveling to Vegas  a couple  group of single guys or girls  anyone  I went with my husband as part of our honeymoon and we loved it    will hopefully be back again next year   The rooms are hot    large  spacious  elegant  modern    to name a few  The bed was heaven and the view was gorgeous  I love the remote controlled everything    they had a remote control that opened and closed the blinds and shear drapes  that turned off all the lights in the room  living area  and bathroom  that locked in whether you wanted privacy or your room to be made up  etc  The tv was a nice flat screen  Loved the large  spacious bathroom and the robes  Everything was perfectly clean and luxurious The service was great    checking in was easy and quick  The concierge was very helpful with all our questions and recommended some great spots  The restaurants were really good    we loved Wazazu and the restaurants in the Wynn were fantastic as well     esp Okada  We were in Vegas   days and we didnt venture out to eat anywhere but the Wynn and Encore  since everything was so good The club XS was absolutely amazing  Great music  great crowd  Tryst at the Wynn  also  absolutely fabulous  They had tons of shops    most of them very high end  so we didnt do as much shopping as we d like  but theyre definitely fun to browse around in and just to walk around and window shop   Overall  like another reviewer stated  the Encore is almost classy    which is so hard to say about anything in Vegas  You go to Vegas for the novelty of it  the craziness    Encore is almost a getaway from all that  Yet it still has the corny red chandeliers and loud carpeting   but its still a whole lot of fun  Enjoy  
P =>   Exceptional Service   I am not a Vegas type person     I love entertainment  but typically view Vegas as a bit tacky and have a    hour rule  However  while the Encore has a casino and the general Vegas y atmosphere  buffets  slot machines  smoke everywhere  it seemed  dare I say  CLASSY for Vegas  The level of service was exceptional  I mean  just phenomenally incredible  Each and every person treated us with a level of professionalism and service that outdid any place I have ever stayed  The pool area was great as well  We enjoyed the Adults Only pool where it is permissible to go topless although many did not take advantage of this option  We ate at both the SW Steakhouse and Boudin s french restaurant  They both overlook the  quot lake of dreams quot  which has mini shows throughout dinner service and they are entertaining to say the least  You don t forget you are in Vegas  The lake of dreams has a wall of water that cascades down into a lake  Very cool  You can sit outside inside  so when making reservations  be sure to mention you would like outside  Our room was a panoramic room  We also checked out a salon suite in the Tower Suites  but we enjoyed our panoramic room much more  It was on a high floor  floor to ceiling views of the strip  and overall a great room  The one complaint with the room is that the flat screen TV is placed between the bedroom section and the sitting room area and we could not move it to enjoy the nighttime view of the strip  
P =>   Vegas at its best This was our third time in Las Vegas and the best hotel by far its new stylish and imaculate Before booking we checked it out on Trip Advisor and read some negative reviews im sure some people are a bit slow on the uptake First thing drinks and food are not cheap but it is a five star hotel which cost millions of dollars to build and to run  this has to be paid for somehow If you want a beer for a buck and a cheap hot dog go to the places that do that dont go to a five star resort and expect to live on the cheap Secondly thousands stay here every night and tens of thousands pass thru the casino bars  restaurants and shops every day So dont expect the bartender waitress or hotel manager to remember your name unless your a high roller its not a personal service type of place Saying that the staff were perfect and the food and drinks were as good as it gets If it takes you    or    minutes to check in live with it your not the only person there Our resort suite was perfect  big bathroom great sitting area with large tv black out curtains electric operated  and its true what they say about a Wynn bed The pool does get a bit packed at the weekend if your not down there early you wont get a bed It may be at the quiet end of the strip for some people but for     in a cab you are at Mandalay Bay which is the furthest hotel away on the strip In summing up this place is better than the Bellagio The Venitian The Paris and the rest so please dont complain about the price of the food and drinks When we go back to vegas we know where we are staying ps if you want a quieter room just ask at check in and dont have one that overlooks the pool night club  
P =>   BEST HOTEL EVER  WORTH EVERY PENNY I was totally  blown away  by this beautiful  elegant  stylish hotel  The suite was amazing and attention to detail everywhere   from the exceptional bed  amp  fine bedding to the remote control curtains Yes it is a pricey hotel and I was a little anxious to see if it would be worth it        worth ever penny and more  It is not just a hotel stay  but a truley wonderful experience that you will never forget  We have been to practically all the   star hotels in Vegas and this one is by far the one that really warrants the  five stars  in every way Spotlessly clean everywhere   service and standards      Restaurants we found a little too pricey  but venture out to suit your budget I am the most critical and fussy customer  and can honestly say   no negatives here at all Construction everywhere at the moment on Las Vegas strip   not around the Wynn and the Encore though   middle of the strip looks like a construction site so this hotel is well out of the way of all the cranes  dust and noise etc  Perfectly located Book it    you will love it  
P =>   Great Rooms  Huge suites   insanely comfortable beds   remote control curtains and lights   gigantic bathroom  I have to say that Steve Wynn knows luxury My main purpose for this trip was to attend a tradeshow at the convention center  Great location for that  There was a show sponsored shutlle going  but cabs were only about    I used the spa at the Wynn  which was very nice   great workout room as well  The unique thing about the Spa was the natural light in the jacuzzi area  Nice touch  However  it was on the small side  My husband used both Wynn and Encore spas and said the Encore spa was even nicer and larger They also have some prix fixe meal deals going on  with dinner at Wazuzu going for      The cons were the Encore pool   didn t like the openess of the set up  I preferred going over to the Wynn Pool  Also  the food options at Wynn were a little more attractive  The omlette at the Terrace Cafe was scrumptious  And did I mention there is free Wi Fi at the Terrace  I mean       in your room for internet or        for pancakes and Wi Fi  Need you hesitate       
P =>   Best Stay In Vegas I was hesitant to book a room   the Encore because of several negative reviews  My wife and I usually travel to Vegas every other year for a convention so our trip is both business and pleasure  We have stayed   the Bellagio  Signature MGM  and Paris  Hands down  the Encore was substantially superior  The Bellagio is starting to show signs of wear and room service is slow to respond  The door frames   the Bellagio are metal and when someone opens or closes a door nearby it is noisy  The best thing about the Bellagio are the pools  My second best choice in Vegas would be the Signature which is a good value for the dollar  We learned a long time ago not to walk or take the monorail  Too hot and slow to walk and the monorail always dumps you   the back of the hotel  Cabs are the only way to go             gets you up or down the strip and saves your wife s feet The Negatives s    Only one  which turned into a positive  Sure enough we had trouble   check in around   AM  The staff was having computer IT problems and the system was real slow  k our clerk  perspiring profusely  was working two terminals in order to check us in  Don t even think about trying to check in without your confirmation number as we could not check in with our name only  We were there about ten minutes and k appreciated our patience  We booked a king panorama view room  I told k we could be even more patient if he gave us a higher floor room on the north side away from the club noise which he said he would try and do  We left our bags and went to the conference down the strip and received a call        that out room was ready  Later that afternoon we picked up the keys to a fabulous   th floor room with an incredible view  This is one of the nicest rooms we have ever stayed in Tip   There is a market and Walgreens just north of the Encore to save money on wine beer  snacks that costs     less than the hotel sundry  No one pays any attention to the sign   the elevator stating no food beverages from outside the hotel  Don t be afraid to open the refer cabinet which has a nice tray  glasses and bottle opener you can use   Just don t lift anything off the mat or take anything out of the refrigerator or it will cost you dearly  Fill one of the bathroom sinks with ice from the ice machine  insert wine beer and don t even bother leaving this great room  
P =>   Vegas as it should be seen The hotel is    storeys high and we stayed in a Resort Suite on the   nd Floor  The views were fantastic  the canyon on one side  the Wynn hotel itself and then the strip which could all be seen from the floor to ceiling glass window  The checking in was slow   new staff member being trained  and we were asked lots of silly questions that had already been answered within our booking but we stuck with it  half an hour later we were finally in our room on the   th floor  Unfortunately the air conditioning unit was faulty and when we turned it up on arrival in the room  it was like a jet engine taking off  When the bell hop arrived with the bags he confirmed that this was obviously not right and rang reception who proceeded to advise that they only had   other room  in the whole hotel   available and it was on the   nd Floor with the same view  They quickly moved us and an hour after our arrival in the hotel we were finally unpacking  The hotel was very busy as it was Labour weekend and it certainly gave you a sense of what these type of hotels are like when full of people as on the Monday evening the noise levels went down and the pool areas were dead in comparison to the previous   days  The rooms were large  lobby area with wardrobe  not too big  and safe  then large king bed  drinks cabinet  fully stocked fridge  electronically activated   into a lounge area with L shaped couch  desk and chair and flat screen TV that swivelled around to either the bedroom area or lounge area  Bathroom was good with double sinks  shower  Jacuzzi bath and separate toilet room  Turn down service in the evening but no water left which is usual in most hotels now a days  We expected the use of the gym to be included in our rate but the hotel advised on check in that it was not  our agent had told us it was but as we had nothing in writing the hotel said we would have to pay to use it  The rate was      each for   days usage      dollars a day to use a treadmill and a few weights is losing the plot and as a result we declined to use it  they would not negotiate even though we were staying   days and would have been willing to pay something towards it  We used the Adult pool every day   over   s no cameras for obvious reasons   The music was brilliant each day and the regular parade of beautiful bodies kept us amused and entertained  The water was freezing but a welcome relief from the     degree heat  The gaming tables are in the centre of the pool with a bar facility and seemed to be very popular  The nightclub leads into the pool area so every morning the pool was late opening as the beds had to be taken up each evening and put back down again each morning  Meant there was a queue each morning at  am for beds and by      they were all full for the Fri  Sat  Sun and Mon mornings We had lunch by the pool and the service was excellent  try their great smoothies  ceasar salad  wraps and rolls  We also took breakfast out to the pool from the muffin bar area and the croissant with egg  cheese and bacon was fabulous if not a little decadent  Granola and fruit was also brilliant for the  good days  The sun does go in around     pm from the adult pool so if you want to continue to stay out you will have to move over to the second pool  usually there were beds available to transfer over to  The restaurant choice is immense so there is no point in me trying to talk you through them all  they are all good  there is a casual burger place between the two hotels and it was very cheap and excellent food and the buffet in the Wynne is well worth trying  If you sign up for the red card and get enough points on the card through gambling you will qualify for free buffet dinners so worth a try if you intend playing the machines  The drinks are also complimentary if you are playing the machines  We went to the show Le Reve and thought it was fantastic  would have gone to see it a second night if we had booked it   Definitely recommend it even if you do not like shows  we never go  as it is exciting and different We stayed in the Venetian last year and we would say that the Encore is probably bigger  more reasonable  has more facilities and would probably be our preferred choice if we return to Vegas  
P =>   Wow  From the moment we arrived our stay was off the charts amazing  Self and Valet parking was easy to find  When we first went through the entrance we were a bit confused as to where you actually  check  in and had to ask  Given the fact my husband and I are in our twentys and staying at such a nice place this may have factored in to the response we got from the  staff  we inquired of  but dressed rather nicely we were a bit suprised when the man asked my husband right back if he was a chauffer  What   Other than this one moment and rude   to a   about check in that was all there was to complain about  Check in was easy  fast and efficient  Offered choice of papers for your morning review  then off to the room where an added security member makes sure you have a room key before allowing you to enter the elevator section  Conceirge was helpful later in our stay and the housekeeping could not be better  Rooms were magnificent  Stayed in a Panoramic View Suite on the   th  or was it   nd  sorry  can t remember but it was Fabulous    View of the strip  a golf course and at night you can see the fireworks across the street  Very clean  Kept very clean by housekeeping  even straightened my shoes that were flung this way and that after rushing to get ready for dinner  Bed was super comfy and soft  with a control panel right beside to open and shut the curtains blinds for blacking out your room or just letting minimal light through and not having to get up  Nice Flat Screen TV that swivels for the living area and office to the bedroom for viewing anywhere you want  Bathroom has plenty of space  great tile shower  jacuzzi bath  two vanities and a great makeup mirror  just what you need in Vegas  and seperate powder room  Towels  Robes and a few amenities are all up to par  Pool areas and the spa area were all landscaped and decorated to deilght  An adult  no cameras and only above    allowed  where you can sunbath topless is also available  Didn t visit the spa for any treatments but nice and quiet area seperated from the clang of casino noise would make for a good retreat for an hour or so We ate at several places in the hotel including the small cafe just beside the casino and the elevators  across from concierge  which had good coffee lattes and scrumptious croissants filled with your choice of goodies in the morning  Around     but well worth the price for the energy and amount you receive  Botero Steak was the best meal we had while in town  Best meal I can remember hands down  Steak was cooked to everyones preferred temperature and the flavor was fabulous  Side dishes including truffle mac and cheese were just perfect Overall the hotel was very Red  especially near the Casino  The casino is very quiet throughout most of the day but at night gets going  Waitress s are always around to grab you a drink and are dressed more tastefully than several of the casinos we ve visited  One of the friends I was with forgot their  red card  which is for the machines and gaming at the slots but was easiliy replaced when going to the front desk while her other one was voided out  Connected to the Wynn by a super super long hallway with high end retailers you can arrive there in about       minutes without ever leaving the building  Location wise you are right across the street from the Fashion Mall which has everything you may have forgotten to bring and not the higher prices of the hotel stores  The Palazzo and next door is also easy to access and fun to explore when you need a break from all the modern luxury and red Loved our stay and can t wait to return  
P =>   Gorgeous Hotel The Encore is first class all the way  Wonderful staff always HAPPY and willing to assist you with anything you needed  The suites were beautiful and exceptionally clean and the beds were heavenly  Fabulous pool and spa  I had a massage in the spa and worked out in their state of the art fitness center  I ate in several of the restaurants and the food was excellent and the presentation amazing  I would definetly go back to the Encore    
P =>   Class Elegance and Comfort all in one  Despite all the negative reviews about the Wynn resorts  my husband and I had a wonderful time at the Encore  Our room on the   rd Floor was spotless and beautifully appointed  Room service was prompt and the quality rivaled leading restaurants  Pool was fantastic and staff were attentive in taking drink orders  As for their signature restaurants  while we experienced one of the best risotto ever at the  quot Swtich quot   we found the back drop and scene changing theme a little gammicky  That said  the food was great and we had a good laugh  We had zero issues with checking in  out like most people complained about  Every staff we encounted was friendly and helpful  We will definitely be back soon  
P =>   We never stay anywhere else in Vegas I have stayed at the Encore   times since they opened last ember most recently in tember       For my husband and me there just is no comparison to any other casino hotel  We love the suites  the spa  the restaurants  the casino and the service  The decor is definitely Vegas but fabulous colors  lots of red  and there is a butterfly motif that is carried throughout the hotel  Because it is a newer property I definitely notice a lot less smoke in the casino areas which is a big bonus over other hotels on the strip  We love having breakfast at Cafe Society and dinner at either Botero or Daniel Boulud on the Wynn side  The shopping is very high end but still fun to wander through the Esplanade  And there is a big mall just across the street  Neimans  Macys and lots of chain stores   You will find the Wynn to be busier and more lively than the Encore   When we travel to Vegas we are usually just the two of us  husband and wife  and we do not go to the clubs at the hotel  I imagine that XS  the giant indoor outdoor nightclub at the Encore  is great if that is your scene  One weekend we noted that men were paying      to enter XS and women only       the line of dudes was all the way down the hall If you are looking for a more mature  upscale stay in Vegas then the Encore is your place  
P =>   Loved it            From minute one everything about this hotel was top notch  Would stay again no question  my only negative was the volume of the music around the pool however it was Labour weekend  
P =>   Encore provided an enjoyable stay We spent a   nights at Encore in mid  tember and overall we were very happy with our accomodations  The hotel is as beautiful as the Wynn next door  We were originally on the   th floor but moved to the   th floor with a strip view after the first night  Each room was configured a little different  The first had a separate living room area that was split from the bedroom area by a     wall  The    quot  LCD TV easily swiveled to face either side of the suite  The second rooom felt more spacious as the living and bed areas were more combined and didn t have a half wall to break them up  The bed was extremely comfortable  the bathroom was phenomenal  I also can t say enough about the staff at the Encore  everyone we dealt with was pleasant and very attentive  Cons  There really weren t many  The hotel was a little far from everything else  We walked everywhere and found the long trek back a little tiresome compared with other trips where our accomodations were more centrally based  The pool was also seriously lacking any shade  There were cabanas and other rentals but as far as umbrellas that were not rentals there were only     so if you weren t out very early you were out of luck  As someone who needs shade this was a huge disappointment  The first day I ended up leaving the pool much earlier than expected because there were no shady areas  i e  umbrellas availalble   Unfortunately for me  while the  quot cons quot  were limited  I believe we ll likely choose another hotel for our next trip  
P =>   Not As Wonderful Or As Complete As The Original Wynn And that s a shame  because the Wynn is the finest resort on the Strip  In my opinion  the Encore still needs some details filled in  Say what you will about the huge red plastic looking chandeliers on the casino floor  I think they are awful  or the butterfly tile and carpet motifs  I think they re great   or the two pools  or the fine restaurants and bars all over the lobby level   everything down there expresses a more relaxed  luxurious environment than the original Wynn  which has a bigger  busier lobby floor and casino  That s fine  because the Wynn has a smaller footprint than the original Wynn But there seems to be a large gap between the standard rooms of the Wynn and the standard rooms at the Encore  the rooms the vast majority of guests will select   The original Wynn rooms feature a seating area  sofa  coffee table  accent lighting  artwork   a desk  and a secondary seating area by the window  a table and two lounge chairs   Lots of furniture for a     square foot room  but very well thought out  The Encore on the other hand  has vast amounts of empty space  The seating area is a large L shaped sofa under a large framed print hung on a wall  But there is no lighting fixture or dedicated spot lighting above it  Furthermore  if the Encore rooms are supposed to be suites  why isn t there a room deivder between the seating area and the bed  It would make an enormous difference   one wall would make this room a real suite  There is no secondary seating area  There seem to be fewer dresser drawers than the original Wynn  this is a suite  right    And there are vast amounts of square footage of nothing but carpeting and dead space  Now I m not suggesting that the Wynn Encore become crammed and cluttered like a Tokyo or New York apartment  But some more lighting options and a little more furniture would have gone a long way  Now about the stay itself   it was very disappointing compared to the Wynn main resort  Unlean windows  Hand prints on the mirrors  Crumbs on the carpet and sofa  It was shocking  actually  considering how perfect our stay at the Wynn was  and that both buildings have received the AAA   Diamond Award  So we think if you want the true Wynn experience  avoid the Encore until they can sharpen their game and fill in some details  The Wynn remains the finest luxury resort on the strip  along with the Belaggio  If you don t mind it being on the north end of the strip  go for it  You won t regret the Wynn  
P =>   No Reason to Leave Every aspect of service was beyond expectation  I put Encore in the same category as any Four Seasons  Pools are beautiful  Encore is NOT a large hotel and therefore feels more intimate  Rooms are big  modern and plush  You will be spoiled here and disappointed by the competition   if you venture elsewhere  
P =>   This is the best Hotel in Vegas The Encore is one of the nicest Hotel that I have stayed  The staff is very friendly  The Hotel rooms are beautiful and cozy  We had the perfect night out we went to Dinner to Switch what a creative looking Restaurant and the food is great  after Dinner we went to see the show LeReve what a show     and after the show we hit the casino  The slots don t payout however  if you go there to have a good time and don t stress over losing a couple of hundred dollars to the slot you be okay  Even though I lost the Casino Host assign to me was wonderful  Overall an excellent choice  
P => 	Star Best in Vegas Encore is fantastic  Good food  good service  great pool and great rooms   but at a price  If you want to splurge this is the place to stay  I didnt mind the position at the end of the strip  as fashion show mall was across the road  Some good cheaper dining options at the Wynn  Terrace Point Cafe had great breakfast and lunches as did society cafe at Encore  Wazuzu had beautiful asian food at the Encore  ate there often  Palazzo and Venetian is a short walk up the strip which offers good shopping and cheaper dining options  We had a panaromic view room on the   th floor with a strip view  I would definately recommend to request for a strip view  Room was large and very clean  Requested clean sheets one day with housekeeping and this was not a problem  Plently of towels and toiletries   Walgreens  McDonalds is a short walk down the other end of the strip  Checked out most of the casions and would definatley reccommend the Encore or Wynn  My next choice would be Palazzo Venetian  We stayed from Monday to Friday and did noticed that the casino was becoming much busier towards the end of the week  Did not have a problem getting a pool chair and noticed that staff were very helpful if you could not find one  Spa was spactular  Security was great  Cant wait to go back    stars  
P =>   Another Great Trip to the Encore Las Vegas  This was the second time this year that we ve stayed here Last time it was for my   th birthday in e  this time it was for my mom s   st birthday  And the Encore and their whole staff  from housekeeping to the front desk and conceirge associates to the very courteous security Steve  did not disappoint  We saw their show Le Reve  and it was fantastic And with the wonderful help of William at the conceirge desk  he got us the perfect seats Along with his teammate  Brittany  they arranged our every request with a smile to top it off  Great job AGAIN  You have totally spoiled us to any other hotel  See ya next time  
P =>   Everything top notch except the location This is a beautiful hotel  I read reviews that complained about service and I was stunned  I thought every single employee from the front desk to the maids were friendly and welcoming  This is a gorgeous hotel but it manages to maintain a warm  welcoming feeling  I find the original Wynn a little  quot cold quot   and I love the Encore  I ve heard the spa is the best  although we didn t have time to try it  Our room was outstanding  with wonderful furnishings  lots of room  lovely big bathrooms and gorgeous luxurious bedding  Our view with the floor to ceiling windows was outstanding with the only thing blocking it the original Wynn  We checked in quickly  the price was right  and we were able to get a room at      am  Every single Maid said a friendly hello as you walked by them in the hallways  The  quot cafe quot  is excellent  and very different from the average cafe in Vegas  We ate there twice and the Kobe burgers were really good  I thought the rest of the restaurant choices were too limited  but we did have a really good meal at the Wynn at the Country Club  Didn t love the atmosphere there but one of the best meals ever  But the Encore is so far down the strip   it is located close to the Fashion Show Mall which is nice  but not at ALL within walking distance of the other casinos  which is the major negative  I like it enough to stay here anyway and either rent a car or take cabs  The only other thing we didn t like  is that if you sit at a bar and play video poker you no longer get free drinks  That seems to have changed all over the strip  And the video poker machines at Encore need to be changed out  I won t go into detail here but they are set up to encourage you to accidentally increase your bet because of where the button is placed and the fact that it doesn t reset the bet after you double down  if playing blackjack for instance  so you can mistakenly bet ALOT of money  The bartender admitted this is a constant complaint  Anyway I think this hotel is beautiful and I d stay again and again  
P =>   Good Stay Major sound issues  As I m writing this review  I just arrived back in LA from my stay at Encore  The hotel itself is classy  beautiful  modern   all the things you would expect from Steve Wynn  The staff was always accommodating and courteous  I would like to first emphasis that the Encore is much smaller that the Wynn hotel  I thought the basic rooms were better designed and more refined that the Wynn  Also  I thought that the Euro pool area was better than Wynn  However  Encore HAS MAJOR SOUND ISSUES  Noise from the hallway is loud  which is surprising because the doors are so large and heavy  But that is just the half of it We started our stay at the   st floor on a Monday night  That night was club XS night  From across the entire pool area  from the   st floor the sound and the bass was appalling  We did not sleep that night  Do not accept a strip view room that is from the   th floor or below  XS will keep you up all night  It is truly shocking  Or take a mountain view room that doesn t face the strip to avoid the noise However  to the staff s credit they listened  understood and moved us to the   th floor with a better view and away from the noise The decor of the Encore was both modern and elegant  but I would sooner stay at the Wynn than the Encore  I m glad I tried it  Over all it was still a good stay  Between both hotels  there is nothing else you need  They really do make it hard to go anywhere else  BTW  Go see  quot Le Rev quot   
P =>  Best of the best Without doubt the best hotel in las Vegas  The use of natural light coupled with the superb interior design makes it in my oppinion the best It really doesnt have what i call an  quot airport terminal quot  feel like most of the other hotels have  even its sister hotel the Wynn feels vast and dark We stayed in the tower suites  which is really worth the extra dollar if you want more of a personalised service  the private lobby itself was like wow The rooms are off the clock  the high end materials are magnificent  the furnishings fantastic  bathroom sumptious  Ive stayed in top end properties accross the world  trust me   this hotel is a bargain  Cant wait to return 
P =>  BEWARE OF BLATANT UPSELLS  Steve Wynn apparently has his first failure on his hands  Why else would he authorize his entire front desk staff to use cheesy laminated photographs of his hotel rooms   strategically shot to showcase views   and encourage them to blatantly lie and enhance the truth in an attempt to squeeze hotel guests for     or more extra per night beyond the rate they agreed to pay  Outside of Las Vegas  we call this BAIT  amp  SWITCH  At Encore  they ll tell you that the non smoking room you reserved is not available  but for an UPCHARGE  you can not only have the non carcinogenic space that you reserved and have a right to  but a better view  Or  they ll tell you that their nightclubs are VERY LOUD  How loud  So loud that the room you booked will be thumping until  AM  So       for a minor UPCHARGE  you can have a room on a higher floor  with a better view   and save yourself the misery of being kept awake half the night Did Wynn really build his new hotel with paper thin windows and walls  And if he did  does the music really need to be so loud  Are nightclub guests more coveted than hotel guests The poor management of this property has infuriated numerous guests to the point that they will not return  Short sighted attempts to squeeze     more per night out of guests who fall for the trickery is unethical at best and illegal at worst It s a sad  sad day that someone of Mr  Wynn s status   and such a beautiful property as Encore   has stooped so low  This reviewer will never return to this immoral property and encourages all readers to stay at one of Mr  Wynn s former properties  now owned and operated by MGM Mirage  including Bellagio or The Mirage  or one of the three hotels at Mandalay Bay DON T GET RIPPED OFF  
P =>  Best Casino Hotel on the Strip In my opinion it s difficult to deliver high quality service in a large hotel  The operational  amp  staffing requirements are as challenging as launching the Space Shuttle  On the Strip in Las Vegas  other than the Four Seasons  service is usually Job      entertainment  amp  gambling are    and      Encore  during my stay  was a pleasant surprise  Tower suite was large  amp  spotless  It even had a private massage room  a first for me but alas you had to call for a masseuse  Check in was efficient  flexible and friendly  Mr  Wynn has a talent for staffing  There are pretty people  competent people  nice people  and fun people working at Encore  The gentleman manning the Tower elevator lobby had the bearing of a polished diplomat  Housekeeping and room service was flawless  SW was great  plus it provides an excellent view of the light show  Bartollota serves fish as tasty and fresh as anything found in the Med  The Euro pool was a great place to catch some rays and had some top notch  viewing   I was up a grand at one point but ended only a hundred down  It was worth it  A great stay and a great value 
P =>  Only free thing is the air you breathe   I think  Great hotel with some very helpful and professional staff  The only smug lot being the ones on the entry for XS  Blush  etc  Odd that staying in the Tower Suites  which gets you a privilege red door card    doesn t entitle you to much else  No free internet and not even entry to the hotel s clubs    Mr Wynn sure knows how to part you from your cash  be it was the repair bill for that Picasso  Rooms good and food in Sinatra s  Wazuzu and Southside Cafe all good quality  Alex restaurant hugely expensive for what would not pass as Michelin quality in Europe  Great fun though  
P =>  Blows your mind away Book it  Now  If you are staying in Las Vegas  there simply is not alternative  None  The Encore is simply incredible   fact  I had never heard of Steve Wynn before we booked and stayed at this hotel and now I have something of an obsession  This guy talks a lot about notions and cabanas  and taking things to another level  This hotel is just that   another level  The rooms are huge  the views amazing   the pool is like something out of Hugh Hefners mansion  the casino is both intimate and exciting  The restaurants are brilliant  It helps we won a lot of money compliments of Mr Wynn  but that aside this raises the bar of Vegas accomodation  It is joined to the Wynn  Steve s previous attempt at the  quot new Vegas quot   which in itself is as incredible as you could hope for  It s less like a hotel  more like an experience  Take a walk down the strip  try the Palazzo or the Bellagio   they re nice  sure  But you will always want to head back to the Wynn and the Encore  because they are the best  XS nightclub  Tryst or Blush   they make the rest blush  It s quite simple  Book the Encore  pay the extra and come back and write a review like this  Believe me  you will  This place rocks  
P =>  Encore lives up to its name    Last ust my wife and I spent   nights at the Wynn and absolutely loved it  This year with some apprehension we decided to try Encore  All we can say is WOW    Steve Wynn and his staff are the best hoteliers in Vegas  It was once the Bellagio  It is now Encore Wynn This is the classiest most incredible hotel in Las Vegas and one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in  I have experienced quite a few Vegas hotels including the Bellagio and Venetian and neither come close  In a nutshell   Gorgeous and Massive rooms  Fantastic Pools  toppless and DJ on weekends   Awesome service from the front desk to the casino and pool drink service  Great restaurants throughout the Wynn property  Natural light throughout the Casino and lobbys makes it feel light and happy unlike any other Vegas hotel casino  the place is so clean it looks as though they vacumed the carpet every   minutes  One downfall   bring your bank its not cheap but none of the Big Vegas Hotels are anyway  Definately the best hotel stay I have ever had I highly recomend it to the         year old husband and wife or groups of friends  
P =>  Beautiful Hotel We recently stayed at the Encore Las Vegas  We had a nice trip and we were happy with the hotel and the service  When we arrived at the hotel it was around  pm so they didn t have anymore king rooms available  even though that is what I had reserved   They told me that they don t guarantee any room type  It was a Saturday when we checked in and that is there busiest night so I put in a request for a room change the next day  We got to our room which was on the   th floor facing the Wynn strip  We couldn t really see the strip because the Wynn blocks the view  We could also see the pools from our room  We thought the room was very big tons of open space  The one negative for the room with the double bed was that I could hear the club from our room  Just the base sound and it lasted until at least  am  The next morning around  am we looked out the window at the pool and noticed that people were starting to get seats  So we moved quickly and went down to the pool so we could grab a seat with an umbrella  There were about   umbrellas spread out around the pool area  you don t have to pay for these umbrellas I read somewhere in a previous post or on the forum that you had to pay for the umbrella per day this was not the case   The European pool didn t have any umbrellas unless you rented a cabana  So we used the other pool all week and got to the pool early to grab an umbrella  We did walk over to the Wynn pool since Encore guest have access to those pools as well  They also have two pools  one regular pool and one European pool   I didn t notice any umbrellas over there but a lot more shaded area from trees  The pool at the Encore has drink and food service  When you get your towels there is a menu you can grab and there are girls taking orders all day  They food was basically just sandwiches  starting at around    or     per sandwich nothing else is included   After we were finished at the pool we went back to the room and called the front desk about switching rooms since we hadn t heard anything  They did have a king bed available on the   th floor on the other side of the hotel  The view wasn t great on that side either but at least we didn t hear the club  The king room is definitely smaller than the double bed rooms but overall it is still a really nice room  One nice thing is that the Encore and the Wynn are connected so you don t have to go outside to get to one or the other  This was also very helpful since it was so hot we always cut through the Wynn so we didn t have to be out in the heat as long  We ate at the Wynn buffet one night and it was     per person  They do have a large section of different types of food and a large section of desserts  I personally thought it was a little overpriced but it s the Wynn so its kind of expected to pay that price  The casino was very nice and clean  The pay outs weren t that great  Advice  Bring good walking shoes because you will do a lot of walking especially since the Encore is all the way at the end of the strip by the Fashion Mall  Also be prepared to spend a decent amount of money in Vegas  One afternoon we did a lot of walking and it was hot and we got thirsty  We stopped in I believe it was Bellagio to get a drink and for   small bottle of Fiji water and   fountain ice tea it was     kind of steep but we were thirsty and needed a drink before we could get to CVS  I would definitely stock up at Walgreens  CVS or ABC on snacks and drinks to save money  Overly all we had a great time in Vegas and enjoyed our stay at the Encore  
P =>  EXCELLENT EXCELLENT EXCELLENT I have stayed at several Hotels in Vegas and have enjoyed most of them  however  nothing compares to the Wynn Encore This is one of the few times where I am completely speechless Loved It   This is my new permanent VegasHotel Destination 
P =>  Fantastic Hotel that lets itself down      The Encore hotel is a beautiful hotel but I feel it is not exactly what it claims to be Im a huge reader of Tripadvisor and every bad comment made on here about this hotel is correct We had   seperate stays at this hotel during our trip to USA which amounted to    nights total at the Encore The housekeeping we found to be very poor  after   days there were still food crumbs on the carpet that were there when we had checked into our room we had complained   times and eventually my hubby left a note on the pillow for the maid ASKING for her to vacuum and so she did The noise from the club REALLY is THAT BAD   Our first stay on the   th floor and even on the   th floor on our second stay I think it may not be so bad if you get a room facing North Not allowed to take any food drinks back to your room from outside of the hotel  even a sign stating that your bags may be checked  From what I saw though  the Encore staff didnt really bother about this rule and we took plenty back to our room still it makes you feel like a naughty school child We received no turndown or slippers on our    night stay The hotel is quite far from the main part of the Strip but having been to Vegas several times we already new this so it didnt bother us but may be something for first timers to think about Overall the hotel is shiny and new and for me that was the appeal it hasnt had the chance to get messed up and dirty The rooms I think are a great size and the TV between Bedroom lounge area is fantastic The bathroom is clean and nice but the amenities do not get stocked up on a regular basis We got a great deal on this hotel and overall had an enjoyable stay but I feel that it should address the issues that it has It wants to be an amazing   star experience but the truth is it falls someway below expectations and when the gloss and newness has worn off it wont really have anything going for it that is unless you like to hear the thumping of the club noise till   in the morning  
P =>   beautiful hotel first let me say that vegas in august is HOT HOT HOT   so be prepared  if you dont like the heat  then august may not be the time for you to go there  however  this hotel is amazing  it is so beautiful  as with all of vegas  no expense or detail has been spared  the rooms are to die for  we are on the   st fl with a view of the strip damn palazzo hotel blocked the other half of our view     elevators are quick and always there  the mosaic tiles in this hotel and the flowers are to die for  besides checking in which took a little longer than it should have  service inside the hotel was great  we liked this hotel for many reasons  it was at the end of the strip so it was quieter  the hotel was def quieter we went to the mirage and could not believe how crowded and loud it was   someone asked if being that far down made a difference to us it didnt  we had to take a cab anyway bc it was so hot so it didnt matter  again we liked that it was quieter than most hotels  and dont get me wrong its still loud and there is plenty to do  but its so far out of the way that you dont get a lot of looky loos   we spent   days at the pool  i was not in love  i hate that i had to get up at the crack up dawn to get a chair  i was up anyway but i hated that if i got down there past   am that the odds of me not getting a chair were quite great  the music was very loud  in the afternoons the pool got so crowded that you couldnt move  the waitresses looked cute but they were not the sharpest knife in the drawer  the buffet in this hotel it is actually in the wynn but it is connected  is not to be believed  we love breakfast buffets and this is probably the best one that i have been too and i have been to my share  we went to a few of the resturants in the hotels i think we went to about   of them and the only one that had decent service was society cafe frosted flake french toast there is nothing like it     no one that works in any of these places is in a rush so if you are looking to just grab something quick good luck another plus is that the hotel is across the street from the fashion show mall big plus for me   they have everything  so when someone steals your flip flops from the pool  you can easily run across the street and buy new ones  it is a lovely place and i think that everyone should at least visit once  
P =>   Great hotel   much better than bellagio etc  We have been to vegas many times and this is the first time at the Wynn Encore  We stayed there on a recommendation from another friend  and it does not disappoint  This hotel is beautiful  the rooms are large and very well decorated  The beds and bath are very comfortable  It has great restaurants  nice pool  great shops  etc  We will definitely stay there again  in reference to other  luxury  hotels on the strip  I think others have gone down market in both appearance and service  example paris is tired  bellagio is not as good since it became an mgm property  etc   The encore is truly lovely  
P =>   One of the Best Hotels in My Experience I ve stayed in many hotels this year  One of the best was the Grand Bretagne           Euros per night  in Athens Greece and my stays have included mostly Fairmonts in the United States and Canada  We have also stayed at the Venetian and Bellagio as well as others on the strip I would rate the Encore as the top hotel  I felt the staff and service was excellent and the room incredible  The layout and technology of the room was superb  You open close drapes  lights etc  from a console beside your bed and the telephone system is state of the art  The hotel is superbly decorated and has a wonderful quiet ambience There are fewer restaurants in this hotel but the Wynn is a short walk away through a beautiful mall  But having said that  we ate at the Society  quot Cafe quot  for many of our meals and found this eatery to be one of the best restaurants we have been to in a long time  I say that having spent Restaurant week in New York in y and after eating at many gourmet restaurants there  The food and service was absolutely superb  They have breakfast  lunch dinner and even a tapas menu for snacks  All prepared in a gourmet form with impressive service  The decor of this restaurant is wonderful We found the food overall to be great  even at the smaller take out outlet or room service We found the service by the front desk and guest services  concierge to be top notch  Spent much time by the pool and it was fun and open  The place overall is very clean and the air to be the best of any Vegas hotel we have stayed at We found that we had very personalized service in every respect  I would highly recommend this hotel  
P =>   High priced While the rooms were very nice  the casino and service were average   The hotel had few eating places and you had to walk to the Wynn for choices   Also  the casino is about half the size of the Wynn   They are very tight on comping your room   While we ran up over      points  we could only get about one third off our rooms   We have stayed at many hotels in Vegas and this was the worst for comping rooms  
P =>   Excellent Hotel  My wife and I stayed at the Wynn Encore for four nights starting ust           We drove there so had a car for getting around Vegas which made our trip much better  The hotel  including their parking garage are first rate  We had no line when we first got to the checkin counter at      pm  however  our room was not ready until       so we just enjoyed a hotel lounge by the pool for a bit  no big deal  The room was fabulous  We ve stayed at the Venetian  Caesars  MGM  etc  before and the Wynn Encore rooms are the best so far the rate we paid  The rooms were very clean  well appointed and very quiet  We would stay at Wynn Encore again  as long as the rate was within reason and comparable to discounted Venetian rates  
P =>   Beautiful hotel    too large and busy to provide any real service The Encore is one of the newest hotels on  quot The Strip quot   and it shows  The property is beautiful  fresh and shiny  What really took my breath away was the generous size of the room and the floor to ceiling windows that provided stunning views    hours a day  Despite our uninspiring view  of the old end of The Strip and the desert landscape   the windows always gave us the opportunity to spot something of interest  The hotel is  of course  obscenely large and it takes a day or two to learn the layout  This is the first time I have stayed at a brand new hotel in Vegas and it was wonderful to enjoy the untarnished experience This  like most other Vegas hotels  is large  bustling and very impersonal  There is absolutely no attention to detail in service here and be prepared for waits   we waited close to    minutes to check in at the absolutely chaotic front desk  I have never seen such s sight  On a bright note  the gentleman who checked us in  Magnus  was warm  welcoming and offered a smile and friendly conversation  We were also shocked by the limited hours of the hotel s business center  Mon thru Fri   which made it a pain to check in for our flight Overall  we loved our stay  This is a beautiful hotel in a quiet end of The Strip  but just remember that you won t get any personal service   you will just be a number  
P =>   Beautiful Room I stayed at the Encore for two nights  The room was one of the most beautiful I ve stayed in  on par with the Venetian but more cool feeling  It was large  very modern and hip  a gorgeous granite bathroom with shower and tub  and the floor to ceiling window made the room feel other worldly  It was great to walk into the room It s true that the wireless internet and gym cost extra  but this is standard at many luxury hotels  especially in Vegas  Also  the room was a little noisy at night with the sound of dance music coming from somewhere  but this didn t bother me  I didn t use the pool or other amenities  so I can t rate those  Overall service was great with no complaints One note  if a gym and health are important to you  the Trump has a free gym and in room kitchen  which is very nice  But if style is your main concern  Encore can t be beat  
P =>   The Encore will get an encore from me We loved the Encore  Check in was quick  It looked a bit chaotic at the check in counter  but we just waited about   mins  We loved the style decor furnishings of the suite and even of the hallways  They paid attention to detail that made it really special  the doorbell  the Privacy Please and Make Up Room buttons that you push instead of the hanging doorsigns  your name on the phone lcd screen and the Bambu toiletries The reason i didn t give this the full five points is because i like the location of the Wynn better  closer to the mall   but that s just me  
P =>   Couldnt beat it for what we payed  First I should say we got this room free  We are usually more frugal and choose to blow our money in the casino and not the room  where we are very rarely at  With that said  it was a great room  Probably the nicest I ve stayed in  All the amenities you d want and fancy  All rooms are suites  It makes you want to stay in the room  The casino is just another casino  a little high on the stakes for me  The pool is great but the hours suck  In Vegas in the summer  lots of daylight left and they kick you out at   pm  I would not stay here again at their regular price  but give me a deal and I would  Recommend it if you like plush  
P =>   Almost too quite Just got back from a   day stay at the Encore Wynn  Both hotels are well maintained  staffed  There wasn t a lot of activity at either hotel in the casino area  Never had to wait for a seat place at a blackjack or craps table  Min tables were     still not crowded   Lots of     passing by in the evening going to the clubs  Great place if you just want to relax and play a little  without interacting with anyone   
P =>   Exceptional Customer Service   Awesome Room but would not return  We visit Vegas two times a year and I love staying at nice hotels  We have stayed at the Wynn and I loved it  We got an unbelievable deal for     a night so we decided to try the Encore  We arrived  asked for a higher up floor and received it no problem  So past posts talked about them not honoring your price  we had NO problem with that but I had an email confirmation that I demanded from Encore public relations just to make sure but I didnt need the confirmation  We arrived to our suite and it was awesome  Of course the bed was a Wynn bed which if you haven t slept in one you are missing something  Best night of sleep ever    Room decor was tasteful   my husband was making fun of the donut looking picture of O s but the room was lovely  The customer service was excellent from the maids in the halls greeting you and even the maintanance man in the elevator apologizing for delaying our trip to the casino when he entered and hit a floor several below ours  At the pool we found seats right away  in fact we were surprised at how UNcrowded the pool was  We set up and within about    minutes pool staff went around offering FREE iced bottles of water and FREE fresh cut up fruit  That was a first and wow it was awesome on a      day in early ust  Very impressed with everyone greeting   like Disney customer service  Later that night after a night of activities we arrived back at Encore and wanted a snack  They only have one  quot coffee shop quot  which is actually a bar and the prices were wayyyy too much for just fries and a ceasar salad  While the customer service and quality was good  this is when I missed being at a hotel that had an averaged priced  quot coffee shop quot   Also buffets and walk to Wynn was okay but a bit longer than I expected  Encore is way down the strip so I missed being more centrally located  Overall the entire staff and hotel is top notch  the slots were sooo tight couldnt win a thing but it was a beautiful hotel  I wouldnt do it again due to location on the strip  lack of  quot down to earth quot  eateries or snacking and high price of food items at Encore   try Palazzo next or go back to Belligio but for class and beauty  Wynn and Encore are awesome  
P =>   Steve got this one right   this place is a    out of      Gorgeous  Absolutely breathtaking  There wasn t a single flaw that I could find at the Encore  Ok  maybe one   we couldn t find breakfast at  a after a long night at Tryst and on the casino floor  But  then again  we could have been slightly impaired in our quest  At the Encore  you have access to the best rooms  d cor  comfort   the hottest clubs  XS  Tryst   fantastic restaurants  Sinatra  Society      tables at all     levels  high end shopping  amazing pools  topless if you d like as well   isolated cabanas  one of the best spas in Vegas and spectacular views  if you re room is south facing  you can t beat it   Steve Wynn definitely got this one right  I ve also stayed at the Wynn  and there is a very big difference  admittedly  I wasn t the biggest Wynn fan   felt it was dated and disconnected   The Encore is Vegas s crown jewel  And   for those who may be splurging on the room   there is a Walgreens and small  budget  shopping center within walking distance in case you happen to have an emergency need and don t want to pay for it dearly  If you want to do Vegas right  this is the place to do it  If you want to do Vegas on a tight budget  this might not be right for you     but I ve stayed at other  cheaper  hotels in Vegas and  trust me  you will have a very different experience  For the price  for the experience  for the luxury   I highly recommend the Encore  Worth every penny  
P =>   Heavenly My husband and I recently returned from five luxurious nights at the Encore at Wynn  We absolutely loved staying there  We based our decision to stay there after reading the tripadvisor reviews  We are in our early   s and were celebrating our anniversary  We are both well travelled travellors who enjoy the finer things in life  From the moment we checked in until we departed  we thoroughly enjoyed our stay  Check in was quick and the employee was extremely pleasant The hotel and grounds are beautiful and immaculate  There are people constantly cleaning whereever you walk on the property  We stayed in a standard room on the   th floor  It had a king bed  couch  desk  flat screen and gorgeous marble bathroom  There was a frameless shower and a large rectangular separate bath tub  We were very pleased with the accomodation The restaurants at Encore and Wynn are fabulous  However  be prepared to pay for the beautiful ambience and delicious food  Most nights our bill game to       We researched all the restaurants on Trip Advisor before going on vacation  The best ones seemed to be at the Wynn and Encore  Needless to say  we made all our reservations at the restaurants there  SW steakhouse is out of this world  It overlooks the lake of dreams where they have light shows every    minutes  The filet was so tender I barely had to cut it We also dined at Bartolotta   Italian Seafood   The seafood is flown in daily from Italy  It was also beautiful  The food was great  What made it an interesting night is that we sat at a table next to Steve Wynn  his girlfriend Adrianna and two other couples they were with Another night we ate at Switch  It is unique because the music   walls  and chandeliers actually switch every    minutes or so  We ordered the seafood platter for     for two and it was incredible   We also ate at Botero  It overlooks the pool and seems to be a bit more casual  but that doesn t mean cheaper   The food was delicious  It seems to be more of a hip place to dine  If you like to people watch    then Encore is the place  Encore definitely attracts upscale people including the stars Beyonce was performing at the hotel when we were there  Two days in a row we saw David Spade and Hugh Jackman sitting in the cabanas at the Encore pool I saw Beyonce s mom walking in the hotel shop corridor one day We went to the spa at Encore  It is gorgeous  Intricate gold and marble decor  The actual massage treatment rooms are nothing special though  All the attendants are RMTS The only con of our trip was that for the first two days we had luke to cold water for showering  I called to the front desk and they replied they would send up an engineer      who never showed up  However  the rest of the stay the showers were hot We would definitely return to Encore in a heart beat  
P =>   Over the Top  My husband and I stayed three nights at Encore in late il  Based on advice from this forum we asked for a top floor room and paid an upgrade charge of        for a room on the   rd floor  The views were awesome  The room is huge with livingroom furniture  desk and chair  bedroom area is separated by a wall with cutout which holds the large flat screen tv which swivels  or is modern and absolutely beautiful  Large bathroom  robes  deep tub  tv  separate shower stall  double sinks  The Hotel Casino staff are wonderful and the ambiance is restrained and very relaxing  Views of the pool area from the casino  Stunning art work starting with the laurel tree Daphne sculpture in the lobby bar cafe  Enjoyed the spa very much   reasonable day rate        It is a must see  We wanted to see more of the strip so we switched rooms for our last night from      to      and we very happy we did  Housekeeping in the first room was not what you expect in a   star hotel but in Room      the housekeeping was outstanding  our room was tidied up several times in one day  We definitely look forward to returning to the Encore at the next earliest opportunity  
P =>  Will Always Stay At The Wynn or Encore Absolutely beautiful  elegant decor and landscaping  Casinos are smaller  more intimate  classier  and less crowded than most of the other hotels  We ve stayed at other hotels on the strip and love the Wynn Encore s location  If you walk down the strip  once you get past the Venetian  the area gets a bit run down and the sidewalks far more crowded  Also  we have several restaurants at the Fashion Show Mall we enjoyed  It s too expensive to eat at the Wynn when you re paying for    semi adult  children  Recommend Stripburger  Cafe Baba Reeba      price tapas and Sangria Mon Thur        and the food court on the  rd level if you have teenagers  We had a great lunch at the Capitol Grill which is also at the mall  A bit pricey but well worth it  great service and food  when compared to a couple of the restaurants we tried at the Wynn Encore  Don t buy any basics  wine or beer at the hotel  The markup is horrible  We lucked out and found a Walgreens and a liquor store just   block  north   going towards the Sahara hotel  There were a couple of nice touches we noticed at the Wynn  The coffee pastries shop is right off the elevator  We d get coffee  food  and a newspaper and take it out to the pool which opens at  AM  There is also free ice water and servers offer free small cups of fruit  Every employee was very helpful and pleasant to deal with  Tip If you have stayed at the Wynn before and used your red card to gamble next time you call to make a reservation ask the desk to transfer your call to  quot Resort keting quot    They may be able to give you a better deal than the website or the front desk  It s worth a try  All in all we ve been spoiled by our stays at the Wynn and the Encore  They are our hotel s  of choice from now on  
P =>  Applause for the Encore    My wife and I normally go to Las Vegas at least once every year and normally stay at the Venetian  However  for our anniversary we decided to try the Encore  I actually booked this four night trip in ember of last year using all American Express Membership Reward Points so this was a free trip  I had been saving all my points for years and wanted this to be really special We arrived in Vegas on Delta but unfortunately our bags did not make it with the flight and we did not actually get them until      p m  Interestingly in the little baggage claims office the guy ahead of me was one of the Jonas Brothers  I had heard of the name but was clueless  They were missing several garment bags and a guitar and were scheduled to play at Mandalay Bay that night  The Delta agent was dutifully unimpressed  Welcome to Vegas baby When we arrived at the Encore around      p m  the check in desk is not busy but again this is on a Saturday  however  if you make the mistake of arriving on Sunday expect your wait to be a long time  The registration desk is surprisingly small and unassuming and almost like it was an afterthought  The desk personnel while professional were rather bland and cold and I had to ask to get a map of the property  I also inquired about getting an empty refrigerator sent to the room because I had a twelve pack of Diet Pepsi I wanted to keep cold  the hotel is a Coke property  and was told it would be a     a day charge  Also  be careful because if you pick up the snacks on the tray or in the mini bar in the room longer than    seconds your room is automatically charged  I didn t see a price sheet anywhere but did see in the sundries shop downstairs the same items i e  a small tin of M amp M s were      Can you say price gouging  Lest you think I m a tight wad  even with getting a free room my hotel bill was         We ate at several restaurants in the Encore  had lots of room service and went to the spa Since our room was not quite ready we walked around the hotel and actually walked by than none other the man himself  Steve Wynn  in pool attire heading to the pool with a small entourage and several security personnel desperately trying to blend in  My wife missed the whole thing and it wasn t until after he passed me that I realized who he was  Later I went up to a security personal and asked him  He grinned and said he stops by all the time  I think he actually lives in one of the villa suites at The Wynn anyway so it makes sense  We stayed on the   th floor and the room had floor to ceiling windows and an unbelievable view of the strip  This is probably the best view I ve ever had  It is especially beautiful at night to see the lights and fireworks from TI  The room was     square feet and the layout was much like in the Venetian but a little bit smaller  The bathroom was slightly smaller as well but still had a great soaking tub and walk in shower  The shower door  however  does not seal properly and even with a bath towel the floor gets soaking wet  The bed is heavenly  there is actually a Home Store in the Wynn where you can order the bed for I think around         or you can opt to buy the     count bed linens or the Turkish towels  the desk lamps etc  It is crazy  but it is Vegas too Like many that review this hotel all in all this is a great place to say and yes we will be back  But be warned if you are trying to do this on a limited budget forget it  
P =>  Up to expection My girl friend and I stayed at the Encore on     for   nights  Certainly this hotel is by far better than the other hotels we stayed in during our trips  Imperial Palace    Queens and Fitz    The room itself is huge  with a large washroom as well   The hotel is relatively quiet  it had fewer guests waiting to check in compare to other hotels we had stayed in   The hotel is new  the design is elegant   They had pix fixe menu for most of the restaurants in Wynn and Encore  I don t know if they still have it now   We tried  Wazuzu  in Encore  and it turns out to be a good experience  The front desk staffs were very friendly   However  one slight problem during our stay was that we went early  around   am  to try to check in  the front desk person told us the room was not ready and she kindly asked my cell number so that they could call me as soon as the room is ready  But at the end they never called me     Overall  the room and the services are imperssive  For the rate of     night  its worth to stay  
P =>  Luxury    Hotel and Casino My wife and I stayed at the Wynn Enocre for a   night break at the begining of il  This hotel is at one end of the strip and therefore a little quieter than some of the very big resorts further up the strip  It was easy to get onto the gaming machines and tables and the bar service was quick and efficient This hotel is amazing  From the minute we arrived to the minute we left  nothing was too much trouble for all staff that we encountered  Our room was on the   th floor with a great view of the strip and the airport  Our bedroom was really luxurious with a massive bathroom with seperate bath  shower and a TV  The room had its own lounge area with large HD flat screen TV  big ceiling to floor windows and the most amazing bed We visited the buffet at the Wynn next door which was the best buffet I have ever seen  The hotel has a great selection of bars and restaurants We visited all of the mojor resorts on the strip and at no point did we wish that we had stayed at another resort  Although the Belagio did look impressive  
P =>  Beautiful but has its flaws    Went here for a friends birthday  You can t deny the beautiful  artistic  and alluring look it has  We were all between       years old  hoping for a sexy  fun time  Check in was a hassle   my friend had booked online several months earlier and at the front desk we were told there would be an additional      fee for security hold  I don t know  but we obliged   hesitantly  Nonetheless we went about our days with the whole Beyonce concert going on   it was a little B overload  But nice regardless  The pool is great  a separate one for adults and topless tanning  A   The nightclub XS was beautiful   beds were deliciously comfortable and the remote control curtains and panoramic view of all of Vegas certainly made the stay all the more enjoyable  The negatives  No fridge   okay I can live with that  but no coffee maker  Come ooon   And checkout proved to be a thunderstorm on our parade  That sketchy       Wasn t returned   The front desk person cited it as  quot a problem with the initial payment quot   So my friend wound up paying about     for the simple room  and has to show them cc statements of overcharges I guess  So  it was beautiful  but be cautious with the billing  
P =>  For the price stay at the Wynn We have stayed up and down the strip but thought we should try the Encore this trip  Last trip I stayed at the Wynn and thought it was great  This trip we were disappointed  At check in we were told DO NOT touch the mini bar  or put anything inside the refrigerator  or we would be automatically be charged  We were told that emphatically  We tried the restaurant  quot Sinatra quot  the first night and found the dinner unremarkable  We ate the rest of our meals out or at the Wynn  which has some of the best restaurants in Vegas  The decor in Encore casino and common areas is gaudy  but the rooms are fabulous  
P =>  First time at Encore but not the last  We have stayed at the Wynn a couple of times previously and were happy to try the Encore  We were not disappointed  Check in was fast and we were given a room that we expected high and low noise  The room itself was luxurious and comfortable  We slept well We checked in Thursday night late  Friday morning I was down at the Encore pool by   am and had a wonderful chair and view of the pool all day  The chairs closer to the pool are for rent only   if you are there on your own it is too expensive to rent a poolside chaise  Also the iced tea is mediocre as compared to the perfect iced tea served at the casual restaurants at Encore ant Wynn  too bad   Also since children are allowed at the Encore the main pool has children  young children  diapers eww  so I moved to the adult pool  There is no cover charge for the adult pool only the warning that it is for    and over and there may be topless bathers there  Okay  The music was fine but wish the iced tea was better at       per glass My husband and I had dinner at Botero for our anniversary dinner  It was good but not great  Craftsteak at MGM is better We would happily stay at Encore again  The rooms comfortable  the casino classy and the food consistently good  maybe not great   Also guests at Encore may use the Wynn pool but not vice versa  I did use the Wynn pool on day two and three as the seating was more abundant at the adult pool at Wynn Next trip look forward to using the Encore spa  Hope it is better than the Wynn spa  
P =>  Hello Hugh Jackman  Really impressed with this hotel  Gorgeous  swanky  and excellent customer service  I m no princess  so this far exceed any expectations I had    The pool is actually a little small but really fun  It seemed pretty swarmed both days  but we didn t actually have any trouble getting seats  While we were there we hung out with our pals  Beyonce and Hugh Jackman  I got to swim with Wolverine     and we heard JT  Justin Timberlake  was on his way  This is just to point out  this place is HOT  Apparently XS is  the  club in Vegas right now   I was in the Double Queen Suite and actually spent     hours napping in my ridiculously comfortable bed before a legendary dinner at Picasso  Bellagio   A siesta is  highly  recommended in your Encore bed  and you will need it after a day in the sun  I also had a really cool view of the strip  The room came with a living room and foyer area with huge mirrors  was perfect for three girls dressing up    The room service was delicious  however the already added     gratuity was a little annoying  The only other thing was  there was no internet access in the room  We desperately wanted to twitter our fab weekend to make friends jealous  but couldn t  Lastly  the Spa at Encore  If you re a spa junkie  like me   do yourself a favor at make an appointment at this Spa  It s serene  tranquil  and a serious pampering session  It s not cheap  I got the Good Luck Ritual       before gratuity  but its worth every single penny of it  There s a steam room  suana  dipping pools  a must  and waterfall showers  All of this is included with the spa service  or you can pay     for it I totally recommend this place if you have the money   
P =>   Encore   a sure bet in Vegas  One of the newest hotels in Vegas  Encore  an extension of Wynn  has to be the place to stay The rooms  we stayed in entry category  are spacious and focussed towards the view  A half wall and massive TV between the bedroom and the lounge area almost create a separate room or suite  With a waffle weave style wall in the room and the dark colours and patterned curtains of the public areas show great attention to detail The pool areas are well separated with a quiet pool and then party pool close by  If youre there on a week end  make sure you pack the aviator sunnies  the pool partys  complete with outdoor blackjack  are full of LA s finest on a road trip seeking tan time and new phone numbers The biggest surprise was the club scene  many    somethings donning their sexiest outfits and hitting clubs in the complex such as Tryst  XS and Blush  If you re travelling with a group book a table  its easier to access the clubs  not queue to gain entry and have a well endowed server of either sex pour your drinks all night Hot tips   make sure you present your room key if your playing the tables or slots   you may gain discounts of accommodation and food  If you play patiently on the tables and tip the first waitress  you can be sucking back on free Heinikens all night The hotel is designed for high turnover  so dont expect service at concierge or front desk to be especially prompt or personal   Vegas isnt about personal touchy feely  its about tips  Internet is overpriced   looking to catch out those who have to make emergency cash transfers and ATMs cost an addition   bucks to withdraw  Also  leave yourself enough time to check out   the queues filled with winners or woe can be lengthy As for vegas   leave time to walk the Strip at night  try the Oxygen bar if youre feeling a little edgy and if you want to see the grass roots area of vegas and drink a   c martini take a taxi to freemont st  the light and freak show is worth the fare   even the croupiers are still wearing tie dye Don t do more than   nts   it sucks the life out of you want any more Vegas tips   drop me a line Love in travel  Spoons xx 
P =>   The upper class is comfortable here I am not upper class LOL I get so disgusted with some of the people who write reviews here  The last poster said the chairs were full by       a m   that is BS  My girlfriend went down at       and got a chair right next to the pool  It did fill up  it is the Encore  The pool is full of adults  which for us was very nice  The European pool is where the party is and the girls act a little wild  probably why the previous poster was unhappy he could not get a chair  At registration  I told the girl it was my B day any she gave us a panoramic suite on the   nd floor  We could see the golf course and the strip  very nice  There is nothing this hotel has to be ashamed of except for charging    for a hot chocolate  LOL Speaking of chocolate  the hotel sent up a nice chocolate gift for my B day  I have stayed at many hotels on the strip and this one is fantastic  be if the people posting negative comments were a little nicer to others they would find easy solutions to their problems  My only problem was a jerk who jumped ahead of us at the key counter because his problem was worse than mine  he forgot his room number   You must remember that this hotel is full of snobbish rich people  they don t care to wait their turn  I will not name drop  but if you pay attention  you might see someone famous  I would stay here again  but it is just to expensive for my taste  There just is no place to eat breakfast or lunch for a decent price  This hotel is priced to separate the classes of people  I am more comfortable at Caesars and the Venetian  We stayed   nights at Encore Sat    th  amp  Sun   th then moved down to the MGM  I will write a review on the MGM also  One last thing  If you take a cab from the Encore  be prepared  The cab drivers will try to hit every light they can  LOL I am serious on this  I never had the issues with cab driver like I did on this trip   Feel free to contact me  P S  I left my butt at the Encore and still would recommend this hotel  Almost forgot  if you want to be seen with all the beautiful people  go to XS nightclub on a Saturday night  The lines to get in stretched forever though  
P =>   Better Than Average But Not Quite Very Good       Stars I spent   nights at the Encore while on a business trip  The room was large and well appointed  I was on the    floor with a great view of the Strip and the pool area No complaints with the housekeeping staff  they were quick and efficient and cleaned my room early which is helpful when I come back between appointments to rest or freshen up The problem areas are the pool  the restaurants  and the front desk  The pools chairs are taken up quickly  they were all gone by   AM on Saturday in the European Pool  and it had opened just after  AM despite a posted  AM opening  The restaurants are horribly understaffed  even the nice ones  so desipte good tasting food the service is very spotty  empty plates linger too long  water  amp  coffee isn t refilled  courses come out too slowly  It was very disappointing And check in is a nightmare  Luckily I had a host so it wasn t too bad for me  but I came downstairs to eat after check in and    minutes later  people who had arrived at the same time as me were still in line  At check out  I went online to check out and two items were on my bill that didn t belong to me  It took    minutes to fix and going down to the front desk to fill a form out before I could leave  Thank God I wasn t in a rush Overall I like the hotel  but I still like THEhotel  amp  Caesar s better  but I would have no problem returning here  
P =>   Gorgeous Hotel  The hotel and rooms are gorgeous  The service is as others have said    seems a bit busy  slow and chaotic checking in    BUT the room is amazing  Close the curtains with the touch of a button   beautiful panoramic glass window and view    beautiful bed   great shower    We really loved our stay here   one of the nicest rooms we ve stayed in  I loved the modern chick decor  It is at the north end of the strip so expect to walk drive ride to other parts of the strip  
P =>   First class everything Spent the weekend there with my grown son  Even though it was deadly hit outside  the place was pretty packed with tourist  Lots of foreign tourists and overall it was a surprisingly young crowd Likes The room was great  very clean  lot s of restaurant choices  great pool scene and out door craps and blackjack near the pools  Buffet was excellent  The layout of the room is not great   but the food rivaled the king of Las Vegas buffets  the Bellagio  Go to the steakhouse at the golf course  Great everything  Poker room very friendly  but mostly higher end tables  Dislikes Some rip off prices  I forgot my toothbrush and it cost me     at the gift shop for a toothbrush and toothpaste  Took forever to check in even though there was no line NO FREE DRINKS IF YOU PLAY VIDEO POKER  This is insane  and should be outlawed  I sat at the bar playing    video poker  in the tightest machines on earth and was charged    for a diet coke  Free drinks when you play is a Vegas tradition  Here you have to be in the casino to get a free drink at a machine  No logical explanation was given and no one was playing the bad machines at the bar  Also  a well drink is      My kid had a double Jack on the rocks for           You have to be rich to get a buzz going Even simpNot a dislike  but the two night clubs in the Esplanade had   block long line ups on Saturday night to get it What a freak show  Some of the scariest women Ive ever seen  It was fun to check the people out trying to get into these clubs  
P =>   Best Hotel on the strip  I have been to Las Vegas many times previously and stayed in Wynn last year  I got a very good offer from the resort and got a room at a very reasonable      per night  We stayed    nights so had plenty of time to take things in  Check in was quick and efficient and the check in attendant was excellent  she was originally from Melbourne  Australia and had an excellent manner about her  She found us a room high up with a view of the North strip  and suggested that after the weekend  y  th weekend  we should be able to get a view of the main strip  As it turned out we did get the strip view room a couple of days later  The room was excellent and furnished tastefully and to a high standard  We ate in several restaurants within the property many of which had special offers on for pre theatre deals  our favourites were Botero and Switch  The casino and whole resort had a very calm and tranquil feel about it  and it felt like a real refuge from the craziness of the strip  The staff were all excellent  friendly and curteous and we never had any issues in almost   weeks  The concierge were helpful and got us onto guest lists of any club we asked for in Las Vegas  The airline had lost our bag and the bell boys were extrodinarily helpful in getting the bag to us  Some people have mentioned the location is out of the way  but that can also be viewed as a positive  I think the location is one of the most appealing things  especially when you are in Vegas for an extended period  The nightclub XS was superb  but forget going on weekends  the much nicer crowd can be found on Sunday and Monday night  particularly Monday  This is the best nightclub I have ever been to in the world  The only complaint I have about the whole thing was the hosts that walked the que on Friday and Saturday nights were absolutely awful  ill mannered and seemed to forget that they are just like the rest of us  Never mind  All in all excellent  
P =>   Fabulous best in Vegas Loved  Loved  Loved the Encore  Stayed at the Wynn two years ago and wanted to go back and now test Encore  It was fabulous  Had a room on the    floor with views over the Wynn and the Strip  Was fantastic  Rooms are huge and exactly as shown on their website  Very stylish and with all amenities  Love the Wynn properties since there is not so much hustle and bustle and noise from Casino like in other strip hotels  It is elegant and sophisticated  Would go back again immediately  
P =>   Sensational Having stayed at Wynn previously I had high expectations for Encore and wasn t let down  Stayed in one of the luxurious Tower Suites and everything about the room was amazing  The beds are some of the most comfortable I can recall and the room service is of a very high standard The hotel facilities are of the highest standard imaginable and the staff were excellent  
P =>   Really nice hotel  The Buffet   the POOL   the coffee  It is my favorite place in Vegas 
P =>   Very nice I was offered an excellent rate apparently through my Wynn Red Card  so took them up on it  Overall a good experience  I travel solo so my experience and priorities may well be different from others Room   spacious and comfortable facing downtown which is what I requested since I didn t want to deal with the noise from the night club  I loved the floor to ceiling windows  It s a bit of a stretch to call it a suite since the bedroom and living area are really one big room divided by a low wall and big TV  The bed was very comfortable  Bathroom was huge with Lemon Pledge scented  OK  lemongrass  soaps and shampoo  The curtains  sheers and even the Privacy light are on a remote control by the bed Restaurants   I had breakfasts at the Terrace Pointe Cafe and Wynn Buffet  The Buffet was high quality but unless you really can put it away probably not worth the cost  I had the pancakes at the Terrace Pointe which were good but not as good as The Original Pancake House  I m not trying to be critical  it s just at a place like Wynn Encore you expect to be blown away and that wasn t the case I had the filet mignon at Society Cafe which was excellent  Just a great experience all around from the food to the coffee to the service Gambling   yuck  The odds at the Encore stink and I ended up driving to downtown to do most of my gambling Location   just OK  It s at the far North end of what would be considered the nicer part of the strip  You can walk fairly easily to Wynn  Venetian and Palazzo  Past that is certainly doable but more of a hike  I get up early to go jogging and jogged up to the Stratosphere and back which takes you through some mildly dicey areas  I didn t want to jog south since there are so many driveways and traffic lights Service   I am not too demanding but the couple of times I asked to have the room made up at a specific time they did so Overall a nice place if you want to live like the upper crust but I would only go back if I got a good rate  
P =>   Meah    so so at best  Being invited for a stay on the   th floor facing the strip  view was ok  but if you like looking at your sister hotel  The sound insulation could do some upgrades  we heard every flush from our surrounding neighbors washroom and also their conversations  day and night   I know Vegas is hurting but I feel with all the cut backs they have made  they do not change sheets even after calling down to request for them to be changed   hotel policy   I do not mind changing at the end but if we do need them changed and followed the hotel policy  I would hope they would follow  The in room minibar has a nice layer of dust on them as everything is automatically charged so no one touches them and even the chamber maids are careful not to knock them down  For what was paid  I feel the Big B  Bellagio  down the strip gives a better bang for the buck with much friendlier staff and service  Yes the little turn down chocolates make a big difference       Skylofts were great but now going down in quality but the Sunday brunch at the Mansion are TO DIE FAR    and the only way I will be able to make it into the Mansion at MGM unless I get REAL lucky The pool area is very small and all the lounge chairs get taken up very quickly even with the    minute squat policy  they are hard to come by on the Fri Sun period  esp the Euro pool as      of available sun bathing area is dedicated to the       cabanas  that no one uses but told to get off of Unfortunately the   restaurants I wanted to try out were both closed for the week  Picasso and Alex   settled for Jo l Robuchon and had a nice dinner with their summer promotion but then that is a separate review  
P =>   As Good As It Gets I m a Las Vegas veteran  having stayed at lots of different hotels including the Wynn  which I reviewed favorably a couple of years ago  This place is better  And it wasn t just the  quot recession quot  killer low rate  The room is a spacious suite  with a separate area for the bed  and then a sitting and work area separated by a divider  The rooms are huge and comfortable  The bathrooms are identical to the Wynn but still spacious  with separate shower  tub  and WC  The AC functioned great in the     degree heat  But who goes to Vegas to spend much time in their room  The casino is smaller than the Wynn  so you can find friends quickly  It is organized into slightly separated parlors  and  for the first time that I ve ever seen  lined by windows  one side being the pool and the other side being a garden courtyard  The pool area is divided into a regular family pool  and then a separate  quot European quot  pool  for those    and over  with a bar area  televisions  a craps table and some blackjack  A scene to behold  The restaurants are top quality    I recommend Botero for a poolside lunch and Wasuzu for excellent Asian  The Bloody ys at the Society Cafe are outstanding  The exercise room is first class  and the men s spa is full of cool showers  whirlpools  and a couple of places to just sit quietly and relax  Most of all though  the staff is just terrific  Pleasant dealers  courteous hotel and wait staff  smiling and helpful security personnel  cheerful housekeepers and engineers  etc  They believe their job is to say yes to any reasonable request and they do  Professionals from top to bottom  I can t wait to come back  
P =>   Encore   a true delight in a mad city Overall I loved Encore  it is a true   star resort hotel with more focus on the resort than casino side  which is a refreshing change for Vegas  The hotel is located just up from the centre of the strip and is within easy walking distance of the central area  It is located next door to its sister hotel  Wynn  the two hotels are linked together making it very easy to wonder through from Wynn to Encore and make use of the exceptional facilities at both  Encore has a very European feel with lots of light in the building and attention to detail  It s not OTT Vegas in the same way as Caesars Palace more a refined retreat in the middle of all the madness  RoomsWe booked a resort suite direct though the website and got a much better deal than was available through the major online travel sites  Check in was swift and I was able to get a room on the   th floor with a view of down town Vegas  Friends had a strip review but had to pay     per night extra for it  The room was large with a good sized separate living room area  bathroom was a good size with separate toilet  shower and bath  The room is equipped with all the modern cons you ask for including bipod dock and speakers and a fax  Pool  amp  SpaThe resort has   pools  we only made use of the two at encore  Both the main pool and European pool were lovely with lots of beds available  The only slight downside was the lack of pool servers  The spa at encore is amazing  very relaxing with good facilities  It s     per day or     for a   day pass  which also entitles you to use the gym  Restaurants  amp  BarsDuring our stay we ate drank in Society Cafe  Stratta  XS and Parasol Down  Society cafe   was a lovely spot for informal dining  the food was good and the service polite and efficient  The only slight issue we had was the photo shot in the bar area which meant we sat through dinner with a flash continually going offParasol down   excellent spot for pre dinner or after dinner drinks  right on the lake of wonder on which a show is performed every    mins by a host characters from a giant singing frog to waltzing globesStratta   located Wynn this was a nice pre XS choice  We where there as a group of    which meant we had to have a set menu  The menu was very limited and not good value for money  In addition our group was split into   tables  had we known this we could have booked two separate tables and been able to eat the ala carte menu which was much more varied and better valueXS   Excellent night club  be warned if you are a big group you really need to book a table otherwise you will struggle to get in and finding a place to sit stand will be practically impossible  We booked a table for our party  it s not the cheap option but it gave us an area to ourselves  which is great as this place gets rammed later on   our own waitress and a lot of drinks  
P =>   The Rolls Royce of hotels  We recently travelled to Vegas for our wedding in The Primrose Courtyard at The Wynn  Neither of us had visisted Vegas before and we chose the hotel purely on recommendation and we have no regrets or complaints whatsoever  Both The Wynn and Encore are outstanding and we truely had the time of our lives We stayed in a resort room within the Tower Suites  it was a little more expensive but definitely worth it  The service was second to none and the staff can not do enough for you  we were treated like royalty  The rooms were very nicely decorated and had the most comfortable beds you will ever sleep in  we have never slept so well  Our parents both stayed in the standard resort rooms at The Wynn and they were also very nice but they definitely didn t have the same  wow  factor as ours We ate at the buffet every morning and the choice and quality is well worth the money  We also ate at Society Cafe which was ok although nothing to rave about  On the other hand Botero is in another league  the food was amazing and the staff were very attentive  It was our favourite meal during our   week stay in the States  it s a real must We loved Vegas so much we re booking to go back next year and in case you haven t already guessed we ll be staying at Tower Suites at Encore  
P =>  Beauty and Color everywhere  LOVED it  Beauty  Elegance  Ornate  The second you walk in you are hit with COLOR   Red  black  white  orange  butterflys  flowers  peacocks  curtains  tassles and the list goes on  I dont think there was a single corner of this hotel was not decorated with something lovely  We booked    rooms for a sales retreat through work  Group Booking  Talk to Jojo  She was very helpful throughout the process and managed to get us a low price for two nights  The Wynn price and the Encore price were the same for group reservations  Dont expect ANY hookups though  They cant and could give us a single discount  resort  spa or any other credit for the group  I though Vegas was hurtin  Check in  Very easy and fast  We had a friendly smile greet us and accomodate an early checkin for our group since we arrived at    Check in is normally at    The cool thing is your room key is your players card  charge card and room key all in one  Its a snazy   RED with your name printed on it  Room  BEAUTIFUL  Extremely modern  comfortalbe and has a seperate living room area that is so nice  Pictures would try and do it justice  It had a long hallway  HUGE closet  and mirrors everywhere which were so nice for a girl getting ready to go out  Bathroom  HUGE  Two sinks  nice shower with great shower pressure and the most amazing bathtub  The amenities smelled yucky  lemongrass  but im sure men would like it  TV in the bathroom was fun too  BEST PART OF THE ROOM  Remote controlled drapes  lights  curtains ect  One button and off and on  No more getting up from bed  Also each room has a doorbell  with a light for privacy or clening room  No more hangers Pool  SLOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW service  I loved the design  allt he day beds  cabannas and the       year old scene   no teeny boppers or families   super chic so thats why their service didnt hinder on my stars but seriously they lose so much money on drink and food just because they have like   servers for the whole place and they move like molasses  Took our group of    who was ready to DRINK about    minutes to get service  Even got up to get service   times   Honestly the service was good throughout the hotel  comfortable beds  and worth the price you pay  The casino isnt very big so you are not super overhwlemed to go from one end to the other  Walk to the Wynn is connected indoors and is a short walk which is nice  Cant wait to go back  
P =>   Unbelievable i cant say enough     After reading the reviews form people i was neevouse  But there all wrong  This place was amazing  I woul ddef suggest getting the upgrade in a tower suite if you want to feel like a king and queen  As for the dining and clubbing in the hotel all was amazing being in a tower suite has unbelievable advantages you can walk past everyone except xs is very picky  Being in a tower suite you get a different pool tthen everyone else and let me tell you they wait on you hand and foot at it  Prices are desent its   diamond what do you expect  Im from NY i didnt see much of a change in prices  Also Jersey boys at the palazzo is a must see   
P =>   BEST Rooms in ALL of Las Vegas  I am going to MAINLY cover the room aspect of the hotel and a few bits of the service aspects of the Encore hotel so I won t be reviewing the restaurants  clubs lounges  or pool  The rooms I stayed in a King room  areIMO the best in Las Vegas  I have stayed at Wynn  Signature  The HOTEL  Bellagio  and Mandalay Bay and while all of these hotels have VERY nice rooms Encore really has the art of a beautiful room down to the tee Note  Encore has around      rooms but only about     of them have two beds while the remaning      are King bed ONLY rooms so take this into consideration when booking if you have more than   person in your room  Also the sofa in the room does not fold out into a sofa bed OK on to the Encore King bed room review     Floor to Ceiling windows  HUGE set of       foot tall large windows that fill the WHOLE wall of the far end in the room Furniture  Blonde wood furniture that is stately  good quality and contemporary  Sofa  bed  ottoman and chairs are all attractive and good quality Bathroom  Large marble bathroom with above average quality make up mirror  thick satin robes  georgous inlaid beveled mirrors  large soaking tub  large glass walk in shower  electronic scale  dual sinks with Kohler faucets  thick towels  seperate small room for the toilet  and a small falt screen t v Fabrics Lighting Crown Molding  The room is anything but dark or depressing and has fabulous lighting placed in all the perfect spots  There are lights hidden underneath some of the furniture  Lights are also inlaid into the black laquer crown molding that gives the room a feeling that you are in an expensive showroom or clothing boutique  There is black laquer crown molding all over the room and not just in the higher ceiling areas but also in the floor areas which again gives the room a showcase type atmosphere  There are at least four areas in the guest room that have different colored textured thick high quality fabrics that are in laid against the walls that give the room a multi demonsional chic contemporary yet palatable feeling to the room Carpet Drapes  The carpet is a beautiful beige colored with hints of a slightly darker beige color that give it a textured palate  The drapes are electronically conrolled by a bed side touch panel which is only found in the highest up scale type guestrooms Flat Screen T V   The SHARP T V  has about    channels and all are HD which is another thing only found in top up scale hotel rooms  Most hotels in Vegas have very few t v  stations but at Encore you have about    of them with only about     hotel advetisement channels mixed in with the regular channels  Also the t v  has Mood music which has   different choices of music jazz  pop  rock  rap  classical  and it is sattelite radio with no commercials  The sound on the t v  music channels is excellent and also shows video clips pictures of the artist for each individual song played Doors Entryway  The front entry door  bathroom door  closet door are all very thick stately doors and add to the rooms feeling of a posh sanctuary  The long etnry way is all marble with a whole wall of wood in laid mirrors which make your enry sweeping and vivid  Closet  The closet has some drawers with a large enough electronic safe to fit a laptop computer and the closet has big thick double doors Mini Bar area  The room has a stylish peice of furniture that houses the mini bar and also has a slide out  quot drink station quot  that houses the in room glasses wine  cocktail glasses  and is nice for keeping your drink making supplies housed  There is plenty of room on top of the actual mini bar peice of furniture to set up a bar if you choose  The actual mini bar located inside this peice of furniture has alot of choices premium liqours  ect   that again are only found in the best of hotels Ceiling in the living room area  The ceiling in this area is beveled with in lay lighting and with the other things in the room makes the atmosphere chic and multi demonsional Beds Beddding  Beautiful big beds with good quality sheets comforter  The bed along with the two regular pillows also has two huge body pillwows much larger than regular bed pillows  which are only found at higher end hotels Service  I am a light smoker and while in Las Vegas I reserved a smoking room  I ran out of the one book of matches provided and called housekeeping to have another book of matches sent up and within    minutes a young man was at the door with two books of matches in a crystal bowl served on a silver platter for me to take  Everyone from the front desk  bellman  valet  to the service people I passeed in the hallways was very gracious  hard working  dedicated and genuinely friendly  Las Vegas has a difficult time giving good service beacuase the hotels are so large       room hotels  but at Encore they really exuded an effort that made it seem like I was at a     room hotel instead of a       room hotel  While getting ice from my hotel room floor I encountered a few service workers and they all seemed genuinley happy to say hello and make me feel like I was in a hotel that cherished it s guests There are plenty of less expensive places to eat accross the street at the Fashion Show Shopping Mall if you do not wish to eat drink at the Encore and Wynn hotels which may not be affordable for all people Encore and Wynn are connected together and are both owned and operated by the same peopleIf you want a beautiful room in Las Vegas then I would say Encore should be VERY high on your list as this same type of room in California or NYC would be      per night but is available for you at often close to half the price  A website called smartervegasDOTcom has Encore and Wynn room rate specials directly from the Encore and Wynn hotels One more Note  The nightclub at Encore called XS stays open until  am Friday  Monday and the noise can travel up to the rooms so if you definately are a light sleeper and want a quiet room then ask for a guestroom facing the North as the guestroons facing south are the ones that can be affected by the possible nightclub noise becuase the XS club is on the southside of the Encore guestroom tower Have a great time in Las Vegas and thank you for reading my review   o  
P =>   Most beautiful hotel I have ever stayed at Hey Just got back from staying at Encore yesterday  I would definitely suggest Encore over the Wynn  both are AMAZING and beautiful hotels but Encore is newer  I actually stayed at Encore for cheaper than the Wynn  Also  when you are an Encore guest  you can use the facilities  namely  the pool  at the Wynn but you cannot use Encore facilities if you are a Wynn guest Hotel room is gorgeous  definitely the best I have ever been to  Spacious with a comfy bed and great decorations  Fun electronic switchboard next to the bed that controls lighting  sheers and draperies Encore and Wynn are connected and the walk is very pretty  I realized that neither hotels have a single blank wall anywhere  All walls are either textured  or there are curtains or mirrors or fixtures  AND  the decorations change all the time  All this means that you will be constantly amazed by the interior design My one complaint about Encore are the restaurants  We went to two   Tableau and Switch  At Tableau  we found a hair in one of our dishes  At Switch  I had mentioned my severe allergy to nuts and peanuts and they promptly served me nut bread  Luckly  I inspected my food before consuming and caught the bread  However  if I had not  this would have ruined my entire trip  I would have been sick and may have needed hospitalization   The manager tried to excuse the restaurant with  quot the waiter and bread service are not connected quot   Umm  I m sorry  this is not an excuse for any restaurant  but especially not a fine dining one like this  
P =>   WOW    What a Place Just when I thought the Wynn was the best there is in Vegas  Encore comes along and takes it up a notch  We stayed in a Panoramic Suite with a maginificent view of the golf course and the south view of Vegas  The room was large and luxurious  The first night we ate at the Encore restaurant Switch  Although the dinner was very expensive  it was not the finest meal I ever had  however the dining room setting is interesting  We still had to walk to the Wynn for the breakfast or lunch buffet  but chose to eat smaller meals in the Encore  The fitness facility and spa in the Encore was outstanding  Our second night we had a late dinner at Mix located at The Hotel at Mandalay Bay  They substituted my fish dish without informing me and I was sick the next day  My third night was spent at a business function at the trendy new Encore club XS  We stayed around after the business party to observe the scene  It really was an unbelievable sight unfortunately I felt like the local elder with the young crowd  No expense was spared in the decor  My remaining observation was that Steve Wynn employs the most beautiful and stunning casino and club employees  When walking through another Vegas casino  I commented that they employ the mothers and grandmothers of the Encore employees  Overall  Wynn runs a classy operation and I feel the Encore is the best Las Vegas has to offer  
P =>    Play It Again Steve  Much of what we think about our travel experiences is based on our expectations  We did not know what to expect from our recent stay at the Wynn Las Vegas  Perhaps that s why we enjoyed it so much  The Tower Suites section of the Encore has a private entrance and lobby  Our suite on the   st floor had a stunning view of the Las Vegas Strip  Wow  The room itself was filled with modern conveniences   a huge flat screen TV that rotated to be viewed from the living area or bedroom  an iHome docking station  a control panel by the bed to open the drapes  turn off lights  etc  The bed was comfortable and the living room furniture   resort casual off white and black   was functional and stylish  The beautiful bathroom featured a separate shower and tub along with the now requisite TV in the wall and separate room for the toilet  This was our first experience with a Wynn property and now we can say we see what others are talking about  The service was very good and the overall attention to detail in design and experience was very successful  We had drinks in one of the bars and enjoyed dinner at two of the many restaurants  Botero and Sinatra   Both of our dinners were among the best we ve had recently   and despite their fancy pedigree were more realistically priced than some of the supposedly  greater  meals we ve had in Europe this year  We had a wonderful massage in the Spa as well  It s a beautiful facility and despite the somewhat uneven service  the masseuses and welcome staff were great  but the attendants had a bit too much attitude  and messy clientele  guests left towels everywhere which never seemed to get picked up   we loved it  The walk to the treatment rooms is not to be missed and is one of the prettiest such environments we ve seen at a spa anywhere  Staying here is not cheap  but we think it s worth it  Even the gaming areas are tastefully incorporated into the overall design of the property and feature lots of natural light and room to roam  If you re looking for a gargantuan gaming hall where you can t tell if it s night or day or the cheesy  old Vegas  slot machine heaven  this is not the place for you  If you d like to stay in a beautiful high end hotel that just happens to have gambling  this could be the place for you  
P =>  Worth it so much fun Having read negative reviews about the Encore before leaving for my holiday I was worried about staying there  I was reading reviews which flagged up bad service  no hot water  no non smoking rooms left    and so on  I ve stayed at the Bellagio twice previous but found the service on my last trip dissapointing On arrivial at the Encore  we were checked in immedialty with no problems  We stayed on the   th floor in room      looking into the strip and down to the pools  Fantastic views  the bathroom was spacious and the room was beautiful and very clean  The two pools provide more than enough space for everyone to get a seat at the pool  We were going down to the pool around   am and had no trouble get a bed  The encore pools get the sun for far longer than the wynn pools  so if your looking to sunbathe I would recommend the Encore over the Wynn  the family pool is a good size  if you want to sit at the european pool or even walk through it you need to be over    and provide ID  The pools are not heated but with the strenght of the sun I found the cold pools refreshing  The food in the hotel was very good  Wazuzu was my favourite  I would recommend the Thai spicy basil  The food is reasonably expensive but your paying for some of the top chefs in the world to cook your food      its worth it  We also went to XS night club on the sunday  I phoned concierge and got six of us in the guest list which i strongly suggest doing as the que is normally very long DEF would encourge people to stay at encore over all other hotels and thw wynn  top marks  
P =>  Worst Hotel I have ever stayed at  DO NOT STAY HERE We booked our reservation at this hotel   month in advance and we booked a   queen size bed room  When we arrived we were told they sold out of their   bedroom queen size bed rooms  So four guys had to pack into one room with one king size bed and a couch  We spoke to management and they didnt do anything for us  They didn t care  they offered nothing  The service was horrible  and the casino was dead  Don t believe the hype of this hotel  the food is way over priced  the drinks are watered down  and the rooms are simply plain  DO NOT STAY HERE     WHAT a waste of time and money  I will never stay here again  nor will my family and friends  Christina who is the manager  is very disrespectful and doesnt understand customer service  
P =>  Perfect for Girl s Weekend Getaway HOTEL  Trendy and modern  the Encore is very fun in decor  Unfortunate for us  the hot water system broke so we had no hot showers for the first night  However  they credited all guests with     hotel credit which wasn t too bad  STAFF  Very accommodating and patient  ROOM  Large and spacious with plush beds  A very modern touch with sofa couch included SHOWER  Huge and very luxurious LOCATION  Directly across Fashion Show mall and minutes from the Strip  Shortcut to the Strip   go through the Palazzo and Venetian hotel  ATTRACTION  XS is currently the hottest club in town which means long lines  Come early if you re not planning on bottle service or guest list  The pool is spacious  clean and relaxing   TIP S   Sign up for a members card even if you don t gamble  I received their promo email which gave me a great discount on the room  Less than       night with credit  
P =>  If considering Wynn Encore vs  Venetian Pallazo go with Venetian Pallazo My wife and I are at the Encore because of its      special rate         Internet   It s as nice as Venetian  though modern motiff vs Italian  but everything one needs is not here at a price we want to pay  like food  While many hotels have a range of prices for food  Wynn Encore  connected  very similar  has one of two price levels   high and higher  We find ourselves going to the Venetian to eat at our favorite in Las Vegas  The Grand Lux where the food is reasonable  plentiful  and good  developed by the Cheesecake Factory   There is no coffee in rooms at either Encore or Venetian  but a trip downstairs at Encore gets you a cup for    In room bar has cokes for    and cashews for      No newspaper delivery  which comes with some rooms at Venetian  Venetian rooms somewhat larger or at least better arranged  There is a new Walgreens between the Wynn Encore and Palazzo Venetian which is nice  All things considered we ll be back at Venetian Palazzo next time  though the Encore is nice  beautifully decorated  and at      a night  a real bargain  Well worth a walk through whether or not you stay  
P =>  Beautiful rooms great casino nice staff far from the monorail My wife and I stayed at the Encore for part of our honeymoon  We booked online and stayed for practically nothing in a suite with a panoramic view of the strip on the   th floor  Everything in the room is controlled electronically  lights  drapes  do not disturb  which is a nice touch  The room was huge      sq ft  and the bathroom was beautiful  
P =>  We Loved it   Went to celebrate my husband and my   th Birthdays  Having done a lot of research into the  best  hotel to stay at and also having looked around all the other hotels on the strip  we were very pleased that we chose the Encore  The room was a great size  the bed was fantastically comfortable and the bathroom spacious  Loved the gorgeous colourful decor throughout the hotel  Pool area was small and very busy when we were there  a public holiday   but pool staff helped us find seats  Found the hotels casino the most elegant and most comfortable to be in as it wasn t as dark and claustrophobic as some of the others  Best thing we saw were the fountains outside the Bellagio  which we returned to every night  Saw  O   which was great and Love which was OK  Be prepared to walk as hotel is at the end of the strip and allow lots of time to get everywhere  Believe me I do loads of research into everything and the Encore was fab  We would definitely stay there again  loved every minute of it  
P =>  Encore vs  Wynn   Wynn is the Winner Encore is a great casino  but it is a supplement to the Wynn and is not the equal to the Wynn  The rooms are great  the decor is great  the table games are the same  just not as many as the Wynn  The Wynn has the poker room and the Sports Book  Encore does not  Ladies will enjoy the Wynn more because it is more centrally located to the Pallazzo shops  the Fashion Show Mall and the Wynn restaurants  If you stay in the encore  you have much further to walk to shop at these places  If the rates are the same  choose Wynn instead of Encore  Wynn s restaurants are better and more popular  You can always walk to Encore to gamble if Wynn is too crowded  Encore s plus is the pool area and the Botero restaurant where you can eat poolside during lunch  
P =>  Absolutely amazing wish we could have stayed longer My fiance and I stayed at Encore from e   th   y  nd  I have read alot of reviews over the past   months on here and I was a little worried when we arrived  But I really dont have anything to complain about in this review  The check in was very easy  The lady working the desk was nice and got us checked in very fast  Our room was on the   th floor and had a view of the end of the strip and the Wynn golf course  Everything in the room is top of the line  The swiveling TV is a great touch  the huge window with the automatic drapes is great  the bed is the most comfortable bed we have ever slept in  The bathroom is really big and comes with all the soaps  shampoos  etc  We didn t eat at any of the restaraunts at the Encore so I can t comment on them  We did play alot of craps in the casino and had a great time  The dealers were all real nice and even the pit bosses were easy to talk to  We loved the casino because of the small size and it wasn t smokey at all  The casino got a little busy around     pm til midnight but anytime before and after it was no problem to get a spot on a table or even a table to ourselves  I read alot of complaints about the hotel staff but we did not experience this at all  I ve got nothing but good things to say about them  My fiance left her cell phone at a slot machine and did not realize for a couple of hours  We spoke with a really nice security guy named Bryan who helped us track her phone down  We really wanted to stay an extra night and cannot picture staying anywhere else in Vegas from now on  
P =>  Amazing hotel  Beautiful and enormous rooms  Fantastic bathroom  Cleaned every day  they even folded our clothes  I loved it  Our room was so spacious  clean  new  modern  there were no problems at all  The bed was comfy  the bathroom was a dream  The cleaning staff did a great job  My boyfriend and I were quite messy  everyday the room was cleaned perfectly  Of course the hotel is pricey   it is a   star hotel  The bars offer fantastic drinks           It s all worth the money  I can t wait to go to Vegas again  
P =>  repeated bait switch at check in be warned This is the first and only review I have ever written about any hotel  and it is to warn all readers of the Encore I am a seasoned traveler and I have stayed at the Wynn multiple times because we ve had phenomenal stays there  So naturally when I received an offer from the Wynn offering me a spectacular rate for the Encore              clearly due to the economy  I jumped at the chance  I had already booked an amazing room elsewhere in Vegas  but I couldn t say no to the Encore  believing it would be even more wonderful than the Wynn  MISTAKE At check in  we had to almost beg for a room that wasn t facing XS because we weren t interested in being kept up all night by the club  After much back and forth and phone calls between the desk and  quot someone quot   we were offered a room that was acceptable to us  ie  non smoking and not facing the club   we re not asking for much here   But when it was time for me to sign off on the room rate  WOW they tried to charge me a rate that was about     more PER NIGHT than the rate I had booked with  Nope  not an upgrade upsell as you may be thinking    the Encore actually tried to argue with me that this MUCH higher rate was what I had booked  I insisted that they were completely incorrect and they insisted  quot this is an excellent rate  quot  Well  this isn t a negotiation  I booked a guaranteed rate  directly through your hotel website using a promotion that your hotel emailed me personally    honor the rate I booked  They insisted that I must be mistaken  FORTUNATELY I had the foresight to have printed out the actual daily rate and final total for the full stay from my computer screen at the time I booked  NOTE  the email confirmation that they send you does NOT have this detailed information  the confirmation only has the deposit charge rate   After digging through our luggage in the middle of the check in area for    minutes  I found the paper that confirmed that YES  INDEED the rate I booked was           per their direct email promotion  They insisted that their computer must be making some sort of error for an unknown reason and they agreed to honor the lower rate  you know  the one that I had actually booked  Needless to say  this was an AWFUL way to spend our first hour in Vegas and tainted our entire vacation You might be thinking  quot oh  that must have been a random computer glitch  I m sure that a hotel of the caliber of the Encore would never do that again  quot  Well    weeks later  my friend had the EXACT SAME PROBLEM   he had to PROVE to the Encore that they were attempting to overcharge him for his hotel room  the room that he had booked using the same Encore email promotion  the same rate  directly booked through the hotel website   And as you can see from other reviews  it has happened to others  I have to wonder how many hundreds of other people are having the exact same  quot bait and switch quot  happen to them  If you have  you should definitely share it here  If not  and you re planning to stay at the Encore  BE WARNED  and print out the computer screen snapshot that confirms your final room total AND your rate  and have it with you when you check in  Make sure that your booked rate matches the one that you sign off on at check in  As for the Encore itself  the Wynn Encore have increased  significantly  the prices of everything  including room service which used to be reasonably priced  The buffet costs more but has gone downhill  try PH buffet instead   Housekeeping is fine except they won t replenish any of the toiletries until you re completely out  No slippers at the Encore  you get them at the Wynn   I liked the Encore pool and spa better than the Wynn s  Wazuzu was great  Not sure if the Encore is just worse than the Wynn or if the Wynn has likewise gone downhill  Totally unsure as to whether I will ever stay at either hotel again  due to this terrible experience  
P => Encore was Fabulous  From arrival to departure our stay was perfect  We were upgraded to a panoramic view resort room and got   Queens non smoking room as requested  We got the   st floor and the view was really nice  The beds are comfortable also  Maid service was always perfect Bellman to all services were quick and given with a smile  I called housekeeping on day   and asked if I needed to call daily for turn down service and she told me no will note that and it was done EVERY night of our   day stay there  Room service was great and Stratta s Taste of Wynn menu was wonderful  Switch was nice but didn t top Stratta  Society Cafe has wonderful Frosted Flake French Toast  Actually all their food is good The only thing that could have been better would have been a late checkout which was not available when I called down at   am  But it all worked out fine  Bags were stored and prompty there for the taxi to airport  I ve stayed at Wynns before so would stay at either hotel again A really great store Walgreens is just down and over the walkway by the Palazzao on the strip   great for    hr walk in clinic or for a last minute suitcase  Oh must mention the Encore SPA   the Good Luck Ritual is really amazing and LISA V    the therapist I had the first time even came in the second time because I requested her  She is an excellent massage therapist   almost fell alseep  Can t wait to get back there  
P =>  Another Great Stay This was my third stay at the Encore Tower and Wynn Tower Suites this year  Both properties never fail to impress or wow each stay  Upon arrival at the Tower Suites  I was warmly greeted by a bellman who immediately offered assistance with luggage  At checkin  I was offered cold bottled water and chilled towels  a very nice touch  My keys and registration were already pre printed before my arrival with all the amenities of my package outlined  My room was ready but not inspected yet so the front desk agent personally escorted me up to my room  Salon Suite E      Strip view   I ve only experienced this level of service upon arrival in upper tier hotels in Asia   The room was extremely spacious almost to the point of wasted space  Everything was tastefully furnished in neutral colors in a refined residential decor  The suite was very open with a powder bath  a private massage room  dining area  huge wet bar  and large living area with a massive HDTV center stage flanked by floor to ceiling windows  You ll find all the standard Encore touches like lighting with dimmer controls  and automatic shades and blackout drapes  slightly upgraded from the Wynn  The bathroom has a seperate bubble jet tub and shower  dual sinks on a large vanity  seperate toilet area  and two closets  Throughout the entire  midweek  stay  I was never bothered by any noises  either from neighboring rooms or the nightclub XS below as previous reviewers have noted   Every square inch of the Encore is beautiful and well designed even to the smallest minute details  Every member of staff encountered from the pool  casino  reception  valets  and bellmen were friendly and exhibited a can do attitude  Of special note was the incredible service and facilities of the Encore Spa  What a truly magnificent area of the hotel  It is hands down the most beautiful of all the spas in Las Vegas  possibly the world  My appointment in the afternoon was delayed    mins and I received a call from the Spa Manager in the morning profusely apologizing for the setback  The treatments are world class and worth every penny   We dined at Society Cafe  The Country Club  and Daniel Boulud  All three were exceptional in food quality and service  especially Daniel Boulud  I have two words  mango souffle   Yes  the Tower Suites are slightly more expensive  than the Resort rooms  but you get what you pay for  I have never heard anyone staying at a five star hotel say room service  dining  or mini bar charges are inexpensive  You will pay accordingly  I have also stayed before in the Resort Rooms of both hotels and while don t expect to be waited on hand and foot  they are still quite good   Both Wynn and Encore Resorts will undoubtedly be home when my travels bring me to Las Vegas  
P =>  The Best in Vegas The Encore has the WOW factor going for it  Great rooms with modern decor which are huge  nice size bathroom  The pool area is meticulously landscaped  The spa area is very Zen like with Asian decor  a     charge if you are not having a treatment  The hotel is fairly well laid out  was able to check in after parking without having to go through the casino  Likewise  the pool is easy to get to from your room  Look for promo rates before booking  I got Encore for       The buffet is high priced but very good quality and variety of food  This is a resort you don t have to leave  
P =>   Wow    of my friends and I went for long weekend to Vegas and I just have to say  quot wow quot  for En core  Our check in went smoothly even though I requested a room with   double beds we ended up being upgraded to the  quot panoramic quot  view king suite with a roll away bed   As per my friend the rollaway bed wasn t bad at all     She actually got the best view being right beside the floor to ceiling window  The decor was super trendy and beds were super comfy  Trendy Bathrooms were equipped with shower  full size tub and separate toilet with door including a flat screen tv  I judge a room by it s bathroom since a lot of trendy bathrooms can seem  quot unclean and muggy quot   And Encore was exceptionally  quot Clean quot We did have two minor incidences which included calling front desk for a blanket but never received it  We didn t end up needing it but still it would have been nice to have received it  We also encountered a very  quot rude quot  front desk personnel that seemed to be  quot bothered quot  with our questions of wanting to checkout an hour later  which you have to check back at      AM the day of checkout  we didn t end up needing since checkout is at noon and where to print out our boarding passes  which btw you can ask conceirge but make sure you bring your confirmation code   It probably didn t help that some lady cut us in line while we had already waited    minutes for the rude lady behind the counter  The pools and amenities were super nice and new  Really liked the  quot europeon quot  style pool but was always crowded  No matter early or late  I would suggest that they make it a rule that people can t save their seats all day by leaving their towels on the chairs  It s really inconsiderate since most people only layout for at most an hour or so  We also enjoyed the nightclub XS which is a loungey club poolside with partial indoor  The set up is open and free flowing but would have liked a few more men staff  As we women were  quot ignored quot  by girl bartenders all night  We also had pre drinks at Society which we were personally invited by a Blush club promoter by the pool  Overall We all really enjoyed staying at the Encore   which has a separate entrance from Wynn  
P =>   Tower Suites   Divine Stayed for four nights at the Encore Tower Suites and from the first moment  the experience was first rate The dedicated driveway and lobby for the Tower Suites was a great touch as we were greeted right away by the bellhop who took care of our luggage  We were greeted with a cold hand towel and bottled water at the registration desk and was promptly provided with our room  Our luggage was delivered right way once we were in our room  and they took care to outline the amenities included in the Tower Suites There is nightly turndown service with chocolates and slippers provided  Your choice of newspaper is delivered every morning as well  While the Encore Tower Suites does not have a pool and restaurant in the lobby like at the Wynn  guests do have access to the Tower Suites pool at the Wynn and your room key acts as a line pass for the buffet Restaurants at the Encore and Wynn were great  Highly recommend DB Brasserie for the food as we had our best meal there  Terrace Point Cafe and Tableau are perfect for breakfast  the Wynn buffet is definitely one of the best out there  As for the nightclubs  note that XS does not keep a guest list for Friday and Saturday  Blush on Thursday is Ladies  Night While the Encore is far from most things on the strip   it s likely a good kilometre walk from the Encore Tower Suites to the Wynn s front door   we liked the fact that it wasn t too busy and provided some seclusion from the usual crowds  Definitely a great place to stay if you re looking for relaxation  Spa facilities are great  though you need to pay for access daily at     or three days for      Classes offered are available for an additional     each With the discounts available right now  it is worth staying  
P =>   Wynn Hotel Much Better We stayed at Encore this past week and would most likely not stay there again  We have stayed at the Wynn a year before and enjoyed that much better  Pros   Nice rooms    Very very clean hotel   great comfortable beds   Good staff   Good food  just     Negatives   The entire hotel lost hot water service for almost    hours and only received a     resort credit for this inconvenience   Thats   drinks at the pool   hotel should of given all guests a free nights stay at the least    Pool is way to small and on weekends past   am you can t get a chair    Way to expensive for drinks and food     for water      for weak drinks at the pool         a day for internet at a   star hotel     should be free since everyone needs it in todays time Overall the Encore is a nice hotel just not as nice as its advertised  The charges for every little thing gets old quick for a   star hotel  
P =>   Wynn Excellence   Part II After staying at Wynn several times  we decided to stay next door at the Wynn Encore  Encore was a continuation of the high quality and personable service and elegant setting that we expected from a Wynn property  The rooms seemed slightly larger than the Wynn rooms next door and were plush  They were well appointed and very clean  There was a cafe conveniently located at the bottom of the elevators so morning coffee pastries required minimal effort According to my lovely bride  of    years   the spa was fabulous  and she is very picky about spas The location is great for those with spouse that like to shop   the Fashion Show mall is right across the street to keep her occupied while you gamble Drinks are  quot resort priced quot  at the casino bars  but high quality drinks     yr Macallen  are free at the tables and slots  
P =>   ENCORE SHOULD FIRE ITS HOTEL MANAGER I ve stayed at the Wynn on more than   ocassions and my first time had very dissapointing reviews  they dont know the meaning of CUSTOMER SERVICE  but now the ENCORE completely won the tittle  I stayed from jun    jun    and was there for the  quot NO HOT WATER    HRS ORDEAL quot  I dont care for the     refund  but the answers you get from the front desk are un deserving of a   star hotel   quot we dont know when the water will be back quot   quot we cant move you to the Wynn its full  yeah right   quot  People tell Mr  Wynn he s lost its hospitality touch  I dont mind paying for good food and excellent service but we had breakfast at the Society Cafe   persons    dishes  eggs  hotcakes  sandwich  chocolate milk  coffee and   beer and our bill was over       What    Then you have to walk to the Wynn if you want the Buffett  Sorry but The Palazzo  the Venitian and my all time favorite The Bellagio are your best bets in luxury and spacious suites  Dont bother really      
P =>   Almost not quite perfect    Encore is a terrific property that combines lovely facilities  great restaurants and excellent service  but suffers from some inconsistencies that mar what could be LV s best property We arrived on a Friday and had no trouble checking in at noon  Our  quot upgraded quot   quot Panoramic view quot  room on the   th floor was no different than any other room we saw  The bed was good quality  the linens were excellent and closet space was ample  The floor to ceiling windows helped open up the room and make it seem more expansive  The bathrooms are huge and well appointed with a separate shower and bath and double sinks  Our room was on a low floor and faced the pool area which meant that room noise from the XS club was in full effect every night  I m a heavy sleeper so it never bothered me  but it would definitely be a problem for a more sensitive person  Service was first class and efficient  Valet cars were delivered promptly  the front desk handled all questions and requests immediately  The property is spotless as workers constantly polish door handles and glass removing al traces of fingerprints and smudges  The lobby and casino areas were gorgeous with lots of  quot lucky quot  red splattered around the public areas  The two pools were are bit tight for the space they occupied and virtually all the chaises were occupied by   AM on a week end  I ve read complaints about drink pricing at the pools and bars  and while it is expensive it s no different than properties of same quality in New York  Miami or any other big destination I too was there on the Saturday where the hotel had major engineering problems and no hot water  My wife had been at a spa and showered earlier that day while I took a brief  cold shower with little pain  For me the     resort credit was apology enough  but I understand that for others this interruption might have been way more of an inconvenience  I ve read a few months of Encore reviews here on TA and there have been occasional hot water lapses so this is an ongoing problem at this property  This is still a young hotel so they can hopefully solve this problem and move on  but it is troubling  My little brother told me on Saturday  quot Hey  I paid     at the Sahara and  we  have hot water  Other engineering problems exist too  My wife bought a spa day pass on Sunday to hang out with girlfriends that were getting treatments  but then found that the sauna wasn t working  She was refunded the     day charge but was disappointed that the one amenity that she really wanted to use was unavailable  For rooms  service  gaming and amenities Encore can t be beat  I d certainly stay here again  but I am troubled by the various outages and engineering problems  If they can stay consistent this will me a top property for years to come  
P =>   TERRIBLE SERVICE  I have stayed in hotels in AC that had nicer suites and customer service then the encore  The rooms were small for the money  the food in the hotel was nothing special  and the service was awful  On Friday night there was no hot water  we called down to complain and they said that I was the only room with that problem and they would send maintenance up right away  I waited    mins and nobody came up  So I called down again  and they told me that everyone was having that problem and that I could go shower in the spa  They could have at least told me they weren t sending anyone up  The hot water went back on about   hours later  The next morning at   we got a message saying the hot water was off again in the entire hotel  including the spa  They said it would be back on by    Well we checked out at    and still no hot water  I was furious  all our dinner plans were ruined because we were unable to shower for a day and a half  When you pay for a hotel in Vegas  you pay basically for a nice place to get ready  Not just to sleep  The front desk was very unhelpful and rude  All we got was a late checkout and    room credit  Besides waiting for a     hr for the maintenance man to come   and never showing up  amp  not telling me   I also waited about    mins for a security guard about a noise complaint at      am in the hallway   and he never showed up as well Basically this hotel has terrible customer service  They don t follow through with what they say and don t know how to handle problems at all  I think the guests deserved a little more than    dollars for such an inconvienence    don t stay here    
P =>   Never Again Serious service issues at every turn  The employees must all still be in training  If you re looking for   star service go elsewhere  It s definitely not here  
P =>   Amazing the ONLY place to stay on the strip I d just like to say that my stay at Encore has completely ruined me for staying at any other hotel in Las Vegas  We arrived on a Sunday and after flashing my      trick   I politely requested to be moved from the   th floor to the   th strip view floor  I don t really know if it was the tip that worked or just being persistent and friendly  I do believe that any of the higher floors are considered an upgrade as I overheard a conversation between another couple and the desk clerk discussing a  quot     nightly charge quot  to be on a higher floor  In any case  the hotel room was absolutely FABULOUS with GORGEOUS views  The Encore casino itself was extremely clean  the cleanest on the strip  I constantly saw housekeeping staff going around and wiping down all of the machines  I m attaching some photos  so you can view for yourself Everyone in the hotel was both friendly and personable  willing to help when needed instead of some places where they pretend not to see hear you  P  Of all the hotels casinos we visited  only at Encore and Sam s Town did someone open the doors for you  surprising since we also visited the Bellagio  Venetian  etc   BTW  if interested  I will be writing a full review of Sam s Town tomorrow complete with pictures  which I find to be a family friendly off strip resort complete with a separate non smoking casino  Which reminds me  Encore was the least smoky of all the casinos that we visited  I rarely saw anyone smoking there  yay   If you check my screenname in a couple days  you can find reviews of the various restaurants at Encore  but I highly recommend visiting Wynn s Champagne Sunday Brunch  or the Buffet at any time  It was the highest quality and freshest food of any Buffet that I have ever visited  We occasionally go to some rather extravagent restaurants  and I would compare the food at the Wynn Buffet to some of those restaurants  I don t like to diss  but I would skip the Bellagio Buffet  More than just a few dishes we tried there seemed to be spoiled  the desserts were unimaginative and plain  comparative to any    buffet that you can find in your own hometown  BTW  their prime rib was tough and was not tasty  Also notable mention includes Tableau for breakfast  and Daniel Boulud  had the best seafood shellfish that I have ever had the honor to taste  and I grew up on the beach where fishermen brought in their catches directly to the market   Society cafe was nice for a lunch  nice atmosphere with a view of the casino Just to note  we found a deal on slickdeals net for our room  it was      night and gave us a     resort credit and     slot play  Oh  can t forget to say that I found Encore to have loosest slots  even over Wynn  I know some other people might try to argue this  but maybe they are better because Encore is new and less crowded and wanting to attract people  We gambled there every morning for about     hours  The first day we used our     slot credit and my     slot credit to play for about   hours and didn t spend another dime  Other days had similar experiences  I think the most we spent per person was         and got all the free coffees specialty drinks we wanted  We played  quot Wizard of Oz quot  and some  quot Star Trek quot  game that my husband loved   he is sorta a star trek geek      Those two seemed to pay out more and have more bonus games than any of the others we played in the casino  Well  closing for now  enjoy the pictures   btw  internet service there is an extra     day P S  People dress to come here  dressy casual and dress shorts  all the way to stiletto heels and tuxedos  People did not wear jeans or scruffy t shirts  Everyone is clean  It isn t an ostentatious place  there were all walks of people there  it is just that everyone wore the best they had and took a shower before arriving  P I am a nurse and my hubby is a software engineer  we felt very comfortable  meaning that we aren t wealthy and didn t feel out of place there   
P =>   Incredible   star rooms I am a total unabashed hotel snob  This hotel totally did it for me  The rooms are gorgeous  The bathrooms are gorgeous  As for the rest of the hotel  the pool is very nice  and there s an  quot adults only quot  pool which keeps the obnoxious kid level wayyy down  The hotel is kind of at the far end of the strip  but it is close to the Peppermill  which I highly recommend for a nightcap  skip the food  go straight to the fireside lounge   
P =>   The Encore is a jewel on the Strip After reading many reviews about this place  thought I would share my impressions  First off  no matter how much you paid for your room  remember this is a   star hotel  NOTHING is cheap in it or about it  THE HOTEL  I was given a room on the   th floor with a chance to upgrade for an additional     night  I passed   The room had a north facing view   I heard nothing from the nightclub  or the hallway  One night I heard parts of a conversation from the next room but I think it was a fluke that we happened to both be sitting on the sofa  The flat screen TV couldn t have been any bigger  The remote control everything   lights drapes etc  was great too  Warning   the bathroom toilet flushes as if it were designed by the same people who engineered airplane lavatories  Hotel common spaces are out of this world  in the morning staff could be seen hand picking dead material leaves off of the plants   Chandliers  carpets  everything was bright and shiny as could be THE SPA  Amazing  I used the spa area  fitness center   steam room  jacuzzi a couple of times during my visit  Very relaxing  Even put my feet up and watched a quarter of the NBA Finals in the lounge afterward  Not sure how the spa treatments were because I didn t indulge THE POOL  I read others post about how the pools at Encore were too small  and or too noisy  They were fine to me but then I wasn t here to lounge poolside for hours at a time  Went early one morning   ish  and at   on a different day  Sat in the European section since it was the shadier option given the design of the builidngs  It was an adult crowd  not wild in the least  The  quot family quot  pool area was much more crowded but there were seats available in both areas  Never saw anyone in the pool side cabanas  Drink prices  one word   expensive  Take a nip from the bottle in your room before you go down to the pool  The FOOD  I ate breakfast at Tableau  Wynn  every morning  Unbelievable  If you eat the  shredded  Kobe short ribs and eggs for breakfast you can skip lunch  Not just filling but GOOD and filling  Also had the french toast and cream of wheat   not a bad bite in any of my meals THE SLOTS TABLES  I am not a gambler  Was able to make     last for an hour    drinks  playing    cent slots  For table players  there is an incentive to get up early  Not sure if its advertised or for how long but I saw with my own eyes    tables at both Encore and Wynn every morning as I began my trek over to the Venetian  before  am  THE LOCATION  Many mentioned how  quot far away quot  Encore is from the action  Personally I liked that  I had to walk to the Venetian for my conference everyday  From my door to the meeting rooms of the Venetian took roughly       minutes  I m a fast walker and I didn t stop to window shop  Walked from Encore down to Caesar s to have dinner at Bradley Ogden one night  Didn t time it but it had to be    minutes  ped traffic doesn t move as fast in Las Vegas   Went as far down as the Bellagio to check out the fountains  The trek back took a good    minutes  If    minutes is too long  or you have shorter legs   worry not  cabs are plentiful  the self park gargages are open and the Duece was coming and going quite often  In summary  if when I go back to Las Vegas I won t stay anywhere else  
P =>   A hotel that sets a new basic standard for a five star experience In my previous and first trip to Las Vegas this past uary  I stayed at TheHotel adjacent Mandalay Bay on the opposite end of the strip  At the conclusion of that review  I said I was so impressed with the experience that out of the many  many Vegas choices  I would return to TheHotel on the next trip I lied After a      a night offer I couldn t refuse  I decided to alternate to the north side of the strip on this trip and attempt Encore  As i ve said in previous reviews  i m one of those people who hunts and pecks through sites like Trip Advisor trying to find the perfect hotel with the least amount of negativity in the reviews  Having just come back from Encore and read some of the more recently posted negative reviews  I ve come to conclude what s an obvious reality  Not everybody s experience is going to be perfection  and sites like these do tend to seek out and lure those that did  not  have a good experience That being said  Encore s world class  There s no other way to put that  I live in northern california and i m not near a whole lot  I m not a world traveler  and I don t have money to blow on a regular basis  When I do blow it  I blow it a couple times a year on a vacation experience that s hopefully five star  I can now safely say that not only is Encore fully worth my money  it s five star On arrival at  pm on a Saturday  we were checked in with no wait  On mentioning we were celebrating a birthday for this trip  we were upgraded to a Panoramic view  Top    floors  room at no charge  While the view is important to me  and I did have high hopes for a strip view  I ended up with the opposite north facing view  Did I care anyway  No  Was the panoramic  crystal clear window view of the northern strip and downtown Las Vegas phenomenal and amazing to look out at at night  Absolutely The rooms are amazing  simply put  I have all the same fears a lot of people do  Bad housekeeping  poorly sound insulated walls  uncomfortable beds  etc  I found none of that  It s a brand new five star hotel  and it shows in every way and every detail  From the automatic curtains  to the incredible bed linens  to the high definition swiveling television  to the touch sensor bedside controller that allows you to choose different variations of lighting throughout the room  it s a new definition for five star  I heard no noise from my neighbors  I heard barely any noise from the hall  I slept very nicely in an amazingly comfortable bed  Is the hotel perfect in every single way  Obviously not  No hotel is      a day for WiFi access is still a dissapointment but seems to be a recurring theme in most high end strip hotels  It s also  quite honestly  a tad bit of a hike to get from the Encore elevator bank to the front end of Wynn  But when you re hiking through meticulously designed esplanades that feature all natural lighting and marble with colored designs and flowers all over the place  along with rows of shops that likely sell lots of things probably worth my annual income  you can t much complain  You came to Encore for a large  high class luxury experience  That s exactly what you re getting I ll wrap it up with simply this  As amazing as the hotel itself can be  the staff often times make people s experiences a good  bad or horrendous one  Nobody s perfect  and I ve run into bad service at high end hotels myself as well  I ve read about bad service at Encore in prior reviews here  and it s probably true  There s a tremendous amount of employees working here  I can only testify to my own experience  And as far as the staff goes  everyone I interacted with was incredibly courteous  helpful and genuinely intent on making me a repeat customer I will be  And this time I mean it  
P =>   Favorably compares to other  suite hotels  I stayed at Encore on            I had stayed once a few years ago at Wynn and was favorably impressed  and Encore is also lovely  I will say  maybe my expectations were too high  but I can still recommend the hotel for those who are not budget minded and appreciate great service in a classy  dignified hotel that isn t megasized My first two nights of my four night trip were spent at THEHotel at Mandalay Bay  so I got an opportunity to directly compare  Of the two  I prefer the airier Encore decor  both in the common areas and the standard guestroom suites  THEHotel room is a  quot true suite quot  in that the bedroom is separated from the living area with a full wall and door  and it has an extra bathroom  one sans tub or shower   The Encore is similar in style to the Venetian Palazzo  quot suites quot  in that there is no door or full wall separating the bed chamber from the living area  Unlike the Palazzo though  the living and bedroom areas at Encore share one television  Thus  if you desire true privacy  you might be better served at  quot THEHotel  quot  But the effect in a room of similar size to the Encore suite makes the living area at THEHotel feel a little more cramped and dark  Since I was traveling alone  I preferred the feeling of spaciousness offered by the Encore and the floor to ceiling window overlooking the strip and the golf course  as well as some roof equipment  offered much more natural light than its counterpart The room  I was not in love with the black and beige color scheme  but it worked well in the room visually  It just isn t my taste as much as the more colorful and rich looking Wynn Tower rooms  The sofa placement wasn t particularly convenient for watching TV with a drink and snack  There is a side table but it is inches from the TV  so to use it you have to sit too close for comfort to the    inch screen  The chaise side of the sofa had no side table  There is a leather ottoman in place of a coffee table  but it is white and I didn t feel comfortable placing food and drink items on it  Tdesigner just wasn t being real practical with the layout of that space  Otherwise the room is well equipped with nice generous sized toiletries  beautiful quality rock and wine glasses and corkscrew  plenty of towels and wash cloths two clocks  one on each night table  three phones  sufficient outlets for computers  phone charges etc   separate tub and shower  comfy robes  and slippers I didn t use  The closet is small but it has a chest of drawers and an ironing board inside and more hangers than anyone should need   Weirdly  moments after the bellman left  a housekeeper arrived to give me another hanger  for what reason I do not know  I guess she thought   wasn t enough for one guest     As per usual for the strip hotels there is no coffee maker in the room but there is a bar steps from the elevator that serves as a coffee bar and pastry shop in the morning Service  This hotel offered the best service across the board of any of the luxury strip hotels I have recently frequented including THEHotel  Mandalay Bay  Palazzo and Bellagio  Everyone was courteous and unfailingly prompt  I was checked into my room quickly about an hour before posted check in time on a Saturday afternoon  My room service orders arrived within a half an hour of being placed  Valet service was immediate  and the bellman arrived at my door with my bags within    minutes of my call  Saturday probably isn t the busiest day at the bell desk  but still  that is a record by a long stretch  He showed me all of the features in the room  lots of automated lights  drapes  etc   and fetched ice  Likewise on checkout both the bell desk and valet  as well as the front desk who I called in order to complete checkout were fast and courteous  The only service gripe I had was at the  quot Red Card quot  desk where there appeared to be   people working  but only   helping customers waiting in a very long line  Cocktail waitresses in the casino were plentiful  Restaurants and casino  I had dinner at the bar at  quot Sinatra quot  and the meal I ordered arrived too fast  I had planned on savoring a martini and having a glass of wine with my entree  but the entree got there before I d taken two sips of my drink  Faster than McDonalds  I swear   Actually had a similar experience at SW a few years ago   Other than Sinatra and the coffee bar I utilized room service for meals  The food was good and served beautifully  I enjoyed the natural light in parts of the casino and restaurant and shopping areas  The casino itself is pretty small  but the Wynn is connected by a short corridor if you have exhausted the possibilities on the Encore side  I didn t use the pool but it was very pretty I had a wonderful massage at the spa  I must say this is the nicest of the spas I ve tried at Venetian  THEHotel  Mandalay Bay  and Bellagio  It is just breathtakingly beautiful  well laid out  with plenty of amenities  It is also located on the second floor just steps from the elevator  so you needn t traipse through the casino to get from room to spa gym salon and back to your room  My biggest complaint about both Wynn and Encore are the prices of everything  There are very few options for an inexpensive bite to eat  Room service eggs bacon and coffee is     and it isn t much better in the cafe  The only    hour cafe is the  quot Drugstore quot  at the Wynn which has a very limited selection in the wee hours  But room service is    hours at least  A minor nit was the music in the casino  I guess some people would love it  but it was a little too lite new agey and repetitive for me  They ought to play jazz or Sinatra type standards if they want mellow  or something a little more contemporary if they want lively  But at least it wasn t intolerable like at Mandalay s casino  where you are assaulted by dance music from two clubs  pop music over the loudspeaker and some live performer playing all at the same time  The Encore has its loud customers at the craps tables and so on  but it is mostly on the quieter side  ala Bellagio  Wynn and Palazzo  I appreciated that the slots were spaced out so you never feel crowded  The flowers and other decorating touches are just lovely  although I think the Wynn side is perhaps more beautiful to my eyes I used a casino promotion for my stay which made the room rate very inexpensive  I d stay at the Encore again if I was able to get a rate of a few hundred or less  Because the prices of everything else are so high  I wouldn t want to spend much more than that for the room itself  although it is luxurious and worthy of being on the higher end of strip hotels  At this point  Palazzo still reins as my favorite strip hotel for the rooms  the location on the strip and the restaurant selections available there and at the connected Venetian  But I would rate Encore Wynn a close second  
P =>   There is something for Everyone at Encore We stayed at the Encore for my friends Vegas wedding  The attention to detail was simply amazing  From the endless art to the color schemes  everything was Beautiful  The food was wonderful  I had breakfast at the Society Cafe a few times  and Wazazu Asian food was fabulous  If you are an eggs Benedict lover you have to try the Lobster eggs Benedict on the rooms service menu   quite possibly my favorite thing  XS is the nightclub in the hotel and it was nice  I would recommend getting a cabana  The gym was nice and if you get spa treatments you get a free day pass to the gym as well  If massage is your thing you should absolutely without a doubt go the spa and get one from Nicole  She is wonderful  The pool is nice  but crowded on the weekend  a cabana would be nice there as well My only gripe would be wifi was not included If you are a foodie try Alex at the WynnWazazu   Excellent Sea Bass  and Shrimp Soup to die forSociety Cafe  French Toast to share for the whole table 
P =>   Even better than Wynn Our two night stay was a complete delight  It started with the easy access free parking and short walk to the registration desk  We got an early check in after a long drive  We appreciated this very much  All hotel employees were professional and nice  We ate at SW  at the Wynn  and at Society Cafe  at Encore  among other non Wynn restaurants  SW was great  We loved Society Cafe for breakfast and lunch and looked forward to our wonderful meals with the best service  The blackjack table minimums were mostly at      but there were a few at      Finding chairs at the pool was a bit difficult until we enlisted the helpful employees who gave us chairs that other guests had  quot reserved quot  and abandoned for hours  XS nightclub was incredible  A pit boss had given us passes  They were testing out a new outside format  which essentially took the club outside to the pool  I can say the test was a big success  All in all  we had a fantastic time on our vacation and look forward to returning to Encore  
P =>   Great Hotel Stayed         beautiful rooms  great property excellent service  Subdued casino which we enjoyed  Nice pool area although small compared to most  
P =>   Beautiful Hotel On Far end of the Strip The encore is an elegant  beautiful hotel  The rooms are large and very comfortable  We  quot upgraded quot  at check in to a higher floor for     a night  I m not sure I d do that again as we weren t in our room that much and the view wasn t that spectacular  lots of tops of buildings and such   We  like others  had trouble with our room being ready at check in  We were traveling with friends and had specifically requested that we be on the same floor as they were  Their room was available first so we all put our luggage there  When our room was finally ready  after        we found it was not on the same floor as our friends and that there was nothing available on their floor  It was mildly annoying as this is what we d been promised  plus we d all upgraded         The casino is small and the hotel is on the end of the strip    personally  I would opt for a hotel more in the middle of things and a larger casino  I went to the spa one afternoon and it was pretty bare bones   I expected a lot more from a property this nice  They had heated lounge chairs by the hot tubs and all were strewn with towels and no people  Housekeeping doesn t seem to go by there much  The Bellagio spa is WAY better  We also had an issue with check out   we were supposed to receive a     resort credit that would come off our bill  quot automatically quot   It didn t and my husband had to spend quite a bit of time getting this     taken care of  That said  I do want to reiterate that it is a beautiful hotel  Gorgeous flowers everywhere  I would come back here only if I got a really good deal  
P =>   Great Stayed here with my family for      a night and this was a great deal  The hotel is just wonderful  Spacious rooms  Twice daily maid service  The only down side is the service  It is not up to Steve Wynn standards  And the other thing was no buffett or    coffee shop  You have to walk to the Wynn next door  through the shopping area to get those things  But overall  if you can get a room for under      a night  go and enjoy yourself  The Internet charge is a rip off  Had to add that  
P =>  This place was great    My wife and I visited the Encore last month for my birthday and boy did we pick well  We absolutely loved the rooms and the contemporary d cor of the hotel and casino especially compared to the others  We took a long time deciding between the Encore  Wynn and Bellagio  also Mandalay bay but that was disregarded early on  My usual favourite which is the Mirage also lost out   We did not have any regrets with the Encore Check in was smooth and even though the queue wasn t very long we were ushered to the preferred guest line  We had booked a standard room and I asked for a high floor and a quiet room with a view  The receptionist did try to give us a room on a low floor but I kept insisting I d really appreciate a high floor  she also tried to sell us a premium view room but we declined   After a few mins she found us a room on the   th floor facing the north end of the strip  We reached room      and it was fantastic and was just as was shown on the website and the view wasn t bad  could see the golf course   I read a lot about the noise from the nightclubs but we didn t get any and we stayed   nights so both clubs were open whilst we were staying there  I m a very light sleeper and I couldn t even hear anyone next door  it could have been empty   My wife and I really liked the bathroom but the pressure from the shower could have been a bit better  The walk to the strip wasn t bad and it was not very busy  I think if you are not able to walk with ease then it could seem quite far but we are both young and didn t think it was too bad  We liked the location as we spent quite a lot of time at the nearby casinos and being near the fashion show mall was a bonus  We bought refreshments from the ABC store in the fashion show mall and also the Walgreens at the base of the Plazzo  The mini bar is very sensitive so watch out and even though there is a sign near the elevators saying no outside food is allowed in the rooms nobody stopped us with our goodies from ABC Walgreens We made reservations at Okado and Wing Lei and both were absolutely worth every penny  We had the taste of Wynn menu and both were absolutely amazing I think Okada just nudges out as our favourite  we ordered some extra sushi sashmi as we loved it so much make sure you have the lobster roll   We also ate at the buffet for breakfast twice which was nice and had very good choices  We also had breakfast at Sugar and Ice  Wynn Esplanade  and the Breakfast Croissants with Ham were very good and being able to sit outside near the waterfall was a bonus  We also had room service on our first night and it was very good and I especially enjoyed the Kobe beef sliders  mini hamburgers  whilst my wife really enjoyed the Hainanese Chicken My favourite breakfast was at Peppermills only a short stroll from the Encore entrance       mins  and we always stopped at the Walgreens on the way back to pick up any essentials or goodies The pool area was very good and not too crowded and even though we didn t take advantage of it I did have a stroll and it looked very niceCheck out was easy but my bill showed a charge for a bottle of vodka from the mini bar that I didn t have which I explained and without a fuss it was taken off my bill I would not hesitate to stay at the Encore again  
P =>  Encore Tower Suite   Perfect mix of luxury service  Chose Encore for our   th wedding anniversary and my   th Birthday celebrations  Had travelled from Australia and arrived on Sunday   th        All of my dealings and reservations had been done with the hotel well prior to leaving for the US so you only hope all goes smoothly when you arrive  Had booked a Tower suite after originally being given a great deal on a standard panoramic room for      per night  Swapped to the Tower room for      per night and stayed   nights  A nice surprise for my wife and the Best move we made and here are the reasons why    Arrived in town the same time a huge retail conference was happening at the convention centre just a few blocks away  The Tower suites has its own car and taxi   limo entry drop off and check area   concierge etc which is well away from the standard entry  Just as well as the main entry was well crowded at     pm in the afternoon and most times we walked past it during our stay  Only a couple of groups all being attended to in the Tower area reservations desk so minimal waiting     At checkin we were offered complimentary cold towels and water which was nice as it was about          degrees outside  the attendant breezed through the checkin  showed us a map of where things where inside the Encore   Wynn compound and offered us a choice of rooms on different floors  Nice touch and no hard sell on room upgrades for a fee as some others have mentioned  Could have had a south facing strip room but took the north view for a change as it is the quiet side of the hotel and were on the   th floor with a view of the north strip  convention centre  golf course etc  No waiting and straight to the room with bags arriving   minutes later    A very clean and well laid out room with big screen TV on a swivel so you can watch TV from the lounge room or in bed  Classy and clean decore and nice stone bathroom area with no mould  hair or previous visitor smells or stains  Brilliant  As per other comments minbar and snack bar are pressure sensitive so read the card provided and not the labels on the products otherwise you ll see the item on your bill at check out  Yes the prices may be a little high on some items but  hey there are a couple of liquor stores just across the road if you need to hit the hard stuff in a bigger way  Ice machine on every floor and a bag lined ice bucket for hygiene is in your room  So drink away if thats your thing   The hotel casino we found was easy to navigate  great for walking around  nicer style  better lighting and atmosphere than Wynn  very nice restaurants   Society Cafe and Switch were excellent as was the Country Club at Wynn   Friendly gambling table staff although the drink service was a little irregular  but no restrictions that we found  at night when the gaming area was busy  No big deal though just an observation  If your the type who would squabble about a free or cheap drink then this Hotel isn t for you  look elsewhere like New york New York or Fremont St for your hotel    The manager I had dealt with for my booking arranged for a complimentary pool cabana for an afternoon during our stay and this was done in the Wynn tower pool area  A nice touch and great food and beverage service by the attendants  The pool was well attended by guests and has a nice atmosphere  The cabana normally costs about      per day and offers complimentary non alcholoic drinks  TV  sunlounges  water misting unit to keep you cool and very frequent service from the bar   food staff  Ordered up some food and Champers for a nice afternoon spent relaxing from the flights the day before    People have commented on the location being out of the way  I would disagree  yes it is the last top end hotel before no mans land north of Wynn Boulevard   north strip  but you have   top hotels in Venetian  Palazzo  Wynn then Encore all side by side and a very easy walk between them and they are all linked by a walking bridge and shopping areas  Add Fashion show mall across the street and its a great safe and clean part of the strip  The further south you go the seedier and grungier it gets  At least you can walk around without being harrassed by  quot porn ticket slappers quot  and the like  Give me this area of the strip anyday  Plus if your into finding a bargain for clothes take the short walk just up from Encore to Ross  very good chioice for the whole family for cheap name brand clothes at a fraction of what we pay for them here in Australia  Eg  Long sleeve brand name shirts you pay       per shirt I bought   at     each all top notch and exactly like home   someones making a killing back in Australia    The Tower suite lift area has a security man on in the late afternoons till mornings  The genetlman was Excellent  very personable  remembered our names and always checked to make sure all was in order with our stay  A wonderful touch and really made our stay running into him each time we went in or out of an evening Overall  book a Tower suite for that little nicer touch of private entry and exit  great concierge and security staff  very nice quite rooms with lovely decor and what I believe is good value for money for this level of comfort and service  Check my other review of our stay at MGM Skylofts as I paid   times the price and didn t get the same feeling when checking out after our stay  Love Encore and would return in a flash to a Tower suite  
P =>  Soothing and Relaxing Environment for Vegas  Took my husband here for a birthday get away and had a wonderful time  The room is kind of small but beatiful  We arrived at      am and was allowed to check in without difficulty  The front desk clerk was very nice and gave us no problems about checking in early  She even gave us a room on the   st floor with a view of the strip  golf course  and mountains  Simply beatiful  Loved the remote control everything  lights  blinds  alarm  etc  next to the bed  Speaking of the bed   one word comfortable   best bed I ve ever slept in  Bathroom is beautiful   love the glassed enclosed shower over looking the tub  disappointed tub wasn t jacuzzi  but still nice   No problems with services our blind was stuck once but an engineer was up to fix it in less than   minutes  The TV is a little difficult to work and takes awhile to come on but you get use to it after while  Staff was very friendly and helpful  Checkout lines are long and kinda of chaotic with no one directing traffic  Check out is at     wonderful  and they allow you access to the your room until      which is great  Not a lot of action in the casino area during my   day stay very quiet  Hotel is very expensive and caters to the upper class  My husband and I had lunch at Societys      No casual dining places for reasonable cost  We went to other places to eat that was more affordable  The hotel  although beatiful  is far from the main attractions  Is literally on the end of the strip  Matter of fact  it s the last main hotel on the strip before venturing into old Vegas  That being said bring walking shoes  All in all we had a wonderful experience at the Wynn and would recommend to anyone  Very clean  quiet  decor is beatiful and nice people  
P =>  Luxurious rooms Stayed for   nights and thorouglly enjoyed our experience both at the Casino  the amazing shows and above all the fab hotel services 
P =>  Hotel and rooms dazzle service and pool disappoint Ideally  I d like to give Encore a      It s definitely not a complete   star experience  I ll lead off with why it s not  and then get on to the positive stuff SERVICE  While professional and courteous  it s not on par with a Four Seasons or similar hotels that emphasize the ultimate in customer satisfaction  My dad and I went out to the pool area on an overcast day  with maybe a third of the chairs in use and all the cabanas empty  Wanting to cool off for a couple minutes  we walked into the pool and took a seat on these big round seating things they have in the water  Within two minutes  a lifeguard came over and said   quot I m sorry  these are for cabana guests only  quot  There were six of these huge seating things in the pool  each one capable of seating       and not a single person was on them  There weren t even any cabana guests to use them  And you re seriously going to kick us off them   That s just poor service and bad business  After getting asked to get off  two other ladies in the pool said   quot Yeah  isn t that terrible  We were sitting there this morning and they kicked us off  as well  quot  Moments like that leave a bad taste in guests  mouths  and they pass on such stories to others  quickly leading to bad word of mouth POOL  The pool area is pretty small  The adult pool  with a bar and gaming  is very nice  but the regular pool is pretty boring  I m a sun worshipper  but for those who like some shade  there is NONE at the main Encore pool  Poolside dining is another disappointment  The prices seem very reasonable  even cheap for such a nice hotel  until you realize the food is pre packaged from the Lobby Bar  amp  Cafe  With food like that  you re better off grabbing a Subway    footlong and taking it out to the pool  Overall  I prefer the Wynn pools to Encore LOCATION  Encore is pretty isolated at the far north end of the Strip  yes  there s some stuff further north  but The Sahara and Circus Circus are not places most high end hotel guests will frequent   If you have a car or are willing to cab it  you re fine  while getting around by foot is doable but not easy  Encore connects to Wynn  then you can take the bridge to Palazzo  which connects to Venetian  and from there you can cross the street to TI  which connects to Mirage  in the middle of the strip  Now for the positive news HOTEL CASINO  The design is spectacular  like the Wynn  However  avoid Encore at all costs if you don t like the color red  Whereas Wynn is decked out in neutral brown  Encore is totally and completely red  red  red  It s far too much of a non neutral color  IMO  but I can let that go when the details and intricacies of the design are so stunning  From the crystal peacock tails to the Daphne statue in the Lobby Bar  you can tell how much thought went into every single design detail  The casino is small and intimate  but beautiful  with natural light all around SUITES  Pretty close to perfect  The huge rooms are modern and sophisticated  in neutrals like black  beige  and white  Everything is top of the line  from the big things like the beds  the best you ll find on the Strip  to the small things like the Kohler faucets  While these are bigger than the rooms at Wynn  they kind of feel smaller  because of the partial wall in between  but I like them better  The bathrooms are huge and gorgeous  too  I think I have to give the Encore rooms the edge over Palazzo  making these the best rooms on the Strip  IMO  As for the noise problem from XS  I purposely chose to stay at Encore on nights when the nightclub was closed  so I can t comment about that noise  However  the rooms were very quiet  and I heard no noise from outside the hotel or from the hallways other rooms     TIP      For stunning views of the Strip  request the south side of the hotel  with rooms on the west side of the hall  we had rooms    and     which were perfect   
P =>  I thought the Wynn was the best resort in Vegas until I stayed at Encore  The rooms in Wynn s Encore are better than the rooms in the Wynn Resort  mainly because they are all suites  Until this trip  I thought the regular rooms in the Wynn were the nicest in Vegas  While the rooms are expensive  there are lots of great deals available  We received an upgrade from the Wynn to the Encore at no additional cost  I have found that the employees at Wynn properties make you feel like you are a welcomed guest and not just a another warm body  The casinos  and lobbies are the most beautiful in Vegas and you almost feel like you are in a much smaller botique hotel in the Ozarks  This is not an easy task in resorts that house thousands of customers  Steve Wynn may not be the most popular person in Las Vegas  but he knows how to the best resorts time after time  
P =>  Wynn Version     gets it right I had stayed at the original Wynn tower a couple of times  and while there s a lot there to like  there were still some things I didn t care for  The casino and layout are confusing  the rooms are a little much in terms of decor  etc  But with Encore  Wynn and his team really hit their stride  Just about everything at this place works  and it s probably become my favorite Vegas hotel  just above THEhotel at Mandalay Bay Public areas  Red  red  red  It works in the casino and check in area in a way it didn t in the rooms at Wynn  It s vivid and exciting  the design is a stunner    well  except for those ugly red chandeliers that look like huge upside down spiders  Otherwise  bravo  The casino layout is the easiest to navigate in any Vegas mega property  You can actually see all the way from one end to the other of what is basically a big rectangle  and the two long sides have natural light and outside views  There are restaurants and lounges arranged around the perimeter  no following signs around corners and meandering casino paths to find anything  Spa Pool  The fitness center is pretty much what you would expect  big  with plenty of machines of all types  The spa waiting area is a stunner  It looks like the living room of an Arabian prince with great taste  The interior is great as well  the plunge pool area has a huge tile wall with a copper cherry tree mosaic  Just gorgeous  There are also heated tiled lounge chairs which vibrate slightly  It would be easy to lose an afternoon dozing on one of those  There s a     daily use fee  which is outlandish but about the norm for Vegas  The pool is not a match for Mandalay Bay s  still the best in town   but it s nice in its own right with plenty of lounge chairs  even on a busy weekend  we were able to find a couple of chairs together with no problem  Drink service was frequent and efficient  The European  topless  pool is pretty much the same as the main pool  only with a huge center bar  Guys  sorry to say there was only one pair of assets on display the day I was there  Don t know how well this European bathing trend is catching on Rooms  Much calmer and more relaxing than the public areas  Mostly in the beige family  but there were plenty of accent touches to give it character  There s rough textured houndstooth wallpaper behind the mini bar armoire and rust colored wallpaper behind the beds and on the entry way ceiling  The L shaped sofa is a great touch and the sitting area is huge  Of course  everything is remote controlled from the bedside  I might question the choice of painting over the sofa  which is basically three big white circles on a black background  but whatever  If you ve stayed at THEhotel  Venetian Palazzo  or Bellagio  then you know what to expect in the bathrooms  Very plush and spacious  but not necessarily distinctive  We had a double bed room with a spectacular view over the Wynn tower  the pools  the golf course  and part of the strip  We were on the   th floor and didn t hear a peep from the nightclub  which some others have complained about  Room numbers that end in even numbers are strip view  Restaurants  A very nice selection  and we made a stop at all of them except Switch  Went to the bar at Sinatra  which has great appetizers  main course menu didn t intrigue me that much  and a polished bar staff who made fine traditional cocktails and are always ready with a suggestion  There s also a very cool huge model ship hanging over the bar  Wazuzu has the spectacular crystal dragon along one wall and a fine pan Asian menu  Society cafe was good for breakfast and the Lobby Cafe and Bar is just off check in if you can t even make it to the elevators before you need a drink  Best of all is steakhouse Botero  which was slam packed the night we were there but still offered tremendous quality on every course  The bone in NY Strip is something special  as is the salmon with Meyer lemon appetizer and the side of truffled corn pudding  Deserts are more creative than anything  so choose carefully if you re a dessert traditionalist  There s also a great bar up front here  if Kirk the bar manager is working  ask him to make you his martini with pear vodka and elderflower liqueur  Random notes  It s a pretty easy walk to Wynn down a hallway by the theaters  past a shopping arcade where they would turn you upside down and shake the money out of your pockets  Won      in ten minutes at a single deck blackjack game  but I promise I didn t let that influence my review  Nothing here is a particular bargain  but I wasn t expecting it to be  so   Elsewhere on the Strip  You can skip the bar at the Trump tower  Dull  The wine list at Mix at THEhotel isn t as good as it used to be  but the food is  CityCenter is getting near completion on the exterior  and is just enormous  Can t say it really advances architecture on the Strip  though  
P =>   Nice Hotel but nickel and dimes you  with tight slots Very nice hotel with excellent Service  Rooms are probably about the nicest I ve every stayed in  Considering its a very expensive hotel  it seems to nickel and dime you for everything      a day for internet  food expensive  drinks expensive when not gambling  The Video Poker and Slots seem to be very tight  not paying off much  
P =>   Loved it     We were offered a two night complimentary stay at the Encore   we d stayed at several hotels on the Strip before  This was by far the best   looking down from our suite on the   th floor on Vegas could not be beaten  It looked like a film set beneath us  The room was clean and bright  with a nice sitting area and floor to ceiling windows  Bathroom was large and well maintained  Very efficient valet service ensured our car was with us within minutes of request  
P =>   Wonderful rooms and unbelievable lunch buffet We got a great online price that included a     resort credit       the lunch buffet was        but worth every penny       so good I went back the next day when my husband was golfing  Unfortunately  no free coffee in the rooms  which I always enjoy  Also  the clothing shops were outrageously expensive  but a very nice mall is right across the street that I could actually shop at  I loved the music that played in the Encore      lots of easy listening music I ve never heard but really enjoyed  
P =>   beauty is only skin deep even though my husband and i could have stayed at a myriad of LV hotels for free  we had been waiting to experience the opulence of the Encore  We have stayed at many of the better hotels on the strip and had stayed at the Wynn two times while the Encore was being built  the property is beautiful but it s customer service  or lack thereof  ruined any good rating I wished I could give  To make a very long story short   I had a slip and fall accident in our room on the  th day of our five day stay  I didn t know if I was going to be able to travel home because of my injury so on the way to the emergency room I asked the front desk mgr  if we would be able to possibly add on another night if I couldn t fly home the next day  he responded with  quot         a night quot  I didn t expect a room for free but i was paying a rate of         per night for the weeknights we stayed  I had torn my hamstring muscle  We filed a report with security and that s all the personal contact I got from the staff  As i said  I told the front desk  concierge desk  who directed me to the emergency room  hotel mgr  and head of valet dept and several employee what had happen and I received no follow up inquiries while we were there or when i got home  The only contact I have had is with the risk management dept which I called to voice my anger about my treatment  Since that time The hotel manager sent me a very generic e mail hoping that they will have the opportunity to welcome us back soon  be if he extended a  quot contact me when you are coming into town quot   I would go back  But  I think I d get better treatment from a Super   motel  
P =>   FABULOUS     DON T BELIEVE THE OTHER COMMENTS THAT SAY OTHERWISE    let me clear up what people are saying about checkin s customer service issues about the     thing  i checked in early and i ended up getting a room on a low floor    if i wanted to get a room on a higher floor  i would ve had to pay an extra    per night ONLY BECAUSE IT WAS A BETTER ROOM    duh geniouses  the higher you go  the better the rooms get  they re more spacious  have a nicer bathroom  etc  if you want that  then u can go ahead and pay for it  but  if u just want a room  you have to get whatever is available  i wanted a king sized bed so i chose the one THAT WAS AVAILABLE  there were probably other rooms available but had   beds in it   people always fuss about everything  jeez  i have to say  i absolutely love the hotel  the food is excellent and reasonably priced  the decor is gorgeous  i took soooo many pictures   everyone was very nice and i had no problems whatsoever  i even left a few items after my stay and the hotel graciously mailed them to me     i live in florida so i was surprised that they did that free of charge  you get to keep your room key too because it has your name on it which you can use to make charges throughout the hotel  big and beautiful hotel    you definitely get what you pay for and i got more than one i paid for  if there was a problem that i had  all i had to do was call downstairs or wherever and it was fixed   couldn t of asked for anything better  
P =>   Would not stay here again     This worst possible room service  and front desk service   We traveled with our young preteen son and at the time of check in requested   beds  The rooms with   beds were sold out and we were given king size be and promised a roll away bed will be brought in  On Friday night  the bed was never delivered  at       pm   I called housekeeping to ask for the bed  Long story short  after about   phone calls  the bed was never delivered  AT       am  in the morning  we went to bed since my son was so tired  and he had to share a bed with us and we call down to cancel because it was so late  On Saturday  we requested the bed to delivered early at      pm   not till       pm  the bed was delivered  I was upset and tired because not being able to sleep the night before  The most incredible part  at the time of the check out I requested to speak to the manager  about the situation  It was their chance to make the situation better for the guests  by offering perhaps     off of the room  or a sincere apologize  The idiotic manager  said  quot well you cancel the bed service    quot  He just didn t understand the situation  want to understand and ultimately did not want the guest feel welcome and appreciated and apology for the situation  I have stayed at the Palazzo  MGM and Four Season in LV  And this place is the worst  I m more upset that my family dropped      at Daniel Bouloud for dinner and I spent       at the Manolo Blanik shoe store  If I had known about this kind of service to the guests  I would not spend     in the ice cream store    Also not sure if they are understaff  but expect a LONG WAIT for checking in      
P =>   We loved the Encore My wife and I stayed at the Encore for our Anniversary and loved the place I can talk about our room the restaurants the lounges or room service food All were great but it was the staff that made our visit incredible They make you feel like you are    and are happy to do so My mantra is  quot Great food without great service does not taste very good quot  From the Bellman to the Desk Clerk Room Maid Waiter Bartender Pool boy and miscellenious people that seem to be everywhere to help you out they all are the same page I read some of the negative reviews and all I can say is   this is The Encore   not the   Queens  You get what you pay for    
P =>   BIG PROBLEM  XS NOISE My room was on the lower floor of the Encore and we were kept up all night from the excessive noise from the Encore s nightclub XS  The front desk said they would send up ear plugs  The noise lasted until      AM  This is the way this luxury hotel treated its guest  They knew about the noise  but did not warn me  They did move us the next day  but even on the   th floor the noise could be heard  Do not accept a room on the south side of the hotel  on the lower level floors unless you want to be kept up all night  XS operates from Thursday through Monday  Basically Mr  Wynn designed a nightclub  rather then a hotel casio  Beware of this situation This is not a luxury hotel  unless you are a high roller  and in the tower suite  Turndown had to be requested  They would not change the sheets unless requested  towels have to be placed in the tub or they could end up being reused  The guest should not have to complain or request certain items that are standard in other luxury category hotels  Management should have told the guest about the noise problem and should not have made there customer complain  The hotel owns the nightclub and this is the worst situation for noise at a hotel I have ever experienced  Mr  Wynn should come down from his perch and see what is going on in his hotel  
P =>   horrible guest service I stayed at Encore last month for a  quot girls weekend quot  and have next to nothing good to say  I had an offer through Amex Platinum travel so it was a great deal  the room was free and we also had breakfast for   days and one lunch comped   The check in area is completely disorganized with people just milling around trying to figure out who is next  The desk agent claimed the hotel was sold out and refused to give us a room with   beds  and then we had to wait several hours to get a room when we checked in  which has never happened any other time I have ever stayed in Vegas   They are clearly working with a skeleton work staff  baggage took almost an hour to be delivered  did not get maid service at all one day with no explanation when I called  and yet the casino floor  lobby  valet area  etc  were practically empty the entire time we were there  It does not seem remotely possible that the hotel could have been fully occupied based upon the complete lack of people we saw during our entire stay  Also I was SHOCKED to find out it is their policy that drinks are not comped when gambling at any of the bars in the casino  which is contrary to every single casino in the entire city   It was nearly impossible to get a cocktail waitress on the casino floor  The Encore pool is very party oriented  they have an entire  quot European bathing quot  area and there is a DJ playing music that is SO loud you can barely hear yourself think  and the chairs are practically on top of each other  Not relaxing at all  The rooms at Encore are very nice with a separate living room area  but otherwise there is nothing special  Following my visit  I sent a long  detailed letter to guest services with information about the many problems I had encountered and in response  two weeks later  I simply received an email thanking me for the information and stating  quot sorry to learn that your visit was less than what would be expected of a Wynn property  quot  They clearly have no interest in guest services or appreciation  I would definitely recommend staying at Bellagio over either of the Wynn properties  You may also note that Encore is currently advertising nonstop on the internet for very cheap room rates that include  quot resort credit quot  and you will find that leads to ridiculous lines and wait times for all the restaurants  since you have to use the  quot credit quot  at the property  
P =>   Expensive but very good Its a very smart new hotel and a lot less tacky than most of the others we visited  Good restaurants and a great  if very expensive  spa  Only complaint is really about the service   waited   minutes to get the concierge to answer the phone and when we ordered a drink from room service it hadn t arrived after half an hour so we rang to cancel the order and they said they had no note if it anyway  We had a room on the north  mountain view  side which was very quiet  I d stay there again  Le Reve at the Wynn is definitely worth seeing 
P =>   A stunning place We stayed at Encore for two nights on  th and  th       for our wedding anniversary  We got a great deal with Expedia which meant the two nights cost a total of       Laura L was very helpful at check in and during a chat we mentioned it was out wedding anniversary  That evening we received a gorgeous chocolate gift and a card from Laura wishing us a happy anniversary which we thought was a very nice gesture  We stayed in a panoramic suite on the   rd floor facing south  towards Wynn  with a view of the Strip  The suite was amazing  the view fantastic and it was very quiet  We loved everything about Encore and would definately recommend it and stay there again ourselves in the future  We found the staff very nice and helpful  They have a mini bar and other items for sale in the room and if anything is removed from its place for over    seconds you are advised you will be charged for it  I removed one item for about    seconds and replaced it as soon as I saw this notice  When we came to check out  on the TV in room  we saw that we had been charged for room service for the gift we received and also for the item I had briefly picked up  I called reception and they immediately removed them from our bill  We ve stayed at a number of hotels on the Strip in Vegas and are used to the fact that they don t offer in room tea coffee making facilities for obvious reasons however the coffee shop was near the lifts on the ground floor so it wasn t a problem popping down in the morning and bringing one back to the room plus it was very nice coffee too  We had a great time at Encore and was very sad to leave  
P =>   A Cut Above Wynn   But Get to the Pool and the Restaurants Early  Whoneedssunscreen and her Hub experienced mild trepidation prior to our weekend visit to Encore after viewing some of the reviews on TA  However  being the sunworshipping Vegas scene fools that we be  and having stayed at Wynn on prior occasions  we could not resist the discount E mail offering for their sister property  We loved the decor and atmosphere upon our arrival  although some might find it too garish  Encore seems more intimate than Wynn and the other Strip hotels  excepting Four Seasons  More importantly  we LOVED our room  We asked for the highest room we could get  and found that on the   th floor on the north side  street noise and XS club noise remained far below  The room was just beautiful with tasteful mirrors and a division between the bedroom and the living area  There was a very cool  large manly flatscreen television which rotated to face either room  The bathroom was large and comfortable and well appointed  The people at the front desk and within the hotel bars treated us very well  and we had no problems  even when we pointed out that the minibar double billed us for an eight dollar bag of potato chips  The moment we pointed out that our remote control for the drapes and lights was not working  it was replaced  We were forced to step over a    something boy all dressed up and passed out on the hallway floor on our way to the pool at      a m  Should you call security  Why get the boy in trouble  He was breathing and looked very happy  We felt intermittently pampered at the  quot European quot  pool  depending on the crowd size  but sincerely felt for the poor souls who arrived after       a m  who could not find a lounge chair  let alone two next to each other   What was truly annoying were the towel game players who left towels and other accoutrements on chairs and then returned two to three hours later   Towel game people should be fed to crocodiles   The staff worked hard to alleviate this situation  The chairs were actually quite comfortable  although on top of each other  The casino pool area bar had misters  which also were quite comfortable in the     degree heat  The pool temperature was actually cold  which felt great later in the day  One tip  If you lay out on the area with the astroturf  bring sandals as the turf gets incredibly hot and feels like hot coals  The pina coladas were delicious  The wife and about    of the rest of the women went topless and only about    including the wife went topless in the pool  This might have been partially caused by the fact that the  quot main quot  pool is rather small  and perhaps people who might not have chosen to be there had no other choice  In any event  we did enjoy the pool very much and found it rather relaxing for Las Vegas Unfortunately  there was a convention  which meant that almost every restaurant was  quot committed quot  until       p m  by the time we stumbled up from the pool with pleasant  self inflicted cases of heatstroke  After many telephone calls  Hub was able to get us into Sinatra s on the patio at      p m  We had drinks at the Eastside Lounge beforehand  The wife loved her white cosmopolitan  The service at Sinatra s was outstanding and the food was quite good  but one can t help thinking often when in Las Vegas that whatever you are doing or consuming is just not worth the price  Sinatra s is indeed overpriced  Heck  the wife and I would not spend the usual price for an Encore room either  The wife and I wanted to try out XS  but the line filled with    something kids whose self esteem depend upon whether they get in  was way too long even at      a m  Seriously  we are talking hundreds of kids wearing short skirts and silly smirks drunk texting through the wee small hours of the morning  Overall  the experience was a cut above Wynn but be sure to get to the pool and reserve restaurant time early  
P =>   Really Really great place We just spent   nights at the Encore and I would have to say it was worth every penny  Really  really nice rooms with a super nice bed  Everything was spotless  The    quot  HD TV was great but could use a few more free channels  My usual gripe is the internet service  Seems like the more expensive the hotel  the more they charge for internet  You can get it for free at most cheap motels but have to pay at the expensive places Anyway  the only other downside that I can think of is the location  It s a little out of the way but close to the convention center  The food is fantastic and again  in my opinion  you get what you pay for  Great service and great food  The shopping is very high end and what you would expect for a hotel of this class On Saturday night the night club was packed  Most of the restaurants were busy but no wait  even for the buffet which we really liked for brunch  We would stay again but the location might make us look at other choices  Love the bed  
P =>   Beautiful Hotel and fun stay This was our first stay at a Wynn property  We went with another couple and we both had booked through AAVacations com  Upon check in they tell us they are out of non smoking rooms which we couldn t believe  Luckily our room didn t smell but our friends ended up moving rooms  they moved again after this b c they got stuck above XS nightclub on their second room   All was forgotten when we walked into our room   beautiful  clean  spacious  They did a really wonderful job on the rooms and the beds were A      We all wanted to buy the sheet sets at their store downstairs they were so soft and the pillows were awesome  The rooms had anything you would want and a nice flat screen that could rotate and another flat screen in the bathroom which was a nice touch  I did not mind the hotel decor at all that some have criticized   its Vegas and its supposed to stand out  I thought the hotel was beautiful  The casino is smaller which we also did not mind  the Wynn was a short walk away if you wanted more action  We spent a lot of time at the pool and never had a problem finding chairs  We never went to the  quot European quot  pool since we were there to relax and read by the pool  Our first night there it was late and we were hungry so we just walked into the Deli at the Wynn and split salads which were very good and reasonably priced  for Vegas  and for the Wynn   We ate breakfast at this Deli all weekend  it would still be a     breakfast but it was just what we wanted for breakfast   I had the veggie bagel which I liked  Friday night we ate at Switch b c SW steakhouse was booked  The restaurant is very cool and the walls and ceiling change every    min   that was the only good thing about it  It was way overpriced and the food was NOT good  Very bland  they need a spice rack in the kitchen  We were not impressed at all and the service was terrible  We barely saw our waiter and for what we were paying the service should be there  We had tickets for La Reve after that which was FANTASTIC  Highly recommend it  Saturday night we ate on the patio at Mon Ami Gabi in the Paris hotel  all   of ours favorite restaurant in Vegas  It was delicious and great prices for somewhere on the strip with a great patio  I was a little sad my chop salad has been taken off their menu  which changes several times a year  We had Sunday brunch at the Wynn buffet   reasonable price we thought        The food was pretty good  nothing spectacular  The meats were very fatty  but we all found things we liked and the great thing about a buffet is if you dont like it  you dont have to eat it  The desserts were great there  All in all this was a great stay  Encore is an awesome hotel and we will definitely return  Service could be a little better  but there were also some outstanding people working there  We were sad to leave and could have used   more pool day  
P =>   Very nice very pricey but you get what you pay for in this case  Great hotel  I was there on a business trip and don t gamble  so much of Vegas is lost on me  but I really enjoyed this hotel  Very clean  Very good service  I was concerned about noise based on previous reviews  but I didn t hear my neighbors or any music from the street below  I asked for mountain view instead of strip view  Very nice view once you look past the incomplete  and stalled  construction  I had a room on     The pics from other members are accurate  I like that the flat screen swivels  Steve Wynn is a bit weird on his channel describing the hotel  but it was more entertaining than anything  Food is outstanding regardless of what you get  but it is EXPENSIVE  especially room service  which I normally expect to be expensive  The pool seemed very nice  but a bit crowded  Outstanding  friendly service  Check in was a bit slow  however  but my room was ready to go by       a m   which was very nice  Did I mention the great food  If I were going back to Las Vegas  I would probably stay at the riott Resort about    miles off the strip  but only because I m not a gambler and like the mountains  Encore is expensive  but you get what you pay for in this case  
P =>   Amazing Hotel I stayed at Encore for   nights  between    and      I had previously stayed at the Wynn  but it was my first time at Encore  Everything was great  and I did prefer it to the Wynn  I would definitely stay at the Encore again next time  Check In We had no problems at all  there was no line up  We arrived at   am  and they allowed us to check into our rooms immediately Room Room was perfect  Beautiful and spacious  I preferred the rooms at Encore to the rooms at the Wynn  I loved how everything was controlled by the remote control  curtains  lights  etc   And I enjoyed the seperate living and sleeping areas  We didn t find it noisy at all  some ppl complained about the noise in their reviews  but our room was extremely quiet  Also housekeeping did a great job with cleaning organising the room everyday  Pool Loved both pools  It was hard to find seats at the European pool unless you went early  Dj was great too  Drinks at the pool were all amazing  I loved their strawberry lemonade  It was hard to get service around the pool  there wasn t enough staff to serve everyone  so we had to wait a while till we got someone to take our order which was annoying Restaurants at the resort We dined at Stratta at the Wynn  their mushroom pizza was just excellent  For breakfast  I highly recomend Society cafe  Their french toast and sticky buns are amazing  Best I have ever had  The buffet at the Wynn was okay  the dessert at the buffet was the best part of it  We also ate at Sugar and Spice  and at Terrace Point Cafe  both were alright  Clubs  We didn t actually get around to going to XS or Tryst  But if you go to the concierge  you can get free passes from them  Otherwise cover would be around         per person  Casino The casino overlooks the pool  and it gets lots of natural light unlike other casinos  It is smaller than the other casinos though  Location It is at the end of the strip  but I actually prefered that  It is steps away from the Wynn  Venetian and Palazzo  And it is right across from the mall  
P =>   Fantastic Hotel   The only one I will stay at going forward This is the nicest hotel on the Las Vegas Strip  I ve stayed at Bellagio and until now my impression was that it was the nicest My wife and I loved the location  It was at the north end of the stip  but only a    minute walk to the center of the action  Being so far north results in a quiet  non crowded hotel  Walking through Caesars  Mirage and even Bellagio is a gong show with all the crowds so we really appreciated how quiet Encore was Room was perfect  We had the basic room on the   st floor looking north   Room      Fantastic view of the north strip and golf course  It was very quiet and we never heard any noise from the night club or other rooms  I think it was because we were facing North  Basic room still means a HUGE bathroom  seperate living aread with a swivel flast screen tv that turns towards the bedroom  and the King size bed was extremely comfortableWe ate at Bartalotta  Incredible italian seafood restaurant  We ate outdoors in a cabana and was probably the nicest setting I ve ever eaten dinner inSociety  Incredible burger  Okada  Amazing sushi and modern Japanese fair  views outside of the waterfall were spectacularWazuzu  The dim sum was the best I ve ever hadBotero  Steak was good  but not fantastic  Was a little over cooked but the truffled mac and cheese more than made up for it  Country Club  amazing cobb salad  View from the patio overlooking the   th green was beautifulRoom service breakfast  Omellete s wern t actually very good  They seemed to be pre molded with the toppings  mushroom ham and cheese  scooped underneath it  The hasbrowns however were very decadent  Now  all this being said  the restaurants are clearly overpriced by approximately     however  you are on vacation and Vegas is a tourist area so you can t blame them  It is something to note though  If you want breakfast for       or dinner buffet for       than Encore is not for you The pool area is gorgeous  Not as big as some of the other major hotels  but again very relaxing and not too crowded The casino  Beautiful  It was never too crowded and very friendly  One thing i particularly liked about it is it wasn t jam packed with slot machines  It was a very open space that didn t feel too crammed with all the regular casino crap Club XS  It s gotta be experienced  The people are beautiful  the drinks are amazing and has both a fun dance floor with a huge rotating chandalier and an outdoor area surrounding the pool  Expensive but well worth the experience The Staff  If you ve ever stayed at a Four Seasons  this hotel rivals it in terms of staff service levels  Always with a smile  friendly and they all seemed to really enjoy working there  From bellhops  to room service  to casino dealers to bartenders  they all really appreciated and enjoyed working at Wynn Encore All in all  this was probably my best Vegas trip to date  been   times now We will be returning next year to Encore and probably won t ever stay anywhere else  
P =>  OMG    I LUV the WYNN   ENCORE sheer Beauty     My stay   the Fabulous WYNN  ENCORE was one of the most greatest time i ve had in Vegas the service was great every request that i made was was done with no problem   i just loved theh decor the RED CARPETS were my favorite  the suites are very Elegant and the view we had was to die for   My man and i had a very very very great Experience   the Encore and cant wait to go back       
P =>   Spa close but not quite perfect Spa is really gorgeous  Colors are very nice   oyster gold blue  Lots of details that were very nice and awfully attractive  Lockers look like luggage with the key pad as a luggage tag  Lobby ceiling is terrific  Gym is well equipped and comfortable  However  it was decorated as  quot mans world quot  browns etc  Treatment was wonderful  One of the best treatments I ve ever had  Heated loungers in wet area were unique and incredible  Rain Shower wall was fabulous and I m getting one for my house So     here are the  quot buts quot      Totally lame steam room  No steam     No bathing suit dryer  Attendant suggested we use the dry sauna  Yes  it worked but    The wet areas are large   whirlpools the size of small swimming pools so women were primarily dressed in swim suits  Its nice to have a way to dry it before leaving the spa     Salt scrubs are offered but there are no treatment rooms that dont have carpet  Salt etc can get in the carpet  Other spas have tiled rooms for scrubs     Prior to your treatment you are directed to a  quot tranquility room quot   That s great  Its a nice room with comfortable loungers  But staff use the  quot tranquility room quot  as a cut through to get to the reception desk  Huh  So there are women relaxing  therapists welcoming their apointments and desk personnel dashing about  Hardly tranquil     Cell phone usage in spa  
P =>   Encore  fringe bobbles and over the top elegance  We love the Wynn  but we love the Encore even more  However  put the two side by side and you have the perfect hotel for Las Vegas  The hotel is similar to the Wynn  over the top decor  fringe and bobbles on fringge and bobbles and glass chandeliers that scream for your attention  But  the rooms are somehow more comfortable  elegant and welcoming  The bathrooms are wonderful too  with creams  Picasso sketches and a larger TV in the wall than the Wynn  Our meal at Botero was good  but they could use a few more months of training the staff  The wait staff at Botero would also look better in something more special than T Shirts  Our check in was all messed up and we were never informed that our room was ready and the woman was less than friendly  but the rest makes up for it  The casino is the lightest  and most intimate around and the pool had a great vibe  We re going again and dare anyone who loves Vegas to dislike Encore  
P =>   The staff couldn t care less about us    How very disappointing  The magnificent Wynn and Encore   I don t think so  I shall start from the beginning   and let me say that I have never written such a derogotary review of a hotel on TA before When we arrived  first the receptionist tried to downgrade our room as we d booked a prepay deal via Expedia  She was actually going to  escort us  as she put it   out of the Tower Suites reception to the resort reception until I could provide written proof myself that we should be there  After a  discussion  with her manager lasting some time  we were allowed to stay in the room we booked   but she neglected to offer us the normal water and cold towels that one would expect in a   star hotel  Other guests got that  but not us  Finally when this was sorted  we were given a key card  not shown to our room as I would expect  and we waited and waited    and waited for our luggage  Finally after we chased and phoned  it arrived   an hour and a half later  and the bellboy was rude when he didn t get a tip  We tip for good service and don t tip for bad  sorry  We tried to make ourselves a coffee while we waited  but no facilities  shame  Again when we would stay in a hotel of this caliber  and in a room of this status  one would expect an executive lounge to grab a coffee if there are no facilities in your room  Not so  at the Encore  you only get access to the lounge if you have a  gold star  on your card   and you only get those if you spend heavily in the casino  So if you would like a coffee when you wake in the morning  you have to get dressed and walk down past reception  into the hotel for about    minutes where you have the privilege of spending    on a coffee when you ve already spent somewhere in the region of      on your room  Nice  I also told them it was my husband s   th birthday while we were there   normally I would expect some recognition of this   I am not asking for huge freebies   just a little token to mark the occasion   even a sparkler on a dessert    you have to be kidding  they couldn t care less  I also personally found the waitresses with their fake boobs on display and bottoms hanging out of their deliberately short dresses a little much for breakfast time    Then there was the pool   I have a rule that I won t stay anywhere with plastic sunloungers  but somehow this place snuck through    we couldn t even find a spare one  and they are so crammed in you are like sardines  It is clearly a place where people go to show off their bodies  girls in full make up and high heels   I even saw one gentleman taking photos of a lady in a rather  um  uncompromising position   and this was quite the norm  It is very much about being seen at the  pool scene  and you get looked up and down as you walk around  it s a bit like a daytime nightclub meatmarket  As a normal size        something  I felt very very uncomfortable    didn t stay there long And I was particularly offended when I asked for a glass of prosecco and was told that they had run out at that bar but the barman could offer me a glass of sparkling wine  for the same money    I wasn t asking for it because I wanted cheap champagne  more because we were off for an Italian meal and I find prosecco the perfect aperitif for such a thing  Oh  and when we checked out  they snuck on     for minibar things   which we hadn t touched  It took    minutes to fix the problem  and the snotty receptionist didn t even say sorry    What I will say for the hotel is that it is at the nicer end of the Strip  and the rooms are stunning  We had dinner at Sinatra s which was excellent and I would say of a   Michelin star standard  though they do not have such an award yet  Also of note is Stratta  the Italian restaurant where the food is excellent and the staff amongst the best in the hotel  And LE REVE is truly spectacular  a must  Then there was Big Steve  security at the Encore  tower suites   who was charming  the best member of staff we found in our four days there  
P =>   Beautiful hotel wonderful stay We stayed at this hotel       celebrating Mother s day  Mom  sister  mother in law  This is a new hotel just opened      and it is a very beatiful classy and trendy hotel Check in was no problem no lines quick and very friendly professional staff  We were offered an upgrade for     per nite in a room on the   st flr but we declined b c we heard that it was nt worth it we were in   connecting rooms on the   th floor strip view and the room and views were spectaular no need to upgrade  when the bellman brought our luggage up he gave us a tour of the suite and told us about operating the lights and advised us not to touch the minibar items staing that they were weighted and if touched we would be charged and I noticed that one of the items were missing he called housekeeping to let them know so that we would not be charged  I guess because the minibar items should not be touched that may be why they were COVERED in dust housekeeping obviously doesn t touch them either  I also noticed in the water closet that the light sconce was dusty so thats why the four stars on cleanliness  Overall the stay was very good we ate at society cafe food and service great  Wynn buffet excellent  We ordered room service twice for breakfast hot and delicious about     for two  We brought   rooms through expedia and rented a car in a package and paid      and we got a     room credit per room b c we prepaid be advised that they hold a      charge on credit card for incidentals and if its a debit card it holds for   days  I liked the location of this hotel its away from the drunk crowds and the seedy element  I would advise to rent a car so that you can avoid the crowded buses and monorail all the Hotels offer free valet parking and all we paid in gas was     traffic is not bad and we drove up and down strip  town square  las vegas outlets and downtown We took pink jeep tour  we did downtown freemont  statosphere lounge  KA cirque de soliel  wolfgang puck  Olives  George Wallace show  Eleven Spa  House of Blues gospel brunch you can see those reviews on other post   We did not experience any club noise in our rooms as other reviewers said  the whole time on our floor we never even saw anyone on our floor much less noise very quiet and relaxing  Even going to visit other hotels like MGM and Bellagio they were so noisy and crowded you felt lost and overwhelmed not what I would consider relaxing at all  I don t gamble but my mom and mother in law does and they thought the casino was a little too quiet they went to the Wynn to gamble   minute walk through esplande shoppes  
P =>   Superb Hotel on the Strip Fantastic hotel  We booked this room for   nights     and    several months before our trip at about      per night  panoramic suite   Called about a week before to see if the hotel could make a more attractive offer  They promptly gave us a Wynn rate and upgrade dus to this same suite for      a night  Quite a value  Very large room  Spotless hotel  Fantasic decor  Prompt courteous service  Free valet parking  Super quick bellmen  Casino doesn t smell like smoke  Would definitely stay there again  Downsides  At the far north end of the strip  so somewhat removed from the other hotels on the strip         per    hours of internet service  
P =>  One of the best hotels I ve ever been in Great hotel   the rooms  ours was had   queen beds  were huge  Bathroom had shower  soaking tub  double sinks  and private toilet area  The foyer had a closet with dresser inside of it which was the only complaint about the room   it was far too small  The rest of the room had a sitting area with an large  quot L quot  shaped couch  Along with the two double beds there was also a desk  It was plenty of room and space for   people  However the view of the strip was mostly blocked because of the Wynn The hotel is very nice and pretty but there is nothing to  go look  at as there are with the other nice hotels on the strip   Bellagio has the fountains  Venetian has the shopping  etc  The staff was very helpful and very nice  never had a problem with anyone  except for one waiter  The pool area was very small and nothing special about the pool   except one is a topless pool so families with children beware Ate at Switch   the food was amazing and the atmosphere of the restaurant changed every    minutes so it was like dining with a show  Unfortunately the service was horrible  the waiter treated us like we have never eaten out before and huffed and moaned when we asked for our picture to be taken Also ate lunch at Botero which was great  Highly recommend eating there for lunch instead of at the pool bar  
P =>  Very Good with a few issues OK  just back from five nights at Encore  Overall we enjoyed our stay  We were not crazy about the layout of the room but it was beautiful nonetheless  We had a panoramic suite on floor     second to highest floor   Bathroom was beautiful but the layout of the rest of the room is awkward  Steve Wynn obviously watnted all these to be suites but the divider between the bed and the sitting area does not do much for the room  The couch was also uncomfortable  The decor is outstanding  The mirrored wall by the bed is kind of cheesy  The view we had was good but not great and again we were on the second to top floor in a panoramic suite  The issue is that most of our view was obscured by Wynn  This is a south facing view which is the view of most of the strip but you can t see much except Mirage and TI because Encore is directly behind Wynn and we were staring right at Wynn  as everyone else will be in any room looking down the strip   Bed  linens and pillows were OUTTANDING  Maid service was excellent and timely  Wireless was full signal with no issues  We had room service twice and both times the foood was very good and arrived quickly  We ate at Switch which was very good and also Botero which was average  We also ate breakfast at the buffett at Wynn which was excellent for breakfast  Cocktails are    bucks if you re not gambling and were weak  We ended up going and buying some booze at a liquor store  next door  after paying a few hundred bucks on drinks the first few days  We are not drunks but    dollar drinks add up quickly  The pools are WAY TOO SMALL and do not have nearly enough space  People were crammed in and on top of you at all times  There were not enough chairs and the waitress service was horrificly slow  This was a huge dissapointment for us because we like to hang outside and sun and swim for a few hours every day  The pools here suck  Period  Big mistake by Steve Wynn  I don t know what he was thinking  they are simply too small for the size of the hotel  The Wynn pools are better but too far a walk and they were also very crowded  The casino was dead even on the week end  Casino bars were also dead all six days we were there  even Friday and Saturday  We went to XS  encore s high end club  on Friday night and it was OUTSTANDING  Great club  we are in our early    s  with a good mix although average age was probably late    s to early    s  Overall I would return mid week but would not return on the week end just because the pool area is too small for when Encore is more than half full  If you are not into the sun  swim  lounge outside thing then this place is for you anytime  
P =>  The Room was great especially for the      The Room Suite was extremely comfortable  The new hotel ambiance was great  The bed was very comfortable  The livingroom area was welcomed  The bathroom with the separate shower and soaking tub are great   then there was the private toilet area  Also   there is a television in the bathroom as well as an HD TV that swivelled for both the bedroom and livngroom  The ability to open and close the drapes and turn the lights on and off from the bed side was a plus as well as the dimmers on the lamps  Our view was just so so but that was because we were early getting there before the   PM check in time and we took the first room available   th floor  with a King Bed  We did have a problem with the housekeeping  however  once I expresed my displeasure they came back and recleaned the room  provided a turn down service with slippers and music playing upon our return as well as the extra glasses we had requested since we were briging friends back to the room after dinner We had dinner at one of their restaurants  Sinatra  which was just so so with small portions and overpriced  
P =>  Excellent stay Hotel is top notch  Rooms are beautiful and service was excellent  
P =>  Opulent but            Having stated in the Wynn   or   times  amp  all the other Vegas   star hotels we were really looking forward to our    night stay Rooms are awesome  the best  the bars are great but can be quiet due to the end of strip location  service overall is very good The pool is too small  people crammed in  we stayed on the   st floor  strip facing  amp  when the nightclub is open its           the bang bang goes on until   in the morning so avoid the low floors  this really is a huge problem  the complaints must be massive  it really is awful      prefer the Wynn  
P =>  Excellent Choice    My family and I just returned from a family trip to Las Vegas where we booked the Encore via a Hotels com flight hotel deal  great deal by the way   We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Encore  I ve stayed at other hotels on the strip  including the Bellagio and we so enjoyed the Encore much more     the strip down near the Bellagio Ceasars seems to be a bit dirty  old and less upscale than the location of the Wynn Encore The size of the rooms are great and the newness of the hotel is a definte plus  I love new hotels   There are two flat screens in the room   one in the bathroom and one in the bedroom living area A few downsides      the hotel will not guarantee a double bed room  even though you request one     they say it s  quot just a request quot   They may try to charge you extra if you want a room with two double beds instead of a King      They charge     per day to go to the gym    couldn t believe it      They try to get you to upgrade your room     don t do it  We paid     extra per night for a high floor room facing the strip    th floor      my sister had a strip facing room on a floor a few floors lower    th floor  and she didn t have to pay anything extra and the view was the same Overrall we loved our stay and will definitely stay here again    I don t plan on staying on the side of the strip near Bellagio Ceasars until they clean it up a bit and update the area   You won t go wrong with this hotel  especially if you book a great deal online at hotels com or one of the other sites  
P =>  Awesome week in Vegas We got a great package deal including flight and room at the Encore  Very stylish  festive hotel with superb service  Our room was on a high floor overlooking the strip with floor to ceiling windows  Amazing bed  Definitely check out the spa    huge and beautiful  and a nice gym too  We didn t hear the nightclub  as some other reviews mentioned  so maybe they ve fixed that  We could occasionally hear our neighbors through the door that connects the two rooms  but no big deal  
P =>  not sooo great my sister and i recently returned from a trip to the encore  we have previously stayed at the wynn and have stayed at the bellagio too  our room was lovely however housekeeping made our beds the first day and the sheets were hanging out below the comforter  we had to call a technician to the room to fix our safe  we were asking him questions about the mini bar and he said  quot if i m going to pay that price for a drink  I want to see some boobies  yes you read that correctly The casino was nice and roomy however the chandliers are so bright red that they appear gaudy  these are all over the casino  while eating breakfast at the wynn we were talking to a gentlemen who said it looks like valentines and christmas day all the time while going to the restroom  along the hallway i found this girl lying on the floor with throw up by her side  security was there with a wheelchair but people qwere passing by her  i felt humiliated for her  the next day you could still see traces of the throw up on the floor when we stayed at the wynn we had no complaints  and when we ve stayed at the bellagio it has always been very upscale  Mr  wynn is talking about buying the bellagio back  Please don t because you may be expanding too fast to keep up with what you already own  
P => Great Stay at Encore    I stayed at Wynn s new Encore Hotel  amp  Casino from Sunday il   th thru   th and really enjoyed my stay at this new resort  The rooms are spacious and seperated as if you are in a   room suite  The bathrooms are spacious with a tv in the wall and a nice little night light feature so you re not banging into things during the middle of the night  They should have went the extra mile though and installed whirlpool tubs in the bathrooms  as Ceasers Palace has in their new towers  instead of just plain tubs   just my opinion though  I found the bed to be very comfortable  the electronic blinds curtains feature to be a very big plus and the seperate tv area work station very relaxing  The pool area is nice  but I can see it getting a little crammed during the prime summer months when everyone is laying out by the pools  I look forward to my next trip out to Vegas where I will have to see about another stay at this new resort P S  I didnt do all that well in the casino  but my brother hit for          on a dime video poker game  so that made it even a better stay   P S S  Just found out that the main headliner at this resort  Danny Gans just passed away   R I P  Mr  Gans 
P =>   Great for Vegas but    We just returned from a two night stay at the Encore and if you re heading to Vegas for gambling  fine dining and high end accommodations  then this is the place  However  if you are looking for any sort of relaxation by the pool  and i know many vegas visitors aren t  then think twice  I just wanted a couple of hours mid afternoon to enjoy the nice weather  relax by the pool and read a magazine but with the loud  pounding club music and no shade to speak of  you re better off staying at the Four Seasons or getting a massage in the spa and calling it a day  btw  the spa was nice and in my book gets an     I was also shocked that at  pm there was hardly a spare lounge chair to speak of  Equally surprising was the difficulty gettting reservations in the restaurants  This is a hotel which doesn t seem to show any signs of a recession  which is not at all what we expected  In any case  we enjoyed our dinner at SW which is their signature steak house    so much so that we ate their both nights    but as with most Wynn Encore restaurants they are high end   a drink in the bar beforehand      with tip for   martinis  You will pay LA NYC prices but you will get great service and food  Another thing to note is when we asked the concierge for reservations at SW we were told they were  quot fully committed quot  but when we said we really wanted to eat there  she mysteriously found a table for us both nights at prime time  Lesson is you just need to be nice and persistent with concierge  maybe checking back later  Everything about the Encore pricewise just seems to be a bit higher than other vegas high end hotels so if you dine and shop there just expect a bill at checkout that s probably higher than expected  
P =>   OUTRAGEOUS MISC COSTS While due to our economy and the  slump  Las Vegas is in  confirmed by numerous cabbies  the room rates at the Encore are quite reasonable for what you get  the other expenses    are nothing less than outrageous Cabana day rental                more than room costs  Coffee shop  breakfast for two           Sunscreen  Wynn s own brand           Goodies from mini bar are marked up at least     Soundproofing between the suites is indeed very poor  Housekeeping is excellent  Check in was excellent   pool service  when not renting a cabana  less than average Liked the hotel   but they really need to consider reducing their misc  charges as well  
P =>   Awesome This property resort is amazing  If you re looking for a nice place in the middle of the strip I would recommend this hotel  If you would like to go dancing for a night but don t know where to go   ask the Concierge  They directed us to a club on property called XS and provided us with free admission tickets  This is a nice club with access to an outdoor area that surrounds the pool and leads you out to a poolside bar  The atmosphere is great  We went on a Monday night and it was busy but fun  Drinks are a tad expensive but the experience is worth it  plus you don t have to cab back to your hotel  
P =>   Overall great effort from Wynn  The descriptions you see from other reviews are all very correct   great decor  clean and new  friendly staff  Good comps are  Bellagio  Venezia Tower Pros  use of pools and restaurants at Wynn  amp  Encore Stayed on   th Floor  facing away from the pool   zero noise even though I had the first room from the elevators  Friendly staff and nice attention for such a huge property with thousands of guests Classy and not as noisy as a lot of other properties   went to Mirage to see a show and realized how lucky I am to stay at Encore Check in was quick  but I did see lines at times   I think it is a function of a large group arriving  The attention at the front desk is very good and they spend the time with you which really slows down the process for others If you pressed me to find faults  here is what I would say  Biggest complaint  sucky food at the pool and no pool side restaurant  tuna salad sandwich      However  this is easily cured by going to Wynn  which has a wonderful pool side restaurant that serves awesome breakfast and lunch  service around the pool was slow on one of the days and another guest complained  It was fixed the next day  XS  amp  Tryst are great  but Monday night   XS they weren t very selective   maybe locals night  Could have been better  Not a lot of shade by the pool and no umbrellas 
P =>    spring break  My husband wanted to celebrate his   th birthday in vegas for just the two of us   so i booked Encore since it is one of the newest hotel in vegas and i was curious   We stayed in Encore from  april   th  The hotel is just beautifully decorated and impressive  Checked in was excellent since we arrived almost  pm which means not a long line and the guy that checked us in was very customer oriented even asked me what room do i prefer  strip view or mountain view  Going to the elevator has a security guard asking to show your key card  nice touch i thought  Our room was at the   th floor and facing the pool and Xs club with very nice mountain view  It was very clean  no slipper but just a bathrobe but didn t really matter because the marble floor  i think  felt comfortable with our bare feet  The bathroom is big and more than enough for my husband and i using it at the same time  I read some complained about a cabinet space but our room has plenty of it both from the closet and from below the plasma tv  The bed is just so comfortable but had no aches or pain getting up in morning even from staying at the wee hours  Restaurant  we tried the wazuzu  i think thats the name  the food was okay nothing to brag about but expensive  busy and the waiter seemed to like to hurry you up in your decision and ordering  We also ate the at wynn  sw steakhouse  best porter steak and vegetable we had but again Expensive Poo  Encore pool is nice but nothing extraordinary  and yes you have to reserve and pay for the cabana and the soft chair close to the pool area  don t know how much and didn t really care for it  the lounge chair served our purpose and the sun wasn t that hot for us  The water by the pool is complimentary and has a coctail waitress that comes around to take your order for drink or munchies  I ordered an asian chicken salad  mai tai and double shot of rum and coke for my husband and i  cost us close to      EXPENSIVE         Club  Xs club  very crowded and     to get in  Theres a coupon from the wynn buffet that you can pick up where the girls are free for only certain days but you have to get in before midnight  Unfortunately  the line was so long that you have to be in line before   pm or ealier to get inside by midnight  Again  drinks inside the club are expensive  It was so crowded that everyone bumping and hitting each other that i saw couple episode of almost erupting into a fight  so we got out  The music seemed to go on forever and ever to our room till about    am  Xs is openned friday  monday  Aside from the music from the Club  my husband and i heard few conversation next door and nothing in the hallway  I always put our don t disturb light on The casino is small but not bad for me and my husband  we are not a gambler  just passing time  The hotel has free valet parking but i heard complained of being slow so my husband parked our rental car himself  we always found parking easily in first and second floor close to the entrance  The hotel is accessible to the Forum shop wynn shops and palazzo hotel but a lot of walking Overall  it was a nice hotel but it is gear toward adult pupulation  businesses and high profile customers  Another thing the hotel should have at least a welcoming basket of fruit or nuts complimentary for couple celebrating anniversary  bithdays or at least with   th or above birthday or some other special occasion to ensure customer to keep coming back  I told the hotel reservation its for my husband   th birthday and she told me theres nothing complimentary that the hotel do   
P =>   Beautiful Hotel and Pool The hotel rooms are spacious  The pool cabanas are nice  Good shopping  high end  and good food  high end   
P =>   Encore We spent a long weekend at the Encore in Las Vegas   checking in on Friday and departing on Monday  We stayed in the tower rooms  non strip facing  The rooms are very nice and large  We had a king bed and it was very comfortable  The bathroom has double sinks  tub and shower  The bathroom is large and nicely appointed The room was quiet if you wanted to sleep  and as long as you set the privacy indicator  you are not disturbed  Check in  one word of advice  it can be a long wait to check in if you arrive from Noon to  ish  If you can wait  it will be a lot faster after    pm Location  The Encore is attached to the Wynn  which has the larger casino  the Encore casino is small but nice  Across Las Vegas Blvd is Fashion Show Mall  It has lots of shopping options and several restaurants  Realize you are staying towards the Downtown end of the strip and it is a bit of a hike to center and south strip I like all of the Wynn created properties and the Encore was no exception  Service was good  the food in the cafes and restaurants was excellent   although not low cost if you are looking for that  The walk between the Encore and Wynn is reasonable  It is a nice property overall  
P => 	   for a pool umbrella   Are they kidding  Total disappointment  It began with the woman checking us saying over and over  You are staying for   days   Wow  That s a long time   Progressed to the room itself  Nicely appointed but unbelievably limited in drawers and closet space  A couple of tiny drawers for each guest  Half a closet  Oh look there s a huge console in the bedroom  Whoops   just a nice oversized wrapping for the mini bar  The centerpiece of the room is a huge flat screen TV  Which is nice if you are there to watch TV but who goes to Vegas to watch TV The walls are   as has been reported in other reviews   super thin  We were awakened around  AM Saturday night by a group of young women in the room next door screaming and laughing  I called the front desk to complain  To illustrate how bad the noise actually was   I held the phone up in the air for the woman at the front desk to hear for herself   That s next door    she asked me  Yes ma m  it sure is  They did respond with security at the door within a few minutes  But even security ringing the bell and the conversation he had with the guests next door was fully audible from our bed But what made us check out   days early and move to the Bellagio is that when you go to the pool and ask for an umbrella the charge for it is       Which by the way was more than the price of our room  There had to be some mistake  Nope  Unless you are a  Tower Suite  guest with access to the VIP Tower Suite private pool   which provides umbrellas free of charge   expect a room charge of      for the umbrella Desert sun  No shade  And      for an umbrella  Wow  We checked out and moved to the Bellagio where we were given an umbrella by the pool free of charge  But it does make me wonder if the Encore has no trouble skimping on basic amenities like umbrellas by the pool for guests who aren t  high rollers  what other basic amenities   that we can t see   are they skimping on as well  Ugh  I don t even want to think about that one  
P =>   The Numbers A   star hotel staffed with   star employees  With the low room rates you get   star neighbors  Need I say more  
P =>   Almost Perfect Huge room at a great price  The hotel is brand new  so it is clean and beautiful  Classy  in a Vegas way  and not anywhere near as crowded as some of the other hotels  Pools  including the ones at the Wynn  are great  Service is friendly and the restaurants are good but VERY expensive Having said that  I would recommend Botero for a splurge  Truly one of the best meals I have ever had One the negative side    the XS nightclub blasts music poolside from      every night early morning  Our room on the   th floor was subjected to a steady thump thump thump  We tried to deal with it  but gave up after an hour On the plus side   after calling the front desk  it took less than a half an hour before we were in a quiet room on the other side of the hotel  The service was that responsive  I don t mind spending extra money on food and sundries if I am treated like a valued customer  And at the Encore  that s precisely how I felt  Even the stickmen at the craps table were friendly One other thing   the Wynn has the best  most comfortable sports book I have ever been in  
P =>   Perfect Just spent three days at Encore and it was a terrific experience  Such a huge difference in the new hotels vs  the old hotels  The wear and tear is just not there  We stayed in the basic room and it was over     sq feet and very nice  Once of the best hotel beds  soft  but not too soft  The staff was very attentive and helpful  Both check out an check in were made easy by a helpful staff  The casino is on the small side but Wynn is a five minute walk  The path between Wynn and Encore is much more doeable than the maze between Palazzo and the Veneitian  The spa is amazing  For my next trip back  I will stay here again and that is not normal since I like to experience the different hotels

P =>   Nicer than expected I was a little concerned about what I would find in the Golden Nugget s older  less expensive south tower  I made my reservations by phone  and the salesman was really pushing the newer  more expensive north tower rooms  extolling the virtues of pillow top beds  flat screen TVs and in room safes  I decided to go with the south tower anyway  and    maybe I just lucked out  or maybe it s important to ask for a room on the upper floors  we were on the   th floor   But my budget room boasted a pillow top bed  a flat screen TV and an in room safe    Anyone out there who  like me  might be hesitant about choosing an  quot old quot  room shouldn t be  It was very nice    large  nicely decorated  with several pieces of furniture  a table  chairs and a nice  clean bathroom with plush towels and even two robes in the closet  Sure  the carpet is a little worn  but it didn t bother me My only complaint    and it may sound strange    the bed pillows were horrendous  I can t believe such a high class establishment would put such uncomfortable pillows in their rooms  One night  I simply could not sleep because of the pillows    they re small with bunched up  lumpy foam  To the hotel s credit  though  the front desk had a replacement pillow delivered to me in the middle of the night  and it was fine and my sleep was fine after that  One final note  this was the first time I stayed at a downtown hotel  I found that I missed staying on the strip  and believe it may be worth the extra dollars to do so  especially if you ve never been to Vegas or have limited time there  But the Golden Nugget is a great value for your money  
P =>   great time at the nugget the wife and I stayed in the GN   th thru      Arrived at noon  there was no line  Our room was ready  It was clean and cold  We stayed in the South tower  The walk is nothing to the casino or freemont street  The pool was great  The chairs are a little close but still nice  the food was excellent  We had the breakfast buffet one morning  the cafe two days for lunch and Vic and Anthonys one night for dinner  V and A was very very good  the valet service is free and the guys were very helpful with directions Cant wait to go back  
P =>   Nugget Really Isn t Golden We were really disappointed with this hotel  All the staff  Lilly s Noodle Bar aside  are breath takingly rude and incredibly unhelpful  The pool is fine if you don t mind virtually sitting on strangers laps  the sun loungers touch   Also overall I would say   don t stay downtown if you don t mind either a     taxi ride or an hour s bus ride to get to Vegas proper  
P =>  Loved the Golden Nugget I had the cheapest room and it was wonderful  Everything about the room was the quality of a much higher priced room anywhere in the world  Loved it      As a woman traveling alone I was made to feel safe and comfortable in every way  The buffet was very good with high quality foods and plenty of healthy choices  The prices were good  too I would have liked to be able to use the gym for no extra cost but the hotel is just not laid out that was  The whole hotel is elegant and the new pool with an aquarium in the center was just the best  I could swim along with the sharks and other fish in the hot sun I like the Downtown  Freemont  part of town as it is easier to get around and even easier to get to the bus to the strip  The journeys on the bus does take time but that is just because there are so many people I would choose this hotel again any time  It was really gret  I travel a lot and am fussy  
P => Another Good Stay at the Golden Nugget We just returned from a five night stay at the Golden Nugget and it was superb  as usual  We had stayed there in ruary and in y of this year also and would stay nowhere else but the Nugget for this trip  This is my first review for this wonderful hotel  but it will not be my last visit as we will return It has never taken us more than    minutes to check in and we have always been granted our request of high floor  no smoking  king bed  On our y visit  we found the television replacement to the huge flat screened version  We were there with relatives who also stayed at GN and as first time downtowners  they were impressed as well  Except for one visit where we stayed in the suite in the North Tower  we have been in the South Tower and it is not a long walk to anywhere  A second Starbucks is outside the banks of elevators as well as a computer area to print out boarding passes for     Rooms are clean and spacious and bed is comfy  Another replacement since the summer is the shampoo  conditioner  hand lotion in that it is half the size of the former containers  Lotion is a handy  quot to go quot  size  but the conditioner was not enough for one person  However  housekeeping obliged with the request of another conditioner  The vanity and makeup mirror just outside the bathroom is convenient so I can dry and curl my hair while husband is showering Pool area is great with the shark tank and is relaxing in the evening as well  Not a huge pool area  but there are sunny and shady areas as well as areas you can met as a group  Cannot wait to go back  
P =>   Not my first choice The hotel is not bad  but not very good  Very poor value for the money and sort of running down  The staff  with on one exception  were horrible  The person helping me on check in was great  but it went down hill fast from there  I would avoid the hotel based on three reasons Poor air quality   the place is very smokey and the air is staleLocation is sub optimal   expensive to get to the intresting parts of town and the location is by the justice center  so by definition a high crime areaValue   not great value for the money   vey pricey for what you get   in particular the retaurants in the hotel seemed expensive given what they provided I just did not find the place  quot fun quot  or  quot relaxing quot  and could not stand the smoke  This is an older building and lacks modern air purificaton systems  I do not think the new addition construction will make a great difference  It may help with the air quality  but that is about it  The location remains away from it all  The staff seems to generally not be interested in helping or seeing guests happy  It really shows  By the end of my stay  I was ready for a vacation   which seems sort f wrong  
P =>   What a Gem HaveJust come home from another fantastic trip to Vegas  staying at the Golden Nugget was again Fab  Staff very very helpful and pleasant  rooms great overall service superb  For vegas virgins or regulars alike Downtown Vegas is a must  The Freemont experience out shines the Strip     Greatest tour was a trip to the neon museum aka the boneyard   its a must do tour  book in advance for this best     ever spent  if your planning a trip to vegas soon  make this a must do on your list  i think an actually museum is planned for next year  which will be cool but seeing this in its raw state is a must  for all you csi fans this is a must  see season   episode     I would also check out Bills Casino on the strip the Karoke with the    beers is a must and after   can guarantee you will be singing  I did  it was an abba classic  dancing queen  I blame the super mamma mia i saw the night before at mandalay bay    Cant wait to book up again   VEGAS ROCKS    
P =>   Great Hotel Downtown    Moved to Golden Nugget from a strip hotel that we were staying at for a trade show  All I can say is WOW  We booked a Gold Club Luxury room  What a nice change from some of the other Vegas hotels  Floor    in the North tower is all dark wood  quiet and attractive  There is coffee  water and munchies sitting by the elevator when you get off  The room is great  Dark wood  a DVD player  I Pod player  flat screen TV  Great furniture and large  very comfortable bed  Bathroom is really outstanding  Huge shower with waterfall type shower head  Large bottles of shampoo  conditioner  lotion  shower gel  shaving kit  etc  Sinks are separate bowls sitting on the dark  granite countertop  Loved the in mirror TV too  Very upscale and well worth the little extra from their regular rooms  We also received an amenities booklet with two for one buffet  free drinks and other half off specials The pool is great too  Newly renovated with a shark pool in the middle of the regular pool  A water slide goes right through the shark pool and is a big hit  All the fish swim around all day and watch all the people hanging out at the pool  It is a bit small for all the people  so go early if you want a good chair  Pretty good bar service too We went to the breakfast buffet  We are normally not much for buffets but this one is really good  On weekends they have loads of options for foods along with unlimited mimosas and bloody marys for        Our waitress was fabulous and brought a mimosa to us before the one we already had was half empty  We finally had to say  stop or we would still be there   I must say I am surprised how nice downtown is  It is the  quot old quot  Vegas with a new twist  The downtown light show is pretty fun to watch  and we loved the old casinos with much lower bet minimums  good drink service and much easier to walk between hotels  On the strip  it would take you twenty minutes to get just from one hotel casino to the other  but is much easier and more entertaining downtown  We decided in the future we would just stay downtown and go to the strip for a show or two  Last time we stayed at Venetian  which was lovely but minimum bets were     and we aren t real big time gamblers  Like the smaller  easier casinos Stay at the Nugget for a great time  great service and the true Vegas experience  
P =>   Great Stay Arrived at noon on Saturday the   th   room was not ready but only because we waited for a smoking king room  Staff was pleasant and helpful   check in line was very quick  Room was ready as promised at    The room itself was very nice   no obvious defects   and a wonderful view of the mountains  Big     inch    flat screen tv was a nice feature  Maid service was hit or miss  One day it was miss   no facecloths   another day fantastic   room spotless and extra towels   left  Staff at the pool  in the casino and in the buffet and Grotto were knowledgeable  friendly and generally helpful  This was our second trip to the Nugget and probably won t be our last  
P =>   Ok hotel ordinary people I booked this hotel for         night and bought myself an upgrade to a one bedroom suite for      night extra when checking in  For that reasonable price I got a huge suite  very large living room  bedroom  two bathrooms  one with shower  amp  tv  and one with whirlpool   The suite was spotless clean and had a nice view  no noise That was the good part  Now about Fremont Street  I don t understand what people like about it beside the light show in the evening  There is not one nice shop  simply not one  Only a few ordinary souvenir shops and a few casino s  that s it  If you spend half an hour in Fremont Street than you ve seen it  In the hotel and in Fremont street you have to see the crowd  I ve never seen so many ordinary people together in one place  the crowd in the hotels on the strip is very different  Sorry I have to say this but most of the guests in the Golden Nugget are rather low class  I sometimes felt uncomfortable  You can certainly leave your best clothes at home Beware the distance to the strip  a taxi ride will cost you     one way with tip  When checking out early in the morning computers were down  they couldn t even tell me the amount of my bill  They said they would send the bill by post  still haven t got it Sure I got a great room for a great price  no doubt about that  but if I had known about the very low class crowd and the location  I would have stayed on the strip  
P =>   Golden Nuggett is Golden         I booked my trip for the Golden Nugget on Priceline  went for Thur Mon so it was pricey  could of did same trip Sat Wed for half the price   but couldnt get the time off I have stayed there before   other times and have been to Vegas    times so I pretty know what to expect Arrived about   pm Thursday night  took a Taxi  was screwed charged me about       my return trip was        I wasnt paying atttention when I arrived  thought price of gas went up or something   I utilized the Deuce bus downtown     blocks from Golden Nugget  safe     each way to strip   First time I took it and was suprised how nice it was   will do it more often in the future  Room in South Tower was fine for myself  clean  good maid service  but it is a longer walk to the casino and can be a pain    The room on the floor was the last one down the long aisle also   Went to Big Elvis at Bills gambling hall on the strip  he lost    lbs  Great Free show Mon Fri  in the casino floor  p  p everyday   must see all  Seen it   times now   Spent a lot of time in sports book at Golden Nuggett was packed for Football weekend   Was betting      to   k bets  had to ask for drink tickets    to get free drinks   they should make that easier   Breakfast buffett is nice at the GN   only     Mon Fri    more expensive ont he weekend   Mad they no longer serve Binnions chili in the Coffee Shop   You have to buy a cup at the snack bar upstairs   It is great chili thou    try it Flights were screwed up there and back   but had a great time ps   I noticed more then normal working ladies downtown this trip    right out in the open approaching folks   numerous were hanging out at the GN bars over the weekend   you can never go wrong at the GN  
P =>   Excellent stay at The Golden Nugget This was our third trip to Las Vegas having stayed on the Strip previously  The Bellagio and Excalibur   We were not disappointed with our stay at The Golden Nugget and enjoyed Fremont Street tremendously We were booked in for    nights  Check in was quick and easy and I requested a room with a good view and had the choice of downtown or the mountains  I opted for the latter We were located in the South Tower  which is very close to the pool area  Carson Street Caf  and one of the   Starbucks operating within the hotel The room was extremely spacious and very clean  It comprised of two double beds  a bedside table between the beds with a lamp  telephone and digital clock  There was a large chest of drawers with ample room for clothes  on which sat a huge plasma screen television  In addition was a good sized round table  two comfortable chairs and a very large wardrobe with an abundance of coat hangers  one iron  ironing board  hairdryer  two dressing gowns and a safe  The window does open and there is an air conditioning unit underneath the window frame  which was quite effective in the intense heat we experienced Also within the room was a vanity unit with two good mirrors and an ice bucket  there is a free ice machine further up the corridor  The bathroom was a good size with a large vanity unit  bath and shower  An abundance of clean towels were provided each day and we were never without the free toiletries as these were replenished each day  The Golden Nugget is a beautiful hotel  extremely clean and comfortable with a good atmosphere  All the staff we dealt with were friendly and eager to help  The beds were as comfortable as those we have at home and housekeeping was without fault  It was such a pleasure returning to our clean and tidy room each day  The breakfast buffet was extremely good value with a huge selection each morning  all freshly prepared and quite delicious  We also ate the Champagne Brunch at the weekend and again the food was fresh and delicious with a wide selection to choose from and the champagne was flowing freely with our glasses topped up regularly We ate several times at Carson Street Caf  and we were constantly impressed at the excellent quality of the food and the very reasonable prices  Again  it was a very relaxed atmosphere and the staff were efficient and friendly  We enjoyed several mornings at the Shark Tank and Pool on very comfortable sun loungers  The pool area is very attractive and again extremely clean  It is an amazing experience to swim alongside the sharks and other fishes in the tank  There are two bars  which serve drinks and food  although a little expensive  and a good mix of music plays all day  to suit all tastes  It did become a little crowded over the weekend and the sun loungers are quite close together  However the terraced area was quiet  The pool also has a hot bath  which can hold up to    people  In this area are comfortable seats and day beds  There are also several Cabanas for hire The slots were kind to us at The Golden Nugget  On joining the Players  Club you are given     free play  I proceeded to win      which was rather nice as it didn t cost me a penny to bet My husband and I could not fault The Golden Nugget and if we were to return to Las Vegas we would not hesitate to stay here again  Downtown is a different holiday to that of the Strip  There is a party atmosphere each evening with live bands and street entertainment  During the day it is very relaxed and you do not get tired walking to the casinos as they are next door to one another  Also  the price difference is very noticeable with Fremont Street being far cheaper and better value than the Strip Definitely    out of    for The Golden Nugget and Fremont Street  
P =>   So So Hotel pool is much nicer then it used to be but very hard to find a chair at the pool The pool area is very crowded The shark tank is very cool but wish there was more room at the pool to enjoy  Rooms are average Would rather stay on the strip though  
P =>   Had a Good Time BUT                   Prior to arriving  I called to check on the room that we had booked on line and to see if I could get a room guarantee  Please be aware that the  quot Standard Room quot  that most people book is located in the South Tower  The problem is that the South Tower is nearly     yards away and and the rooms have not been upgraded  To get a room guarantee in the North Tower  Standard Room  is considered an upgrade and costs an additional     per night  If you don t ask  they won t volunteer to tell you  Also  I would recommend that you pay the additional     fee for VIP check in to avoid the long lines  particularly for early check in  We found the staff very friendly and accomodating throughout our stay  A word of caution if you re checking out in the wee hours of the morning   Getting a copy of our folio  bill  prior to checking out was impossible because the computers were shut down  We were told that they would have to send it to us either by fax or in the mail  Well  it s been a week now and we still don t have it resolved  Charges have appeared on both my wife s and my credit cards and no one can explain why or give us the actual charges  I would highly recommend the buffet for breakfast or lunch and we found the shark tank and the Freemont Street experience to be awesome  We booked round trip transportation to and from the airport with Gray Line Airport Shuttle  Be sure and call    hours in advance to make your reservation for pick up from the hotel  Call them again if the driver is not there on time  We came close to missing our flight because the bus picked us up over an hour late P S  Avoid the offers for  quot free stuff quot  at the hotel in exchange for a few hours of your time  The     hour time share presentation turned out to be      hours of high pressure gimmicking by some of the best in the business  
P =>  Golden Nugget Fantastic  We arrived late too the Golden Nugget   am  We also took a cab  big mistake  take a shuttle if you are staying at the Golden nugget it was a     trip if you have to take a cab tell them to take the Swenson exit and the strip its cheaper Check in takes about   minutes and you are to your room with in   minutes  but that was at  am so it was quiet and easy The room was clean  maid service always did a great job and the temp in the room was cool nice to get out of the heat of ust we had an alright view we could see the corner of Fremont street and some construction  we never heard any noise from the construction so no complaints thereDon t think about getting room service unless you are ready to spend a few bucks  you are better off eating at the great buffet for       per person  for breakfast  plus you get a few       coupons when you book through certain places we went through NWAlunch is        and dinner is        all prices very much worth it The staff was great  We stayed for   nights  so many of the staff remembered us and greeted us as we went through the hall ways  the dealers were very friendly and willing to help and teach you how to play games and they also made a point of remembering you and you re name as well The pool was fantastic and clean and so was the cabana which you can rent for      a day  very cheap  many other places charge      a day Fremont St is amazing so much to do and see and lots of security so you don t have much to worry about no matter what time you are out there  the Golden nugget is definitely one of the best hotels and casinos on Fremont ST so if you are staying there Golden nugget is the place to be the best way to get to the strip or lets say you want to go to MGM from GN hop onto a bus to Sahara hotel and casinos and then get onto the mono rail and cruise that to the end with in    minutes or you could stay on the bus but that can take a very long timeall day pass for the bus is    and a all day pass for the monorail is     very much worth it when you can travel from downtown to the strip in no time and see it all with in a decent time frame The Golden nugget is a hotel that when we go back we will be staying there again My Wife and I looked at all the other hotels and casinos and we were so pleased with our choice at the GN  it was fantastic  The only complaint we had was the people trying to sell time shares from the Grand View hotel they were all over downtown and the strip  just tell them no thanks and keep walking  they will leave you alone after you ignore them the best bet if someone is offering you free stuff and their name badge does not say Golden nugget ignore them because its not truly free Golden nugget is a Golden hotel    s all around  
P =>   golden nugget is golden Just returned from the Golden Nugget and felt compelled to write  Had always stayed on the strip and wanted to try something different  Couldn t have been more surprised and pleased  Stayed in the South Tower cheap room and was a little nervous because of the low price       summer deal   The room was beautiful and the distance between the room and casino and pool was no problem at all   If you ve ever stayed at Bally s and tried to get to the pool you can relate    The restaurants were great  Won a little in the casino and access to other casinos was so easy  In fact  for the first time in Vegas we did not get burned out  literally and figuratively  since everything was an easy walk and the Fremont overhead screen also kept the area shaded  Access to the strip was easy and cheap using the Duece  public bus   however we ended up only going there once for a show at the Mirage  The staff was friendly and eager to please  The clientelle was a comfortable mix of Americans  Europians and others  young and elderly  no seedy types  Also  it was a nice change with no flesh peddlers handing you papers constantly  Unfortunately  you still have to put up with pushy salespeople but at least they re only selling condos  Really wish they would get rid of these obnoxious people  but I can walk fast and talk fast   quot No  quot   when I have to  Would recommend this place to everyone  
P =>   Great experience as always at Golden Nugget We have stayed here several times  We go about once a year  This was the first time we stayed in the North Tower  My sister was right  it is so much closer to everything  It never seemed like a far walk from the South tower  but it is  The North is also remodeled with luxury bedding and very large flat screen TV  Don t expect a coffee pot in the room and internet is        a day  If you don t mind a   block walk from North tower   just take your laptop down to the Main Street Station and access wonderful free wireless internet there  It is in the players club area and is not a problem to use  The food is great at the buffet  ask for a coupon book when you check in depends on your rate  and you will find   for   coupons  We had a small problem with getting them to change the sheets  They only do it every   days water shortage ya know   which is fine but after the third night they still hadn t changed them  so on day   I asked that they come up and change them  They did  but much to my surprise at midnight when I got into the bed I found my toes on the matress cover because they had shorted the bottom sheet by about   feet  I called  they said someone would be right up     minutes later  nothing had happened so I had to get dressed and go down to the desk  I was told they were on their way  I nicely asked for some compensation for the trouble and was given a     food  amp  bev comp for Carson Street rest  I still think the day maid did it on purpose  but the great front office MOD made it right  Fantastic pool  new club Gold Diggers overlooking Femont Street  It s great to stay downtown  Just hop on the double decker bus  The Duce  to go to the strip  
P => 	A M  Construction NOT  Golden  at the Golden Nugget We originally booked   rooms  one non somking king  and one smoking king  When we arrived at   p m  we were told all that was left was a double in smoking  My husband does smoke and this was the last hotel on our trip and the only one that we had been able to get a smoking room  I was told that it was based on first come first serve  We were then told we could opt for a non smoking room but with a king bed  We chose that one What they didn t tell us that at   oo A M  we would have   men on a scaffolding working  scraping  hammering  etc  outside of our windows  There was also the sound of construction from within the hotel  When I called  I was told that there were rooms above ours    and that was where the noise was coming from I then took photos of the scaffolding with the   men on it and the recording from my phone and went to the front desk  As my husband and I went downstairs  we passed by at least     workers with toilets  They were remodeling all of the other rooms  The manager did comp our room and did offer free breakfast for both of us although this was after he asked What else I wanted        I told him we along with another lady with the same rude awakening  had wanted a good nights sleep and the courtesy of not being lied to about the noise and the construction  No room is that nice  to see people at your window at      A M  on the   th floor  A little frightening  
P =>   One of my favorite Las Vegas Hotels  Stayed at the Golden Nugget because of a great package price I got from the airline  I had been a little hesitant to stay on Fremont St  as it s an older area  But as soon as I checked in I was very pleased  The rooms were very nice and clean and the pool is beautiful  We ended up upgrading to a suite for the last   nights  and it was definately worth it  The bed is amazing  and a beautiful marble bathroom with a jetted tub  And for anyone having any doubts about staying on Fremont  IT S GREAT    There is always action right outside the hotel  and the Fremont st experience  light show  is great  And with everything in close walking distance it s super convenient  And getting up to the strip is easy  there is a bus  the deuce  that runs up to the strip all day  I recommended the Golden Nugget to a couple of friends  now they won t stay anywhere else  Bottom line  the hotel is a great value  
P =>  beautiful rooms We arrived in LV at     pm on a flight in from Detroit  Caught the CAT bus       from Mccarran Airport  It was easy to catch  a short walk from the terminal  the fare is       or you can buy a    hour all bus pass for        The      takes you directly downtown and bypasses the strip  The absolutely best place to stay downtown is the Golden Nugget which has just been redone and is absolutely beautiful  Stay in the North tower it is worth the extra dollars not to have to walk and it has all been remodeled  The rooms are large with    quot  plasma TVs and beds that have feather mattresses and pillows and comforters  Ask for a room at the end of the hall if you want quiet  I stayed at the Paris Hotel and these rooms are nicer than the room I had at the Paris  The pool is circular and it has a large clear cylinder     view shark tank in the middle of the pool that you can swim up to  It is quite large and has a large assortment of sharks and fish  Be sure and catch the free blackjack and craps lessons      am in the casino  I paid      for   nights that included a     food credit  We ate at the Grotto an Italian restaurant but It was overpriced and the food was not as fantastic as the price would lead you to believe    avoid it  Our best budget stratagy was to eat at the McDonalds accross the street in Fitzgerald s casino and in thier Coffee shop up stairs which is fantastic  
P =>   Golden Nugget is true class  This is the  th time I have stayed here and I wouldn t stay anywhere else in Vegas  The suites are great and the service is top notch  I loved the pool and did pretty good at the casino  A true gem in Las Vegas  
P =>   Loved the Nugget First time staying Downtown Vegas  wished we had done it before  The Golden Nugget hotel was everything and more The pool area alone was worth it  the shark tank and slide are even more fun for  quot grown ups quot  lol The food at the buffett and the Carson St cafe was great We were here to unwind and enjoy and everyone at the hotel was helpful and nice We will stay again 
P =>   Really Nice  Stayed here for a few days during spring break and loved it  Pool is amazing  Right dead center on Fremont Street which is exciting all on its own  Very fancy  Great rooms  Great deals  Had a blast and definately recommend coming here  My favorite part was definately the shark tank in the pool   And the waterslide  
P =>  What a GREAT hotel    What a terrific hotel     We had a girls weekend at the Nugget with    women  The hotel and the staff were wonderful  The pool is about the only thing that could keep us out of the casino  Callie the pool manager and Sebastian were so attentive we didn t want to leave The rooms were clean and luxuriously appointed  we stayed in the North Tower  The only think they could improve on would be making the Blackjack table a little luckier  
P =>   Contiuous Upgrades Return guests are given first class treatment  Limo pick up at the airport and comps  
P =>   Golden Nugget best value in Vegas I have stayed at the Golden Nugget five times and never had a bad experience  This time I stayed in the North Tower  My room was one of the best I have ever stayed in Vegas  The room has a    inch plasma TV and a bed that felt like a cloud  The staff here cannot do enough for you  The pool is incredible  you have to see it to believe it  There is construction going on  but other than parking issues it does not effect you  I would recommend this hotel to anyone  anytime  
P =>   Loved it at the Golden Nugget Stayed here for   nights  First time in Vegas This hotel is great  It s a lot cheaper than staying on the Strip  and in my opinion  the area where it is  Fremont St Downtown  is far better  It is so much cheaper and smaller  much easier to get around  than the Strip  its the original Las vegas  If you want to go down to the Strip  just take the bus  The Deuce  for a couple of   The hotel is smaller than its Strip counterparts but it really is lovely  The pool is unbelievable   a huge shark aquarium  water slide  water falls  hot tub  There are lots of good places to eat   a cafe which serves breakfast  lunch  snacks and dinner  the buffet is fantastic  and italian  There are   starbucks on site  Nightclub and a bar also Our room  we asked for a smoking room but learned our lesson  After coming from smoking unfriendly New york we assumed Las vegas would be the same    WRONG  you can smoke indoors in Las Vegas  Our room stank of stale smoke and all our clothes  even in the wardrobe and suitcases  smelled bad  We thought it would get better  there is only A C so no actual ventilation  but it didn t  We should have asked to change room but we didn t  Oh well  we will know for next time   Staff are very friendly and approachable  Casino is good too  but we didn t do much gambling  far better to watch someone else put       on red at the roulette   all in all  great hotel for the money  very luxurious  P S We seen our friends room at the MGM Signature   Penthouse suite which was amazing but it was their honeymoon        they said that they actually preferred our hotel amenities and location  Plus they arrived to be told they had to pay an extra     a night for  quot service charge quot  for use of the pool   They weren t happy bunnies   
P =>   Nugget is the Nice and Comfortable Our stay at the Golden Nugget was above average  The bellhops were not too pushy and the desk clerks were friendly  The wait to register was about    minutes on a           Tuesday     pm check in  We were staying at the South Tower which was located on the opposite side of the casino  but you got to view the shark tank pool through the a c  lobby as you walked to your elevators  The negative was the time share people just outside the elevator hallway hawking you with  quot Hi  are staying here for a couple of days       blah blah blah        quot  as we just walked by and ignored them The rooms were very nice and clean  They had a vanity top inside the restroom and just outside the bathroom was another vanity top for the ladies to get ready  while the restroom was being occupied  The beds were very comfortable and we requested feather pillows to be sent up to the room  The rooms come with a free to use digital safe  which came in handy  The a c  was the under the window type which was no distraction to us  Overall  we were satisfied with the rooms and felt they were larger than your standard room  because of the vanity area  These South Tower rooms are nice and no upgrade is needed to be comfortable The valet pick up was busy and slow  so we opted to use the self parking garage  which was actually very close to the South Tower  This made going to your room very easy and fast as opposed to using the valet and having to wisk your way through the casino  past the Shark Tank Pool and then the restaurant row  then your elevators  Use the self parking if time and distance is of the essence The breakfast buffet was great and cheap at only      per person and it included an omelet station  salmon  fruit  salad  dessert  and free drinks  The line was brisk and we even got to use the buy one get one free coupon that we picked up at the front desk upon arrival      must be staying at least three nights according to our travel package  The    hour diner was also included on the buy one get one free coupon and the oriental salad was big and good along with the world famous bread pudding that Steve Wynn s mother recipe     also free with coupon The blackjack tables are tricky in that some pay the     odds on blackjack as oppossed to the standard     payoff  You have to ask for the     tables to ensure you are not getting ripped off or read the sign for the     warning  The tables were mostly     min  bets and shoe dealt were available along with single deck  The best blackjack tables I found were the Las Vegas Club and The Cortez which both had double deck     min  bet dealt out of the shoe and open faced  You have a better advantage this way in tracking cards patterns  In my experience  The   Queens offers the best comps for your play as far as time played equates a free meal at their Magnolias Cafe  The best prime rib special was the the Main Street sports grill  brewery for       with the best tender prime rib  vegtable  and potato  It was better than Magnolia s       prime rib Overall we felt safe and well taken care of at our downtown stay at the Golden Nugget and will be back soon  I hope this helps some of you make your decision  
P =>  Golden Nugget   Updated hotel at a Great Rate This was my second time at the Golden Nugget  The hotel has been renovated since my first stay and it is a vast improvement  The rooms are spacious  the bedding was first rate  the amenities were high quality  My room had a king size bed  a big  flat screen television  a desk with free wireless internet  and a comfortable armchair There are restaurants  bars  a live theatre  and  of course  a casino  in the hotel  The hotel is on Fremont Street and within easy walking distance of several other hotels  casinos  shops  restaurants  and the Clark County government offices  I got an unbelievably great rate of     per night  
P =>   Loved The Entire Stay  First time on Fremont Street  what a FUN time  Great atmosphere inside and out  Hotel was nice and clean with a really cool shark tank in the pool  aka The Tank   Suggest that you take a small coffee pot  filters and coffee with you if you are a caffine freak as the rooms do not have one  Also nice to have a cooler  ice is free   and buy bottled water or drinks at the ABC store next door to the hotel for your room  The buffet at the hotel is very good  ask for buy one get one free coupons at the check in desk  Also  if you need transportation to see the strip area  there is a shuttle called the Deuce that costs    for any    hour period  There are tons of free things to see on the strip  but wouldn t want to stay there  in the MGM  New York New York  and other places  Just ask at the front desk  Free drinks at all the hotels if you play at any slot machine  Golden Nugget offers the best free drink selections around  Make sure you get your   K card at the Nugget  it s free and offers perks  You won t be disappointed  Priceline offers great rates  
P => The coolest hotel in Vegas   who knew  The rate is amazing       a night during the week   only around      for the weekend  The rooms are huge and the pool is BY FAR the best in Vegas  
P =>  Good Property   Disappointed they Closed the Pool to Hotel Guests My son     years old  and I go to Vegas at least once a year  and always try and stay at a different property  This time we split our four nights  The first two were at the Golden Nugget  We don t stay downtown  We don t really like Freemont Street  but about   years ago the Golden Nugget opened a new pool complex with a Shark Tank  aquarium   water slide and all new pool  We saw it last year  and agreed to stay and play this year  The water slide goes right through the Shark Tank   which is very cool The owners have spent a great deal of money renovating the venerable downtown property  and this is by far the best hotel casino on Freemont  The room was excellent  huge flat panel TV  very well appointed bathroom  comfortable beds with way too many pillows  Only wish there had been a few more channels for my son to watch on the TV But we came to swim   and wouldn t you know  as soon as we arrived  we were told that the pool complex would be closed for most of our full day for a private party  That really stinks  I have no use for a hotel that puts private parties above its guests  I did get a late check out on our departure day so we could swim in the morning  and we really did have plenty of time over the three days  two nights we were there   but it is the principal of the thing  We had the same problem last year in Miami  I am  perhaps  jinxed  All that said  the complex is great   the waterslide really fast and really fun  the shark tank amazing  You can swim up to it on all four sides  Perhaps not of interest for all  but there is a lot of shade at this pool  When it is     degree out  shade is a good thing  In fact  obe entire side of the pool is under cover  Just worth mentioning We ate primarily at the    hour ket Caf   Food was very good  prices quite reasonable  and the wait staff generally fine  The other eating choices looked to be excellent with a great variety of cuisines  Obviously we did not sample the casino   with a    year old in tow   but it looked to be busy Nice property  They are building another tower with     more rooms  so it must be doing well  We prefer the Strip   so its unlikely we would stay t here again  Word to families   Vegas can be a great family vacation  Just set your expectations  We spend most evenings at the magic shows  days swimming and enjoying the noises and lights  We often spend a few hours at Jillians shooting pool  And we know the best arcades on the Strip  
P =>  Gold in downtown freemont area Stayed one night  Saturday  for a great price through Priceline  Check in was quick and painless with helpful staff  Very nice throughout the hotel casino although not as elegant as   star facilities on the strip  Room was clean and quiet  I only ate at the    hour restaurant  can t remember the name  Excellent service at  am along with very good food and portions  The waiter even added pancakes with my meal which wasn t on the menu Poker room is a little cramped but very friendly staff and management  It was so busy that one of the managers had to serve as a dealer  I was very impressed with their commitment to their patrons This facility is so much nicer than any of the others in or around downtown that there is really no comparison  
P =>   Still A Downtown Hotel Hotel still reaked of smoke  ided on Golden Nugget because heard such great stories about it and how they spent     million to remodel it  Well I can t see where the money went  The pool is the best thing the hotel has and it s more or less just a shark tank  Room layout was horrible  Still just a downtown hotel no better than Vegas club or   queens  
P =>   Vegas Rocks This was mine and my boyfriend s first time we went to vegas  and loved it  We stayed at the golden nugget  People were really friendly  And the following year we booked a trip to vegas again and we stayed at the monte carlo I wasnt to inpressed  So this is our third time going now and we were looking at the pictures and airfare and of course we were drawn by the pool that the golden nugget has  So now we cant wait til we go in september of    
P =>   Loved the Nugget Loved the Nugget  Its the best in downtown las vegas  Its hot in july but their pool is the place to be  THE TANK has a shark tank in the middle of the pool  Great place for relaxing in the water  Rooms are very nice the restaurants are very good and service is excellent  We will stay there next year 
P =>   Great Vacation Hotel For the best rates  I continually checked every possible website for months  The hotel website was actually the best each every time  I even canceled and rebooked with the hotel when their prices declined  After seeing negative reviews on tripadvisor  I was hesitant about our trip  Our group stayed in the south tower in   rooms in the   th nonsmoking floor  plush sheets  pillows  towels  showers  sinks and mattresses were beyond perfect  Carpeting and AC was wonderful  Housekeeping was great  The buffet was fabulous  Customer service was very pleasant including the parking valet  which we used each night including Saturday   check in  doormen  casino workers  This is definitely a four star hotel  The pool is a nice size with much seating  the fish tank and slide are fun and interesting  We found   for   coupons for Downtown and much of Vegas in a book americancasinoguide com and there is also a coupon page Downtown in the center of the street at the O  booth ask and you shall get  We never paid full price for any meal or drink while there  Our favorite place to eat was at the back of the Golden Gate  huge shrimp cocktail    cents with player s card  and Bay City Diner next door  huge fresh breakfast   Coupon is in the American Casino guide above  Enjoy your vacation  We sure did      
P =>  would not recommend I upgraded my room and even that is just ok  The non smoking rooms still smell of smoke  I changed my room  now my room doesn t smell but the sheets do  Carpet is very old  The pool  is not as grand as shown in the pictures  It is actually rather small  Other then seeing the freemont street evening activities it really doesn t have much going for it  
P =>   Loved The Golden Nugget I was only at the Golden Nugget for   night while waiting to join others the following day at anonther hotel in Las Vegas  I arrived at the hotel at   pm and was greeted quite cheerfully by the front desk staff  I was told there was good news and bad news  I had booked a smoking room and there weren t any available  but the good news was they had upgraded me to a   bedroom suite in the North Tower  I was pleasantly surprised and delighted at my good fortune at the start of my trip  the   bedroom suite is BEAUTIFUL   After getting up to my room  changing  I set out to investigate what else the hotel had to offer  The shark tank in the middle of the pool was pretty impressive  and the water slide is great fun for kids of all ages   the hotel itself is very well taken care of and it shows  I decided to dine at Red Sushi located a few steps from the casino floor  and as a sushi lover I have to say the food was impeccable and the service excelllant  I felt like a queen  I checked out the nightclub Gold Diggers that was fun for dancing and people watching from the balcony that overlooks Freidmont Street  The casino is spacious but not enormous which was fine with me  I had breakfast at the buffet the next morning  the omelette station was very good as was their overall selections  My waiter  even though it was a buffet  was very attentive  I was sorry to checkout later that day  but I will definately return to The Golden Nugget   it s wonderful staff  and beautiful hotel  
P =>   The Jewel In The Crown Just back from another excellent stay at the Golden Nugget  This is the  rd time we have stayed there and you will not get better value anywhere in Vegas  the US or Europe We have travelled far and wide and no where is as good as the Golden Nugget  We were last there in ober last year and it has improved even since then The new Gold Diggers club and bar over looking Fremont Street are great  The staff in the hotel as so helpful and Gabriel at the pool even remembered us from our last visit  Impressive customer recognition or what  We paid around      for a   week stay  which is less than half the cost of a reasonable strip hotel  BTW the pool is amazing The poker scene there is amazing too   we met Daniel Negranu  Phil Ivey and others playing poker in the Golden Nugget   totally awesome The atmosphere in the Golden Nugget is always electric and the entertainment on Fremont Street is great everynight The convenience of being able to cross the street in a comfort to another casino without the red hot sun beating down or the heat hitting you in the face is great The choice of restaurants on in the Nugget and on Fremont Street is amazing  If the buffet is busy we recommend Jillians at the East Fremont end of the street for a great steak and cold beer  You can get a game of pool or do some bowling there too  if you want a break from the slots etc I cannot recommend this hotel more highly   just go there  
P =>  Very Nice Stay We stayed at Golden Nugget for   nights over the y  th holiday weekend  Arrived around      pm and waited    minutes to check in  Only one person was helping  regular  guests check in  while another   people helped the VIP guest line  Got to the front and was told they had no king n s rooms left  She kept looking  and magically found a king n s room in the South tower  Fine with us  that s what we paid for and we didn t want to pay     extra for the North tower rooms  Headed off to the room   th floor facing away from the construction  and walked in to a room that was completely under construction  Mattress was leaning against the wall  headboard was leaning up against the bathroom  drawers were pulled out of the nightstand  etc  Ugghhh  how frustrating at midnight   Went back to the front desk and explained to the same girl the room fiasco and she was very apologetic  She upgraded us to a North tower Gold Club room for our entire stay  Our gold club room was on the   th floor  mixed in with the regular North tower rooms  We were not on the VIP floors  The room was awesome   a comfy bed with fresh linens and lots of pillows  a modern bathroom with a tv in the mirror  a corner seating area and a    quot  flat panel TV  The a c worked perfectly and kept our room nice and cool  Also  our room was about   doors from the elevator so it was a very short walk  Ate at the breakfast buffet using a coupon from the booklet at check in  Very good breakfast and     for two of us  I thought it was a great value  Also ate at the cafe for lunch  Salads were huge and very good  Had lunch at The Grotto and enjoyed our meal  They were not busy at all for lunch and the service was excellent  Used both the valet and self park garage  Valet filled up on the weekend and even hotel guests had to self park on Saturday night  Asked for a parking voucher at check in so all we had to do was show that card to get free parking Overall we were very happy with GN  our room  the staff  the restaurants  etc  
P =>   it s ok The hotel is OK  The front desk were not very helpful checking in  sending us to the wrong room twice  We asked for a non smoking room and ended up on the   th floor  The hallway was one big smoke ball  Not great  The air conditioner didn t work and they had to bring in a new motor for it  If you stay in this hotel  spend the extra bit of dollars and stay in the North Tower  By the way   we asked for a free food voucher or something for the hassle and we got nothing  That didn t seem like it should have been a big deal to us  if they wanted to keep their customers happy Some people seem to get buy one get one free coupons and others didn t for gold diggers  The drinks were      a drink    The strip gives you more value coupons  that is for sure  We didn t even get a free deck of cards   The pool is pretty good  but not as big as it probably should be  The slide is good but you are going so fast you don t even notice you are going through the shark tank Food is very expensive  we never found a meal under    dollars for us two  We thought downtown would be cheaper then that We actually enjoyed the other casino s like the Plaza and Binions more then the Nugget to gamble in  You could always get your own table The Nugget is trying to compete with the hotels on the strip and it s not working  They would be better off to just be the nicest hotel downtown  Overall we did enjoy the Downtown better then the strip  but not sure if we would stay at the Nugget again or try another hotel down there   
P =>   Good Value Downtown Vegas My wife and I travelled to Vegas for seven days over the y   holiday  We had been to Vegas before  but always on the Strip  never downtown  So we decided to stay downtown for the first four nights of our stay After some research  I determined that the Golden Nugget was the only four star hotel downtown  Armed with that info  I was able to get a great price for a holiday weekend    only     a night   on Priceline We got a room in the  older  South Tower  and based on some other reviews I had read I wasn t sure what to expect  in terms of whether the rooms might be run down or noisy because of ongoing construction near the tower  The room  however  on the  th floor  was very nice  It was quite large  with only minor wear  and very quiet  even on y    when there was construction going on   The pool was nice  but crowded  The breakfast buffet was fantastic    for only       we had all sorts of great food  a waffle and omelet station  and unlimited coffee and juice  all in a brand new  renovated restaurant  The prime rib at Tony Roma s across the street from the Nugget was also a good deal I am a card player  The Nugget poker room was very nice  For blackjack  however  I walked to the casinos at Four Queens and to Fitzgeralds  which were very close to the Nugget  to find the five dollar tables with more favorable rules  e g   permitting surrender   The Nugget only had ten dollar blackjack tables One night we went to  quot Defending the Caveman  quot  a one act play running at the Nugget  This play has been around for awhile  and both my wife and I had seen it before  but it is a fantastic play and very well done at the Nugget  You can get discount tickets to this show  and many others  as well as restaurant discounts  at a  quot tix tonight quot  booth in the Four Queens Casino right next door to the Nugget Check in and out at the Nugget were very easy  unlike our experience at the Luxor on the strip  But that is another review  Tip  Car rentals are CHEAP in Vegas  and I recommend that you consider that if you want to get around a bit  We got a full size car throught Hotwire for     a day  All the casinos have ample free parking  no surprise  eh   so its easy to access them all by car travel  
P =>   Nicely surprised by the Golden Nugget I had read the reviews of the Golden Nugget only after I booked a room for my two almost grown children and myself in the south tower  The reviews I had read regarding the more affordable south tower of the Golden Nugget were not good  I was pleasantly surprised  however  when we opened the door to our room  The room was beautifully appointed and clean  The beds were so comfortable I couldn t believe it  I ve never stayed in a hotel where the beds were so nice  The pillows can be exchanged for feather pillows at no additional charge  but we didn t feel the need to do that because they were comfortable  too  The bathroom was nice and the dressing table outside of the bathroom was a luxury since I had my teenage daughter with me  The pool is beautiful  but a little small  It also closes around  pm nightly  which we thought was way too early  Customer service in the hotel is quite good  One word of caution  The food at the hotel buffet is not good  it tastes like you are eating a bad frozen dinner  However  there is a restaurant in the hotel  Carson Street Cafe  that I recommend  They are open    hours  serve breakfast around the clock  the food is delicious and the servings are huge  Oh  yeah  the prices are reasonable  too  The fitness room and spa areas are gorgeous  top of the line facilities  but they charge you an extra     per day to use them  Bottom line  The Golden Nugget is great  but I didn t like the pool hours  the buffet food or the extra spa charges  Additionally  they charged me an extra     per day to add my    year old son to our stay even though he was the second adult  my daughter is still considered a child   
P => Thank you Bell Desk  My husband and I were going to Las Vegas with our two children for the fourth of y weekend  and were suprised to find out when we got checked in  that the pool was CLOSED  because of a private party  IN THE DEAD OF SUMMER   The next day we wanted to get some ideas on what we should do for the  th  after all  the kids wanted to see fireworks  We called the operator  who told us the fireworks will be set off all over the strip  WRONG  Then we called the front desk who informed us that they had no idea where the fireworks will be  and transfered me to the bell desk  The young girl that i spoke with was VERY informed on when and where fireworks will be at  a breath of fresh air  Later on we wanted to find a good mexican restaurant in the area  and once again the bell desk was there to the rescue  This hotel seems to rely greatly on the knowledge of the Bell  Desk  as did we  We called down repeatedly for advice  and was never steered wrong  Overall  i don t know what our vacation would have been like if the helpful individuals at the bell desk werent there for us

P => lovely off strip hotel and casino with the best dining The last two trips  I enjoyed Ping Pang Pong  the dim sum restaurant in Gold Coast  enough to want to give it a try as a place to stay  The prices of the rooms  particularly if you have a club card  which gives you a small discount  were quite good  we chose to go with the  quot premium king quot  room for less than      for three nights  The room was clean  modern  and had a nice pan Asian styling  We really liked the porcelain tiles used throughout the shower and sink areas  The view not the best  but reasonable for the price  The hotel staff were friendly and helpful  and the parking convenient and close to the lobby The breakfast buffet is a great deal and has a nice variety  the casino floor and staff were outgoing and helpful as well  The casino is more  quot old school quot   quiet  simple layout  never got lost here   and no fancy themes or mostly naked pole dancers over the blackjack tables  Ventilation was quite good  we don t smoke and were not really bothered much by smokers in the casino  We found it refreshing and not over the top  particularly after a day or evening of wandering through hotels on the strip where the sensory overload can really wear you out  I even enjoyed a round of bingo and bowling  both in the casino and both very nicely attired  
P =>   Just fine There was a conference at the Rio and the special conference rate was about     a night  I went on TripAdvisor and could have gotten about a     rate through them but I found a     rate at the Gold Coast which is right next to the Rio  There was an additonal mandatory    a night resort fee but I was aware of it because of another review on Trip Advisor  Since budget was a major consideration  I booked at teh Gold Coast Arriving on a Monday about       the front desk staff seemed overloaded  There were   people behind the desk and a line all day long  Since I was a little pressed for time I checked my bag at the bell desk and went for the afternoon conference sessions  Coming back at       the desk was still a bit overloaded  But I got in line and waited about    minutes  Reservations were on file and away I went My room was on the  rd floor facing the back parking lot  The room was clean  the king sized bed comfortable  The bathroom was small and but very functional for what I need to do in there  There was a coffee maker which was helpful as I was still on Central time and woke up rested at  AM Pacific  Sine I really did not want to go down for breakfast  I made coffee in the room to take care of my vicious caffeine habit  The food trucks and garbage trucks came in with a bit of noise right below  not bad  but I was up anyway Location  The Gold Coast is off the strip  it is a    minute brisk walk to Caesar s Palace across the freeway  There is a sidewalk next to the Flamingo Road  There is a shuttle but it is infrequent and the line is long to get on it  With my conference at the Rio  I could walk there in   minutes to the side door of the Rio if I went up to the  nd floor of the parking ramp and walked down the stair and jaywalked across a very wide street  There was not so much traffic on the very wide street and with a center median it felt safe to do Food  The buffet is fairly marginal  There are lots of choices though and I easily found things to my liking  The first day  the prime rib was tough and tasted a bit old  The Wednesday prime rib was better  I think owing to the marketing campaign of free buffet for seniors in their club  The package I got on line included   free buffets so budget ruled over palate  The TGI Fridays open    hours is nice  I ended up eating evening meals there  I am a fan of the Jack Daniels burger  Plus they enforced the non smoking very well in TGI Fridays which I also enjoyed  Don t go in there if you plan to smoke I used the hot tub facility  temp was good  very few people using it  Some thought the    s temp too low for the pool area  I am a Minnesotan and thought it just lovely  Communications  I hate paying for internet  it drives me crazy  I can go to a dumpy motel in the middle of Montana and get free wireless but go to a      night hotel in Chicago and they want to tack on an additional      Here it was an additional      Not worth it  I did need to print off my e ticket for my return flight so I used one of the little internet kiosks with a printer attached set up just for that purpose spending        I maybe could have gotten it for    at another kiosk  TV  The television worked fine  kind of a long delay in the on off button  patience is needed Checkout  I used the video checkout option on the television  Got to the last screen and I needed to get a receipt so I pressed the button to get a receipt emailed to me  The next screen told me to type in my address on the wireless keyboard  Wrong  There was no wireless keyboard  So I called the front desk who said no there are no wireless keyboards and happily printed one out that I could pick up at the front desk  That was fine Overall  for     a night with a free buffet  it is a comfortable room with ok service at a decent location  especially if you are using nearby more expensvie facilities  
P =>   Great Value We visit Vegas every ember and this is the fourth time we have stayed here  This year we stayed in one of the premium rooms  They have been updated and are clean  The mattresses are very comfortable  The shuttle service to Bill s is an added bonus  The breakfast buffet is great and inexpensive at       per person  One of the food stations makes made to order omelets and eggs  The prime rib dinner at the Cortez dining room is to die for  Staff and serving personel are friendly  No problems with water pressure or temperature in the shower  We particularly like the fact that we can turn on the coffee maker and have coffee in our room before going downstairs to breakfast  We will be back next year  
P =>   Why spend tons of money if you are not planning to be in the room all that much  I stayed here on one of my trips to Vegas because the Palms was sold out  This hotel fit all of our needs  The room was basic  We didn t really need an expensive room because we didn t plan on being on the hotel room that much anyway  The room was a standard size and there really was not a great view but it worked for us  The front desk staff was great and it didn t take but   minutes to check in  The walk from the parking garage to the front desk is a long haul but not too bad  The casino its self was great  It is a older casino and it seems that this is a place were locals go  Not only for the slots and cheap table games but the cheap food discount at a few of the restaurants in the hotel  On the weekends they have a hot dog vendor set up shop out side the sports book  I think we got     dogs  and they were only        The hotel also has a shuttle that takes people to Bill s casino on the strip  Which is good for people that don t have a car  We were dropped off so it was good for us  I will probably stay here again if the Palms is sold out or too expensive at the time of booking  Its right across the street from the Palms which is were my wife and I like to gamble  This hotel fit all of our needs on this trip  
P =>  Inexpensive   with certain benefits I was there for ch Madness      so this review is a bit late  but I loved Gold Coast and will be back again in       OK  so my high roller friends booked rooms at the Palms  which is right across the street  literally and is an easy walk away   yes  they made fun of me AT FIRST for booking into the  quot mold coast quot  or  quot old coast quot  but by the end of the week  they were committed to joining me there in       Positives  some of these may be outdated  check the website  Room   clean  cheap  cheap  cheap  inexpensive  cheap  comfortable  You just need a place to crash anyway in Vegas  this is idealLocation   close to the Palms and RioAmenities   TGIFRIDAYS open  almost   all the time with super deals for breakfast  beer  drinks etc  Shots and beers were    while games were on  first round of ch Madness they are literally almost always on   Yeah  you heard that right  BOWLING for    after either midnight or     am  which is like the afternoon in Vegas terms  Great deal  good times  TABLE GAMES   we had a wonderful time with low minimums and great staff  SLOTS   good variety and great selection and payouts for video poker Check in   easyCheck out   easy  didn t charge me for a movie I fell asleep to  too Negatives Location   if you have a few too many on the strip and decide to walk back rather than grab a cab  watch out  The walk back is scary and confusing  Get a cab  Shuttle   never saw it  a few employees didn t know what I was talking about  ended up always splitting cabs  ps   always look for folks to split cabs with  you ll find them  That s it for negatives Great stay  can t wait to go back to VEGAS  
P =>   Great off strip location We selected the Gold Coast because we had tickets to a concert over at the Palms  Gold Coast is right across the street  maybe a   min walk and it s a whole lot cheaper than the Palms  It s also right next to Rio  also a   min walk  There s a lot to do right there with those three casinos and if you want to go to the strip Gold Coast runs a shuttle over to Bill s Gamblin  Hall every       min depending on traffic  It s on the same corner as Bally s and Bellagio  We took the shuttle over there and then walked the mile down to New York  New York to see Zumanity  I wouldn t want to walk it in the summer heat but it was a really nice night when we were there and the walk was quite nice  A cab shouldn t be to expensive if you don t want to walk  it s only a couple miles from Gold Coast to New York  New York and would be roughly the same to most any casino on the strip  We had plenty of time and thought a stroll down the strip would be nice  At Gold Coast we had a Deluxe King room and it was quite nice  Everything was in real good condition  It didn t look run down at all  The bed was very comfortable  The shower was awesome  No tub  big enough for two and one of those big rain shower heads  No crazy hot or cold water spurts that happen in some hotels  One other thing I liked is that the big casinos are like a maze and I tend to get lost but Gold Coast is small enough to find your way around easily  We aren t gamblers so I can t tell you much about the gaming  It looked the same as anywhere tho  The tables were pretty active  We did get pretty drunk one night  There s a quiet little bar at one end of the casino that has a pool table  We enjoyed playing pool with a group of Japanese business men till the place closed then we found our way down to the TGIFridays that s open    hours  We were there till about  am and we had a great time  Negatives are few  the views from the rooms aren t great but I don t really care about that  The pool isn t much  it s pretty small but we didn t have much time to hang at the pool anyway  There was no one even at the pool when we went out for a swim so at least we had it all to ourselves such as it was  The buffet wasn t great either  We had free coupons for breakfast and dinner  The breakfast was pretty good  They had an omelete station where they would make anything you wanted fresh  The dinner was a little more depressing  For free it was ok but I wouldn t want to pay for it  We like TGIFriday s tho and Rio has a seafood buffet if you really want a buffet  
P =>  A Good Time This Hotel is not   stars but overall worth the value  We did a Girls  Weekend Trip and stayed here     The rooms were clean and decent  the staff was friendly and they have upgraded a bit by adding a    hour T G I Fridays Restaurant  The location was great across the street from both the Rio  amp  the Palms the only reason to go to the strip was to view the new hotels  Easily accessible and nice bang for your buck  
P =>  pretty good it was pretty good for the price  I paid for a buy one night  get one night free  
P =>  Great deal  I got a great deal on this room from vegas com  I reserved a premium room but when I got there they put me in one of the un renovated standard rooms  It had a really tiny bathroom with a strange shower and the whole thing just felt old  After I went back to the desk they corrected their mistake and put me in one of the premium rooms  It was great  Nice bed  TV  furniture  amp  bathroom  It s definitely worth paying a few more bucks to get the premium room over the standard This hotel is a lot of fun if you like to play bingo  There s also good Chinese restaurants inside and a    hr TGIFridays  The buffet is pretty cheap and not bad  The Casino has a big selection of games and low minimums  There s also a huge bowling alley with    bowling after midnight  It s not a big deal that the hotel is off the strip because there s The Palms  amp  The Rio right across the street  and there s a free shuttle that takes you to the strip  The pool is nice  nothing fancy  but there s no waitress or bar there so you have to get drinks in the casino and bring them to the pool  
P =>   Nice Place Good Deal Really nice place for the price  It is a stretch to call the Seafood Buffet a Seafood Buffet but it was good  Clean rooms  reasonable price for an  quot off the strip quot  hotel  Good service  No complaints at all  
P =>  Great value and comfortable stay Took my mom to Vegas for her birthday and found a good deal at the Gold Coast  I had read the reviews on this site and decided that it sounded fairly decent  I was happy to find that it was  Rooms were clean and functional for a budget hotel  The bathroom is fairly tight in the budget rooms  but does the job  The shower had major water pressure  so it doesn t take long to shower  Had no problems with checking in or out  The casino is pretty large and has a large number of video poker machines  This is definitely a locals hangout  The free shuttle to the Orleans and the Tropicana runs every    minutes  so getting around was really painless  TGIF has a cheap breakfast special  so we ate there a couple of mornings and in the buffet one other time  The tables were very busy on the weekends  so we only played them a couple of times  There is a large variety of slot machines  so we played those most of the time  Overall  I really liked the Gold Coast and would definitely stay there again  
P =>   Good priced hotel First time we stayed at the Gold Coast  good all round hotel all prices reasonable in the hotel   room was clean and tidy The shuttle bus now drops of at the tropicana hotel at the top of the strip  previously Bills gambling hall barbary coast  from   th september This has not been received favourably by the guests we spoke to  as it is not so central to visit other hotels  as the bus is    dollars a trip or   per day on the deuce  if you are unable to walk further down the strip   
P =>  Loved It  Stayed at the Gold Coast with a buddy over the Labor Day weekend and was thrilled with the place  We got a great rate  about        a night   so we weren t sure what to expect  Both of our standard rooms were large  well maintained  and clean Everyone we came into contact with  from the front desk to the casino staff  were very friendly Breakfast in TGI Fridays was very good and served quickly  Dinner in the Cortez Room was outstanding  The filet mignon melted in my mouth The casino seems to cater to the slots crowd  That being said  even on a holiday weekend  we were able to get onto the table games with no problem I will definitely stay at the Gold Coast again  
P =>   There were Mormon crickets inside the room  My room was on the first floor  I heard the loud cricket noise when I started to sleep  After some investigation  I found Mormon crickets inside the room  They were between the carpet opening under the A C unit  The front desk said someone must have opened the windows  They didn t have any other room for me to move into except for a smoking room  I didn t get any sleep at all  
P =>   Excellent value clean and friendly This is the  rd time I have stayed at the Gold Coast and have enjoyed myself every single time  It may not be the most luxurious hotel but it is clean  comfortable and friendly  The cost to stay was exceptional and the food was very good value  There is not the hustle and bustle associated with staying on the strip which is just what I wanted  Fun and madness when you are on the town but nice and peacefull when you want to sleep  It did get a bit louder on the weekend but not enough to keep me awake  The cocktail waitresses were pleasant and very quick to supply you with drinks when you were gaming which was something sadly lacking at a number of other  quot  bigger  quot  casinos  Big is not allways better and I would recommend the Gold Coast without hesitation  
P =>   Great Place  Great Price  Nice Hotel  Only good things to say  This is a great hotel off the strip  It is nice and clean  We were able to check in early  The buffet is cheap and dessert is good  The chinese Ping Pang Pong is excellent  The price was great  We rented a car and the vallet service was very quick  The slots pay out and you can actually play for awhile  I would love to stay again  It is also a great price  Everyone there is friendly and helpful  They also have bowling  
P =>  Gold Coast Casino and Resort Las Vegas We stayed for   nights at the Gold Coast  Very good service  The buffets are excellent and they serve regular food like pizza  beef pasta  burgers and things like that  Great for families Very nice rooms for the price  Very nice views of the other hotels in the area Recommended for Families or couples looking for a nice place that is quiet but close to the strip  The shuttle takes you to the strip and drops you off right in the middle of the action of the strip  I would absolutly stay there again  
P =>   Excellent place to stay  I am recently back from a month of solo travelling in California As I was using public transport  location was an essential factor when choosing accommodation  I used a good value shuttle bus from the airport  which took me directly into the resort  Although a    minute walk from the Strip  which is better to do in the evening when cooler  there is a free shuttle bus that drops you in every    minutes  Note that there is a       day resort fee  but it s this that covers costs for use of the shuttle and swimming pool  WiFi access is very expensive at        per day  so try not to use Overall  this hotel represented great value for money  The staff were extremely helpful at helping me book day trips  which was much appreciated  Gold Coast is definitely worth staying at when in Las Vegas  
P =>   Great place to stay quick to the strip nice enough people   would go back again I booked a   weekend night stay at Gold Coast  We arrived at almost   am  but our room is indeed ready  I booked one of the premium  renovated rooms  so I m happy  Our front desk person was nice enough  if a little curt  We get Number      of    floors  and its pretty and does have a view of The Palms across the street  The room is in classic  neutral style  very elegant  The shower is nice and roomy  but tends to get water on the floor  but there is a window to let in alot of nautral light  The water pressure was good  We went to eat at the TGIF s  We got immediate seating  our waiter was nice  food came fast  so it was all good  We also visited the gift shop  which had alot of nice selection  and very talkative employees  I also saw where they had a casino coffee shop  but I never got around to visiting it  The shuttle bus was excellent  but it does stop at midnight  We never waited very long and it dropped off pick up at Bill s  It was a short walk anywhere from there  This casino is quite a break from the loud strip and the monster hotels  I was happy to return each night  I initially booked the room because we were going to a show at The Palms  but it was an excellent choice without breaking the bank  I got a great rate at hotels com  they were having a     sale   even for a weekend  I think it was      for both nights  all total  Our check out person was very nice  Oh and make sure the cabbie  if you re taking one   does not need to go through the tunnel  It s about    minutes away from the airport     I would definitely recommend Gold Coast  
P =>   unbeatable value great hotel great casino great location   great stay  What to say about this hotel  It was so cheap on expedia at     a night over the weekend where if you know vegas it s crazy prices over the weekends  We got one of their premium rooms which were newly renovated and it definitely great value  The hotel is just off on the west of the strip next to Rio and sort of adjacent to Palms  We somehow ended up with a double double room when it was supposed to be a King bed  but it wasn t much of a big deal  The furnishings of the room were very nice and trendy  and the bathroom was large and spacious  The shower was more like a walk in shower as it had no door to close it  but it was cool  The lights in the room were minimal  an orange lamp by the desk  but the bedside lamps were powerful enough  There was a large flat screen tv  and we did the express check out through the tv  The hotel itself was great with lots of amenities  the pool was great  they had a number of restaurants in the hotel  and it was cool they had a bowling alley too  It was also convenient that they had shuttles to the strip every      mins until   midnight  To walk to the strip is doable because we did it   but keep in mind you re walking over a freeway etcc so in high heels it could take a while  say   mins   We ate at TGI Friday s and it was great  and they had breakfast until  pm which made complete sense since this is vegas we re talking about  The hotel s casino was great   Great atmosphere and we won so that s always going to make a good impression to anyone  The dealers were nice  their tables would start as low as    for blackjack which was great  They did not have any hot clubs or lounges but Rio and Palms were close or go to the strip for that and come back to Gold Coast after partying to hit the tables  Overall I thought Gold Coast had unbeatable value for a hotel in Vegas and maybe even against many hotels anywhere  Even though I know many people would want to splurge and stay in the famous hotels on the strip  I would recommend this hotel to anyone in a heartbeat  
P =>   If you are on a budget trip to Vegas choose Gold Coast  I have been to Vegas many times and so I didn t feel we needed to stay at one of the     star hotels on the strip  We were looking to budget on the rooms  to splurge on things  gambling  dining  entertainment   I was pleasantly surprised by Gold Coast  the shuttle to the strip was great  the breakfast buffet was cheap and perfect  and the table gambling has low limits  All perfect for my husband and I  We used the Rio pool next door since the Gold Coast pool is just ok  and we were happy  If you aare on a honeymoon or on a romantic anniversary trip   I say splurge on the top hotels  but if you have been married for a while and really just want to go out and have a good time  I definetely recommend the Gold Coast  Oh  and remember to  quot splurge quot  on the deluxe rooms  We paid      with taxes for   nights over the weekend  Well worth it in my opinion  The deluxe rooms are really nice and clean and newly renovated  
P =>   Older rooms yet really comfortable My friends and I stayed at the Gold Coast for one night  We were very surprise about how clean and quiet it was  It s located across the street from the Palms at about a third of the cost  The rooms and everything in them  except the Plasma Flat screen are old  However  everything was in really good condition and very clean  The shower was outrageously fantastic  Hold on for a great ride as the shower is very powerful with plenty of hot water to spare  No complaints at all  We stayed on the fifth floor and there was no noise and we slept very well  The air conditioner worked great and it got really cold in the room  My two friends and I were very pleased and never felt dirty or worried about crime  We saw no trouble whatsoever and had a very good time  
P =>   Good stay Got a great rate on their website  buy one night for     get one free  Stayed two nights for     a night  What a steal  At check in others where getting     coupons for the buffet  but we didn t  I was told my rate didn t include them  No worry  the price was right  The room was big and clean  It faced north and had a view of the parking lot behind the hotel  The room was very quiet  Walking pass the room next door  we heard a loud crying baby  Once in the room  we couldn t hear it at all  There were only   pillows for the king bed but a call to housekeeping got us   more within   mins  The flat screen tv didn t work  but engineering was there in a jiffy to fix it  I was impressed at the quick service  The non smoking room had cigarette burns on the tub  but didn t smell of smoke  The casino is your average casino  Didn t see many people winning and that included myself  Ate breakfast once in the buffet        with free club card  Average  nothing special  At the omelet station  asked for poached eggs they said no  I asked for hard boiled eggs they said no  A lady next to me said   quot They must not have any water here  quot   That was the laugh of the day  Overall a good hotel  Someone stole the do not disturb sign off our door and the maid was knocking at     am  Oh well  that s traveling for you  
P =>  Cheep and Cheerful I have stayed in this hotel before but this time I was disappointed  We upgraded rooms so the bedroom was fine and very clean but I felt the atmosphere in the casino was more downmaket this time and slightly rough at times  The buffet was cheap and was ok for what you pay  We had lovely weather when we were there but and wanted to chill by the pool   the area around the pool is fairly basic This a budget hotel and is good value for the money but I dont think I will be staying here again  
P =>   Great Place to stay and to Gamble Went for anniversary  Told Sarah at the front desk that it was our anniversary and she upgraded us to the suite on the top floor  The room was bigger than my entire house  Really nice  and for the same price as a regular room  WOW  Had a great time  lots of video poker machines and hit some great hands  Will definately be going back again  Where else can you bowl while the wife is gambling and winning  
P =>   Not so Gold Gold Coast Hotel and CasinoMy wife and I booked two nights at the Gold Coast on a recommendation of friend  We arrived to find there is no valet  bellmen  or concierge  Our room was not ready so we had to wait around one hour  so we went to the bar and played some keno and had a beer  The drinks were ice cold and the service was fast  No luck at the keno  but we did start to notice the people in the casino  A drunk couple fighting in the middle of the casino yelling and screaming  the man playing next to me with open sours on his legs  and the other numerous characters  We finally got to our room and we were ready to go  My wife said lets go  so I called and booked us two nights at the Wynn    We left the room and told the front desk we had an emergency and had to go  They refunded our deposit and we were off to paradise AKA the Wynn   Spend the extra cash and spoil yourself  For an extra     a night we stayed at the best hotel on the strip  Disliked The room  the people  the casino  the smoke  the d cor and ambiance  Liked the two ice cold beers at the bar  But hey      has ice cold beer also and you don t see anyone staying the night there  
P =>  Adequate accomodations great value  Check in staff was mediocre  but the rest of the staff was good  The room was clean and the bed was comfortable  The hotel is in a great location for those that have a car although shuttles to many strip and downtown locations were available at the Rio next door  The parking lot is huge and the freeway and strip access were great  The drinks came quickly while gambling  during the week   The buffet was fairly good and the price could not be beat  
P =>   Excellent Value This was a great place to stay  The hotel is located off of the strip across the street from the Palms and next door to the Rio  The free shuttle to the strip runs often and the trip is short  I walked to the strip one morning and it took me about    min The hotel and casino are nice and the staff is friendly and helpful  A room upgrade was provided by asking  The room was nice and spacious  The bathroom was very nice The hotel has a basic buffet which was very inexpensive and you get a discount for showing your gaming card  It has an adequate outdoor pool and a    lane bowling alley The clientele are a little more mature than many of the strip hotels so the rooms were very quiet  The casino was a bit smokey  but the air flow was good  There was no sign    per day  
P =>   Good hotel good value We stayed for   nights for vacation and one of the nights was free  I think the average came out to     something per night  Overall  I thought it was a good value for a room of similar range   comfortable room  nice premises  reasonably close to the strip  We booked the premium room w  king bed  it looked like it was recently remodeled  not sure what the standard rooms look like  The one we had was clean  with a nice modern design  not large but enough space  comfortable bed  The bathroom had a tiled shower stall  no tub   soft towels  amp  bottles of shampoo conditioner lotion  The room had a table  amp    chairs  armoire  amp  drawers  iron  amp  board  flat screen TV with very basic cable  The hotel charges        per day for wifi  I didn t use it  They provide free shuttles to the strip  I m not usually a very demanding guest as far as amenities  so I didn t mind the lack of frills  But I did wish they had more tv channels Food options are pretty good  The Ping Pang Pong Chinese restaurant has dim sum lunch from      that is yummy  Eating dim sum for breakfast was one of my favorite parts of the trip  The Cortez Room has very good prime rib  I didn t try the buffet or the cafe  There s also an ice cream corner  The Noodle Exchange restaurant  amp  a TGI Friday in the building  Checking in  amp  out was easy  I booked through Expedia and the front desk gave me no trouble  This was our first time staying at the Gold Coast and it was a pleasant surprise  We had an enjoyable stay  definitely will return  
P =>   Excellent value and service for the price Having been to Vegas several times now I decided to venture off strip to check out this hotel  I kept my expectations low as it isn t one of the newer hotels out there plus it s location is less than desired  Little did I know that it would end up being one of my favorite Vegas trips ever Check in was great  We asked for one of their newly renovated room and they were nice enough to find us one free of charge even though they were booked solid for ch Madness  They also gave us   vouchers for a free buffet at their restaurant  Nice start We got to the room and were pleasantly surprised to find a completely modern and trendy room  No hint of smoke like there is at other older hotels that say their room is non smoking  Very clean  everything worked perfectly  flat screen tv on the wall and there was always plenty of hot water in the morning and evening On to the casino   gaming area  Although it is not huge  it has all the table games and slot machines you could ever want to play  The sports book was my main reason for coming to vegas and it didn t disappoint  The service was a bit slow but the odds we posted quickly and there are plenty of tv s to catch all your favorite games on  Drink service is fast  as long as you take care of your waitress Next up  the restaurants  TGI Friday s just opened there and we ate there every day  They have a breakfast special for       and it s worth every penny  They offer happy hour specials at the bar     all day  every day      appetizers     beer     shots  even premium brands like Grey Goose  Patron  Crown Royal     The food was always served hot and fresh  The buffet restaurant at Gold Coast was decent  I doubt we would have eaten there had we not received the free vouchers but it was good  It doesn t compare to Spice ket Buffet at Planet Hollywood or the buffet at Treasure Island but it was good   no complaints The free shuttle to the Strip was handy  It runs from  am to      am and we never waited more than    minutes to catch it  This really eased the fact that the hotel is off strip  You could walk to the stip in    mins or so but it would be a boring walk as there isn t much between the hotel and the strip except the highway All in all I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a nice place to stay at a great price  I will definitely stay here again  
P =>   Excellent value for Las Vegas I got an excellent rate for this place  especially considering that our stay included a weekend  and wasn t expecting anything amazing but was pleasantly surprised  I paid the bit extra for a refurbished room and it was very nice  We had a car and for this reason decided to stay off strip  not big drinkers   No problem at all with parking and when visiting the strip we just parked in one of the casino car parks there  The Gold Coast itself has a bowling alley which is great fun and soo cheap and I can also vouch for the smaller Chinese restaurant and the buffet being excellent value for money with lovely food  We actually preferred this buffet to the one at the Bellagio  The Rio is within walking distance which is very handy if you re going to see Penn  amp  Teller as we did  I would recommend the Gold Coast to anyone who doesn t mind staying off strip  it s great  
P =>   Nice Place We stayed here ember            uary          We were surprised to find a room for new year s eve on short notice  however they  as did the other hotels in Vegas  no matter what their condition  had a much higher rate for that night We d stayed here before and like the location as well as the casino  They ve made some upgrades  flat screen TV  and now all the Coast locations have a TGI Fridays  which is convenient  The room we stayed in is your standard hotel room  bed  bathroom  TV  dresser  The casino paid out fairly well  just learn to stop playing or you give your money back  They do offer good rates here  and we were able to walk to the Strip on new year s eve so it s not that far from the action  
P =>  Better then I thought it was going to be Stayed at the Gold Coast in mid ruary for work  Stayed in one of the updated rooms  It was very nice  but the bathroom was a little strange  There is no tub  which is o k   but the shower had no door on it  There was a     glass wall down by the shower head  but nothing to cover the rest of the shower  My best suggestion to you is to turn up the heat in the room  close the bathroom door  which slides closed  and don t open the door until you are done with your shower and have something on  Otherwise you will be cold as soon as you shut off the hot water in the shower  Make sure you have the bath mat on the floor  because the water will go all over the floor  Check in went well for me  but not for the others that were with me  The lady that checked me in was very nice  she offered me a cheaper room  and in exchange would give me a     food voucher for each day  When I said no  she was fine with it  But when my friends where checked in by someone else  and they turned down the offer the lady that was checking them got all upset and became very nasty with them  Check out was a little different  the day of checkout I was sick  I called down and asked for a late checkout  The lady that answered the phone didn t skip a beat  she said you have one extra hour  that is it  I came down at      p m  and got in line to check out  It took over an hour to do so  They do not have just one area for checkout like most hotels in vegas  But all in all My trip was very good  and I would stay at the Gold Coast again  So if you have any thoughts on not staying because it is off the strip and older don t worry about it  As long as you get an updated room it is a good place to stay  
P =>   Nice and Comfy The hotel price is great but customer service needs a little bit improvement  Slots were very loose  won several payoffs  
P =>   Very Nice Place to Stay I ve stayed at this hotel twice  once in       then again in       The rooms are nice and clean and big enough  the beds are comfy  the staff is helpful  and the restaurants and casinos are great  It s not the typical glitzy Las Vegas stop  but it s a great value  I would definitely stay there again and again  
P =>   Best NFR ever  It has been a few years since I stayed at the Gold Coast  but I doubt anything has changed  amp  I recentely stumbled on Trip Advisor I always stay somewhere different during NFR  but I booked way ahead  a year in advance  and got the Gold Coast  normally it is sold out during the NFR  The Gold Coast was by far   AWESOME  The bartenders were so nice  it felt like home  The rooms were clean and I never had any issues with getting towels or anything The food was really good  and the shuttle to the strip was very useful The prices at the bar were half what the strip was  so I considered the hotel a huge bargain I picked the Gold Coast as it used to be the hang out during the NFR  buckle go rounds  and I have heard that doesn t happen there anymore  at the hotel   
P =>  Always A Good Experience Just returned from a stay lasting from ruary  st through the  th  Hit a little bump with the agreed on price but it was corrected without any problem  Recommend you make notes and get names when you get confirmation numbers  Also dates of conversations  We made reservations on the   st of ember at     per room  Then I found on their site at      called and had it confirmed  And then  for like a day  they had a price at      which was confirmed  The problem is that you are talking to a central booking person  not the desk person  Another bump was the new TGIF  They haven t gotten their act together yet and the service is okay but it takes forever to get the food out  Since this is the only restaurant for breakfast you re kind of a captive audience  We used to eat only at the Courtyard Cafe but its only open from  AM to  AM  This is when we started using the buffet  The problem with me is that its all so good that I eat too much and have a problem leaning over the craps table  We checked in for two rooms  my    year old mother in law too  with no problem about    noon  Tables were evil and lost more than I wanted  as usual  Dealers and pit personnel were great  as usual  Ate at the buffet a couple of times on a slot special for age      Had a great dinner at the Cortez Steak Restaurant and also had tickets to see KA at the MGM great show   All in all a pleasent time by all  My son and his girl friend also came in for a couple of days and my sister in law and her husband came over from the Paris Hotel for a visit for dinner and gambling  This is probably our  th visit to the GC  and   th overall visit to LV  and we have never been disappointed  Yes  its a mile from the Strip  Yes  its mostly older couples and locals  Yes  the bathroom is small except for the newly remodeled premium rooms   Yes  there s not a lot of bling and bright sparkle  But  knowing this going in  you should not be disappointed and you will enjoy your stay at a very resonable price  If its your first visit to Las Vegas  I would not recommend it as your first experience  But  if you ve been here a number of times then I do recommend you give it a try  
P =>  ALOT better than expected well  in tember my bf and i stayed at the wynn  which was just excellent  so when we booked to the gold cost for new years we were very very apprehensive  however i have to say that the hotel was really good  this shall be a short review  good  room upgrade just     per day  check in FAST  CLEAN comfy bed and room  the room was modern and nice  the casino was big and had    BJ all day    tables  and it was not that busy bad  far from the strip  they do provide a shuttle  THE BATHROOM DOORS slide  wired   the room only had a shower and teh shower head had to pressure over all i give this hotel a good rating because it was very cheap for new years  clean with very helpful staff and an over all GREAT DEAL 
P =>   Good option but keep an eye on the billing Just got back from a stay at the Gold Coast  I had gambled at the casino a few times in the past  and this was my first stay there  The rooms were a bit older  but clean and functional  It was certainly easy and convenient to get in and out  unlike the gargantuan casinos on the strip  And you always have low limit tables available  even on weekend nights  The only downside was that upon checkout  they tried to charge me an incorrect amount for the room  When you book online  the confirmation E mail does not show the nightly rate  and I never saw anything at check in showing my rate  my fault for not asking   The desk clerk was pretty abrupt and rude about it  and when I asked to speak to a manager  I was told that there wasn t one on duty until   AM  pretty surprising for a Sunday   She eventually fixed the charge because she  quot didn t feel like arguing quot   So that was really the only sour note on a pretty good stay  
P =>   For a budget hotel to rest your head Gold Coast is fine For many Vegas visitors  a hotel room is nothing more than a place to sleep and bathe for one or two nights while they gamble and or enjoy shows  Other visitors may expect the hotel to be a place that offers an extra comfortable respite from the action  good meals  extraordinary service  and amenities that help enhance your time there  If you are the latter visitor  do not bother with the Gold Coast  But if you are the former  then the Gold Coast should work fine  We stayed mid week in ember in a  quot premium quot  room for     total     including tax and so called  quot resort fee quot    The room is clean  about     sq  feet and has been updated with a flat screen tv  a fancier bathroom shower only  no tub   and nicer looking sheets  Still  under it all  this is simply a budget hotel for those that want to be out of the room way more than in it  The pool is small it was closed for the winter though  and the restaurants run from fast food style to middle of the road  such as T G I F   There is an ice cream parlor and bowling alley as well  The casino is mid sized and nothing spectacular  The hotel location is off the strip so best if you have a car when staying here  Overall  stay here if service  luxury  and lots of amenties is NOT important to you  THis is a budget place to rest your head and gamble  nothing more but decent enough to not be less  
P =>  Had a great time   Gold Coast Stayed at the Gold Coast the week before Christmas  Monday   Friday  Got a great Winter deal on their website  stay   nights get the  th night free with     slot or table play and     restaurant credit  It was easy to reserve the room online  The deal was     a night but we  quot upgraded quot  to the newer  recently remodeled room for a whopping     a night  Honestly  we paid more for airfare from Seattle than we paid for the room  A great deal  LV is hurting for tourists  and they really want to encourage business When we checked in  we were greeted by the woman who previous reviewers must have been referring to  the very business like  bordering very closely to rude  barely smiling desk clerk  When I brought up the     slot play and restaurant credit  she didn t look up as she typed away at the keyboard and tried to act like she didn t know what I was referring to  She said that that was NOT noted on our reservation and that we were supposed to call the hotel directly and set that up at the time of reservation  We used the hotel online reservation system  and there was nothing that mentioned the need to call directly  That being said  she did give us the credit for both I asked for the highest floor possible  since that s always the best way to avoid hearing street noise in any hotel  We got a room on the  th floor and it was very clean except for there was some toilet paper in the toilet when we got there  The room itself was very clean and we tipped the maids accordingly  The towels are super cheap  thin  and the ice bucket is just a plastic bucket  both reminiscent of Motel    It s true that there isn t a comforter of any type on the bed  just a thin blanket underneath a sheet  I asked for a blanket at the front desk the next day and a warm  thick blanket was delivered promptly to the room  so don t hesitate to ask for one if you are cold The shuttle to the Strip was very convenient and easy  For us  the big highlight of the hotel is the       hot dog stand by the sports betting area and the       bowling and       shoes        domestic beer after Midnight in the in casino bowling alley  Fun  cheap entertainment  Definitely geared towards older visitors  not    somethings   there s a  quot       breakfast quot  advertised on the marquee outside for TGIFridays  but if you go there  you have to mention it  because it s not on their regular menu  The breakfast buffet was ok  but not fabulous  The best part was the huge dessert area with cakes and pastries  Order the  quot eggs your way quot  and look for   different areas for bacon  one side was crispier than the other  There s also a Chinese restaurant that has dim sum and lunch specials  a Seattle s Best coffee place and an ice cream shop Lost the     slot play credit fairly quickly  I can t say that their slots are any  quot looser quot  than anyplace else  The Star Wars game across the way at The Palms  run across the street for a slightly better lunch buffet  was fun  newer slots  and payed out pretty well  There seems to be a fair amount of advertising for this hotel as  quot where the locals come to play quot  and it s definitely not as  quot blingy quot  and huge and new as anything on the strip  but if you need an inexpensive  low key place to stay in Las Vegas  stay here We asked the Bell Clerk to reserve a rental car for us  and the company picked us up  the day after the biggest snow storm in LV in    years  and brought us back the next day after we returned the car  They also gave us the number of a shuttle that would take us to the airport for       each  which was a lot cheaper than the     taxi ride that we took to the hotel on Monday  If you need to get away from the crazy city  drive less than    minutes away to the Valley of Fire State Park  It was awesome  
P => Nice stay stayed at the Gold Coast just after Christmas the hotel and the casino are very good free shuttle to the strip next to the RIO the only negative thing was the smallness of the bathroom in the standard room other than that it was a enjoyable stay 
P =>   go to gold coast Stayed at gold coast from   th dec till   th dec      Travel to vegas   or   times per year usually stay at orleans but was sold out so stayed at sister hotel  Excellent choice will now stay at gold coast in future Located just of the strip can walk to ceasers in    mins but they run a shuttle bus to strip from       till       Shuttle is free of charge Single traveller so was booked into kingsize non smoking  Room was recently renovated and was really nice Only one complaint no safe i room but safety deposit box free of charge at cashiers bank Buffet as usual  st class Breakfast buffet    Lunch buffet    and dinner buffet     Have eaten dinner at rio     planet hollywood     and luxor     and gold coat is as good as any of them for less than half price Got the hotel for   nights with expedia for      an absolute bargain Am planning to go to vegas again in march and june and will be staying at gold coast  
P =>   Loved the Gold Coast   Loved Las Vegas I have just returned from a week at the Gold Coast Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas  It was excellent  The staff at the hotel were polite and could not do enough for you  For a low budget hotel it was superb  Our room was cleaned every day to an excellent standard  The restaurants in the hotel were a good range with the Ports of Call Buffet being excellent value at all times with plenty of choice  in fact too much choice  The shuttle bus from outside the hotel was a bonus and you were at the strip in   minutes  It ran from      to       a m  and came every    minutes or so  I visited the hairdresser in the hotel and everyone was so friendly and they took great care of you  When returning to Las Vegas  and I will  I would not hesitate in booking the Gold Coast again  The hotels on the strip are a sight to see  but for comfort and a smaller hotel  the Gold Coast is the place to book  
P => Much Better Choices Good location   next to Rio was nice  There are better choices though for the same price  Rooms were inexpensive  but if you are looking for something like that stay at the Orleans   much nicer there  Shuttle was a nice convenience  No safe in the room which is pretty standard  especially in Vegas  If the goal is to stay in Vegas cheaply  don t pick this hotel  but the Orleans  
P =>   Better than expected stay Stayed at Gold Coast for one night  Saturday night   I was a little apprehensive because I really hadn t heard much about this place  but the rates were reasonable and it was only for one night  I was pleasantly surprised at how nice it was  Check in was a breeze  very friendly at front desk  The room had apparently been renovated  it had a new plasma TV and the carpet looked new as well  Very  very CLEAN which is a major consideration for me  There really wasn t too much of a smoky smell in corridors or casino either  We ate at the Ping Pang Pong restaurant downstairs and thought it was very tasty and reasonable  Beer was     which we though was pretty good  
P =>   Daily  Resort Fee  now Charged Spent   nights at the Gold Coast this month and I d say it s a middle of the road choice  Front desk employees were surly and apparently bored by having to wait on customers  The casino certainly appeals to an older clientele than what you find on the Strip The room I had wasn t one of the refurbished ones so the carpet had burn holes in it and the shower toilet room is teeny tiny  But the room was very clean  Stayed at the Gold Coast as I was there for work  I struggled to find more than the one outlet by the work table to plug my laptop and chargers in The A C worked well in the room  although the hallways aren t kept cooled so it s steamy walking to your room  I ate at the Noodle Exchange one night and it was delicious and the employees were great there As an FYI the signs at the front desk all announce that starting in ober there is a daily  quot resort quot  fee added to all rooms I ve stayed in at least   other Vegas hotels and I wouldn t choose the Gold Coast again  not because of anything terrible  it s just a blah hotel  
P =>   Great Hotel in Great Location My boyfriend and I stayed here for a week in        We were delighted  had a room with a view  massive bed     quot  plasma TV  bedroom was very spacious with a walk in wardrobe and decent bathroom  The shuttle to the strip is brill  we only got a taxi on one occasion  Everything here is way cheaper than anywhere on the strip  there is a great variety of food and drinks  We got some free vouchers on arrival also  Could not fault this hotel and i am looking forward to going back there in ch     
P =>   The    Carrat God Hotel My husband and I stayed at the Gold Coast in tember       We have visited Vegas six times and this was the first time we have stayed off the strip  All I can say is this hotel is as good as any on the strip  When checking in ask for a renovated room we did and our room was amazing the bathroom was small but it had the best shower I have ever had The beds are very comfy and the decor is as good as the MGM  The buffet has lots of choice and is really cheap The drinks at the bar are are around    which is less then the    plus they charge on the strip There is a selection of Chinese Japanese T G I Fridays  Ice Cream and Coffee shops which are all worth visit  The pool area is small but clean with plenty of sunbeds and a nice place to chill after hitting the shops There is a mini bus which drops you outside Bills Gambling Hall right in the middle of the strip so no need for taxis as the last one is       The hotel has two entrances one is across the road from the Palms and the other is across from the road from the Reo so plenty of entertainment all round  This hotel is a hidden Gem well worth a visit  
P =>   Phenomenal value good location Stayed for a week early tember  paid the extra for one of the refurbed rooms  I don t have a bad word to say about the place  Its exceptional value  clean and the staff were all friendly I ate at PingPangPong and Noodle Exchange  both were good and a welcome change from standard Vegas food  Really liked the squab  lettuce cups in PPP The gym was small  but adequate  and there s no resort fee tacked on  which is a bonus these days  You couldn t really use the pool for anything other than cooling off  don t come here if you want to get the laps in Being off strip didn t matter whatsoever  the shuttles were frequent  I never waited more than    minutes  and dropped you off by Bills  Staying at the south end  it would actually take longer to get to the action than staying at Gold coast  Miss the last one at       and it s only a few bucks in a cab be the aircon unit would keep some people awake  it was kinda loud  but didn t affect me The poker room is tiny  but good action and a lot of fun  Dealers all very competent  one girl was RIDICULOUSLY fast  took pride in it which is always good Highly recommended  will definitely be back  
P =>   very good hotel for the price booked the gold coast online from hotel com it was so cheap we upgraded to the premier room at a cost of less than     a night on average cheaper weekdays dearer weekends  the room was very spacious the king size bed was enormous  large plasma T V  nice walkin shower  the maid kept the room very clean and well stocked with towels  toilet rolls  etc the food at the hotel was quite good with a choice of buffet  chinese japanese and a steakhouse they where also building a TGI fridays inside the hotel the pool was small but clean im not much of a gambler but i tried my hand at roulette and blackjack and the dealers where very friendly they also had a bingo hall in the hotel the only one in the area  which i played a few times as the prizes where quite big a little warning for the brits the bingo is quite different to what we have in the u k  but with a little help from a friendly old lady we manged to pick it up o k   the hotel is about     of a mile from the strip  but there are shuttle buses about every    minutes that drop you at the strip they stop running at       am and start at      am this might be a problem for clubbers but the money you save on the rooms food and drink over staying at a strip hotel will easily pay for taxis also the gold coast is directly oposite the palms where brittany  paris hilton and a lot of other celebs go and you can walk there the shuttle sounds like a problem but you are actually closer to the centre of the strip than some better know hotels like circus circus and the mandalay bay  there are no real down sides to the gold coast except that it isnt as up market as the strip hotels but you can still go and visit ceasers palace or balagios and with the money you have saved go and watch some of the great shows  love was my favourite   
P =>  Great Bargain off the Strip Stayed at the Gold Coast Hotel for   nights at the end of tember  I honestly have to say  this is a great bargain off the strip and I d recommend it to friends  The premium rooms are worth the extra money  We had a reservation for one of the recently renovated premium rooms  but did not get it our first night since we didn t get in until      am  They were able to get us into a premium room for the next   nights though  The standard rooms definitely need updating  but the premium rooms are awesome We ate at the breakfast buffet all   mornings  It s an incredible bargain at       which includes drink   The lunch buffet was a little dissapointing though  while the Friday night Seafood Buffet was very good  Ping Pang Pong was OK  kind of an eclectic menu   but the Noodle Exchange was very good The shuttle service was outstanding  We never waited more than    minutes for a shuttle to the strip  They actually have   shuttles    that runs back and from from Gold Coast to Bills on the Strip  and another that makes a loop to their sister property the Orleans  then Bills  then back to Gold Coast Most black jack table games were     and most were double deck  Only   shoe   deck tables  and just a couple     tables  Slots were pretty loose  We ended up making money on the slots  and my brother s spouse won      on the Wheel of Fortune slots Overall  this was a pleasant experience just off the strip  Staff were friendly  the breakfast buffet was an awesome bargain  and I d definitely stay here again  You won t get the glitz and glam of the strip  but you also don t get the hubub  and you get a great value for your money  
P =>   Gold Cost is a great value Is saying off strip an idea you have considered  If not  you might think again  Our stay at the Gold Coast in ust was great  The Gold Coast isn  t the high end glitz of the strip  but it did offer newly renovated rooms  great gambling and good food The staff at the Gold Coast is among the most friendly I have experienced  Checking in was quick and painless  I was in a remodeled room  The rooms are modest in size  but tasteful and had large flat panel TV  The only negative was the scarcity of hot water  but this was not a big issue  There was an ice machine and vending machines nearby  The walk to the elevators was a short one  There was very minor construction noise  but only during the day We ate breakfast at the Ports of Call buffet on more than one occassion  The food is good  albeit the standard fare at many Las Vegas buffets  If you have a players card  the breakfast is only about        I have to admit I was a little surprised at how inexpensive it was  Ping Pang Pong sounded so hilarious to us that we had to try it  As it turns out  the food at this restaurant is surprisingly good and quite authentic  The place was very busy for some great reasons The gift shop at the east end of the hotel is a wonderful convenience  They have a great selection of alcohol  Beer  wine and liquor are available and at better prices than I can get at home  This is a great idea for having a drink and relaxing in your room without making a special trip to a liquor store Gambling at he Gold Coast is much more affordable than the strip  There are the standard table games and a big variety of slots  Low table limits are easily found here  Some blackjack tables are as low as       per hand and there were two non smoking tables available during our stay Access to the strip is simple using the free shuttles that the hotel provides  These run about every    minutes and go to the strip or the Orleans  Cabs are easliy had and fares are very low to get to the strip Overall  the Gold Coast the best  quot bang for the buck quot  I have found to date  Suffice to say that we will be visiting there again  
P =>   Loved the Gold Coast Great hotel   The rooms were well appointed and extremely clean  The front desk staff were extremely helpful and were very professional  Check in and check out were a breeze  The hotel has a nice  clean casino and is right next door to the Palms and the Rio  Great location  It was a   minute drive to the center of the Las Vegas strip  near the Bellagio and Caesar s Palace  With ample free parking at any of the strip casinos  why stay on the strip and by double what it costs to stay at the Gold Coast  Save your money  rent a car  and use it to see the other attractions that the area has to offer  Red Rock Canyon was nice  Valley of Fire Park is a must see   
P =>  Love it We booked our airfare and hotel through Allegiant Airlines as a package deal  We knew were getting a standard room at the Gold Coast  but it was a great deal  When we arrived  which was after  PM I asked the front desk clerk if they had any complimentary room upgrades to the newly renovated premium rooms which are very nice   She indicated that there were none of those rooms available  but would we like a suite  OH BOY  it was very very nice  It had a beautiful living room with large flat panel TV  bar  mini fridge  dining table and chairs  large comfy sofa  arm chair  end table  coffee table  etc  The bedroom was in a seperate room with a door in between and a nice bathroom with granite floor and counter top area  Overall  we had no complaints at all  The buffet was average  but you can always find something to eat you like  I would stay here again in a heartbeat    Staff is friendly  
P =>  Off strip getaway I had been in Vegas several times and wanted try one of the off strip places for a change so having read about the newly refurbished rooms decided to give it a go Got a great rate for the holiday weekend and the rooms were excellent value for money  I don t know what the older rooms are like but the new ones are absolutely fine  albeit a little smaller than others I have stayed in with the remodelled bathroom having a walk in shower rather than a tub It doesn t have the choice of restaurants that some others do but will be improved by the opening of a new TGI Friday soon  Buffet was ok and very cheap The casino was ok and there were a few bars to sit in and relax with prices way lower than the hotels on strip The bowling alley was excellent with special    pitchers of beer late in the evening All in all a great experience which prompted me to extend my stay and try their sister property the Orleans  see separate review   
P =>   Nice slower paced hotel We really enjoyed our stay at the Gold Coast and would recommend it to those not into the glitz  glamour and high prices of the strip We got a renovated room  which was very nice  clean and spa like  The bathroom was spacious with a nice glass shower and large counter  The room had a modern design and flat screen TV  Would definitely recommend getting a renovated room Didn t spend much time in the casino  but they all look the same to me so I didn t see a big difference between the Gold Coast casino and those on the strip  But  big gamblers might disagree The restaurants were a pretty good value  Ate at the buffet almost daily  which had a huge selection of food and numerous desserts too  It was about    for breakfast  A TGI Friday s is opening in tember There was a shuttle that went to The Orleans and also to Bill s on the strip  It was very convenient and the waits were never longer than    minutes  usually less The hotel pool was small  but never crowded  There were usually a few sunbathers around the pool  and maybe one or two in the water  It was a nice quiet spot to relax After spending long  hot days on the strip in big crowds it was nice to come back to the Gold Coast  Would definitely stay there again  
P =>   Exceeded My Modest Expectations Just returned from a   night Sat Mon stay at the Gold Coast  I visit Las Vegas at least  x a year and usually like to stay at the luxury resorts on the Strip or the Red Rock offstrip  But a Vegas resident friend called at the last minute with concert tickets  and she offered to arrange a comped room for me at the Gold Coast to lure me to join her for the concert  I had been to the Gold Coast casino and had eaten at one of their restaurants  now closed  a few times  I wasn t impressed  But I didn t want to pay for both last minute airfare and a pricey weekend rate at any of my usual haunts  so I decided to to suck it up and take the offer  After looking at some pics and reading the reviews here  I did ask if she could try to get me one of the redesigned  quot premium quot  rooms  which she did  There was a bit of a line at check in and there were only two agents handling the lobby desk  Both were super efficient and handled the four groups ahead of me in short order  Wait time was less than   minutes  The woman who checked me in was smiling and informative as well as quick  Kudos  this is rare in the Vegas resorts I have recently visited  Those high end hotel employees should take hospitality lessons from the Gold Coast front desk clerks  As promised I was given one of the  quot new rooms quot  on the  th floor  odd number room in the x   numbered wing  facing the Palms looking south down the strip  I did look out over the rooftop equipment  but at night it was a pretty view   The room is smaller than those at the newer Vegas properties  But I give big props to the premium room designer  It is apparent that the decor budget was meager  but he she did a thoughtful job creating the illusion of space  and giving the room a peaceful  modern  feng shui feel  The carpet  window treatments  yes really   upholstery  wallpaper and furnishings are sleek and cool without being cold  Finishes on furniture and doors are dark wood on white walls with stainless steel accents  The elements of air  earth  fire and water and the balanced placement of furnishings and decoration create a serene feeling   There is a large LCD HDTV  an armoire with deep drawers and a small closet  a desk  sideboard  and two bedtables  While the materials and furniture are obviously economy brands  they are visually appealing  The bathroom that many complained about on this site has been cleverly redesigned to maximize space  A sliding panel serves as a door to the bathroom and sink area  The door that used to separate the sink area from the toilet and shower has been removed  A partially glassed   partially open shower has been installed in place of the old tub shower combo  You can still open the little window to let out steam and let some fresh air in  There is adequate counter space  although the coffee pot tray takes up some of it   Nice to have the coffeemaker  although it is one of those one cup deals    The bed was comfortable  Instead of a bedspread  a blanket is encased between two white patterned sheets  Again an inexpensive practical design choice  but the simplicity worked with the room decor  and more sanitary than those scary hotel bedspreads we ve all heard about  I think the mattress was new  The A C is an old fashioned wall type unit controlled by a digital read thermostat  but it worked well  and I like a room colder than most can handle  so that is saying something in ust in Vegas  Being in this room was pleasant and relaxing  I was by myself  and I wonder if I d have been as comfortable if someone other than a close family member was sharing it with me  I think not  It is a small room even though it doesn t look it  There are some things I d add or change  There is no full length mirror  There is no in room safe  which caused me to decline housekeeping services since I had cash  jewelry and electronics  There is no in room hotel guide showing the property s amenities  restaurants  lounges etc  and no room service  There are no usable electrical outlets by the desk or night tables  Both open outlets were on walls that required you to leave your phone recharging on the floor or the window sill above the AC  This is picky  but as nice as almost everything was in these sleek  modern new rooms  the plastic and styrofoam cups  the ugly old phone and the plastic dimestore wastebasket kind of stood out as Motel   cheap and cheesy  I enjoyed playing in the casino but it was disturbingly dead for a weekend   The breakfasts I had at the cafe on Saturday and the Sunday brunch buffet weren t too good  and dinner at the Cortez Room was disappointing  the food and service was substandard although the dining room is a nice atmosphere  The food at the Noodle Exchange was good  TGIFridays will open there soon and they do need something like that  With the exception of the staff at the Cortez  I found every other employee I came in contact with to be warm and friendly as well as efficient  including desk personnel  housekeeping  who gave me stuff even though I didn t have them clean the room   casino staff  cocktail servers  bartenders  restaurant waitstaff and security  I really enjoyed my short stay much to my surprise  While it doesn t pretend to be a luxury vacation destination  at the current rack rate of      a night on weekends  the  quot premium quot  rooms may be the best value I ve seen in today s Las Vegas   I recommend GC for the discriminating budget traveler  and if I need an inexpensive Las Vegas room  it is the first place I ll call  
P =>  Great Value The Gold Coast is great value and is really close to the strip  I don t think it was even a mile  We walked to the strip a few times  which is just about as quick as waiting for the bus etc  The bathrooms are tiny and need renovating  but who cares at the price  The room was very clean and staff were helpful  Save money on a cheap hotel and you can go out for dinner some where nice instead  
P =>  Boycott Gold Coast  I have been a     year customer and this former home away from home for me has been completely ruined by Boyd Gaming  The restaurants that I have enjoyed have all closed  All my favorite employees have left for greener pastures  I am surprised how many long time employees have all of a sudden departed  Prices have skyrocketed and are rediculous  This hotel is not worth more than     night  Management seems to have no clue what is going on especially in this depressed economy  Forget it  You ll never see me again  I might as well stay on the Strip  prices are the same and all the great Gold Coast employees are working there anyway  
P =>  Gold Coast is only OK This is really a hotel for the older set  The rooms were pretty good  but nothing to brag about  The worst thing here is the on site restaurant  If you ate anything by the steak or prime rib special the food was mediocre at best  Fried chicken tasted like Banquet frozen chicken  People were nice and friendly  but I think I will stay elsewhere next visit  
P =>   Could be better On our four previous visits we have stayed at the Gold Coasts Sister hotel  the Orleans In comparison to the Orleans  the Gold coast in just not in the same league  The rooms are no where near as luxurious or as well maintained  The hotel is in the process of being upgraded  that is not much comfort when you have paid for a room that has not yet been upgraded  That said  the room was clean and comfortable  the buffet extensive and reasonably priced However  the staff are friendly and helpful  especially the bell hops and valet car parkers We booked our room at the last minute  so all in all  it wasn t a bad deal  
P =>  ent Budget Hotel I always try to do my homework on hotels  Trip advisor is my bible  Anyway as always we were on a budget and so I wanted best that my limited cash could buy This hotel is very near strip and major casino s  No more than     for cab and that includes tip  If you want to take your life in your hands you could spend    minutes walking     The rooms were very clean and the beds were massive and comfy  The bathrooms were tiny BUT my argument is this   hotels tend to be more of a base  somewhere to sleep and so as long as it is clean and comfy does anything else like size of tv or bathroom really matter For a budget this hotel ticked most of the boxes  as we spent alot of our time on the Strip There is a tidy and pleasant pool area The Chinese restuarant gets good reviews and we had no complaints In Summer of this year a TGI Fridays will be opening in the Hotel You really do  in my opinion  get what you pay for Budget hotel  budget facilities The food in the buffet area is cheap and plentiful BUT as I said you get what you pay for For breakfast you pay only        Go to Wynn or Bellagio and pay     for breakfast and you can tell you are in a better class standard eating establishment     BUT the food in buffet at Gold Coast was adequate I have   complaints  one   was the  quot cafe quot  next to the buffet was really sub standard    I cannot justify the rubbish service and food by saying you get what you pay for  Our only experience was shocking and when I spoke to the food and beverage manager  I was asked what I wanted him to do about it    I ordered a Prime Rib meal and the prime rib was cold not cool or luke warm COLD         I will not bore you with details     BUT if you can afford to eat elsewhere then do so  Try Rio next door they seemed to have more choice   andComplaint     things at Gold Coast seemed to close a little sooner than I would have thought necessary    ie  the Buffet closed at  pm  The  quot cafe quot  closed at   pm  The coffee shop closed around       pm  BUT at Rio things seemed to stay open longer    Over all though if you want cheap and cheerful then the Gold Coast is ok Having said that     having looked round Vegas   we would in future pay a few extra dollars to stay closer to the Strip  
P =>   Good Value Great location  I like the Rio hotel and this is right next door  The room was a decent size  but the bathroom was very small  The sink was next to the closet area and then there was a separate room for the shower and toilet  It was hard to close the door while standing in the bathroom  The TV was nice  a new flat screen  We stayed on the  rd floor and had a view of a wall  but we weren t in the room much so it didn t matter  The bed could be more comfortable  Staff were nice  They give you a coupon booklet when you check in so you get free slot play  free table play  free drinks  and free ice cream  We didn t eat at the hotel so I m not sure how the food is  Overall great experience  Very good value  
P =>  What a deal  What can I say that hasn t already been said  on the positive side  that is  I had to be in Las Vegas on business and chose the Gold Coast based on the favorable reviews and a mid week special on their website      standard room  the rate jumped to over      the next day    I wasn t expecting much but hoped for basic cleanliness  otherwise  checking out the next day would be no problem  Self parking and check in was quick and courteous  Two choices were given   a room with a view of the Strip but down the hall from the elevator   or  no view but close to the elevator   A room with a view was chosen and it was as advertised  however  it was about     steps from the elevator  You don t want to have left something in the room after you ve reached the elevator  nor do you want to wait too long to head to the room for a bathroom break  The long trek down the hall allows one to see that the carpet is kept impeccably vacuumed  and in fact  the room was also immaculate  It was on the small size but quite adequate with a flatscreen TV  coffeemaker  etc  The strong water pressure in the shower was reminescent of the old days  and there is a small window which allows direct ventilation to the outside   excellent   Unfortunately  the internet connection in the room didn t work  and the house electrician said that it does not work in many of the rooms  Uh huh  maybe they wanted us downstairs in the Casino   The Ping Pang Pong Chinese restaurant was always very busy  The food portions were large  looked delicious and authentic but what we had lacked flavor and tasted bland  It could have been the choices  but patrons seemed to be packing up more than they were eating  and I suspect it was to doctor it up at home  The Monterey Room  with a coffee shop atmosphere  was pricier than warranted  Definitely the best bet was the Ports o  Call Buffet  It had the best offerings  flavor  variety and value  and breakfast  lunch and dinner did not disappoint When we returned two weeks later  it was basically the same experience   excellent room rate and accommodations  courteous check in  hotel cleanliness  etc  However  this time we chose a room with no view  near the elevator  
P =>   Love the Gold Coast We stayed here a few nights on our way back to Florida from Orange County  CA and enjoyed every minute  My wife plays the slots and had a great time  I like Texas Hold em and enjoyed the play at their tables  The room was large  clean and quiet  staff was very friendly and helpful  and breakfast in the their coffee shop was excellant  
P =>  Great Place to Stay We have stayed at the Gold Coast Casino two times  We enjoyed our stay so much in ch       that we came again il       We enjoy the small hotel feeling  and great hotel rates  Although it has over     rooms  it is much smaller than the hotels on the Las Vegas strip  It is has reasonably priced restaurants  a nice pool  and fitness area  The rooms are very nice and clean  The bathroom is small  but other than that it was great  There is a free shuttle to and from the middle of the Las Vegas strip about every       minutes  We would stay here again  
P =>  Grreat Value My wife and I spent a great   days at the Gold Coast  We got    quot Mustang Mike quot  specials which gave us   weekday nights with   dinner buffet and   breakfast buffets included in a      price for the   days  So for      we had   dinner buffets and four breakfast buffets and   nights stay   tax included  Try as I might i couldn t top this deal  The rooms were nice and newly renovated  the buffets were ok but nothing special  and the casino was busy but i never had a problem getting on my video poker machine that was full payout  We also ate at the Monterey Room where we got a    oz  steak with a salad  potatoes and baked beans with a beer for        The shuttle to the strip was timely and we used this for the trips to the strip  This was our third time in Vegas and our second time at the Gold Coast  we wouldn t hesitate to go back again  
P =>  Wonderful hotel   We stayed at the Orleans last year  which was great  and received promotions for Gold Coast and Orleans  Gold Coast was the better deal although we loved staying at Orleans  Be sure to sign up for their Players card  The room was very nice  I like having the sink outside the room with the commode Their buffet was excellent  We had breakfast there every day and a couple of dinners  You get    off just for being a member of their Players club Didn t do well in the casino though  We only play the slots and rarely won After booking with the hotel s website  I checked back and noticed that their regular prices had dropped below my  quot discounted quot  price  I called them up and a very nice person said she would be happy to reduce our room rate Best deal in Las Vegas  
P =>   Out of the way value If you don t want to be on the Las Vegas strip amid all of the traffic  noise  and chaos  this hotel just might fill the bill  With complimentary shuttle bus service to the Strip throughout the day  Las Vegas Avenue is just    minutes away The rooms are clean and neat  but nothing fancy  though there is a    quot  flat screen TV  The bathroom is dark with a taupe colored tub surround and toilet and dim lighting   and the tub was very slow to drain  But the shower pressure was terrific  The best values are the buffet meals in the Ports O  Call restaurant  The prices are very reasonable  and the quality and varieties of food are very good  At lunch and dinner there are various ethnic choices along with American  quot meat and potatoes quot  types of foods  There are abundant dessert choices The pool and hot tub were well kept and surrounded by lounge chairs  The attendent was generous with extra towels While the casino isn t as glitzy as those on the Strip  there are plenty of penny and nickel slots as well as the other types of slots and table games  
P =>   Great    For the price  it was a great excellent hotel  The rooms were large and clean  The flat screen TV is great  It is easy to get in and out of the casino from the close by parking lot  It is   min walk to Rio or the Palms  It should be higher rated on this website  Yes  the bathroom is small but not smaller than the one at Bill s Gamblin Hall  I would say that room is cleaner and better than the ones at Bill s  The only negative is that on the second floor  there is some vomit smell in the hallway  I wish that they can change the carpet Otherwise  I would go back and get cozy in this hotel casino again  
P =>   Worth The Stay The Gold Coast is about   miles off the strip but they have a shuttle that will take you to the strip  amp  drop you off at Bill s Casino  The shuttle runs about every    min  The Gold Coast is not a high end hotel  I would say it compares to your average Comfort Inn so if you are looking for something fancier you probably don t want to stay at the Gold Coast  We were very happy with our stay  It is clean  amp  the staff is friendly  amp  helpful  The Ports O Call restaurant has a buffet breakfast that is good  Sign up for the Gold Coast Club card when you get there for       off breakfast plus other discounts  
P =>   Very nice budget stay Our stay at the Gold Coast was Saturday ch  th   Tuesday ch   th  In total we paid about         for the   nights  There was a very large          person  convention in town  so the strip hotel room rates were unbearable  We had room       with a view of the Palms across the street  Odd number rooms have a South view towards the Palms  and even number rooms look North towards downtown We stayed in a smoking room  my buddy hasn t kicked the habit   but overall the smell wasn t too bad  Our room had two double beds  nice  but not luxurious   a flat screen TV  a   drawer chest  a small round dining table  and two nice sitting chairs  The A C worked like a charm The bathroom was functional  but small  I do like that the vanity area is separate from the toilet and tub area  Plenty of room  and plenty of hangers for your clothes  The bathroom amenities included  lots of towels  shampoo  conditioner  lotion  shower cap  bath soap and facial soap  The tub had a little window that opened to the outside for ventilation  The shower pressure and temperature were superb We drove a rental car during out stay and found the parking deck very easy to use and convenient  Check in and out was very  very easy with no wait whatsoever  We didn t use the hotel shuttle We dined twice at the buffet  which was OK  but not spectacular  The price was terrific  so keep that in mind  The casino was rather large and well lite  The ceiling was somewhat low  except for a two story ceiling over the table games  I didn t find the casino especially smokey  and I m sensitive We walked  easily  to the Palms and to the Rio to check them out and to eat at their buffets  Both are somewhat better  and more expensive that at the Gold Coast  I would stay at the Gold Coast again  if room rates at the better hotels are sky high  I always have a car  so staying off strip isn t a big deal for me  If you want a nice  safe place to sleep and you would consider staying off strip  keep the Gold Coast in mind Contact me with any questions at rmw     hotmail com  
P =>  This was a good hotel choice for us We wanted to stay off strip this trip  so we decided to stay at the Gold Coast since we had a great room offer from the hotel The first night there were some people in the hall and in rooms on both sides of us who were having an argument and when I called the hotel desk  security was sent up immediately to deal with the problem The room was large  and we had a great panoramic view to the north that included downtown  part of the strip  and the mountains There was an iron and ironing board  table with   chairs  large dresser  two night stands  and a nice kind sized bed  The most interesting part of the room was a little window in the shower that could be opened to let the steam out of the room   great idea  There was also a coffee maker  made one cup at a time   and we enjoyed a cup while getting ready in the morning We have been to the casino and buffet before  and we enjoy the variety and number of table games  slots  and video poker  There is also a BINGO room  and we didn t have time to visit but met another customer who had just won           on a cover all game We also walked over to the Rio which was conveniently located across the street to the east  and there is also a shuttle that runs to the strip from the Rio and one that runs from the Gold Coast to the Orleans For those on a budget or not wanting a large strip hotel  this is a good property to consider  
P =>   Good Stay  We stayed at the GC  return trip  for three nights and had no real problems  The first room smelled like smoke on a non smoking floor so I called down to the desk and a key for another room was in our hands within a few minutes  We had a view of the parking lot   but don t stay in Vegas for the view  o The room was clean and well laid out   except for the toilet bathroom door issue  If you stay here just remember to close the door before you sit LOL I like having the vanity area outside of the bathroom The only problem we had was the phone rang very early several times for two mornings     and no one there  Kind of left us wondering if housekeeping was trying to wake us up to get us moving     I don t want to get up early in Vegas    who does Front desk said they would shut of the incoming ringer but that did not happen Ate in the Cortez Room one night   mediocre at best   the staff acted like we were an inconvenience to them by the mere fact we ate there We will stay there again because I like a room that has windows that open and that is rare in Sin City  
P =>  Was ok I stayed in Gold coast with my tour  It is good hotel off the strip with good shuttle service to the strip every    mins till midnight The room was clean and i had good view at  th floor  I heard from other friends on my tour that restaurant food was good value specially for vegas   I was out most of time and i found the bed comfortable It is grt hotel if you want to stay away from the strip I went to Rio voodoo bar and show which is opposite GC  
P =>   Pleasant stay Stayed at the Gold Coast for   nights  We like the nice small property off strip  Had some guests pound on the door at   AM the first night and requested a room floor change so we could avoid that happening a second time and we were moved promptly  The room was clean  left a tip daily  No issues with hotel casino employees  just general public  Used the shuttle to the strip several times and never had problems  Overall the slots seemed a bit looser than last visit  won a little here and there  but I can t quit my day job  We will return to this hotel in the future  
P =>  An Okay Stay This is a convenient location without staying on the strip  The room was clean and comfortable  There was a great band that was there during our stay and the casino was good  There are several restaurants and my husband loved the   oz steak special in the Monterey Room  The only two compaints really is one that alot of the staff doesn t speak english well and two we were continually bombarded with servers telling us  quot     quot  before we even sat down at a table  Even when paying seperate checks our group could not sit together at the buffet because of this  quot     quot   Absolutely nuts    These people must get continually stiffed on tips  They would have gotten more than the  quot     quot  that we were continaully told had they just kept their mouths shut and provided us with the service that we should have gotten  
P =>  Superbowl Weekend at the Gold Coast Checked in on Saturday   at noon we were able to get into a king smoking room  Good start   The room was on the ninth floor near to the elevators and the ice machine   generally a bonus  although there were a couple of times I could hear someone getting ice in the wee hours of the morning The room was spacious and clean  the bathroom as others have said  tiny  Some bright soul had tried to put cigarettetes out on the tub   so there were burn marks on it  not the hotels fault  The dealers were friendly  as were the bartenders and poker room staff  Housekeeping was very prompt  we had made a request for extra pillows and had them within    minutes  We put the  quot please make up the room sign quot  and the room was done less than an hour later The shuttle drivers were very friendly   and the service itself great  We asked for a late check out  and the front desk was very accomodating Food choices were average  the sunday brunch at the buffet a pleasant surprise  the       T Bone special at the coffee shop   a good value  The other things we got there   a little below averageAll in all a good stay  we will be back  The value over superbowl weekend      for   nights including saturday  could not be beat 
P =>   Better then the Strip   Loved the Gold Coast  clean rooms  nice comfortable beds     inch LCD tv s  great shower  although bathrooms on the small side   fast elevators  friendly staff  reasonable rates and excellent food   This was a stag trip  myself and three friends to visit the concrete convention  We arrived in the a m  and were able to check in early which would be unusual on the strip  The GC is a fun casino for gambling  unlike the cold lifeless monoliths lining Las Vegas Blvd    So far as food  I advise everyone to try the Arriva at the GC which serves Italian fare  also the Cortez room steaks are half the price of those on the strip and just as good  The GC buffet is one of the best values in Vegas  get a players card and get a discount   The Monterey Room  their    hr  dinner  serves an early bird breakfast special which is dirt cheap  they also offer a        Texas T bone special       You get a    oz  T bone  potato  onion rings  salad  cowboy beans  and a glass of beer   Downtown hotels and the  quot locals quot  hotel casinos in Vegas such as the Coast  amp  Station properties are gaining in popularity among those who realize the strip has become a tourists trap  Think about it  the mega resorts on the strip are more or less owned by two major corporations today  What choice do you have if you think the games are  quot tight quot  and the food prices are too high at a certain strip property  Do you go next door  Hah  More then likely the hotel next door is owned by the same corporation   I can remember when the strip used to have great deals on rooms  gambling  and food  but no more  Unless you re willing to play dollar slots and     tables you don t get diddly for comps  The strip is over priced and filled to capacity with  quot   somethings quot  who are willing to pay outrageous prices for meals and play at games and machines with terrible payback odds  I couldn t believe the number of suckers playing     blackjack and video poker with pay tables almost half what they used to be   After a day of visiting the strip with my friends I couldn t wait to get back to the GC where the food was reasonable  the dealers friendly  the cocktail service fast  and gaming the way it should be in Vegas  
P =>   Value for Money As we were here over New Years the accommodation was very expensive on the strip so we decided to stay at the Gold Coast at half the price of the strip  I think we paid approx     US for the week  some of the strip hotels were            for the week  Check In staff were very pleasant  Had doubled up on our booking as they went onto a new system or something but no dramas at all  she apologised and fixed it up  They ask if you want to sign up for a reward cards  I said yep sure did  They were issued right away  They are free  use them every time you gamble  Also charge everything back to your room for extra points  On check out they check how many points you have  we were not huge gamblers  and they reduced one of our rooms by     and the other       So for something that cost us nothing it was worth it  Must warn you though  check out did take ages while she phoned tables as well as slots  Room had   double beds  a plasma TV  bathroom  table and chairs  the normal type of hotel room  They were very clean  Not modern but I wouldn t say mega old either  I am pretty fussy at times and I thought they were fine for what we paid  Bathroom was small but the sink is outside of the shower  amp  toilet  You can t swing a cat in the toilet shower but hey you are only there to do one thing  The room was big I thought  Bed very comfortable  Lots of towels  Hairdryer was awesome  Iron  everything you needed  Hallways are very long and we were very far away from the elevators  Late at night sometimes I felt a big scared to go and fill up the ice bucket when I was alone  I would go to bed earlier than the others  that s the only thing I would put as a negative  They had security on the door to the room elevators but not all night  They would leave around   am  am  The casino had a great feel about it  Very homely  We could always find each other  The tables and slots are low limits  More  cent slots then the higher ones  Always was able to get on the slots you wanted  Very easy to get around  never got lost  Staff friendly and the cocktail waitresses were always around  You could always order drinks  The crowd out there are older style  We were always happy to come home  They have a free shuttle that runs till      am  Runs every    mins to the strip and Orleans  There are   shuttles  one to the strip and one to the Orleans  Only once we didn t get on the shuttle and had to wait for it to return  that was NYE or day after  I can t remember  We found allot of people were parking at the Gold Coast and then getting the free shuttle  Not at anytime were people checked for room keys  I think over busy times they should do this to make sure guests get on first  But generally no problems at all  One night at   am the shuttle was full  they said don t worry we will send another shuttle for the last of the people so they don t leave you stranded on the strip if the last shuttle is full  We tipped    per person  We did not do this every time but generally once a day  One day we were running to the shuttle and the driver saw us so he waited  We tipped him twice that night  They drop and pick you up from outside Bills Gamblin Casino  We got a taxi home from the Luxor one night and it was only     so if you do miss the shuttle it s not that much Overall I am glad we stayed and experienced the Gold Coast  It s also nice to stay on the strip but if you are on a budget  stay here or if in our case the strip was high during that week the GC is an excellent alternative  We moved onto the strip on the  st once the crowds left and the prices dropped  
P =>   Met Expectations Good   gt  Great deal for the money  gt  Comfortable bed and clean interiors Bad   gt  Tiniest bathroom that I had ever seen  gt  Plumbing not so great either  gt  Distance from the strip      mi  My husband and I did not want to spend a great deal of money on the stay in Las Vegas  as we figured we would only use the room for a good night s slumber  Gold Coast fits the bill perfectly  Clean interiors and plush bed  oh throw in a flat screen TV as well and you have a great place to get some sleep before another late nighter  On the downside the bathrooms were very tiny  The sink wash area is located outside and the shower etc  inside  The plumbing was not good either  It didn t really affect us much  But if you like your bathroom and love to have a luxurious shower this is the last place you would want to be in  Another factor is the distance from strip  though     mile seems walkable it is right across I     so you wouldn t want to be doing that esp in the night and in winter  A cab ride to the strip costs you about     each time  An imp factor to consider if you chose this hotel for its low price in the first place and don t intend to spend it on cabs   We had rented a car for the whole week so it wasn t really a factor for us    Overall an economical and practical stay and a good value for money  
P =>  Friendly staff and really good meals We stayed   th to  th  Check in was a breeze and we received   fun book  coupon books  There were several free drink coupons which was nice  probably the only thing we used but it beat paying the    a drink  I always tipped    a drink since it was free and the bartenders friendly  There were probably     asians at the Gold coast  It never bothered us as whites but sometimes felt out of place  The rooms were very clean and the beds were okay  the pillows could definitely be better   The shuttle bus was great and we never had to wait more than    minutes  We ate at the MOnteray   hr restaurant a couple times and it was basic but lots of food and friendly service  The El Cortez was fantastic  really enjoyed it after a full day walking the strip  My hubby wanted prime rib and he got a huge piece of meat for         plus the extras  I had a chicken ceasar salad which was perfect  The wine was very reasonable and the atmosphere comfortable  One night we ate at the PIng Pong and it was also great  lots of food for a very reasonable cost and friendly service  no ambiance  as it sits on the edge of the casino but food great  We enjoyed our stay at Gold Coast and would definitely return  Across the street is the Rio which is a new hotel and across the other way is the Palms  so there is lots to explore in the area  
P =>   Ironing with a Bungy HAVE A LAUGH   I needed an iron and ironing board and was I glad to see both in the closet  after almost   weeks travelling having used a laundrette in Williams I needed to iron some stuff   I set them up and was astonished to see that the iron was attached to the iron rest on a bungy rope  Trying to reach the end of my trousers with the iron was a sight to see    talk about tug of war  Still I can understand the reasons why such items are security tagged  I will stick to just popping the shower cap in my wash bag  no room for an iron  POSITIVE POSITIVES   This hotel off the strip is lovely  bowling alley  bingo   USA style  friendly staff and fellow residents  courtesy bus to BILLS on the strip  Put    dollars in a bar poker machine for a comp drink   for all you UK Euro non knowers  like me   and bobs your uncle     make sure you leave a tip in the slim jim   at least a   NIGGLY NEGATIVES   the bell hop told us wrong on first day for the courtesy bus pick up from the strip  had to take hire car back to the strip so didn t take hotel bus there   ended up having to take a taxi back from the Flamingo     Hotel  He owes us      Don t leave your coffee compliment on the comfort tray  if you have used only the sugar it will appear full  shove it in a drawer otherwise it won t get replenished  
P =>   Fair option for CES trade show CES is probably the biggest trade show in Vegas so all the hotel rooms jump in price in preparation for the crowds  I booked this for      p n  but was considering the motel of Emerald Suites a mile away as I m not bothered by the frills Anyway  this hotel is for older folks  but service is pretty good  except for one incompetent guy at the Bell Desk  The valet and front desk were prompt and efficient  I didn t gamble  or use room service  which I heard takes an hour at times   but the restaurant diner was fairly good  The waitress we got was very nice to my Indian colleague and his wife My room was surprisingly spacious  I was also surprised that there were just cotton sheets on my bed  not tucked in and no bedspread  Looked like someone was interrupted before they finished my room  The bathroom was fine  but no extraction fan so it got steamy  There s a pool and a shuttle to Bill s Gambing Hall on the Strip opposite the Bellagio which leaves every   mins so you re as good as on the Strip Summary  not the chic est hotel  not the best location  but a good option close to the strip and it has a pool  
P => 	  New Year   Hogmany in Las Vegas        EXCELLENCE We read a number of reviews after making the booking to visit LV for their NYE celebrations and although having been to LV many times before  the idea of a sea of bodies on The Strip did not fill me with enthusiasm  Also  as we were paying for our family of   adults we were budget concous and opted for the Gold Coast  Again  the reviews on the Gold Coast were fairly mixed  and we tended to have stuck to the Flamingo and Golden Nugget on all previous trips  as we knew what to expect at these hotels  So here is our take on the Gold Coast Despite having booked and paid   months in advance  I did not get a smoking room as requested on arrival  But did get moved to a Strip View smoking room the following day ROOMS  for the money paid  we had no complaints  Not as flash as the Flamingo  but clean and tidy  Large LCD TVs in every room was great  Room service was fast and cheap  and the food was great Bathrooms were spotless but are basic and were in need of renovation Good news   all rooms are being renovated during      as part of a multi million Dollar programme of refurbishment in the Sam Boyd chain of hotels RESTAURANTS  we ate in the cafes and the steak house and I must admit the buffet breakfasts and the Sunday Brunch was equal to any other hotels on the Strip    different food areas  covering  American  Chinese  Mexican  Italian  Meat carvery  Dessert cakes  salad etc Sunday Brunch is a must and many LV regulars still visit the Gold Coast for the     all you can eat buffet  Great carvery included The Cortez Room  Steak house  was like stepping back in time to an old Wild West scene  Plush leather and well oiled wood tables  Lets hope they don t change the decor in this restaurant The steaks were good value appx          for fillets and        for NY strip or ribeye  One of the best steaks I have had in Vegas for the money CASINO  This place is designed around gamblers or sports gamers  Big book hall and great selection of table games including their own versions of Texas Hold Em and Blackjack  both of which took some getting use to  but enjoyable once you cottoned on to the game Roulette was as low as    min  e g    x    dollar chips min   or there were other higher table stakes e g      amp      Cocktail waitresses were really quick and for the first time I can recall  I had never managed to finish a drink before she came back for more orders  even during the busiest periods Lots of       amp     cent machines  so event the reluctant gambler can have a flutter without worrying too much about spending too much   gt   High Stake slots also available at      a hit  so something for everyone at their casino Lots of  linked up  slots with high jackpot games  I had some fantastic luck with some of the slots  and returned to them time and time again    my highest payout was      on a    cent machine WEATHER  we were lucky with the weather and only one day we had to wear tops during the day as the wind chill was quite nippy  You definitely need a fleece at night if you are out and about  Still warm in direct sunlight  but chilly in the shade during the day TRANSPORT  ever changing in Vegas  the transport system remains hit n  miss  Best bet is to buy a day VEGAS COM trolly monorail ticket for      which gives you unlimited transportation up and down the strip as well as the malls  But the regularity of the buses trollies leaves a lot to be desired  We ended up renting a car     NYE PARTY Based on previous reviews of the strip on NYE  we decided to eat at the Gold Goast and purchased tickets for their      NYE Gala Show  We were a bit desperate to ensure we managed to buy tickets for the Gold Coast  but the tickets did not go on sale until   but Teresa in the back office kindly reserved our tickets ahead of the public offering   so great service from staff For     a head  we got an open bar all night  seafood bar  oysters  amp  giant shrimp  crayfish etc  a continious buffet including carvery  sweets that were out of this world  giant chocolate fountain  free champagne  party favours etc  but best of all was the Rat Pack playing  The Rat Pack cost      if you were to buy a ticket to see them at their normal venue  so this package was real value for money  They had set up   giant screens in the ballroom  but we opted to go outside to the rooftop area of the Gold Coast car park to watch the firework display and bring in the New Year  and taking all our drinks outside to toast in the NY was not a problem The fireworks was spectacular  and the only downside was that   sets of displays were hidden from view by the Rio Hotel  but we still managed to eyeball all the others on the strip I wore my full highland kilt outfit and this was well recieved by all Americans  and Scots  during the night  but a number of people did ask  where are you from   and my reply after the hundredth time was usually China Would we stay at the Gold Coast again The pool is quite small and the deck area restricted  so as we are pool lovers  I wouldn t stay at the Gold Coast during a high summer break  but definitely out of season and definitely at Xmas  amp  NYE I believe that Vegas gives you what you pay for   therefore  if you want a quality budget holiday then Gold Coast  amp  Orelans or Sam s Town is ideal  If you want more up market  then aim for Flamingo  Golden Nugget or top end  the Bellagio  MGM or NY NY  
P =>   Heee ha all the cowboys came here  We had a chance to go to Vegas for free and use our points on the airlines so off to the city of lights and action  the week was the Rodeo and our place the Gold Coast and the Mirage were hosting the cowboys and cowgirls and they were also raising money for cancer  by wearing the pink shirts We enjoyed the resturant for breakfast as the food and the persoanl were great  Seeing all the wild west guys and gals made it a treat  They are the neatest looking people with the hats and belts and real nice shirts  The gambling at this hotel is also fair and we earned alot of points while gambling the slots Clean and its very much a local place  
P =>  good bargain This is not your upscale hotel  however the services are adequate if you do not want luxury  We stayed for    days and my complaints are only minor  The lighting in the very small shower area is very poor  I took showers in the dark  And if you get a room low in the hotel that faces the south  you will have a view of a wall  I liked staying off of the strip  We used the shuttle several times a day and were very happy with that serviceIf I were to return to Las Vegas  I wouldn t hesitate to use the Gold Coast  
P =>   Nice and cheap We stayed at the gold coast for   days in september    when arriving from Norway after a    hour journey  Quick check in and nice room  Excellent and cheap buffet restaurant  It s a gambling hotel but quiet rooms and good service at the buffet  Shuttle bus every    min to The Strip  Problems with the water was fixed in a few minutes  Recommended   len and Erik from Norway  
P =>   Great value    needs a deadbolt on the door Stayed one night at the Gold Coast after three nights at The Mandalay Bay  I couldn t get a flight out   My rate was     so for that rate you can t complain  The bed was comfy but the   pillows on the King bed were very flat  Lots of hot water but the sink and shower area were tiny  My only complaint is the door did not have a dead bolt lock on it  Just the hook thing that you push over that if someone opens the door they can t get all the way in  I did not feel too secure  You could hear noise in the hallway too Casino was very good  Great watiress service and pretty friendly dealers  Check in and check out was a breeze  There is also a great ice cream place in the lobby that is a good value There is also a walkway to the Rio and the Palms is across the street  Like I said for     for the night it beats hanging out in the casino all night waiting for my very early flight the next morning  
P =>   We ll be back  Stayed at the Gold Coast Hotel and Casino for a combination business pleasure trip  Here s a few thoughts     Great Staff    We straggled into the place at midnight due to cancelled flights and rebookings  The front desk supervisor  e Willey    took a look at us and without us asking  upgraded us to a suite for our four night stay  Thanks      The Room   Okay   Needless to say  the suite was nice  Lots of room   clean   and a decent view of the city  Two bedrooms and a couple of TV s were also nice too    Gambling was good  This was an off strip property and we noticed lots more people here gambling than at the strip hotels  Low limit table games and after a bit of time we found the low denomination slot games that gave us lots of action   The food   Ping Pang Pong   Authentic Chinese  Perhaps a little too authentic for those of us not immersed in the culture and food Ports of Call Buffet   ent food   good price   what else do you want Monterey Room   Good coffee shop withs solid  middle of the road food for good prices    ConvenienceThe Palms and The Rio are adjacent to this hotel and an easy enough walk  There are also free shuttles to the strip and to the Orleans  We found good gaming at The Orleans and it looks like a good property that might be worth staying at    SummaryHave never stayed off strip before  The Gold Coast is not a   star property and doesn t pretend to be  However  if you are looking for a decent room and good casino with convenient connections   this is an excellent choice  I would definitely stay here again  
P =>   Great Value Hotel This hotel would be hard to beat for value  We love this place  It s clean and affordable with a really good funbook given to you at check in  Exercise room is the best we ve experienced  Casino is well lit  not to dark  Drink service is fast and frequent with table limits set where we can afford them  We always rent a car to get to the strip and surrounding area but there s a shuttle service available to get you to strip as well  It s free and runs frequently  Rooms are always clean and have everything you need  Hotel is located across the street from the Palms and Rio hotels so you re not all alone and more fun can be had by simply walking across the street  Yes  there are fancier hotels on the strip but they cost a lot more to stay and play at  And we ve stayed at some where the rooms are not as clean or the staff as friendly  This hotel hasn t failed us yet  If you love great value this is a perfect choice  
P =>   Value for Money My stay at this hotel was generally pleasant  The housekeepers are not all very detailed but the room was cleaned daily  The bathrooms are very very small  If you are on the heavy side  you may want to consider another hotel  Food at this hotel was very good  the Italian Restaurant and the buffet were also very good Would recommend it  and Will stay there on next trip next year  
P =>   Our room was Awesome  My wife and I loved the Gold Coast  Their was plenty of free parking in the ramp  Our rental was shaded from the sun all the time  Security patrols the ramp  There was no line when we checked in Friday afternoon     th  We upgraded to a King Suite on the top floor    th floor  when we checked in and the service personnel were all super friendly  Our room was Awesome  There was a huge bedroom with a comfortable king sized bed and large armoir with plasma tv  granite and marble throughout the kitchenette area and bathroom  camelback sofa and carved armchair in the living room that also had a plasma tv  There was even a small    quot  TV in the kitchenette  I loved that little window in the shower  I could see the Rio and Treasure Island when I opened the window while I showered  Sure  the casino is smokey  and it took some getting use to because Minnesota has pretty much outlawed smoking in public places  Drink service for the whole casino was quick and efficient  Cocktail waitresses circulate everywhere  including the slots and Keno lounge  We ate in the Monterey Room twice  Once for the Graveyard special        for a complete breakfast after midnight  and once for the        T bone special  We received excellent service both times and enjoyed the food  The Fun Book you receive at registration has several good coupons  Gold Coast has very nice gift shop   liquor store with reasonable prices  This is definitely a casino for low rollers  as there were    chips    minimum roulette tables and    minimum black jack tables  They were always full  so Gold Coast is popular with the locals and out of towners alike  We stayed on the strip the last time we went to Vegas  Staying off strip was better  There was nobody pushing escort service cards in our face  no one selling time shares or show tickets  We took the free shuttle to the strip Friday and walked from the Paris up to the Wynn stopping at all of the casinos on the east side of the strip  That was all we needed  Saturday night we took the other free shuttle to the Orleans  We really enjoyed ourselves at the Orleans  We walked to the Rio for breakfast on Saturday morning and checked out the Palms across the street on Saturday night  The Rio was nice  but the Palms was a little too swanky for our tastes  The Gold Coast had no surprises at check out  We did the express check out and our bill was        
P =>   Loved The Hotel Well folks this Hotel was fabulous  great friendly staff  very clean  absolute lush room with a LCD Screen TV Set  great location not too far from the strip  and FREE SHUTTLE BUS to and fro the hotel to the strip and back again whatever time you wish to get back  this hotel was unique  opposite palms hotel which is the playboy bunny  on flamingo road  if you walked to the strip it would take you less than    minutes  with the shuttle less than    from your hotel room depending where you are at  we could see the Stratosphere tower  great gift shop  the restaurent was good too  very cheap aswell  the slots were good  seattle coffee shop there too  you wont find a better hotel from the strip as this     
P =>   Gold Coast met my needs I spent two nights at the Gold Coast  I found it to serve all my needs and met my expectations for a     hotel in Las Vegas  Check in staff  Gaming Staff  Room Staff and Valet staff were all friendly and accommodating  The room was clean and I wasn t expecting a  quot view quot   The buffet is as good as anything I ever found on the strip  I don t believe you can find a better hotel for the price anywhere in Vegas  Those who give this hotel poor ratings are either very hard to please or are expecting too much from Las Vegas  I would call this a  quot blue collar quot  hotel  My kind of place  
P =>  A smell of smoke    I spent only one night at the Gold coast Hotel  having booked a double queen room a week in advance at       plus tax   without breakfast  The hotel is easy to be found from the highway and the parking is free in the premises When I checked in I had a lot of troubles  and the staff did not help me in solving them  at first  they gave me a room having been booked for three nights instead of one  and charged me the correspondent amount  four times higher than I expected   Then  even if I had a reservation for a non smoking room  the staff gave me one having a strongly smelt of smoke  moreover  bathroom fittings were here and there burnt  and there were several ashtrays  Also  the staff did not give me an alternative room after I complained it In terms of cleanliness  the room was OK but not excellent  Furnitures were a little old  but more or less suitable for their aim  The corridor  however  was not so clean and surprisingly without any control at the entrance  since the gate was in the casino area  open to external people  it did not seem a good think in terms of security The casino area was unappealing  By chance  the hotel offered a free shuttle to the Central Strip of Las Vegas  but I waited about    minutes instead of    minutes as declared  
P =>   Gold Coast   Average We stayed at Gold Coast for   night  Saturday night  since the prices sky rocket on the strip  I agree with the most of the previous reviews  the rooms are very basic except for the flat screen TV  The bathroom is tiny  ridiculously tiny  It was reasonably priced and we were able to get a good night s sleep  The front desk staff was friendly  There was no security at the elevators most of the time  so anyone could get to the rooms  The room did not have a chain guard or bar guard on the door  It was nice to be able to walk to The Rio and The Palms  We ate in the diner  it was ok  We bought drinks at the bar  my cosmopolitan was expensive and served in a funky  very small  glass  We did not really care for the atmosphere of the Gold Coast casino and I am not sure I would stay there again  
P =>   Great Value We stay somewhere different every time we visit Las Vegas  This place is great  Rooms are very reasonable and basic in size  Was very clean  Good eating establishments  Check in staff a little rude rushed  Other staff very accomodating  Pool is very nice and quiet  
P =>   Loved It  I am in LV every six months but this was my first stay at Gold Coast  I loved it   So relaxing  I just don t like the crowded noisy strip anymore  Employees were all friendly and helpful  The shuttle is great  just don t try to get back from the strip around     PM  too many people waiting  and there is no order  just pushing and shoving in the HOT sun  The walk to the RIO and the Palms was very easy  There is a small store behind the casino that you can get water and other supplies  open  am  pm  The gift shop has liquor prices way below those at home  Our room was fine  clean and we had a nice view of the north strip from the  th floor  The elevators were fast and never had to wait  If you want to relax  gamble  and not get shoved around this is the place to be  The best part  we were not approached by time share people once in   days at the Gold Coast  This is our new home in LV  
P =>  Great clean freindly place Stayed   nights  Did just about everything  Bowled  swam  ate  and gambled here  everything was clean with good service and food  Rooms are clean with very comfortable beds  If you want to stay off the Strip this is a nice choice  
P =>  Good stay at Gold Coast We recently stayed at the Gold Coast from      until       Overall  it was a good experience  The first room we were given was right above the loading dock and terribly noisy  We asked to change and were given a second room  The lock was broken and we had to go to the front desk twice to get another entry card  A manager finally joined us upstairs on my third trip downstairs and confirmed that the lock was broken  We stayed in the third room we were assigned for the next eight days and enjoyed our magnificent view of the top of the air conditioning units The reason I gave this hotel an above average rating is because this hotel is the cleanest I have ever been in  The rooms  the casino  the restaurant and all the restrooms were spotless  The only dirt I found was in the elevator  Really above average cleanliness  The bathroom was very small and awkward but there was fantastic water pressure in the shower   The room was small and the air conditioner was loud and inefficient  but the bed and pillows were very comfortable and I am very particular about that  So for the little time you are in a hotel room in Las Vegas  there is a lot to be said for not having to worry about sleeping in an uncomfortable bed or in someone elses dirt The food was average  edible  The breakfast buffet had the same selections day after day but you cannot beat the cost         The Rio has scrumptuous food and it is a short walk across the parking deck   more expensive but a zillion times better  
P =>   a yearly  hidden treat  OK  so first off  let me point out that I understand both the glowing and the non glowing reviews about Gold Coast  If glowing  it s probably written by a person  like me  who thinks that all you really need in Vegas is a comfortable room to serve as a base to go gaming and or casino hopping  The GC is quite the value in this regard  offering clean and reasonably spacious rooms with good  plasma  TVs  comfy beds  nice but far from ostentatious baths and good climate control  in our experience   If you re looking  on the other hand  for Glitzorama to the Max dancing fountains and fireworks and neat  clean Wynn Bellagio like  quot sterilized fantasy Vegas  quot  the GC is very clearly NOT for you and I fully recommend you go find a place that has pirates shooting exploding chocolate cannons in the lobby at laser created dragons and the      per night pricetag to match We learned about GC on a trip to Vegas a number of years ago  after spending more than our fair share of time  and money  in fancy strip hotels that got just a wee bit old after about the  nd or  rd trip  My English wife  addicted to her English bingo  even in her   s    wanted a decent casino that ALSO offered bingo games   and among places on or close to the Strip  that meant GC or the New Frontier  further out   Arizona Charlie s  which wasn t a bad bingo room  just a little hard to get to and admittedly a dingier  quot locals quot  sort of hangout   Well  we played once at the New Frontier  and all I can say is that there s a reason we didn t go back to either the bingo OR the casino  lt grin gt   The GC  on the other hand  struck us as being a nice place   far  far from  quot Vegas Spectacle quot  to be sure  but that s part of the charm of the place     everyone who wants the glitz stays away  up on the strip  meaning Gold Coast s casino is actually usually navigable even at peak gaming times in the early evening  Anyway  we enjoyed our  quot reconnaissance trip quot  to GC and its sister property the Orleans so much  we decided to try staying there last year when we wanted to go back to Vegas for a quick holiday Bottom line  although very clearly you have to enter the place with your expectations of the  quot Vegas experience quot  very much in reasonable line with what the GC is  it is nevertheless a good  well managed and reasonably spacious casino with a good selection of games  slots and table   decent dining experiences  respectable but not overwhelming shopping and location and rooms that    well    are just that    they re places to crash in relative comfort that are far from  quot Motel    quot  but very clearly are not the Presidential Suite at the Venetian  actually  by comparison  I can t say our last room at NYNY or Mirage was all that much more impressive  except the Strip views were a little better    but then again  the Strip NOISE was ominpresent as well   Games   as noted above  good selection and good prices  particularly the    minimums on some table games like roulette  Waitress service is good for the most part  and the bingo room is very well run  If you don t want to gamble  go bowling in their bowling lanes just for chuckles    another unique feature of the GC Food   we ve come to appreciate the    hour T bone special in the Monterey Room  and the Cortez Room isn t bad either  For the money AND the selection  Ports of Call Buffet is probably one of the more underrated hotel buffets in Vegas  Hot dog vendors in the sports book during the daytime are nice  ice cream and coffee shops are perfectly adequate Shows   we didn t come for the shows  so no comment  I wasn t going to spend money on  quot Forever Plaid  quot  though some locals appeared to have liked it when it was running  Nice to be someplace where you re not bombarded with Cirque du Solieil posters  at least Rooms   see above  I m the last person who d tell you to stay in an absolute armpit just to save money  the really nice thing about the GC is that FOR the money they charge  well  up to about        per night    anything over that  and I d think again  For their usual off season    ish  they re a steal   you get an awfully nice room with comfy furnishings and a plasma TV  It d be nice if they ran more specials around major holidays  to be sure Clientele   probably a little older and  slightly  more foreign in my experience than the average Strip hotel  If you re desperate to play in the  quot pickup scene  quot  the GC probably isn t your    choice of properties   the Palms is just across the street for vapid  hip dancing and drinking  On the other hand  you also don t USUALLY  with minor exception  have obnoxious    somethings who re overly impressed with themselves preening  primping and drinking  til they puke and then passing out over the tables at the GC  which is definitely a major PLUS in my book  Interesting mix of locals and visitors  traditionally  GC had a good rep as a  quot locals quot  hangout  though I think under Boyd Gaming the last few years  word has gotten out that it s a value for money kind of place for turistas as well  As such  I think it s something of a hybrid these days Payouts Comps   As best I can tell  slots payouts are about average to slightly above average for major Vegas properties  You just have to find the right machines    and pray  Comps are the one area where I have to take GC to task   they re pretty stingy for Vegas in my experience  and even stingier when you think about it being an off strip hotel  I blew a considerable chunk of change there and had trouble negotiating a few freebies in the way of food  at some of the MGM properties  I know for a fact they would have comped a few meals AND a room night or two for what I spent there  We re going back to GC during a major upcoming holiday later in the year  so we ll see if they ve done anything to improve in this regard    Area   oh  heck  it s fine  You re next to both the Rio and the Palms  and with a little imagination  you can probably be content in the GC itself  If you re worried  though  rent a car and you can cruise the entire Strip and outlying areas easily from the hotel s access to LV Blvd  and the Interstate  We did both and the car made it easy  You re also a little closer to a grocery store just down the road where you can buy REASONABLY priced soft drinks and treats for the rest of your stay   DIn summary  I would recommend Gold Coast to everyone who just wants a decent  enjoyable  relatively hassle free gaming experience away from the loud obnoxious turista babies that make the Strip casinos generally less desirable  and jam packed   All of your favorite games are there  and the place is in a respectable state of repair  as is the hotel  It ll occasionally show signs of its age and ask you to forgive it  and admittedly the air in places smells less like  quot Mandalay Bay Vanilla quot  and more like  quot real life combination of people s cologne and lboro Lights quot   chuckle   If you re willing to do that  however  you ll be rewarded with a good Vegas experience for a cost effective amount of money at Gold Coast  
P =>   Great Place  We stayed here from             The rooms are just as advertised  Great king bed  Nice view of the palms  VERY CLEAN  Bathrooms are small  I loved it  Staff was very nice and helpful  My wife and I had a great time and would stay here again  If you are looking for luxury on the strip don t stay here  Stay here if you just want to relax away from the hustle and bustle of the strip  
P =>   From a horror movie  Having stayed in some pretty crummy spots over the years and even running youth hostels myself I can only say this place was the cheesiest and worst amenities ever experienced  The clientele look as if they are waiting for a call from the funeral home  the corridors are from a Stephen King movie and the decor in therooms is so out of touch to be almost a museum piece for the bad taste section  And if these folks ever heard of AC in rooms they must have had a nutcase install it as all they do is channel hot air back in  Finally if you fall for the food    don t be surprised if you think MacDonalds is five star in comparison      I wouldn t send my worst enemy to this dump  
P =>  Local Hotel with a cool feel Staying at the Gold Coast after reading the reviews  I was a bit nervous at the prospect  However  I was pleasantly surprised that the rooms were nice  I stayed in the one bedroom suite   the staff people from the reservations desk to the dealers were all really nice  Overall  it was a good trip and I would recommend this place for  quot low rollers  quot  Craps is    min and roulette     Not many places compare at this level and are still clean hotels  This place is   Oh  and there s even a full bowling alley  
P =>   Serviceable but Not Spectacular The Gold Coast is the best stay we have ever had for the rate we paid  Our room rate was less than the parking fee at some Chicago hotels  I cannot imagine what I would get at such a cheap rate in other cities  Only Vegas The Gold Coast is closer to the Strip than I expected  We had a car and it was only about a     minute drive  Very accessible  They have free valet that is pretty quick  The casino is pretty smoky but find me one that isn t and I ll go there  We are not gamblers so can t comment on the casino scene  I will say I appreciate the    pina colodas though The room was surprisingly quite clean  I was surprised at the size of the bathroom  I was expecting to be in a sardine can  I felt that I could manuever just fine  I loved the water pressure The bed was comfortable and the flat screen TV was great  We only ate at the Ports of Call Buffet and that was because it was free  Not bad and what you would expect for       breakfast buffet We had a great two day stay especially at the bargain price  Clean  close to the Strip  courteous staff  most of the modern conveniences but no fluff  We would stay there again but would not pay full price  
P =>   One of the best stays ever I stayed for two nights at the Gold Coast on a special from Travelworm  two nights for the price of one  I enjoyed the Gold Coast more than the hotels I subsequently stayed for one night each at Main Street Station and the Rio  The room at Gold Coast was pleasant  had a coffee maker and wall mounted TV  The casino was always active  even while playing craps at midnight  There was a band nightly in the lounge just off the casino  A particular highlight was dining in the Cortez room  dinner only   One two nights I had the small filet      for entire meal  and the Orange Roughy  about     as I recall for full meal   With relish tray  baked potato  loaf of freshly baked bread  dinner salad and glass of the house Merlot  the meals came to about     each night including tax and tip  a great value for such fine dining  The booths are horseshoe shaped and contribute to the ambiance and privacy  The gym is near the pool area  well equiped and at no extra charge unlike many other resorts  There is a shuttle to the strip  Bill s  that runs frequently though I enjoyed the GC more than the strip  I also had lunch at Ping Pang Pong and had dim sim for the first time  I have stayed at over a dozen hotels in Vegas and enjoyed the Gold Coast as much or more than any other  
P =>  Very nice First thanks to trip advisor they search for cheapest deals for you  I stayed aug     and paid    a night with   nights free and   free buffet breakfasts     dollars a night  lol how can that be  but it was  I read reviews so i thought it would be just ok    clean and maybe a bit warn with a few gross people here and there I was surprised  When checking in the girl was not over friendly but was ok  I asked for a quiet room and she did try to help The hotel i believe is    stories better than       in some of the new ones  I walked into the room and it was just as it looked on trip advisor and the reviews  The room is small like my bedroom back home probably with a small sitting area  The furniture is not real wood but more on the cheap side  The bathroom area small like other have mentioned  But one big thing  it was clean  very very clean  I actually felt i could walk around barefoot it looked that clean  I always spray with lysol when i arrive at a hotel but I didn t even feel like i had too So for my trip advisor readers i cheked into cleanliness more  I wet a wash cloth and wiped onto of door ledges  tables  table sides  window ledges  door handles  etc and the rag showed very very little dirt  I ws amazed  never in any hotel is that happened  The bed was very nice  I m glad they don t use comforters rather they use sheets to cove blankets  Much cleaner  i think  I got in late each night so the room was quiet  but during day i could hear some noise in other rooms but not really bad  I give up on finding a totally quiet room that s why I hate staying in hotels  the noise  But this was pretty good  The ac worked perfect  the tv was nice flat screen and had a few more channels than the strip hotels i stayed at  I wish they all would improve on this in Vegas  sometimes its just nice to watch a tv show before going to bed Overall i liked my room i felt pretty nice and clean in it  Toiletries were nice  shower pressure fantastic and internet lightening fast        per day The casino was very clean nice staff and always someone around to help  Lets of regulars but not nasty bad people type  I was disappointed it was packed with mostly penny machines  Very very few dollars  i think they could have improved this  But it seemed many of the casinos have done this  The buffet for breakfast was like Orleans I thought it was good nice waffles and good pancakes  I m crazing them right now  Something for everyoneDinner was good to it was clean food ok  I like just regular American food so its great for me  If you are looking for more stations  and different things its not for you  I just look for clean basic buffet that tastes good and feels clean  and i do look too   It was nice for my tastes  I got comped but if I had to pay I would the prices were great  From midnight till   am I think they have a breakfast in the coffee shop for       yes thats right       pancakes and bacon or   eggs hash browns  bacon and toast  It was very good and the price was like old Vegas  Gambling was ok in casino i won a couple jackpots on pennies playing max  I lost too  lets be honest its always what happens if ya wanna play a long time Pool was small  not many people looked cleanAfter gambling they comped my cheap room and also got me another room and comped me Friday night also  i was gonna stay with friends in another hotel for last night Final reviewNice very clean room  smaller  not tiny  casino is but spotless  Casino is filled with locals and budget travelers and visitors from the Rio next store  Food very cheap  basic and good I would stay againPlease read my review under Rio hotel also  
P =>   Great place Most comfortable beds in Vegas  This casino is popular with the locals  It is cheap and it has windows  The buffet is great too  
P =>   Great rates great buffet  Can t beat it This hotel is off the strip but provides a shuttle service to their sister hotel on the strip  I use it every year for conventions   where all I do at the hotel itself is sleep and email  For that purpose  the hotel is excellent and my staff concur The Buffet is good and the price reasonable  The Chinese restaurant is actually very good  
P =>   just off the strip This hotel is not on the strip but only a    minute walk away You can get the free shuttle bus to the strip which runs regularly the drivers are great Rooms in the hotel are better than we expected comfy bed nice towels and in room coffee maker They have a large bingo hall which i liked because i won on the   times i went      They also have a massive bowling alley and they do cosmic bowling on a weekend really cheap and the snack bar in there does great burgers You have to walk through the casino to get to your room which was the only downside especially when youre pulling a couple of cases would we stay there again definately yes nice atmosphere and friendly staff By the way you must visit the rio hotel opposite to see the carnival in the sky its a really good free show  
P =>  Good value decent rooms A high school buddy and I recently stayed at the Gold Coast  e      th   The casino delivers a clean  decent room at a very reasonable price  details follow   The room was of a very good size with reasonable wooden   quot block quot  furniture  To the extent it would look like a dorm room  there is surprisingly tasteful paintings and lamps as well as a terrific flat screen TV  The bathroom is extremely small  however  I was in room      It was very quiet   The casino offers the full assortment of games and table minimums are very low  There is also a bingo parlor  which was of notable size and is fun to play in with the small computer terminals they give you   There is a gigantic bowling alley  which is very modern and has a well appointed lounge that looks like it was very recently completed  The pool  however  is very small   Casino workers were friendly and approachable while the crowd at the casino seemed generally nice   We did not eat at the restaurants other than a hotdog  for around     at the stand in the sportsbook  which was good   The casino is near the Rio and Palms  which offer greater dining choices   The shuttle to the strip was very convenient  
P =>   OK for the price We needed a place to stay for one night before launching off on a tour of the national parks in the west  Unfortunately  it was a Saturday night and all the hotels in Las Vegas double their prices on Friday and Saturday  This hotel was easy to find  well located  and adequate for our needs  The room was OK   equivalent to a Holiday Inn Express  I would say  The bathroom was tiny and dark  Everything worked fine  and even though we were at the end of a long hall  we had hot water   Others here have complained about this   Within walking distance are a couple of other casino hotels that are fine to visit  There is a pretty good Mexican restaurant in the hotel across the street  You should know  This is a decent but low budget hotel  The reception is in a place where there are slot machines  and some keno chairs  People smoke there  They are mill around and are constantly coming in and out for the casino and the hotel  You pass through all of this to get to your room  and surprisingly  you have to walk either through the casino or hump your bags through a bar to get to the elevators  Many people are smoking because you are in a casino every time you go to or from your room  That said  it worked for us given the price  location and our one night stay  We would probably stay there again if we needed a place for a Saturday night  But not on a weeknight  
P =>   They weren t kidding about the small bathroom  For my mother s seventy fourth birthday  I surprised her by taking her to Las Vegas to celebrate  We stayed for five nights starting on Sunday  e  rd       at the Gold Coast Hotel and Casino I originally booked the room at     a night  but found a better deal on another web site  I phoned the Gold Coast to see if they would match it  and it was no problem and they dropped the price to     a night  I then found an even better deal that included two free breakfast buffets and two free dinner buffets for     a night  I used a promo code that I found on the Internet and changed my reservation  No only did they give me the four free buffets upon arrival  I did have to refresh their memory   they gave me four more  What a deal When I made the reservation  I requested a nice quiet room on a high floor away from the elevator  They respected my wishes and we had Room     on the eighth floor  out of ten  quite a distance from the elevator  We were about halfway down the very long hall  so I felt sorry for anyone who was staying even further down We had a bit of trouble with the keycard trying to get into the room  but when we managed to finally get in  we found a medium sized non smoking room with two double beds  a clock radio  two regular chairs with a table  a large LCD  limited channel  television with remote  a coffeemaker  and an iron ironing board The bathroom consisted of two separate areas  One part had the closet with hangers and the sink with mirror  while the shower and toilet were located in the smallest bathroom I had ever seen  I m         lbs  and even I found the bathroom to be claustrophobic and hard to move around in  There were four sets of towels  some shampoo  conditioner  lotion  and a shower cap  The shower did have a handle to hold on to  and in lieu of a bathroom fan  there was a small window that overlooked some new construction at the Palms Hotel and Casino Both the sleeping area and the bathroom were spotless and were cleaned every day  The cleaning staff was very friendly and helpful  and when we had a problem with the bathroom light  they got it fixed right away However  despite finding the room very comfortable  we did have a few problems  other than the tiny bathroom   We found that the lighting in the bathroom was very poor  so if you took a shower at night  the shower curtain blocked the light and you were basically washing in the dark  the window is helpful for some light during the day   We also found the beds were a bit too high  as my mother had a very hard time trying to get in and out  We also found that the hotel does not have central air  and each room has it s own air conditioning unit  The unit in our room was extremely noisy  especially when it started up  I had to set it so that it would run all the time  otherwise we would have been startled each time it turned on  We also found the HDTV to be a bit hard to get used to  as some of the stations were not HDTV compatible  so the shows appeared a bit weird  Also  when the television was turned on  the volume automatically started quite loud  Not too bad during the day  but at three in the morning  it would not have been appreciated by the people in the next room  The room doors also slammed shut  but it was not too bad During evening hours  you had to show your room key to a security guard in order to get to your room  However  during most other times  anyone could go up to the rooms  which sort of defeated the purpose of having security at all We found the casino area to be very large  with lots of room to move around in  Quite a cross section of society gamble at the Gold Coast  both young and old  which made us feel very comfortable  There were lots of slot and video poker machines  as well as an entire section devoted to table games  and another section for sports betting  You can play bingo upstairs  and you can bowl a few games if you want at the bowling alley We ate breakfast every morning  except the day we left  at the Ports O Call Buffet  which is a great value at       plus tax  It has very basic food choices  but it is all fresh and very delicious  with made to order omelets  fresh fruit  crepes  blueberry pancakes  breakfast burritos  and even some tasty pastries  We also had the dinner buffet twice  once for steak night and once for seafood night  I really enjoyed steak night  as when I asked for mine well done  that is what I got  and it was fantastic  unlike the steak night at the Fremont   As for Seafood night  there were tons of crab legs  mostly chilled but some cooked   but not much of anything else  We ended up eating lots of popcorn shrimp  which wasn t too bad  Both nights also had the basic standard buffet items  but all were fresh and definitely very good We also had the graveyard special at the Monterey Room the morning we left  and that was a complete disaster  While my mother could at least eat her breakfast of scrambled eggs  sausages  hash browns and toast  my scrambled eggs were runny  my hash browns were burned to a crisp  and my huge ham steak was almost completely black  I never like to waste food as I always think of the starving people in Africa  but in this case I think even they would forgive me   I did manage to eat the toast and not much else We also received two coupon books full of offers  The only two we took advantage of was receiving a free souvenir pack of used casino playing cards at the Gift Shop and a free  large  scoop of delicious ice cream from Katie s Korner Ice Cream Parlor  yum  The Gold Coast is located west of The Strip on Flamingo Road  across the street from both the Rio and the Palms  I walked briskly to Las Vegas Boulevard from my hotel room and it took about thirty minutes  It would probably take slower walkers about forty five minutes to an hour to do the same  so I would recommend taking the free shuttle to The Strip  which stops out front If you decide to stay at the Gold Coast  I have a few tips for you  Park on the second floor of the parking garage on the Rio side  You will be close to the hotel check in and your car will stay cool from the summer sun  Also  for some strange reason the hotel rooms start on Floor   and not Floor    This is very confusing  as you think Floor   is the casino floor  but that is Floor L for Lobby  Don t make the same mistake as I and other guests did  it s a long wait for the elevator to arrive again Overall  we enjoyed our stay at the Gold Coast  The staff was very friendly  the room was very comfortable and clean  and the food at the buffet was very good  The casino had lots of different slot machines for both my mother and I to play  While we didn t win  we found the machines would give you quite a bit of play for your money  unlike the casinos on The Strip   so we liked that  I also liked the fact that I could play     Jacks or Better  which is a scarce commodity anywhere in Las Vegas now Our stay wasn t perfect though  with the loud air conditioner  high beds  and absolutely tiny bathroom  But for the price      a night plus tax  and with the additional value of four free breakfast and dinner buffets and two coupon books  it is hard to really complain too much  
P =>  Great for the Price We stayed here from      through     and overall had a pretty good experience  Arrived in the evening around  pm to check in and zipped right through the process without any problems  Got a room on the second floor overlooking an alleyway and some nearby apartments  The room was satisfactory  dated some but came with iron and board  coffee makers  and a shower with lots of pressure and hot water  Since we were there in LV to run about the Strip and take in the sights  the room more then met our needs  We never heard anyone other then the occasional person laughing or talking walking down the hallway and the AC kept the room at a nice even temperature for us  In our next trip when we go back we ll probably request this floor  It was extremely easy to dart onto the elevator and get down onto the casino floor  The flat panel TV was great as was the bed   very comfortable  The bathroom is very tiny and has a window  The parking ramp is next to the casino and can be quite an adventure for taking bags to the hotel  We always parked on the second floor of the ramp so it was up escalators  across a skywalk  then down escalators and then to check in  From there its down and through the casino floor past the the card games toward several of the eating spots  It is a haul and I wished it had been designed differently  The fitness center and the pool are off the doorway where security sits to monitor people headed into the hotel  Its very odd walking down this alleyway to get to them  the pool is tiny but the fitness center has a good selection of equipment to use  One note we found out   if you want to use the fitness center  you need to have your card programmed for it and specifically mention that at the front desk  otherwise the card wont open the center  You ll have to sign a waiver prior to getting the card reprogrammed The coupon book is pretty standard in comparison to other casino books  The food was great here and its nearby the Rio which has in our estimation the best buffet in town  We ate at the Monterrey room several times and there wasnt one item we didnt like  The Kung Pao off the asian menu there was ridiculously good  Their T bone steak special was also very good The only negatives we encountered were the slowwwwww service of the cocktail waitresses  a tub drain that at times couldnt quite keep up with the water  and the shuttle service  I discourage using the shuttle  While its technically a service  the couple of times we used it it was lengthy waits  no set idea of when it was coming and going  and left to chance  Staff at GC couldnt give a good answer on when it was scheduled other then  about every       minutes  which was never the case  There are several different shuttles which makes it all the more problematic since one would pull up for the Orleans and you wanted the Strip  etc  The shuttles to the Strip stop at Bill s formerly the Barbary Coast  It was luck the one time we found it there and thankfully the driver held up for us to get on  I think you re better off with a rental car or a taxi  Life s too short to wait on the whims of the shuttle  As an aside  we found the road between Rio and GC  Valley View  to be a great parallel to LV Blvd  We got anywhere we needs in a few minutes using that to the cross streets on the Strip with very little traffic no matter when we were on it  
P =>  Good gambling with great off Strip feel My first stay at the Gold Coast was five nights starting with Sunday of Memorial Day weekend  Check in was quick considering I had three overlapping reservations  for cost purposes   The clerk was quite helpful and set my stay up so I did not have to check out for each reservation  I used the TV system to check out since I did not have any comps to be applied to my bill I was given a room on the seventh floor with a view of the south Strip and the Palms  The room was kept extremely clean and the housekeeping service was above average  Yes  the bathrooms are small  No  the rooms are not fancy  Noise from the hall and adjoining rooms was a minor problem at times  but nothing that ruined my stay or would keep me from returning If one mile off Strip with free shuttle service to the Strip is a bad location in your mind  do not stay here  If you want the glitz and glamour of the Bellagio  do not stay here  The place is far from dirty  but it is also far from looking  quot new  quot  The Gold Coast is a smaller property with a great local feel to it  The casino is a bit smoky  but the gambling is great with plenty of tables with low minimums  friendly dealers and a lot of full pay JoB video poker  The sportsbook is also very impressive and gets very busy by mid morning  The pool is very small  but pretty quiet mid day  Not a great atmosphere if you like to lay out by the pool in Las Vegas As for restaurants  the buffet and the Monterey Room are average  however  the Cortez Room is a great steak place with ridiculously low prices  A must try whether you stay at the Gold Coast or not For the person who said there was too much white trash at the Gold Coast  As a    something male  I think you would probably have more of a chance of having a negative encounter with the    something males across the street at the Palms who have something to prove than you would with the slightly older crowd you will see at the Gold Coast  With that said  I would not characterize anyone I saw at the Gold Coast as white trash You will be hard pressed to find a better bargain for a place with so much to offer that is within a   minute cab or shuttle ride from the mid Strip and a short walk to the Rio or the Palms  I would not recommend staying here or anywhere off Strip for your first trip to Las Vegas  nor would I suggest the Gold Coast if you need to feel like you are in the middle of the action  If you want a place with a bit of a slower pace  stay at the Gold Coast  
P =>  Clean Comfortable Room This is my second stay at the GC  I prefer their sister property  The Orleans but the rates at almost every hotel on Sunday before Memorial Day was over       I received an internet offer for     for that night so of course I booked that night at the GC  The rooms are average but clean and the bed was so comfortable  The bathroom is very small and would not work for a very large person  I do love the casino though  I have better luck at the Gold Coast than any other casino I ve gambled at  The restaurants are pretty good but this time the service was pretty slow  They looked to be understaffed which is where Boyd Gaming seems to be doing to their properties these days  I would recommend for a short cheap stay  
P =>   Really ok good location Memorial day weekend  so all Las Vegas hotels were ful and or too expensive for our budget  We were only staying for one night and got a deal through Travelworm     dollar night for a room with two beds  We got a basic room  kind of what you get from a decent motel  Clean and ok space  But the internet was    dollar day  common in hotels but still it felt kinda expensive The Casino is kind of old with an older clientel  but we thought that  was kinda cool   We are a couple in our    s  We also enjoyed their pool and fitnessfacility  Breakfastbuff  was ok  but we were in a hurry so we couldn t really enjoy it  My husband liked the pokerroom  cheap and fun     Overall  a priceworthy stay with walking distance to the strip  
P =>   Best place to crash in Vegas  let your friends pay for the Palms   We usually have friends that get us comped at the Hard Rock or Palms  This time we had to pay  and it didn t make sense to pay      a night for a room to shower and crash for a few hours  We simple walked across the street to hang with them For clean  safe  comfortable place to crash you could do worse I wouldn t recomend the food  my buddy got hungry one morning and attempted the buffet   and the gambling is old school Vegas  dark  dank and serious white trash  But for about      a night it s an amazing place to crash  
P =>  Bad Location Nice and clean Hotel But BAD Location    
P =>   Could do better could do worse  We did a three night stay at the Gold Coast        It s a decent off strip location  with easy walking access to the Palms and Rio  and shuttle service to the Orleans and strip was convenient The room was reasonably clean  beds were comfortable  bathroom tiny  and even though we were on a non smoking floor  the smell of smoke still wafted through the ventilation system The hotel staff alternated between disinterested and disorganized  as did casino staff I d characterize it as a decent value  as our package was inexpensive  but would consider other properties for my next stay  
P =>   very nice for the price We stayed at this modest  very clean hotel for   nights the first week of  We found it to be very quiet  clean  and a perfect place to get away from the hustle and bustle of the Strip  Altough if the Strip is where you want to be  the free shuttle is very convenient  Our stay included the breakfast and dinner buffets  We took advantage of the breakfast all   days which was great  but the dinner only once since it was just average Besides  there were many other restaurants we wanted to visit  The room we had was spacious with a king size bed  As noted in many other reviews  the bathroom is very small but again  very clean which is important to us  For the price and convenience  I would stay here again  For those of you considering it  keep in mind it is not the Wynn or Bellagio  
P =>  Not in big league but worth a stay  We stayed at this hotel between   th   th        Although this hotel is not in the same league as Bellagio  Wynn hotel  Venicia  Bally s or all the major hotels it is much better than most of the others The Gold Coast is situated a short walk away from The Rio and The Palms  it also has a free shuttle bus to the Strip and drops off outside it s sister hotel The Orlean s Having been inside all of the above named hotels  which are indeed very grand and luxurious  The Gold Coast has a more homely feel and not all the hustle and bustle of the others which are constantly hectic and busy with all sightseers  Agreed the Gold Coast does not have all the glitz and glamour of some of the big ones but there is plenty to do and caters for every type of gambler The hotel has   hr room service and all the restaurants within are very cheap  The Port O  Call buffet in particular was excellent value  The all you can eat breakfast costs just       and is available from midnight to around midday  There is every choice of food imaginable  The other restaurants are fine also with a   oz steak costing about       with a free beer The rooms are spacious with very cosy beds  our double bed was about  ft wide  However  the bathrooms were not that great in comparision  The rooms did not have a safe or fridge but along every corridor is an ice machine which is free to guests The swimming pool area is very nice and the hotel provides free sunbeds and towels  This area does not get busy as most of the guests are inside gambling  so there is always plenty of space around the pool which also has a jacuzzi next to it All hotels in Vegas are open to the public and as long as your having a flutter  waitresses will supply you with comlimentary drinks  Always tip them at least one Dollar each time they bring the drinks and they will supply you free drinks all night We went to seeThe Rat Pack show at the Greek Isles hotel and I have to say it was not the best  quot Rat Pack quot  show I have seen  They try to replicate the original show from  quot The Sands quot  and although word for word they have it mastered  the singers themselves are not that good  I ve seen much better variations in England If you get a taxi to Freemont  a must see  if only for the laser shows in the sky  this should cost no more than    Dollars  Be careful on the return journey and agree fare with driver as some of the hispanic taxi drivers try it on and drive the long way round the freeway or will sit in traffic with the meter ticking away Visit the Ballagio hotel  you ll be amazed at how vast it is inside  They have a computerised water show at the front of the hotel which is in operation every    mins during the day and every    mins at night It would be a shame not to see the Grand Canyon whilst in Vegas  and I can reccommend  quot Kings Airlines quot  who operate helicopter  aeroplane and bus tours  We paid approx       each for an    minute flight in plane all over the Grand Canyon  which flys over The Hoover Dam and other sights along the way  This tour included a visit to the Hulapai Indian reservation with a meal included      ft above the Colorado River  Brochures for this company can be found at the  quot Bell desk quot  in the foyer of the hotel Getting back to the Hotel itself  Once you have been inside some of the other major hotels and seen just how busy they get you ll appreciate The Gold Coast Hotel  It s far from quiet and has all the amenities you d want it s just that it isn t as hectic  
P =>  What a piece of k  Came out to Vegas this past weekend for a buddy s wedding party in a suite at the Palms  Had hoped to stay there but that room block sold out quickly because of cinco de mayo  the fight  the derby  etc     so decided to stay across the street at Gold Coast  The price  at about      night was pretty good too  Glad I didnt bring the gf  she would have dumped me on the spot  This place doesnt belong in vegas  maybe Gary  IN or the Gaza Strip  dont they have some casino there The room is similar in quality to a Comfort Inn or Days Inn except that it has a    inch LCD tv hanging on the wall  Other than that  the room furniture was totally crappy  the bed not particularly comfortable  the bathroom was split between the sink area and the shower area  hate that   and the closet had those crappy plastic hangars junky hotels use to keep you from stealing them  and one of them was broken  The drain in the bathroom sink was rusted  looked awful  The north facing room had a direct view of the south wall of the casino structure  pathetic  Hotel room had high speed wifi  but it was     for a    hour period  Hotel also had    hour room service  which was pretty good and brought me up a chicken sandwich and a     of vodka at about   in the morning  Took about    mins  not too bad  and the prices were totally reasonable  That was the best part of the place The casino downstairs was pretty lousy  just one pit of table games  which were mostly single deck blackjack or some  quot super fun quot  derivation i couldnt stand  Hotel had a shuttle to Bill s on the strip but it didnt start early enough one morning for me to use it  and other times I had to wait about    mins  not terrible  Kind of felt like those short schoolbuss  the special kids use  the rest of the passengers actually seemed like they belonged on there    regular cast members out of that   s horror pic Night of the Living Dead  Latest check out they would agree to was  pm  nothing after  even when I offered to pay some fee  and they readily volunteered they werent sold out the next night  but that they dont give late check out  period  totally sucks  Had one meal at the Monterey Room  which I think is the    hour joint  French toast for     fine  I ll take it  half the place looked like it just escaped from a sanitarium  except that roving keno girl  she was a looker  kept giving me the eye too  too bad i dont know how to play these crazy asian numbers games Never coming back here  just a totally mediocre dump  Gold Coast tried its damndest to de fang the vegas experience for me  but I was determined not to let this lumbering forlorn torture chamber do that  so after dropping a grand at the Playboy Club  round of golf at Wynn  party in the Kingpin suite  and pizza true to the secretive Puck Family recipe at Spago  I was back  baby I ll tell you  that  am     Smirnoff on the room service menu really did the trick though  try getting that at Bellagio  
P =>  Gold Coast is affordable clean and convenient Our recent trip to Vegas was for a convention  so my husband and I didn t want to spend a lot of money on a hotel room we weren t going to spend much time in  The Gold Coast was an affordable and excellentchoice  The room was clean when we arrived and housekeeping did a nice job while we were there in keeping it clean  The hotel offers shuttle service to the strip which was very convenient  The drop off location was right across the street from the hotel hosting our convention  Unfortunately  the shuttle didn t start running until after our morning sessions started  but there are a couple of CAT locations  bus stops  just across Flamingo Street that we rode to the strip  The bus is easy to catch and cheaper than a cab  While the Gold Coast isn t on the strip  it offers plenty of fun  plus  there are two nearby hotels to enjoy  And  we spent plenty of time on the strip and shopping at area outlet malls  While at the Gold Coast  we participated in the free Craps lesson  Still don t understand though  We played Bingo   of course  much easier  but those ladies calling the numbers are fast  We were some of the younger ones in the Bingo hall  and had a great time  The hotel offers a nice coffee bar and a delicious Italian restaurant  I m still thinking about my yummy dinner  And  don t miss out on the hotel coupons  Each guest receives a book of coupons when they arrive  The coupon book included discounts at the hotel restaurants  coffee shop  bingo  a free scoop of ice cream  a free drink  and lots more  We were a captive audience  but why not take part in the discounts  Hopefully  you re still with me because the most importantmessage here is that we would stay at the Gold Coast again   whether for business or pleasure  We walked across the street one night to eat at a restaurant in the Rio  cool balcony on the roof too   The Palms is across the street in another direction  We didn t make it there  but we may next time  Who needs the strip and the crowded sidewalks full of tourists carrying monster margaritas   
P =>   Great hotel We stayed here from ch   th to ch   th  We had a suite on the   th floor  What a clean and spacious room and the price was excellent  When we checked in  Saturday night was fully booked  but with a quick click of the computer and we were in and another excellent rate  The employees are all very helpful and housekeeping did a superb job  The food was a great choic also  Excellent and prompt service  The coupon book at check in was great for saving some money  We walked across the street and used the shuttle service from the Rio that ran until   am I would highly recommend the Gold Coast  We will definitely be back Thank you for a wonderful stay 
P =>   Two Thumbs Up  We stayed at the Gold Coast from        and had a great time  The hotel and rooms are very clean  The buffet is very reasonable and filling   actually much better quality than those on the Strip that cost   or   times as much  The coupons books that are provided at check in were a great surprise   and very useful  A free shuttle bus runs every       minutes to and from the Strip  And as mentioned in other posts  this hotel is quite popular with locals   nice locals      The front desk was very accomodating by providing a late check out for us due to our flight time  We will definitely stay here again  
P =>   Brillant hotel and base for a Las Vegas holiday  I m a travel agent and me and my boyfriend stayed in this hotel for two weeks and found it had everything we needed  When we booked this hotel came up a couple of hundred pound cheaper than a hotel on the strip and I would definatley say that it was excellent value for money  Although it wasn t on the strip  it was on a road that ran between the Bellagio and Ceasers Palace  It took us five minutes to walk to these hotels but because it was so hot we normally took the free shuttle bus to the Barbary Coast which is right in the middle of the strip  facing Ceasers I loved everything about our hotel  the facilities in it were brilliant  especially the    hr    lane bowling alley  we went here on our first day at   in the morning because we were jetlagged and it was only    for an hour I couldn t fault the hotel room  especially the really soft bed  It was very modern and had a lovely big flat screen tv  The only bad thing I could say about our room is that the bathroom was a bit small and dark but it was cleaned everyday which I was very pleased about  The hotel rooms were in a seperate building from the casino and you had to show your room key to get to your room so I always felt very safe I would definatley recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to viva Las Vegas  
P =>   Good basic hotel My husband and I stayed one night at the Gold Coast  It was nice  and a good bargain considering the cost of hotels on the Strip  We paid       including tax  for a night s stay  compared to           for hotels on the Strip  Plus  the Gold Coast gave us two coupon books upon check in that had a bunch of great deals  including free scoop of ice cream  free cocktails  discounts at the Seattle s Best Coffee Shop  etc  Our room was a nice basic hotel room   very clean and fairly spacious  We had a king sized bed that was comfortable  The bathroom was tiny but very clean  The rest of the hotel was nice   we had a good breakfast at the Port O  Call Buffet  and the casino seemed popular with locals  Service was also good all around  Would definitely stay here again  
P =>   Great Off Strip Choice Gold Coast Casino Hotel  Off Strip  West Flamingo Road Las Vegas  We were delighted with our stay at this pleasant  budget oriented hotel  Rooms were basic and clean  nice flat screen tv and sitting area  Bathroom is extremely snug  but has a little window to the outside which is rarely seen these days  Dressing area and basin outside of bathroom behind a well designed walled in luggage storage area  Clientele appears to be mostly locals  Nice buffet  Chinese Restaurant  Steak House  Ice Cream Shoppe  Clam Bar  Coffee Shop  and Italian Restaurant  Lively and basic pool area  Many bars and lounges throughout  including a popular entertainment lounge with live bands  Take the free shuttle to sister properties  Note  Barbary Coast Casino will sooon leave this hotel group  which may cancel the free access to the Strip  Walk across the street to either Palms or Rio Casino  The Strip is walkable  albeit somewhat cumbersome and long  Well designed and dramatic public spaces  Oh  and a big Bingo Hall as well as a bowling alley  Good budget choice for Las Vegas  
P =>   Nice Accomodations We chose the Gold Coast because of its proximity to the Strip without actually being right on the Strip  The rates were excellant compared to the other hotels  Our room with a King size bed was as pictured on their website  The room was not fancy but  was clean and inviting  The linens were bright white and changed three times during the week we were there  The gambling odds were better than most others we have stayed at  We ate daily in the    hour cafe and the selection and taste was very good  All staff that we encountered were polite and helpful  The only two items that bothered us were  the coffeemaker in the room is a single cup machine  we love to sit and drink quite a bit of coffee in the morning while watching the news   and several of the guests were loud in the hallways during the night between   A  A  We would definitely stay again  
P => Enjoyable stay Stayed here for   nights end   got a great rate through Priceline  especially for the Friday and Saturday nights of my stay when the hotel was sold out Room  I received a double queen bedded room on the  st floor at the end of a long corridor with a view of a white wall  I didnt mind this because I got the room for a bargain price but some people may wish to request a room with a view if thats important Room was recently renovated with good amenities and of a decent size for   or   people  Beds were comfortable and although the bathroom was small the shower pressure was good and the water hot whenever I needed it  Plenty of coffee provided for the single cup coffeee machine Casino  Excellent casino  I found the slots to be loose and the dealers friendly although it could be difficult to find a space at the tables on a weekend night due to the sheer volume of people  As others have noted the casino can get very smokey  surely its time to extend the Nevada clean air act to casinos as well as restaurants  amp  bars  Restaurants  I ate at the buffet a few times and generally found the food to be fresh  tasty and an excellent value including the desserts which were excellent  I can also recommend the coffee shop which served up an excellent       graveyard special ham and eggs  I also tried the    hour       t bone steak special which was great value even though the meat wasnt a good cut  A bit too much fat for my liking  Also enjoyed the ice cream from Kates Korner Didnt use the shuttle as I was driving  the hotel has easy access to the Interstate and strip areas I would recommend the hotel as a good value alternative to strip hotels  and the coupon book you receive at check in with free drinks etc makes it even better value  
P =>   break from the snow we just returned from a  six day stay at the gold coast  The rooms were very clean and new beds  bath room small but shower was great  we ate at all the resturants and all were very good  The best part of this place are the locals who fill the casino every night  all the people we met were freindly and nice to talk to  we stay at the gold coast three or for weeks a year  we have stayed on the strip and have had good times but we think that the gold coast is a good location  close to the strip  the highway if you want to go downtown  or explore  and the price is very good  will be there aging in june  
P =>   Great Stay Wonderful stay at the Gold Coast  Hotel was better than expected  Used the shuttle bus to the strip on many occassions and if we wanted a later shuttle bus at night just popped into Ballys and used the Shuttle bus to the Rio If you are on a budget holiday we found the food and drink at the GC to be very reasonably priced  Used the breakfast buffet most mornings for    and didnt really need to eat again until eveing Our stay at the GC was topped off with a      win on the slots the morning we checked out  All in all we loved our stay at the GC  we didnt pay strip Rates and we felt we got more than we paid for       for a week in Vegas was excellent value for money  
P =>  Not for non smokers We stayed here over the weekend of        because the hotels on the strip had astronomical rates over our dates  We have stayed at the Orleans before  but wanted to try the Gold Coast because it is slightly more convenient  It was NOT worth it  The Orleans is much nicer and the cab ride is only a few dollars more  As mentioned in other reviews  the rooms need to be refurbished  The a c and heat unit is ancient and when it works it s very loud  The biggest drawback has got to be the smell  though  I am not a smoker and we booked a non smoking room  The room itself had a lingering odor  but that was not the worst part  I could hardly stand the casino downstairs because it smelled so heavily of smoke  I know that most of the casinos do allow smoking and it usually doesn t bother me that much  but maybe they have an older ventilation system here or something  It was much worse at this hotel than at any of the others we went to  On the bright side it was VERY cheap and the staff was nice  The rooms were clean if a bit shabby  If you re a smoker it would probably be fine  
P =>   Nice Alternative to the Strip I ve stayed at the Gold Coast twice during conventions in Las Vegas and its always served me well  The people at the check in desk are very friendly and helpfull  The rooms are extremely clean and modern  The casino is just fine    there are no gimmics or fancy themes here like you find on the strip but its not junky or depressing either  Its just a basic casino    if you are looking for something more interesting  then the Rio and the Palms are walking distance away  The Strip itself is a little too far to walk but they do have a shuttle  I didn t use the shuttle so I have no idea how often it runs or how well it works  The Gold Coast does have a smallish pool and a small gym that overlooks the pool which is nice  Also the bowling alley looked pretty cool if you are into that  My only complaint during my stay in uary      was this    they installed flat panel LCD televisions in all the rooms which I thought was pretty cool at first  The problem is that the TVs are early generation LCDs that actually have a pretty poor picture  Its not Hi Def television and the picture is noticibly poor  Also  during the time of my stay  they did not offer any pay per view movies like most places offer  be this was just a temporary situation  Overall  the Gold Coast was a very good value and much easier to come and go from  by car  than any place on the Strip  
P =>  Stay at the Gold Coast and save money for elsewhere in las vegas Our group booked   rooms in the gold coast for a week in late uary and here is what we thought First the rate was excellent      per night and     on Friday   though I did book about six months in advance No queue at check in  a big change from LAX where our plane was delayed for two hours and the gigantic taxi queue we met once we got out of the terminal at McCarran  we must have been in the queue for taxis close to one hour We were given two rooms on the  th floor and one on the  th upon checkin  The view was better in the two rooms at the front of hotel  facing the south strip   compared to our room which was facing the north strip The four room elevators worked well during the whole week stay and the entire place was very clean  We tried the buffet   times  fantastic value at       for lunch but not as good as quality as some I have been to  Monterey room was also cheap and standard above average The bathrooms were small as people have mentioned before  but the window in the shower is so cool  The property also has a very small pool and a jacuzzi as well as gym The business center is very expensive       for    minutes on the Internet  crazy    The free shuttle is very handy and there is a city bus       which leaves right across the street at the Palms every few minutes         for a day pass   The walk is less than a mile to the Bellagio or Caesars if anyone is up for that Overall an excellent choice if staying in Las Vegas  its not the Wynn or the Bellagio but those places are about    times more expensive than the Gold Coast  question is are they    times the value considering you are only going to be in the bedroom for a few hours anyway     
P => Great value   Average Hotel I have previously stayed at this property s sister hotel  the Barbary Coast and I guess I am a little spoiled  The good  The price was phenomenal      a night can hardly be beat in Vegas Friendly service  I left my Blackberry charger behind and immediately called the hotel after I checked out  While I was on the phone  they sent someone to the room to grab it and held it at the bell desk  The not so good Location  I look back and think that I would have paid a couple bucks more to be on the Strip  The shuttle service was good  The nighttime driver was very friendly  But its doesn t start until      AM and stops at        An extra hour on either side would have been helpful Casino  Poor ventilation compared to other places  I think that many of the dealers were trainees here  Some had little personality  and I observed some mistakes  But the limits are low for those of us who are not high rollers Overall though  the hotel is an excellent value  The buffet and restaurants are cheap  While some will say that you get what you pay for  sometimes all you want is a little comfort food and this hits the spot for not too much money  
P => Everything you need Price is incredible for the amenities of the hotel  Valet parked the car and never took it out until we left at the end of our stay  We arrived at around      pm on a Tuesday afternoon and were checked in and in our room by   pm  The front desk staff were great and helpful as we asked many questions  We were on the eighth floor in a standard room and found it to be very spacious clean and comfortable The shuttle from the hotel to the strip ran like clockwork and we used it evryday all day back and forth to the strip  The drivers of the shuttles were a hoot and loved to chat with the passengers  Casino  pool area  and fitness center was as good as anywhere on the strip  The hotel wasn t as flashy but offered everything the larger much more expensive ones did  The Port of Call buffet was the best we have been to and featured food from   different countries  We ate all breakfasts and most dinners there  Overall the hotel was top notch and classy  Almaost all rooms were recently redecorated and were top notch For price  value and convenience the Gold Coast was at the top of the list   Would stay there again in a minute  
P =>  A Consistently Good Choice Received     free nights with additional food credits through mail promotion  so again decided for  nd year in a row to stay at the Gold Coast  It continues to meet or exceed our expectations  Often  a Hotel does a great job when you know no ones name  as was the case with this visit  All phases of service were completed in a courteous and timely fashion  as expected  The Buffet is slightly below average  We prefer  and chose on two of three nights to enjoy dinner at Ellis Island  home of the       steak dinner  and quite the steak dinner it is  The gaming at Gold Coast is wonderful  plenty of video poker  and jackpots abound    over the past two years for an average gamer   Be sure to join Club Coast  as their rewards are easy to understand  and collect  Parking is easy  use the parking garage to the east of the hotel  We highly recommend the Gold Coast  and while we enjoy variety  you can t beat this place for consistentcy that is well above average  We will stay at the Gold Coast again  for sure  
P =>   a great off strip hotel we booked this hotel as it was so expensive to stay on the strip on new years eve the hotel was a few blocks away from the strip but this was no problem as there was a free shuttle that ran from the hotel to the strip every       mins from about  am until midnight the hotel was a lot bigger than we expected and the staff very friendly and helpful restaurants were great and the buffet breakfast for    was fantastic everything from your bacon and eggs to mexican and chinese the rooms were huge and the bed was amazing you could have had   of us in there all the usual coffee maker iron hairdryer flat screen tv nice toiletries room cleaned every day and fresh towels bathroom a bit small but shower hot and powerful plus you dont go to vegas to spend all day in the bathroom i would recommend this hotel and next time i m in vegas i would stay here without even thinking about staying on the strip  
P =>  Great base for a Vegas first timer This is a great  low cost base to discover Vegas  Room very clean  housekeeping very good  Yes  the bathroom decor is a bit dated  but shower is excellent  We ate breakfast in the Monterey Room every day  didn t try the buffet only because it was too far to walk to the other side of the hotel  Ping Pang Pong is a great chinese  although beware the huge portions   one main course is enough for two  believe me  We re not gamblers so didn t chuck any money on the green baize    one small downside is that Nevada s no smoking laws don t stretch to the gaming floor  but that s not the hotel s fault  It s true that this is not like the palaces on the Strip  my favourite was NY NY  we might try there next time   but for a no nonsense base to explore we couldn t fault it for the price  The shuttle is really handy  P S  great food  and beer   a hard thing for an Englishman to find in the USA  at the Brewery Pub in Main Street Station downtown  
P =>   Great Hotel Great Value  We have stayed at Gold Coast four times in the past year  and each time has been great  We usually pay between         a night  which is a great deal for what the hotel offers  The rooms are always clean  with flat screen TV s  and they appear to be recently updated  The rooms are comparable to most rooms on the strip  but usually at a much lower cost  The casino is of decent size  with plenty of tables and slots  as well as a huge keno  sports  and bingo hall  There is a    hour bowling alley right in the hotel  The pool is average not too large or fancy  but clean and nice  I usually stay at the Flamingo if I am looking to spend a lot of time at the pool   The hotel offers a free shuttle to the strip  which takes you to Barbary Coast right in the middle of the strip  Gold Coast is located directly across from The Palms  and right next door to Rio  so you also have options within walking distance  One of the best things about Gold Coast is the fun book you get upon check in  It is filled with great coupons for free drinks  free ice cream  bowling  and meals  among other things  The buffet is also great and is less than half of what you would pay for a buffet on the strip  Overall  this hotel is a great deal  and a great value  
P =>   Treated Better than on the Strip We stayed at the Gold Coast during the week between Christmas and New Years Eve  We really enjoyed ourselves  We found the staff  right down to the dealers in the casino  very friendly and helpful  We found it a more affable atmosphere than the hotels we had stayed at on the strip  Bally s and Flamingo   The room  though nothing special  was very  very clean  quiet  and comfortable  the price was right too  If you are a bingo fan  there is an enormous bingo hall that runs games every two hours starting at  AM  free doughnuts   Not a large crowd when we looked in  so the chances of winning aren t bad  The hotel offers free transportation to the Strip and the Oreans every fifteen minutes  Though you may have to wait for the bus  it saves a ton in cab fare  The Gold Coast is  however  no more than a     cab ride to from almost anything on the Strip  and only a     cab ride from the airport We plan on staying there next trip to Sin City  
P =>  Consistently Great Stay at a Great Price I recently returned to the Gold Coast and was treated well as always  I parked close to the hotel and didn t have to walk a country mile to get to the lobby  With the megahotels you often have walk a long ways between car and hotel  but  not at the GC  I arrived on a Sunday and was given an early checkin with a smile  My room was clean and in good repair  They gave me a coupon book for free drinks and an ice cream cone  I used the drink coupons to watch the Chargers   Patriots game and they were cheerfully accepted  The weekday breakfast buffet cost about    including tax  For this princely sum I received a made to order omelete with good side dishes including   different kinds of melon with good tasting drinks  I have stayed at Bellagio and the Venetian  They are superior hotels in many ways  However  for     a night  I believe the Gold Coast is the best deal in town  
P =>   excellent value Stayed at the Gold Coast during the CES show           nights   Got a decent rate  given how expensive rooms were that week elsewhere I took the free shuttle to Barbary Coast  very quick and convenient   then walked to CES at the Sands Venetian  On day    I took the shuttle to BC and then went to the Flamingo to get the shuttle to the Convention Center  Some waiting  but the Strip and Convention Center were very congested and crowded Did not spend any other time on the Strip  I mostly hung out a Gold Coast and walked over to Palms a couple of times  Talk about culture shock    the Palms is all sleek  chrome  thumping music  etc  and the Gold Coast is about as staid as a casino can get  Palms clientele seems to be rich  or rich wannabe  LA types  Gold Coast mostly locals and older folks  I was much more comfortable at Gold Coast Casino is kind of smoky  LOTS of video poker    many more VP than slots  which is OK by me as I am a poker player only  live and video   I did not play any table games  but there was always    BJ and craps when I was there  Sports book very straightforward  Poker Room was a bit light on players    sometimes hard to keep more than   people in a game    but very friendly  Also  good comps for both poker players and VP players Rooms very basic  I could never get the high speed internet conncetion to work  despite   phone calls and promises to  quot check it out quot   I never saw any evidence that anyone had checked it  That was my only complaint with staff or service  Configuration of rooms kind of odd    the internet connection  which I could never use anyways so it didn t matter  was on the dresser across the room from the table chairs  I don t know how they expect you to use your computer    sitting on the floor  I guess  So I moved the furniture all around to suit me  The mattress was kind of soft but comfy  I also liked that there was a clean sheet on top of the bedclothes instead of a bedspread  you never know long since the bedspread was laundered   I always toss the bedspread on the floor anyway  Good water pressure in shower  and you can open a window in the bathroom for fresh air  I had no problems with noise from other rooms  The walk to your room from the elevator can be quite long  Good exercise  though  Never a long wait for the elevator the entire time  There is a security guard by the hotel elevators in the night time hours Buffet was just OK for breakfast  I did not eat there for any other meal  The coffee shop  Monterey    had good coffee shop food  good selection  and reasonable prices  It is all no smoking which is good  The Oyster Bar was pretty good  too  Casino    busy but not crowded  There was always room to maneuver  There are door with windows all along the front side of the hotel  so it was always easy to get oriented  I sometimes get lost or turned around in the huge casinos I m not a bowler  but I checked out the bowling alley and it was pretty impressive  It was too chilly for pool  so did not check that out  They also have a movie theater Summary    I have stayed at most of the  quot medium priced quot  hotels and a couple of higher priced ones over the past    years  Flamingo  Monte Carlo  Luxor  Sahara  Harrahs  Riviera  Frontier  MGM  Tropicana  Paris  Ballys  Treasure Island   I would rate the Gold Coast as the best value of all of these  except possibly for Ballys  No glamour  no glitz    this is just a good  basic  straightforward  hotel and casino with all you need at a good price  Staff was very polite  If you want crowds and beautiful people and the  quot excitement quot  of the Strip  you will not get that here    but it is all only a free    minute shuttle away if you want it  
P =>  Better than expected  Great small casino  hotel  Friendly employees  super fast valet and great food  Surpassed my expectations on cleanliness  decor and layout of casino and rooms  Bathrooms a bit small and no fan in shower  toilet room  but there is a small window in the back wall of shower stall  Bed super comfy for a king   th floor is non smoking  stayed in       which was a bit of a walk from the elevator  so if you are not up to walking too far from elevators  ask for a room closer to them  Security at room entrance at night  so that was a nice plus knowing they are watching who is going to the rooms  Right across the street from the Rio and The Palms  so there is action close by  Bowling alley is huge and a lot of fun  having not played in     years  A great hotel for someone on a budget and who doesn t care for all the flashiness of the big hotels and shops  We had a car so it was a nice getaway from the monster hotel  casinos  And there weren t that many kids  where as the Strip and it s hotels were just flooded with them and their strollers  etc  etc  That was a real disappointment having to deal with all the kids and all their baggage  Vegas is for adults or at least keep the kids in the kid friendly areas  We won t be back until the new bridge at Hoover Dam is done  By then the hotels that are under construction now will be done  making the Strip that more filled up with more to do and see and since we have seen most of it  we will be ready for new stuff  
P =>   Terrific Value   Exceptionally Clean Everything about this property is positive in every way  I booked a standard room with two beds and was upgraded to a two bedroom suite on their tenth floor  The rooms are huge  The showers are brilliant although climbing into the tub is tricky as the side walls of the tub are very high  Internet service was     daily but very fast  I accidentally spilled some sticky mountain dew on the tile floor and when I cleaned it with a wet cloth  the cloth came off the floor absolutely clean  Television service was excellent  Food was inexpensive and excellent as well  The staff is very courteous and check in is quite fast  Oh  I do remember a very negative aspect of this hotel  The elevators are few and because of the large crowds waiting for them  they stop at almost every floor so they are very slow  I will absolutely stay here again  
P =>    rd Time  We have now stayed at the Gold Coast on three occasions and have never been let down  With the bus link to Barbary Coast it s like staying in the middle of the strip without all the chaos that brings  The rooms are spacious and clean  This year plasma televisions have been added  The staff are always very friendly and helpful  The show Forever Plaid is well worth a visit too  All this and you are only ten minutes by the bus from the strip and five minutes walk from the palms and rio  Overall with the cost taken into account the Gold Coast takes some beating  
P =>   Get a suite  The price is right and you are no more than a     cab ride to anywhere you want to go on the strip  Get the suite  they are AMAZING  as the weekday rate is very appealing  Room service was reaonable  quick and tasty  I had a regular room once and there was a lot of wear and tear  poor beds etc  Even a regular room isn t bad when you consider its only for sleeping  The plasma TV s are great  
P =>   Excellent Value My wife and I stayed at the Gold Coast for   nights this past tember  Not knowing what to expect  as this was our first stay at the facilty  we were pleasantly surprised and happy with our decision  If you are expecting facilities on par with say Ceasers Palace  or the Bellagio  this is not the place for you  However  our room was clean and recently remodeled  with a large flat screen tv on the wall  The king size bed was extremely comfortable  The only item in the room not remodeled was the bath area  shower and toilet   Although clean  it appears that these were original to the facilty  The pool area was very nice  but again it does not compare with some of the pool s of the hotel s on the strip  One nice amenity is the abilty to take a free shuttle to the other  quot Coast quot  hotel s  We took advantage of the free shuttle service to the Barbary Coast on a daily basis  total distance to the strip is a mile or two  and took about   minutes door to door  The food at the Gold Coast was very good  We had breakfast every morning in the buffet  and they had a wide variety of options  We also had dinner at the buffet on two evenings and again the food was very good  They have a wide variety of offerings  and we were very satisfied  Two evenings we ate in the Cortez Room at the Gold Coast  They advertise that their Prime Rib is the best in town  and I would have to agree  I think the    ounce Prime Rib is        and well worth it  By the way  my  quot    ounce quot  Prime Rib was probably easily     to     lbs and very good  Overall I would not hesitate to stay at the Gold Coast again  Certainly there are more deluxe accommodations at some of the hotel s on the Strip  but I don t think you can beat the value at Gold Coast  
P =>  Loved the Gold Coast Absolutely loved the Gold Coast  Ok  it s not  quot right on the strip quot  but they have a shuttle that runs until just after midnight that you can pick up at the Barbary Coast next door to Ballys and the Flamingo  The buffet was fantastic  the poker room staff were tops  and I must say the front desk staff was  nd to none    I would advise asking if your room has one of the newer air conditioners as I like it very cold when I sleep and I noticed some of the rooms had the old  quot motel quot  style ac s A little tip for you  the Gold Coast reservations staff  actually all the Coast Property reservations staff will match any price you find online even after you ve made a reservation  I booked a   night stay Sun  amp  Mon last week  The online price was     night  very reasonable  However  about   weeks before the trip I noticed that TripRes had a     night rate available  so I just called the Gold Coast  spoke to a nice lady  told her I saw the     night  she asked where  she checked it out  and I actually got the room for     night as TripRes charged a    comish  
P =>  Fun casino I go to the Gold Coast every time I go to Vegas to play bingo and it is a blast  The Gold Coast also has friendly dealers  low table minimums and the place is not that crowded  They also have some great deals on food and drinks  It is a fun casino to check out  even if it is off the strip  
P =>   great deal We were very pleased with our two night stay at the Gold Coast  I booked online  prepaid  so check in was a breeze    no lines  no other difficulty  They gave us a coupon book which included discount bowling  free drinks  and discounts at their restaurants and gift shop  Free secured valet parking  comfy king size bed  and a free shuttle to sister hotel Barbary Coast  just a few blocks away in the heart of the Strip  kept us stress free  The room was fairly basic but was clean and quiet suited our needs with a nice view of the Palms and part of the Strip  a smallish bathroom  and a flat screen TV  This is not a luxury resort    think a step above a motel    but they have all the basic amenities  plus a few extras  for a very reasonable price and great location for other exploring  Also  the bowling alley was a lot of fun  they do  quot Cosmic Bowling quot  on Friday and Saturday nights  which means black lights and disco balls and dance music  We had a great time  
P =>   Some things good some not so good   Stayed at the Gold Coast t     on a comp   Location is good and has easy in and out with a rental car  Rooms are clean and comfortable   although the bathrooms are somewhat small  There is an in room coffee maker which is unusual in Las vegas  The casino was good for me as I am a video poker player and the place is loaded with full pay machines   even at the bartop    I even hit a royal on the last day   On the downside  the service was somewhat lax  The coffee for the coffee maker was absent for the last   days  as was refills on the shampoo and lotion  The food was not great either  The coffee shop was average  There was a coupon in the comp book for a free bottle of wine with a buffett  The only thing worse than the food at the buffet was the free bottle of wine  Would reccommend the sister property at The Orleans over The Gold Coast  
P =>   Last minute trip to Las Vegas We stayed at the Gold Coast during a quick and in prompt trip to Las Vegas on ust    for   nights  We looked up the price on Expedia and found it cheaper than the hotel  Expedia     hotel site was          The hotel does match the travel site and does not have as many restrictions as Expedia did so we booked and then called the hotel    you must do this within    hours after making the reservation   and they took care of it and matched Expedia  The hotel room as seen on the sight is a true picture of the room  Check in was prompt and very friendly  Parking was easy and not a long walk from the hotel casino  The hotel room was nice  Simple  The flat screen T V  was a nice touch  The bed was    to our taste   a bit on the soft side  The only other compliant we had with the bed was that they do not use fitted sheets and the sheets kept coming up as they were not long or wide enough for the bed  So in short if you toss around a lot at night you ll wake in a clump of top and bottom sheets  These rooms have been remodeled about     months ago  The room was clean  The only other complaints that comes to mind is that with the remodel of the room why did they leave the bathroom out  The shower and toilet are in a small room  If you are a big person you might find this a little hard to move around in  The sink area and closet are outside of the bathroom but separate from the room and are showing their age  Actually they announce their age  One thing that was exceptional was the shower head and pressure  GREAT    The other thing we found strange is where the hook up for the DSL was  It was not located on the table where there are chairs to sit at but located at the dresser         The cable and a long enough power cord could get you to the bed  maybe  or you would have to move the chair over to the dresser and sit sideways if you had work to do or just wanted to look up things to do  etc  was not convenient and as I stated before was placed very strangely in the room  Besides that all else was pretty ok  This is not a budget hotel but more of a local hotel hang out and just a step above budget  If your on a budget though it s great to stay at instead of paying the prices of the Palms    across the street   or Rio next door  Both easy to walk to  So save your money for other things if your frequent those two hotels and their popular clubs  We also ate at their coffee shop  The Monterey Room        Actually it was good and cheap too  Funny thing  we ate the Red Rock Casino in Summerlin the night before at their buffet    which was good   but they use paper thin napkins     at over      a night   and the Gold Coast in their very understated coffee shop uses cloth ones  We would have no problem staying at the Gold Coast again  Just don t expect anything fancy or ritzy and you ll be ok with it  
P =>   Very nice Stayed here for two nights mid week  I was able to check in to my room at  pm  Per a previous review I read on this website I requested a room on the  th floor  It was spacious  clean and a great plasma TV as advertised  I had a partial view of the strip which was nice  I saw the  quot Forever Plaid quot  musical in the hotel which I recommend as a light  feel good show for the whole family  The food at the buffet was so so  Received a coupon book for various discounts at the hotel which was nice and the shuttle runs fairly often to the strip which was very convenient  I would certainly stay there again  
P =>  FAB HOTEL  My fiance and i stayed at the Gold Coast  th     th e  If you want somewhere nice to stay but dont want to pay a fortune the Gold Coast is perfect Lovely clean rooms  with large flat screen tv   Bathroom small but clean  Air con worked great  The bed was the most comfiest in the world    I would recommend a high floor  We stayed on the  th  hotel has   floors   It is a non smoking floor and very quiet Buffet food was lovely and only     for   for dinner  Didnt try the Italian  Cortez or Chinese restaurants  We had breakfast in the Montery Room a few times but there is a coffee shop which did yummy toasted bagels so we got coffee and bagels most mornings to take back to the room for breakfast and watched the world cup games in bed    roulette tables which i won     on most nights  and    blackjack tables  Staff were all really friendly Pool area was always quiet  no problem getting a sun bed  You had to go into the casino to get drinks tho as no pool bar and only waitress service some days Free Shuttle bus to the strip every       mins  It takes you to the Barbary coast which is right near Bellagio and Ceasors  Buses run til just after midnight Although its was     degrees outside we found all the casinos pretty chilly inside so girls bring a few nice cardy s to put on over your outfits We would definitely stay at the Gold coast again and highly recommend it  
P => Unexpectedly GOOD After reading some reviews and considering the price we paid for our room  I did not expect much  However we had a marvellous five nights in so many surprising ways  Our room  with flat screen TV   was larger than I had anticipated and included a bath  and a small wndow that we could open for fresh air and therefore switch the aircon off  The bed linen was a lovely quality cotton  The low limit roulette was a pleasant change in a nice environment  and the staff professional  Both of us had good wins with the slots which is unusual with the main Strip casinos  I had read the Gold Coast was smokey  but it was no worse than all the rest of them  The shuttle to the centre of the strip at Barbary Coast was a frequent and handy service and made the fact that we were off the strip of no significant disadvantage  I would have used the internet except for the     day charge  The other hotels that charge four times more are not necessarily four times better  
P =>  Fabulous value for money hotel and casino Recently returned from my   th trip to Las Vegas  staying for the first time at the Gold Coast Hotel  which is off the stip but is highly reccommended  The rooms were big with huge flat screen Tv s  and although the bathrooms were small  with the sink on the outside of the actual bathroom  the water pressure in the shower was brilliant The pool was heated  the pool attendant was friendly and helpful The casino had all the usual suspects  lots of  c slots  a poker room  and we even played bingo one night     sessions a day   There is also a huge bowling alley  which is open    hours  Don t disregard the free coupon book either as it had loads of useful coupons including free ice cream    free drinks per person  bowls and bingo offers etc We only ate in the hotel for breakfast  buffet both times  for the price it was excellent     for all you can eat  including fresh fruit  eggs benedict  yummy  noodles   and Keno  what more do you want      Ohh and no tip jar for the omelette fried egg station Short stroll from the Rio  if you re missing the action from a big trendy resort casino  But I d highly reccommed this hotel  and will definately stay again  
P =>  Great Hotel My wife and I  ages        stayed here               The hotel room was very spacious  besides the bathroom  but what do you do in a bathroom  besides go pee and shower  The TV is a flat screen TV  The casino was not good to us  but we had fun anyway  The food at the buffet was good  you must get a dessert it was awesome  We also ate at the Monterey room and it was good food  Make sure your gambling before you get a drink at the bar or you will pay full price  We took the shuttle everyday to the strip and at night we either took the CAT bus system back or RIO shuttle from Bally s casino  I would recommend everyone not to take the DUECE to downtown  The cleaning ladies were nice and cleaned our rooms  everyday around noon and we stayed on the  th floor  When you check in ask for a high room and the scenery is a little better than the  nd floor  The monorail was awesome goes from the Sahara to the MGM Grand and it was fast and easy  I would recommend gold coast to everyone  it s a walk form the Palms and RIO  We ate at the peppermill lounge and it was awesome  we ate in the lounge area  where you can only get drinks and applitizers and they have a dress code  all it is NO Hats  Then we ate at Toby Keith s bar at the Harrahs  it was an okay place  Ate at Jimmy Buffet s which was fun and the food was good  also at La Salsa at the Luxor I recommend this place  great food  We saw Louie Anderson  he is still funny  the only bad thing is his show is in the all male review show room and the seating s     If you go Downtown make sure you eat at Upper deck at the Las Vegas club casino and try the   pound burger and also get a drink or   at Mermaids  We also went to Gilley s at the Frontier casino  If you re not a country fan and it s not a Thursday night I would not go to it  It was cheap beer and bikini bull riding and       drinks for the ladies on Thursday night  All in all i might of lost a grand or    but i still had fun and everyone at Gold Coast made sure i did  
P =>  Pleasantly surprised Before arriving in Vegas  we expected that all the hotels would have large  dark  noisy casinos in the lobby area and so we were pleasantly surprised to find that at the Gold Coast it was a brightly lit  not too crowded area  OK we arrived at  am but we thought that Vegas would be at it at all hours of the day and night  The casino WAS open in the early hours  but at whatever time of day we passed through  it was always reasonable The room was very nice   on the  nd floor and strangely not at all affected by noise from downstairs  We had a kingsize bed as requested and lots of space  The bathroom  as another reviewer  has mentioned is dated   a lovely beige colour bathroom suite   but everything works well  The hotel was a fair walk from the Strip  especially if you had just spent the day walking up it and so pretty worn out by the time you hit the junction with W  Flamingo  We didn t notice the Shuttle bus to the Strip but it didn t bother us particularly  but if you find it then you may as well use it  The hotel is closest to the Rio and also Caesars Palace so you have entertainment not too far away   the Gold Coast didn t have any of its own  except the Casino   We d stay here again  
P =>  You canna beat the Gold Coast    For my   th birthday  my wife and i booked    nights at the gold coast  After reading most of the reviews  i had a general feeling  that as a working class couple  we would find the gold coast to our liking  and we certainly were not dissapointed  i cannot think of one negative aspect of our stay  and certainly  it is probably not for the better off  as luxury isnt really one of its selling points  for the majority  this is an excellent choice in vegas  the rooms are kept clean  and service at all outlets is good  special mention to robert and alex  at the back bar  they were very good  and chatty  you didnt feel like just another vegas visitor  food was fine enough  not michelin standard  but good enough  the shuttle service was good  quick  and the drivers all pleasant  so  all in all  the gold coast was superb  and we will be back  ian fae aberdeen scotland 
P =>  A good hotel to stay at  I some ways I don t like giving hotels good reviews as next time I want to stop there the price will probably be higher as everyone else has booked it  Howevr the Gold Coast is an excellent place to stay  The rooms are clean although the bathrooms are a little dated  the buffet is excellent value and the casino has low minimums  I had a great time playing roulette with    minimums and even though I was only gambling small amounts no one complained and the cocktail waitresses still came to me on a regular enough basis  Even though others have said it  the free shuttle to the strip is a definite advantage I had problems at check in due to a mix up by Hotels  but the staff sorted it out very quickly and efficiently  So forget my first sentence and stop there  
P =>  Great Deal  I just returned from a   night business stay at the gold coast  Ate at the breakfast buffet   mornings and for       i couldn t imagine paying double anywhere else  Made to order eggs were excellent along with the hash browns  Many choices to chose from  After a long day at a trade show grabbed a quick bite to eat at the Monterray room  Another great bargin didn t spend more then   bucks for a sandwich and fries  Room was very clean  For the money i would absolutely return  Best deal in town    
P => The Best Deal in Town My wife and I stayed for six nights from         to          We have stayed at many of the larger hotels over the years  Because of its off the strip location  a car is a necessity to really see the sights  The room was large but the bathroom was smaller than the typical bath  The room was clean and daily maid service and towel supplies were excellent  We did not like the quality of food at the Port s of Call Buffet but the price was right  The Forever Plaid show was great and was the highlight of the trip for the friends we took to the show  This show will appeal primarily to guests between    and     The show is very reasonable and for       more dinner at your choice of Gold Coast restaurants was included  The staff was very courteous and the hotel further reduced our already discounted room rate at check out for our table gaming card We hope to return to this hotel within the next year  
P => great hotel and location Stayed at the gold coast for a week in march      staff were friendly and helpful room was large and clean   only negative was that the view was obscured by a wall   I would suggest asking for a room on  th floor or above if this is important to you restaurants on site very good  especially Ping Pang Pong off the strip but free shuttle bus runs regularly every    mins or so straight to Barbary coast which is right on the strip opposite bellagio  Nice position less manic than strip  some good respite but close to the Palms and rio too free coupon booklet on arrival which gives various reductions including  free coctails  free icecream    for   bowling  free souvenirs  shop discount etc would definately stay here again  Fun but not pretentious  
P => Go for Gold  A bit doubtfull before we arrived as it is slightly  quot off strip quot  when we arrived  from the easy check in to the spotlessly clean rooms with great beds i had nothing to be concerned about  As for the bathrooms  reviews saying the cielings are low  well i m  ft  quot  and had no problems  Ok you couldn t hold a party in there  but would you want to  New towels every day and bed linen every few days or so  The cleanliness is something to shout about  i can put up with most stuff except bad cleaning   that didn t happen here  If you do have a car with you then use the Valet parking facility  for a couple of dollars it is well worth the lack of hunting for a space to park  The buffet was great value for all meal times  much cheaper than the strip hotels  the quality of food was also extremely high  i should know   The Monteray room open    hours also provides good food at very reasonable cost  The tables are not too expensive with    minimum on the roulette  the waitress service  the free drinks  while at the tables was quick and frequent  again    a time for the waitress brings her back quickly   One last thing  make sure you use your vouchers  given to you at check in  as they make a bit of difference  The bowling is fab value  The seatle coffee is great  No i have no connection with this place except to say we will return next spring By The Way  we have been to vegas   times now so i have made comparissons  
P => Not again After planning a three night stay at the Gold Coast Casino in Las Vegas recently we checked out after one night  The casino and hotel in general were very smokey  perhaps because it is an older hotel  The clencher that made us check out was the noise in the hall during the night  The hotel door was very light so every sound was heard  We would not stay there again  no matter what kind of a deal we received  
P =>  Well Happy      guys stayed in   rooms from   th to   st ch       The check in was fast  the staff were polite and helpful in trying to get us   rooms close to each other  The rooms were spacious and clean and although our view was of a brick wall   nd floor  this didn t bother us as we only slept there The casino is small but busy and the waitress service for cocktails was fairly fast and friendly  some nice lookers too   We ate the graveyard special a few times at the Monteray Diner which was cheap and decent  Terrible Mikes burger bar wasn t up to much and that s about it really  We would stay there again as its only a   minute walk to the Rio or the Palms  both very nice  and is only   mins to the Barbary Coast on the free shuttle or   bucks plus tip in a taxi to just about anywhere on the strip Stay at the Gold Coast    
P =>   Great Hotel  Though I stayed at this hotel last year and now writing a review  I just felt that I had to help out and say that this is one of the better hotels in the Las Vegas area  Check in was swift  and the rooms were decent with internet access  I got this hotel for    bucks a night  thanks to a Priceline guarantee and some extra research on the internet  Now for   bucks  anyone can say that they got the better end of the bargain at any hotel  amp  casino  but in this hotel you get a great rate  you re within walking distance to the Rio and Palms  a short drive over the overpass to the Strip  a good place to sleep away from the bustle of the Strip  and friendly workers as well  The food at the Monterey Room was good  The steak and eggs meal for       made me day  actually almost every day I was there  The breafast and lunch buffet was decent too for       and       respectively  Did I also mention    cent hot dogs   The gift shop had anything you need for a good souvenier  I also got a free coupon for free ice cream  a   for   at the buffet  and a discount at the bowling center which I didn t go check out   Overall this place is great not only for the budget traveler but everyone else also  I still head out to vegas about once a month  I have a vacation home there now so no need to stay at hotels anymore  but I still eat the buffets and restaurants at the Gold Coast and play my penny slot Mr  Cashman  and Millionizer machines there too   
P =>  Going back again  My husband and I stayed at the Gold Coast in mid uary for   nights  We had booked a   for   seat sale through Allegiant air out of Bellingham  for a mere       for the two of us  hotel included  We were a little sceptical at first  but after reading the reviews on tripadvisor  thought it was worth a try  What exceptional value for the money  The room  although older  was very large and clean  The    s style bathroom    I think the toilet and tub were blue    was small  but sufficient  We ate breakfast at the buffet every morning  and for       per head  it was a feast  We certainly didn t need lunch  It included several breakfast choices  as well as Chinese food  etc  Something for every taste  The best part was they also had a free shuttle that ran every    mins  and dropped you smack dab in the middle of the strip  What more could you ask for  We have now booked another trip for e with the same great deal through Allegiant  I can t wait  
P =>   Gold Coast not exactly nice    Stayed for a week for a conference  and would not return except for cheap gambling  and decent Italian restaurant for the prices  The rooms are terrible  beds with cheap foam mattresses  and bathrooms were tiny with      s decor  I m not sure how they consider the rooms remodeled when all they really did was add new light fixtures  Everything was bolted down including TV  IRON  and even hangers   not exactly a good sign   spend a little extra and get something on the strip  MGM grand West Wing worth the extra     
P => Unbelievable value We just got back from a three night stay here at the Gold Coast  and all we can say is  WOW  We are young   well  we think so  anyway     and       so when my mom and dad recommended the Gold Coast  we were hesitant  because of the cheap room rates  We are VERY picky travellers and like to stay nice  My parents are in their late   s and stay there regularly  being from Arizona  We were very pleasantly surprised at how really great this little gem of a hotel is  We got Mustang Mike s midweek special  which was          nights total  not per person  for two nights and included buffet breakfast one morning and buffet dinner one night    with a full size bottle of wine with the dinner  The third night was      You do have to book well in advance to get these rates  and they are on the website We ate one night very late in the cafe and it was awesome  best bowl of Wor Wonton and egg roll I ve ever had  And it was cheap  too  The buffet food was great  not a bad item there  Not a whole lot of ambience  just very homey  There is a Seattle s best coffee with the best Raspberry White Chocolate Chip cookies I ve ever had  Also a restaurant to get really good cheap cheeseburgers  and a fancy steakhouse  which we didn t try The rooms were fine  nothing more than what you need in Las Vegas  unless you plan on entertaining in your room  They have a very small bathroom  good water pressure  and they are VERY clean  We were in the room hardly at all    it s Vegas  baby The hotel is next door to the Rio  and across from Palms  which  surprisingly we liked neither better than the Gold Coast  We would go back to the Gold Coast tomorrow if we could      
P => Great Hotel Great Price We stayed in the Gold Coast for   nights last   The Room Room was large  very clean and nicely decorated  The bathroom looked a little dated being dark brown  but the power shower was amazing  so the colour was a fine compromise  Sink just outside the bathroom and open wardrobe  which was very convenient  It was great to have a large double bed each  this is never the case in the UK  The Location It s situated just off the main part of the Strip  and offers a fantastic FREE shuttle bus service  there are back  which we hardly ever waited more than a couple of minutes for  Failing that   it doesn t cost much to take a taxi  The hotel was actually a lot nearer to the strip than i was expecting  It takes far shorter time to get from the Gold Coast to the main area of the Strip than does to travel up in all the traffic from cheaper hotels lower down the Strip e g  Stardust  Riviera  Stratosphere etc The Price Gold Coast offers some very reasonable rates  We paid about     weekday and      weekend for the room  I ve seen cheaper too   depends when you re going  Also  they ll match any price  I emailed them a cheaper price i d found and they matched it All In All If you want a reasonable  good quality hotel for your Vegas stay  go for the Gold Coast  It s a smaller hotel so you dont have to walk miles to your room  It doesn t offer huge attractions  but you go and see these on the Strip  I think it s a great find  
P => Good accomodation for the price Stayed at the Gold Coast three night in     for        total  The bathroom is small  the rooms are big  the bed was fine  we spent very little time in our room  so it served its purpose well  We do not go to Vegas to spend alot on a room that we are never in  The shuttle worked out fine for us  We only tried the buffet once for lunch  it was fine  We paid twice the money for a lunch buffet on the strip  and don t think it was as good  The chinese restaurant in the back was very good  lots of choice good prices and open until     am  Would stay there again anyday  
P => Good Value but choose a non smoking room We stayed at the Gold Coast Casino ruary           We arrived late and was quickly booked into a room  no preference was asked upon booking through expedia  however  it turned out to be a smoking room on the first floor due to the hotel being fully booked  The whole floor was quite bad with cigarette smoke and we requested a change first thing the next morning  The front desk were very accommodating and very pleasant to deal with  The rooms have good beds and have all the ammenities you should require  The food at the Gold Coast was excellent and we actually forked  no pun intended  out        each for a buffet at the rio and thought that the food at the Gold Coast buffet was equal or better for          I would reccommend staying in a non smoking room and eating at the Gold Coast buffet  I would return  
P =>  Cheap rate for a Saturday night We opted to stay at the Gold Coast for a Saturday night to avoid the high rent district of the Strip and then we moved to the Strip for the rest of the week  One reason we chose the Gold Coast was its close proximity to the Rio and the Palms  We wanted to check out those places The Rio was fun and lively  the Palms was calmer and not quite so impressive  I actually liked the casino in the Gold Coast better than both of them  It was bright and well lit  It was easy to walk through  Everything wasn t so crammed together We ate in the Chinese restaurant  which was excellent  The rooms were quite bland and very average  The bell service was slow and the front desk personnel exuded very little personality All in all I would say it is an average place  but a good price makes it above average  I would stay there again if the need arose  
P => Stay here every year  I stay here every year  The rooms are adequate and the hotel is quiet  Love the free shuttles to Barbary Coast  the new Sun Coast and the Orleans  The employees are very friendly and helpful  The restaurants are excellent and the Monterrey Room Coffee Shop is a great deal with great food  The price for the stay is a definite plus  
P =>  Can t beat what you get for the price Found a great deal on the web    nights for only      total  Very clean  fairly quiet rooms  All the staff treated us great  Valets where fast  Short walk over to the Palms  amp  Rio  Free shuttle to the strip was easy  Only thing we had a hard time with was getting a cab at the hotel  Would we stay there again  you bet  
P => A little gem off the strip  My husband and I have just returned from   nights at The Gold Coast Hotel  After reading mixed reviews I wasn t sure what to expect but we certainly weren t disappointed and would definitely return  All the staff were friendly and helpful  except for one croupier but no place is perfect   The    hour coffee shop serves excellent  simple food     although if you aren t used to American sized portions  don t go for two entrees  We can also recommend Arriva  the Italian restaurant  which was great   the frontage doesn t do the interior justice  The food at Ping Pang Pong can also be recommended  The shuttle to the Barbary Coast is a great way to get on to the strip quickly  but the location of the Gold Coast makes it a good hotel from which to walk to Palms or Rio  The room was serviced really well every day  The shower is dark but the water was constantly hot with good pressure  which made up for it  They also have coffee machines in the room so you can make a fresh cup of filtered coffee each day  If you can  ask for a room on a high floor so you get a good view  The swimming pool area was being refurbished but looked like it d be a great place to relax in the summer  If you are looking for great value in a clean  friendly hotel with convenient access to the strip  then look no further  
P => Would stay again at the Gold Coast   My husband and I decided to spend New Year s in Las Vegas instead of alseep on the couch in front of the TV  What a great idea  I think we may have to make this an annual event  We stayed at the Gold Coast because  as both of us are public school teachers  we just can t afford the inflated holiday prices of some of the hotels  We had stayed at the GC s sister property  the Orleans last year  so we were not hesitant to stay here  It was wonderful   The pace was slower  everyone was friendly and helpful  the layout was very easy to navigate  and I truly looked forward to returning every night to the GC  The clientele is a bit older   we are          and I actually found that to be an asset  Immediate check in  Room very pleasant  Restaurant prices very reasonable  breakfast buffet is less than    and the  graveyard special  is        You even get a coupon for a free graveyard special in your funbook upon check in   We had rented a car   recommended    and just took off every day  On New Year s Eve  we simply walked to the Strip to watch the fireworks  Took about    minutes  but I think if we do this next year  we will simply stay at the GC and watch from our rooms  as we had a great view  I played the penny machines and had the best luck on  Jackpot Party   Actually WON       I would stay here again in a heartbeat  If you are not dead set on a fancy shmancy place where everyone is trying to impress everyone and you just want an affordable  clean room with a wonderful casino and restaurants that won t bust your budget  try the GC  
P =>  Quite Right For The Price I live in Northern California and decided to spend a  quot heathen s Christmas quot  this year in Las Vegas  I booked through Allegiant Airlines  an excellent option for travel to Vegas if you live in or near an Allegiant city   better than Southwest   I opted for the Gold Coast because it was  quite simply  the least expensive of the hotels from which to choose Being very well travelled  I knew that I shouldn t expect opulence from the least expensive hotel casino on the list  One of the biggest sources of frustration and dissatisfaction when traveling comes when people don t do their research  then have unrealistically high expectations The Gold Coast Hotel  amp  Casino was pretty much what I had expected  It s about   mile off The Strip  and quite cozy  with all the amenities that you could reasonably ask for from such a place  However  due to its off the strip location and lower price  you won t see too many Gucci  Prada  and Cartier draped high rollers  if you aren t familiar with those three brands  then the Gold Coast is perfect for you    you WILL see an abundance of senior citizens and younger  backpacker types  as well as endless low end foreign tourists Both my check in and check out were slightly long  The clerks weren t terribly personable and seemed stressed out and rushed  but I didn t take that personally The casino is quite adequate  although the carpet betrays its age  There is a buffet and a    hour restaurant where the food is good The rooms are large and pleasant  although the hotel DOES get a big demerit for having completely dark showers The Gold Coast runs a free shuttle every    minutes to its sister property  the Barbary Coast  which is on The Strip  Therefore  for the savvy traveller  it is much smarter to pay the bargain rates at the Gold Coast  then shuttle over to The Strip and enjoy the over the top elegance of the landmarks like Caesar s Palace  the MGM Grand  and New York New York All in all  if you are looking for adequate lodging and plan to spend most of your time in Las Vegas out of your hotel  look into the Gold Coast One final note  If you choose to use BellTrans airport shuttle when you leave  regardless of the hotel you re using   be VERY wary  specify with them EXACTLY where your pickup should be  Two other travellers and I waited almost one hour for a BellTrans shuttle that never came  Their defense was that it HAD come  and on time  We figured out that the driver had gone to the wrong hotel entrance  not seen us  and had left  We ended up having to take a taxi  
P =>  Improvements Appreciated  I stayed at Gold Coast   years ago  and it was awful  In that time  the rooms have been remodeled and are significantly better  but still below the standards of most other hotel casinos in Vegas  Food and service at the buffet was average  Nothing terrible about my stay  just nothing that really makes me want to go back  
P =>  Great place to stay Just return from a tour of the Vegas area  this hotel was our base for the last   days there  What can i say first  second and last impressions of this hotel are brilliant  Friendly staff  great rooms  excellent dinning and fantastic location  Arrived early morning            and was told room was ready for imediate use  Even thou the hotel is off the strip the hotel run a shuttle every       minutes to there sister hotel the Barbery Coast right in the middle of the strip  All the shuttle drivers are friendly and great fun  The hotel is only a few steps away from the Rio which is worth a vist just for the free di Gra in the sky show  Lots of pretty girls an hunky men   
P =>  Excellent    Stay Play Casino and Hotel   I haven t stayed in the Gold Coast since the month it opened back about    years ago That    day stay was superb The   day stay from          thru          was no different The Casino play was always excellent  laid back  easy going  with exceptionally nice floor people  dealers  waitresses  and bartenders  EVERYONE was nice  courteous and always willing to take the time to help  or profer answers The Food was as good as it gets  in the Monterey Room  with the BEST Chinese food I have had in years  Then the Filet Mignon meal was FORK TENDER  and cooked exactly as ordered  Breakfast at Monterey Room was excellent and service was FIVE STAR       The buffet was opulent with the choices and the service and courtesy were  again  at the top of the list of all the    Casinos I have stayed in the last    years The Rooms Well  my room was Clean  neat  and cooled well at night and day  The towels were clean  daily  the floors and room cleaned exceptionally well each day TV  WEB Access  Room Service  Wakeup Calls  Housekeeping were top level Price is in the mid level range  and actually QUITE LOW  when considering all the niceties that are provided and the warmth and amiable attitude of the entire staff  including the Valets EVERY need  every request  were attended promptly and satisfactorily I know it may sound silly  but THERE WAS NOT ONE  ZERO  ZILCH  NADA  negative thing or things during the entire stay Gold Coast is a winner  DO NOT MISS the chance to stay in this excellent Casino Hotel  You cannot go wrong A M  quot Tuffy quot  SamsGarland  Texas 
P =>  Dated rooms nice pool The rooms here are dated and in need of refurbishment  Very small bathroom  don t try swinging a cat    Matress was very odd   it seemed fine once used to it  but to start with it felt like we were sinking into it Pool area was nice  with two permanent attendants   warmest pool we used during two weeks and six hotels visited The free shuttle bus to and from the Strip is very useful   and regular  The last one back to the hotel is at      am  so make sure you re outside the Barbary Coast before then  
P =>  Worth considering Gold Coast is   blocks off the main Strip  It is smaller than the Strip hotels which means that you can find you way to the elevators without getting lost    The clients are older so the place is a bit quieter  It is a typical Vegas hotel  good standard  They give you a coupon book when you check in  the free ice cream is really good   There is usually music singers at night that you can watch for free The free shuttle service to the Strip was great  we never had to wait for a shuttle We went to Cirque s Mystere at Treasure Island which was amazing  Mystere is the only one of the Cirque shows to have a lot of humour in it  It was hard to not finish on the floor because of laughing too much  We got the best seats in the house and were in the front row  I would NOT recommend the front row as you have to peer through the barrier onto the stage  Also they choose a male from the front row to become part of the show  he takes an active part    But try to book in the front block as the expressions on the faces of the performers were well worth paying the higher price  NOTE  Cirque do not discount their tickets  You can buy half price  quot on the day quot  shows at a place along the strip  but you won t get the major shows like Cirque cheap We visited the light show at Fremont Street  When we were there several years ago and thought it was amazing so were keen to repeat the experience  We were disappointed as the themes were cars and girls doing pole dances  be it depends on your interest but it did not seem as well presented as last time  Also this area of town still does not feel safe  The actual street of Fremont is fine but walking to your car is a bit freaky The best hotel for things to see is  quot Belligeio quot   They have a theme garden display which was  quot Fall quot  in ober and was stunning  The fountain display which starts at  pm is music with water and is well worth it  We returned for the night displays which were great but thought coloured lighting would have made it just amazing  Some of the outdoor shows were cancelled because of high winds  they ought to live in Wgtn NZ    and one poor young boy was beside himself with grief when they cancelled the pirate show  parents be warned    
P =>  maybe not gold but close enough   stayed at the gold coast for   nights in october       the personnel were freindly and very helpful  the shuttle to the strip is an easy ride  the rooms were clean and comfortable  one problem with the room was although it was on the  th floor you could hear the delivery trucks early in the am  the bathroom wasn t that small  the buffet breakfast was pretty good and very reasonable  the casino has cheap tables  the slots are outdated  and they really don t have alot of       machines  great location if you plan on using a car to see the sights off the strip  easy accessibility to rt      the lounge show  quot the elements quot  were very good  
P =>  Very Displeased with the Gold Coast Hotel We stayed at the Gold Coast Hotel for   nights   then switched over to the Rio   The rooms were terrible   they were not renovated as they claim   the bathroom ceiling was only   feet high   no room to move inside it   the sink and tub were chipped and ancient  The decor was not South Western as listed on their advertising   it was very dark and nothing matched   it had very inexpensive furniture and a small old TV set  They don t change the sheets everyday   unless you make a special request  I checked in as a Handicapped guest   but was given the worst room on the floor by an inexperienced and uncaring front desk clerk   my room was at the end of the hall   a long walk   The manager did not apologize or offer help   she claimed that I must have been one of the last guest to arrive and got the worst room for that reason as per hotel policy  The location of this hotel is not good   it s far from the strip where the action is   they have a free shuttle for guests   but there is a wait and the ride to their sister hotels is not direct  If you insist on staying here   note that their prices vary from day to day   they claim that they will honor any lower rate that they or any other site lists   if they can verify it  If you do find lower rates   call them   and then have an email confirmation sent to you for proof  When I checked out they didn t want to honor the lower price they quoted me   I stood my ground and eventually had it adjusted  There are numerous superior hotels on the strip   if you check their websites you can find special  quot hot quot  deals   their prices also change from day to day  Avoid the Time Share sharks   they are located in many of the hotels   they are very aggressive with their misleading free offers  Check the local magazines for discounts for shows and meals  
P => Gold Coast   comfortable beds         My wife and I stayed at the Gold Coast during our tember      trip to Las Vegas  We took the free shuttle from Barbary Coast on the strip  The free shuttle runs until midnight every day   and got to check in right away  The front desk staff was very friendly and informative  The King sized bed in our hotel room was THE MOST COMFORTABLE HOTEL BED WE HAVE EVER SLEPT IN  Combined with the expansive super cheap breakfast buffet at Gold Coast  WE LOVED THIS PLACE       If you want to save money on hotel costs while in Vegas  and want to sleep like a baby  STAY AT THE GOLD COAST           
P =>  Nice place to stay My husband and I stayed at the Gold Coast Hotel and Casino back in       Memorial day week  I found a fantastic hotel rate on Travelocity for        per night  I love staying at the Orleans  a sister hotel  so we decided to give it a try  The hotel is a little older and in need of an upgrade  but we did have a nice stay  We received a non smoking room with a comfortable king size bed  The bathroom is a little tight  but it does the job  The coupon book that they give you has some useful coupons  especially the free icecream from Kate s Korner  The casino area is very nice  The gambling was good and the blackjack dealers were friendly  There is bowling and bingo to also keep you occupied  There is also  a free shuttle that takes you to the sister hotels  the Barbary Coast  Orleans and I beleive the Sun Coast  Check in and out were hassle free  We received a coupon upon checking out that invited you back for a free   night stay during the week of tember  th to the  th  If you are offered this coupon  I would suggest to book your room before getting on the plane to go home  I forgot and called a week later and all the nights were booked up  They did offer me a   night stay and that is how we ended our Las Vegas vacation for tember  We had a redeye flight and we had the room to rest and freshen up and got in a little gamibling before heading off to the airport late Thursday night which worked out well  We would stay here in the future  we had a nice time at a friendly hotel and a good area  It s not the strip  but well worth the money  
P =>  Okay if you want to stay put a gamble Our room was nice and clean  but the bathroom was very small  There is little to do here besides gamble and the casino is very smokey  However  ther is a free shuttle to the strip  
P =>  No complaints about the Gold Coast We stayed at the Gold Coast for   weeks from may   th  and we had no complaints at all  like many previous reviews have said  the bathroom was very small but nothing to complain about  The bed was comfy and huge  and the room was nicely decorated and very spacious  we were on the eighth floor and it was very quiet  no noise could be heard from the rooms either side  though you could hear people on the landing  Coupon books are very good  lots of freebies  don t be afraid to use them  the shuttle bus is brilliant  runs about every    mins depending on how busy the traffic is on the way to the strip  we used to get the gold coast shuttle to the strip and the rio shuttle back  walk through the garage from rio  only takes   mins  We enjoyed every minute of our time in Vegas   our  th time  and we would stay at the GC again  Only bad thing about the holiday was the flight  we booked premier gold with airtours and it was terrible  the seats were economy seats with a bit of extra leg room  a complaint is on it s way to them with many others i suspect  Unfortunately Airtours are the only airline at present that fly direct from Manchester  lets hope another airline flies direct next year  
P =>  Superb We have now stopped at the Gold Coast twice and the place is fantastic its better than all the pretend casinos on the strip  here the bar tenders actually remember you and the staff look after you as if they know you  The rooms are extremely clean as they have the best maids i have come across in vegas and we have stayed at   other places including the so called luxery places Bellagio etc  If you want Vegas stop at the Gold Coast if you want pretend Vegas stop somewher else  
P => Great Value We stayed at the Gold Coast     e    Asked for a room as high as possible and as far away from the elevators as possible  Got the   floor  of     and had a great view of the Palms across the street  Our room was very clean so no complaints there  The only thing I didn t like was the tiny bathroom  I get a little cloustrophobic so I left the door open most of the time since it was small  We went over to the Rio a couple times as a friend was staying there and it was dead  Lots more action at the Gold Coast  Had a nice band playing at night to dance to Check in was a breeze as only   people in front of me when we got there  Everyone was pleasant  Our remote stopped working the first night and they replaced the batteries the next day and gave us a  nd one also  No complaints there  We checked out at    the day we left  but plane didn t leave until      pm so we checked our bags with the bell desk and had no problems when we picked them up  Great value and great service  I would recommmend to all  
P => We had a great time at the Gold Coast  My boyfriend and I stayed at the Gold Coast            We had a great time  The staff was very friendly  A few minutes after arriving  staff arrived at our door with a coffee maker as our room did not have one which was nice  The beds were among the most comfortable as far as hotel rooms go  We paid to have the wireless service activated and found the set up to be very user friendly compared to other hotels We had fun playing bingo for the first time  It is true that there are a lot of senior citizens here but we did not mind and found everyone very friendly  This hotel is very convenient to the strip  The casino is big  but offers a limited variety of    cent slot machines  Blackjack min  bets are low here   we played at a    table and my boyfriend won            We will stay here again for sure  It is less expensive  has more comfortable beds and better service than the strip hotels I ve stayed at  
P => Great Beds  My sister and I just got back from three days in Vegas  Neither of us had stayed at the Gold Coast before  so we were pleasantly surprised  The price was right         per night  and the bed was the MOST COMFORTABLE one I had ever slept in  The casino wasn t real smokey  and the table games were great  We didn t eat there so I can t give a review on the restaurants  We will definitely come back again  
P =>  Had a Blast Stayed at the Gold Coast    th   th  There were   of us in our mid late    s  This hotel is about location  location  location  Sandwiched between the Palms and Rio  you are able to party at the hot spots and walk home  For the Rio  just cut through the parking garage  And the Palms is just across the street  The first night we hit the Ghost Bar at the Palms  We only had to wait in line for    or so minutes  Figuring out what line your in almost takes longer Rain Ghostbar    We all highly recommend the buffet at the Gold Coast  It s awesome   There s a ton of variety and you can t beat the price  We also ate at Terrible Mike s one night for something different  It s o k   fries were good  Monterrey was o k   mixed reviews between us all  The Palms restaurant Geradino sp   has       steak and eggs after midnight which was good  We took the free shuttle to the Barbary Coast on the strip everday  It s a perfect drop off spot  Easy access to the Billagio fountains  Ceasar s  etc  The fountains at the Bellagio are   x better at night versus the day  Ceasar s has some cool clubs that we enjoyed  The Pussycat Dolls Lounge and Pure  Beware  You ll have to stand at the Pussycat Dolls Lounge  they don t allow you to sit unless you order a bottle of liquor  cheapest bottle is       If you get there early  pm  there s no cover and you ll get free access to PURE when it opens  Each night we went to Palms we saw celebrities  also keep your eyes out in the airport for the celebs  The pool at Gold Coast is great for your self esteem  Remember  the majority of the people at G C  are much older  You re not at your hotel all that much  and G C  was clean and friendly  And cheap food  Rio has some cool clubs  Bikini s you ll get a taste of this club when you walk in the front door   Voodoo Lounge  at the top   We visited the Tilted Kilt which was a nice layed back bar  fun to chill  Bring your walking shoes for the day and your sexy outfits for night  Girls  I d recommend something low cut to maybe get you on  quot the list quot  at the nightclubs  Guys and girls  jeans were acceptable at all of the clubs  but look hot Cabs from the strip to G C  cost us a little under     The free shuttle stops at   pm  
P =>  loved the gold coast stayed here for two weeks  great value for money and not to far from the strip  can walk there safely in about    minutes although taxis are cheap enough  rooms in gold coast are spacious and yes the beds are very comfy you will be given coupon books for money off many activities in the hotel buffet restaurant and other restaurants serve really nice food and are great value for money It is a great place to stay especially if you are there for more than a week coz other hotels are massive and a little impersonal  At gold coast it is safe and the security is  st class we were really pleased with all aspects of the gold coast and will not stay anywhere else when we return staff were helpful and love the english so it makes sense to stay there where you will be looked after  poker room is small but good fun because all the locals use this hotel and you get to know about things to do where to go etc  at the rio hotel which is next door  short cut through car park  there is a lot going on  go and eat at the tilted kilt  nice food and a good pint of boddingtons  For all the girls out there     Chippendales have their own club there and it is worth every penny  the lads will have a good night at the tilted kilt while you enjoy a brilliant show  you must visit all the big hotels but unless you have kids miss out circus circus definately not to our taste but you can get a nice massive hot dog next door at slots of fun for a dollar and a bottle of heineken for   c  a brilliant show to see at the luxor is blue man group  very alternative but is a must see Anyway  back to the gold coast  make sure you sign up for a card that you put in the slots before you start playing coz you can earn money to spend anywhere in the hotel if your lucky you can eat and drink for next to nothing although drinks are cheap enough anyway  we had good weather and it was lovely to lie around the pool for a couple of hours in the morning before venturing out for the day  it is only small but plenty of room for everyone pool warm and inviting  very clean  if you get tired of rushing around everyday you will be thankful of the quiet poolside we saw absolutely every hotel but am glad we chose the gold coast  believe me  for the money you will not get anywhere as good  we will definately be returning to the gold coast  hello to john thames  a really nice bloke who is a dealer in the poker room  alan is sorry he never got to say goodbye but will be back  To all of you who are visiting this hotel in the near future  have a great time you will love it     x ALAN x ANNE  blackpool  England  
P => Had a great stay  My husband  sister  a friend  and I stayed at the Gold Coast for   nights in ch  We arrived early in the day      am and had to wait until after     pm to check in a very long line that moved quickly   We stayed for     a night on the Mastercard promo  Overall it was a very good value  We enjoyed the gaming there and the Palms resort is just across the street  The rooms are average size and the bathroom is tiny but the shower had good pressure and there was always hot water  The room was very clean  The walls are a little thin and you can hear whatever is going on in the hallways  They have good coffee at the Seattle s Best stand in the lobby and the Italian restaurant had great food and service  The hotel is nothing fancy but very comfortable  I would return in a heartbeat  
P => good value comfy bed We stayed for   days in        Checkin was quick  bed super comfy  breakfast buffet yummy especialy the mexican part  Hubby won      on videopoker  I played for a long time on      The bathroom is small and a bit dark at night but that did not deterr us  We ll be back Gold Coast 
P =>  clean and affordable This is a decent place to stay for a good price  It s been remodeled recently so everything in the room was new and clean  There is a free shuttle to the strip every    minutes  You get a better room if you check in early on Friday rather that Saturday  There is lots of free parking  and the staff is friendly and helpful  
P =>  Loved the Gold Coast If you re looking for a less frantic pace than the strip this is the place to go  I found the staff very friendly and helpful the room a little small but very clean and everything in working order  They have several restaurants to choose from and a buffet that serves breakfast  lunch  and dinner  If you tire of the Gold Coast  the Palms and the Rio hotels are across the street  and the hotel offers free shuttle service to the Orleans and the Barbary Coast which is located on the strip  I plan on going back  
P =>  I worried unnecessarily I was very worried about booking at this hotel  BUT was pleasantly surprized and pleased  Our room was very clean and spacious  a bit dated  but who cares  you are not buying the place   and the beds were the most comfortable we slept in after travelling all over the world  Check in was really good and quick  the casino very bright and not smoky  and the shuttle was so easy to visit the strip  I would certainly stay here again  so if you want value for money  cleanliness  and peace and quiet  after the strip  stay here  The only downside  was that some of the staff in the Monterey restaurant  and one girl serving in Seattle Coffee shop  had a bit of an attitude problem  Apart from that  everything was great  and the Americans there  loved listening to our English accents  which was really nice  
P => Wonderful Hotel The Gold Coast was actually much better than I had expected quality wise  The room was very clean and spacious  The casino was large and spacious and the staff was amazingly friendly  The food options were limited but I never ate dinner there with all the other options on the strip and in near by hotels  This is a great place to stay if you are looking for a quality hotel room for a fraction of the price  You are not on the strip but the Palms Casino and The Rio are right across the street  I would definately recommend the Gold Coast and will personnaly go back I give it only four stars because there are many other hotels in Las Vegas that warrent a score of Excellent  The Gold Coast is older but definately not aged  
P =>  Love the Gold Coast The Gold Coast is the place to stay  We make our room reservations before we make our plane reservations  The Gold Coast is not only friendly  the service is excellent and the security even better  The rooms are clean and have all your necessities for a great stay  You don t need a huge room with all the frills of a expensive casino   you are only there to sleep enough so you can get out and start another vacation day of great fun  
P =>  If you like Bingo and parting with     year olds This place is for you  Stop what you are doing and book right now  Seriously  My wife and I stayed there for   nights  early    s  and found it acceptable  The food at the Chinese place was pretty good  Rooms were small but clean  Bathrooms were so small I could get only   body part wet at a time  Casino is a bit on the dingy side but Im not hard to please  Met one of the  quot old quot  harlem globe trotters in the sports book  They have a shuttle that will run you to the strip or you could walk across a   lane highway to either the Rio or Palms  I actually got up early one day and played bingo  What a trip  I thought you got bingo when ever you got all the numbers in one line  I did and screamed bingo out in front of     old people  They were not amused because the game was little diamond or something LOL  I got reprimanded by the old woman to the left of me with an oxygen tank to not yell again unless I had it  In Summary  I can have fun any where I go  I had fun here too but if you are looking for a place that has a bit of class or a place where you can  quot dress up quot  this place is not for you  I personally had fun kicking it with the oldies for a while  I spent most of my time on the strip  
P =>  you get what you pay for Stayed uary           Check in was smooth  room was ok  bathroom very  very small and toilet malfunctioned  Bed has a foam mattress and three tiny flat pillows for a  quot California King quot  bed  It was clean however  Just stayed the one night as we had room booked at Bellagio for our last three nights  Fun book wasn t of much use except for delicious ice cream  worth         Hot dog a very good deal for    cents at the sportsbook  Staff was very friendly  Took shuttle to Orleans for breakfast buffet  very good  for       Shuttle doesn t start til      which I feel is a bit too late in the morning  We paid        for the night so I guess you get what you pay for  I would not stay again as it is out of the way and even with the shuttle it gets full and sometimes you have to wait much longer than the every    minutes they say they run  
P =>  great price for the location We did our annual group trip to las vegas and stayed at the gold coast this year jan   th       great rooms  good casino  no let it ride tables which was a little disapointing  great location  short walk to the palms and rio  clean  clean  clean  nice sports book with a    cent hot dog stand     free shuttle to barbary coast and orleans casinos  you won t be disapointed at this place              
P => Great for the price   My boyfriend and I stayed at the Gold Coast          We loved it because it was off of the strip away from the busy street  It provided shuttle service to the strip  which other hotels don t offer  We are not gamblers  so we didn t care to check out the tables or slots  The price for food  hotel  and other attractions at the Gold Coast were great  I would recommend this hotel for people who are on a budget and would rather spend their money on other things while in Vegas  
P =>  Stay here gamble and eat elsewhere Stayed second week of      Check in was no problem  and they gave me a room away from the elevators  quieter   Room was adequate  though the bathroom was tiny when compared to today s newer budget hotels  Maid service was adequate  Would have preferred a sink in the bathroom  The dining areas and gambling floor didn t look inviting  and the gambling floor smells like an ash tray  seems to attract the low roller chain smoker  Gamble and eat elsewhere in Vegas  but for those looking for an inexpensive and clean safe hotel room can t go wrong here  and having the Rio and Palms next door and accross the street helps  
P => Love the Gold Coast My wife and I stayed at the Gold Coast from ember    to ember    We had a great time  The staff was friendly and very helpfull  This is a smaller hotel and all of the hotel is a short walk not like the larg hotels The food at the buffet is excellent and the coffe shop is great alsoWe would recommend this property to any one over     
P =>  Great start to a great holiday Started our recent trip in ember    to USA here for   nights  and what a good start  Plenty of free parking  quick check in and friendly staff The room was excellent  large and spacious  although quite a small bathroom but as someone else said   who spends a lot of time in a bathroom  The room was quiet and clean  heard very little noise from the outside corridor and even less from outside The food at breakfast was excellent and we enjoyed a great steak buffet on the Sunday evening Free shuttle buses to The Strip were a great bonusAll in a great place to stay  would recommend any one to stay there and made better by winning on the slots     
P =>  wonderful Stay I spent from    to     at the Gold Coast  It was a great place off the strip  The shuttle service to the strip and to the Orleans were an added bonus for getting around  I joined the players club and ended up eating free for my trip  The buffet was good  They have plenty of variety  The slots were generous on my first night there but they ended up keeping what I had won  Romms werer big and comfortable  I would deffinately go back again  
P =>  Solid stay for  st time off strip We stayed at the GC from ober   nd     th  This is our  th straight fall in Las Vegas and we ve stayed at everywhere from the Imperial Palace to the MGM and we found the Gold Coast to measure up quite nicely The beds WERE quite comfortable and the hotel is very easy to get in and out of if you re heading to the strip  vs  MGM   Shuttle to strip was solid and the buffet was very good and a great value  Also  they have a free workout room that is very nice by hotel standards Gaming was fine but the sports book was a little smoky for our tastes  All in All  t says will be coming back 
P =>  great value for your dollar I am not about to compare apples to oranges  as comparing the Gold Coast to other Strip location hotels would not be fair  It isn t glamorous  nor close to the action  but it makes up for it in so many ways  The hotel is clean  the casino is expansive and well lit  the staff is friendly  the beds really may be as comfortable as the other reviews say  the breakfast buffet        cannot be beat  and above all else  it doesn t cost much to stay there       night for friday and saturday  On the down side  the room was nice  yet uninspired   dated fixtures in a cramped poorly lit bathroom  and if your room is lower than the fifth floor  very poor views  if any at all  The room was alright But I am the kind of person that doesn t spend much time in my room  It had the comfy bed and was quiet and dark for sleeping  If I wanted to spend time in my room  I would have spent the extra     s to stay at Mandalay Bay or the Venetian  And if I was looking for glamour  I would just toddle across the street to the Palms  or hop into my rental car and head off to the strip   parking at the Gold Coast is a snap  btw  So I guess what I am trying to say here is that I love the Gold Coast for its sense of value  Would I rather stay at Mandalay Bay or the Venetian  Sure  But can I afford that every time  No  A person could go broke staying in a hotel where ambience superceded good all around value  I suggest you put your needs expectations in context and give the Gold Coast a try  
P =>  Great Value for Good Service  Check in was fast absolutely no line up took less than   minutes  Stayed Sunday thru Thursday on package deal but could have got rooms for        a nite if paid with mastercard  Room is fine nice and clean  the bathroom is ok for your average guy quite small with poor lighting don t try showering at nite unless you want to do it in the dark  Maid service was good never ran out of the usual shampoo conditioner soap towels etc  Elevators worked great super fast I m not sure if thats because their arent that many guests or not  The Clientelle was mostly       middle class working folks looking for a cheap gettaway  also a lot of locals frequent the sports book in the evening it can be a challenge to get to the betting window in a timely manner they could use one more employee to take bets for horse racing  Also there are no personal tvs in the Sports book  But you can see all the action on the big screen TV s The cocktail service was good the waitresses always came back to ask if we wanted another drink before the last one was gone  The Breakfast buffet was Excellent and had no line ups  I think its better and cheaper         than the one at the TI  The Hotel location is fine a shuttle to the strip is provided but we hung out at the Palms for a couple of days only    yds away across the street that place has the Hottest Cocktail waitresses and also has great drinks service so if you want to play at the Palms but Cant afford the rooms the gold coast is the place to stay  
P => Friendliest place in Vegas Been staying here for at least    years every ruary  Wouldn t stay anyplace else Dixie Land band greatest     Rooms great     Food very good  Love the hotdogs by the sporting section and your love Keno best in Vegas NelsonFaribault  MN  
P => always worth a stop Have been visiting this hotel for several years   usually in uary  Prices are unusually low for this town  The room service is efficient and the rooms themselves are well furnished and well maintained The is plenty of free parking  The much more upscale hotels Rio and Palms are on opposite corners but a walk to the Strip is somewhat long It s possible to take the bus shuttle from this hotel to the Barbary Coast and back   they are affiliated hotels  The Barbary Coast is on the Strip across from the Bellagio and Paris Las Vegas The gaming area in this hotel has been expanded and there are plenty of fast foods outlets  for the occasional snack  Overall   a top notch bargain  
P =>  A great no frills casino I ve stayed at the Gold Coast twice now and I m going back in   weeks  The first time I walked in my heart sank as it was full of drunken rodeo riders  After a few hours I loved it It s cheap  n  cheerful which is why the locals go there The bowling lanes are superb  the small pool was quiet and relaxing  the rooms are bigger than UK rooms  the bar staff were the friendliest I ve ever met in my life and there s a free bus to the strip every    minutes You can t go wrong for the money OK  so it wont give you that  Vegas Experience  but as somewhere to stay while you explore the rest of Vegas  it s great  
P =>  Great option for Budget Seekers My boyfriend and I were looking for a cheap getaway  and chose GC based on the reviews we read here  I got an amazing deal for   guests  king bed for     a night in mid y  Hotel is easy to find  has ample parking and in a great location  Check in was fast and we both got coupon books  the free cocktail coupons were a plus    The room was lovely  Large comfy bed  great view of the Palms and the strip and space capsule bathroom  Everything was clean and newly furnished  We had a breakfast buffet and ate the the Arriva  Both were OK and economical  The ten pin bowling was brilliant  esp at  am  The shuttle bus was excellent  frequent  fast and reliable  Only complaint I have is that it is quite a walk from the car to the room  Also  our room was at the end of a corridor and it was far away from the elevator and the ice machine  Note for women   I tried the pool in the evening  and it was habitated by lecherous men and varsity youths  which made me feel quite uncomfortable  The clientele elsewhere was local and friendly though  All in all   a great comfortable hotel if you want to save money and stay away from the Strip  
P => Great Hotel Stayed at the Gold Coast e    to y    We had read reviews of this hotel and decided to try it  The rooms were very nice and clean  All the reviews talked about how comfortable the beds were  and they were right  I liked the bathroom because the tub and toilet were together and the sink was outside of it  with kind of a dressing area  All of the hotel and casino was very clean  We booked the midweek special twice and also got   breakfast and   dinner buffets with it  They give you coupon books when you check in  Check in was fast and so was checking out  We have stayed at the Excalibur and the Flamingo and the Gold Coast was the best value  
P =>  Great Stay at the Gold Coast Not the Ritz  but the rooms are spacious  amp  clean  Bed was great as was the shower  no water saver on this one    Room was very quiet  great for sleeping in after gambling all night  Restaurants are good  amp  inexpensive  esp  the buffet which has the best desserts in Vegas  The free shuttle to the Strip makes the location ideal if you like to get away from the crowds  amp  the noise  We stayed there   nights  amp  thought it was one of the best places we ve stayed in Vegas  Will no doubt stay there again  Altho we didn t bowl  the bowling alley is excellent  They also had a good nightclub act in the Cortez Room  
P => Ok but water cold in shower Stayed for an entire week during a training course  The temp of the shower was cold at night  but not in the morning and the security folks were unpleasant a couple of times  don t wear a hooded sweatshirt from the workout center  or they may think you re a criminal  The workout center was nice  and the casino was fine  Not the best place I ever stayed at  and certainly not the worst  
P =>  Great value My wife and I stayed at the Gold Coast for the first time on     for one night  She was hesitant because she likes the big fancy resorts but they were simply running too expensive that week so I thought I would give the Gold Coast a try  Like eveybody says  the rooms are spotless  The pool was small but okay  The casino was fun  relaxed and easy to navigate  Check in out was a breeze and the staff was very competant if not invisible  I can tell you that my wife actually told me that she was impressed with the Gold Coast and even suggested that we no longer waste several hundred dollars night at the fancy places and use the Gold Coast as our home base from now on   
P =>  Great value  Will definitely return  Although older  I found the hotel to be in very good condition and very clean  With the frequent shuttle to the strip  it makes it a perfect location  The dinner buffet       was excellent  as was the breakfast buffet       This hotel is an excellent value    which is what I am for when I travel  
P => My favorite casino The Gold Coast is my favorite casino to play video poker  There is a large selection to choose from  many with the best pay schedules  The rooms are very clean and functional  The bathrooms are two divided rooms  tub toilet in one room and sink in the other   I agree they are smaller by about     total feet than many other hotels  but are still very functional  The beds are soft and comfortable  Rooms are usually priced between           this time of year  internet discounters may be less   The large casino is very easy to navigate  The buffet is one of the best food values you ll find in LV  large selection and tasty  A dixieland plays in the afternoons from noon       pm  Overall  it is a wonderful place to stay  next to the Rio and Palms  Free shuttle service takes you to the Orleans or Barbary Coast on the Strip  Highly recommended  
P =>  Can t wait to come back We stayed at the Gold Coast over Spring Break and I couldn t believe the value for the quality of rooms and service  The free daycare was awesome as my wife and I had the chance to spend some time at the tables together rather than having to gamble seperately  The kids loved the daycare and after we finished supper were able to head to the bowling alley  The Palms isjust across the street with a first class movie house so there is plenty of family stuff to do as well as fun for the adults  The beds were the most comfortable I have ever slept in  Can t wait to get back to the Gold Coast  
P => Functional Hotel and Casino Stayed a couple of nights in this place  Pretty decent casino  though better craps odds would be nice   above average buffet  and the shuttle to the Strip made things handy  Hotel room walls weren t the best at keeping out next door room noise  but for a     room on Monday Tuesday  I won t complain too much  
P =>  Gold Coast was a good value My son and I stayed at the Gold Coast ch           We attended the Nascar race and as is to be expected motel rooms in Vegas prices about triple during a major event  The rooms at the Gold Coast while higher then usual were more in line with what we could afford  The motel was clean  the staff was friendly and the food was good  My son who is    felt that the motel mainly had older people staying at it and spent most of his time at the RIO which is right across the street  I found the slots were tight but did manage to hold about even for the trip  which is pretty much a win  Lots of Black jack tables at    and getting on one didn t take long  Dealers were friendly  Would stay there again and may try and book rooms for the National Finals Rodeo  
P =>  Excellent value If you re looking for a great value in Las Vegas accommodations  look no further than the Gold Coast  The beds are soooo comfortable  the food was great  especially the buffet   the location is fantastic  near the Rio  Palms  Strip  I      and the employees were friendly and courteous  Would recommend the V P  slots but suggest avoiding all the rest  Our only complaint is that  because of it s popularity with the locals  the Sports and Race Book is very noisy  even for a betting room  
P =>  I would recommend it This was our second stay at the Gold Coast  We stayed there in       and was satisfied with it then  Rooms were clean  a little run down  but not bad and the staff was very friendly  What a sunrise to see how much they improved it with the Remodel  The rooms are not plush  but they are very nice  The most comfortable beds I have ever seen in a Hotel  All the staff was friendly and helpful  I would recommend it to anyone  The next time I head for Las Vegas the Gold Coast will be the first place I look at for a room  
P =>  Love The Gold Coast  After vacationing at several strip hotels we decided to try The Gold Coast last year  We just returned from our  rd stay there and will return again in il  The staff is friendly and courteous  the rooms are clean  the restaurants are wonderful  and priced right  and the shuttle runs often enough that there is seldom a wait   although we enjoy the walk to the strip   Can t imagine staying anywhere else   
P =>  Will definitely stay again Just returned from a wonderful Valentine s weekend stay  Though bathroom was tiny  everything else was great  Room clean and comfy  Casino very nice with great live band and excellent restaurants  not to mention a fine dinner and show deal with prime rib for thirty bucks  There were lots of locals here  but they couldn t have been friendlier and the staff was excellent too  I may never stay on the strip again since it is soooo crowded  but it was nice to take the free hotel shuttle there and back when we wanted to sightsee  Definitely a strong recommendation based on our stay  Right across the street from the Rio and the Palms  two other nice places  Give Gold Coast a shot  It is great  DM St  Louis 
P =>  What a dump Probably the most boring  plain hotel in Vegas  My wife liked the bingo  the kids liked the bowling  my cheap friends liked the    tables and the buffet was great  But all that can be enjoyed by staying next door at the Rio  the best value in Vegas  
P =>  Great Stay Stayed at Gold Coast                    Rooms were clean  restaurants buffet was great  friendly staff  and free shuttle service to the Strip  Gold Coast is a great value  
P =>  Loved it If you want fancy  look elsewhere  but if you want a nice room  well maintained and the best bed I ve slept in at a motel  go to the Gulf Coast  Most hotel beds are hard  but this one is one I would have in my home  Extremely comfortable  Room is about the size of a normal hotel room  TV was better in quality and selection than Harrah s and the rates are fabulous  More money left for the blackjack table  Highly recommended  
P => A great deal Have stayed at the Gold Coast just once  but have ended up there many other times  The hotel has been COMPLETELY RENOVATED from its former dark and drab appearance  and and it is now a bright  cheerful place The entire property has to be one of the very best overall values in all of Las Vegas  Excellent  value priced dining at several restaurants  cheap gaming     craps   and lots of slots and video poker  good entertainment  and nice rooms for the price  The staff is very friendly and the entire place has a warm atmosphere   lots of locals  but not a bad crowd at all What makes it especially convenient is that there is a free shuttle to sister hotels Barbary Coast on the Strip and the mammoth sized Orleans off Strip  
P => Very nice hotel great location  My friends and I stayed there in ust     and were really pleased with the hotel  The first night we had to spend in smoking rooms  they smell really bad   because we got in late  but the next morning we were able to move into non smoking rooms  They have a nice pool w  hot tub and a bowling alley which was really cool  The restaurants and the casino are great too  The location couldn t be better  the free shuttle    minutes ride  drops you off across the street from Bellagio  amp  Caesars  It can be a nice walk too  It s a great hotel for a great price  I would definitely go back again  
P =>  Bingo player I love Gold Coast  I go to play Bingo  but like the ice cream parlor  terrible mike s hamburgers  seattles best coffee  I like that the bathroom windows open  Also  like the location  
P =>  Video Poker Hell  If you are a serious Video Poker player you can t consider staying at the Gold Coast any longer  Virtually all of their full pay machines  which used to be a very good assortment  are now gone  The hotel and restaurants are good  but if you don t want to get ripped off on video poker  stay at the Gold Coast and spend your time playing at the Palms across the street  
P =>  Great place This was a great place  Although it was off the strip the free shuttle bus makes up for it  It was relatively cheap and had a great buffet  
P => Gold Coast is a deal I go to Vegas a couple times per year  The best bang for my buck is the Gold Coast  If it was on the strip  it would be perfect  but they do have a shuttle that does go to the Barbery Coast on the strip  The room rate is one of the best and the food is excellent in all areas plus friendly hotel personnel  The bathroom is a little cramped  but I can live with that  
P => About what we expected We stayed at the Gold Coast ober             We chose it as it was a good rate for a Fri Sat stay and we have read good reviews  All in all the GC was a good deal  clean room  good food at the coffe shop  buffet and Terrible Mike s  If the GC is a little too pedestrian for your tastes  the Palms  amp  the Rio are right next door We found the casino a tad on the shabby side  as well as the clientele   didn t see too many winners either   Cocktail service seemed to be lacking  but we found that the case everywhere we went this trip  The slot club has the Coast Casino system of awarding points on coin out  not coin in  which sucks big time In summary  we got what was advertised  We did notice that the staff at the GC were very nice and did a good job  
P =>  vacation week Pleasant Hotel  Everything functional and then some  Meals and buffet most pleasing  Shuttle to strip a plus  Rooms are nice  One of the largest  attractive sport books around  Dealers need to be more friendly and smile  Good off the strip bargain  Rio and Palms nearby  
P =>  Cheap but little more Its hard to believe that anyone would give this hotel five stars  It does has two positives   it is cheap  even for Las Vegas  and the food in the restaurants is generally good  Now to the negatives  long  slow check in lines  extremely small rooms with the tiniest bathroom I have ever seen  the entry door opens directly into the hall  no safes  the views are those of the casinos roof  requires a bus ride to the strip  and the casino itself is overly bright and uninviting  The gambling is much better across the street at The Palms  We won t stay there again  
P =>  great bargain shuttle a plus  We had a coupon for buy   nights get one free  so we stayed here for     for three nights  The rooms resembled a super    not fancy but adequate  There is a shuttle that runs from the hotel to the Barbary coast mid strip  and also to The Orleans hotel  It is free and runs every    minutes  The buffet is about    per person and is also very good  The waitresses were always around when gambling  The pool was small but there weren t very many people there when we went  so it was fine  Very close to The Rio and The Palms if you want to go some place close to gamble  
P => good overall Enjoyed our stay this summer for   nights at the Gold Coast  They have an excellent buffet there and we won at the casino where the slots seemed to be loose for Vegas  The only complaint I have is that the beds were very lumpy and was not able to sleep well  Enjoyed bowling after midnight for only   buck per game  Would probably stay here again  A good overall value  
P => Fantastic Bargain The Gold Coast is a fantastic bargain  I cam with eight girlfriends and we enjoyed the easy access shuttles and the bed was soooo comfortable  We had fun and saved money  What more could a person ask for if traveling on a budget  
P => what I always wanted My husband and I stayed at the hotel for a week and can t wait until the next time  I went for the Bingo and would do it again and again  we found that the staff from all functions of the hotel were friendly helpful and just plain nice  unlike the bigger hotels  I have recommended it to other people and took pictures to show them  How do you spell vacation Gold Coast Hotel  Looking forward to my next trip and just wish it could be sooner  y H   stayed the week of e       
P => Abosolute best hotel for the price   This was our first stay in Las Vegas and the Gold Coast Hotel and Casino was A    in our book  The rooms were very classy  clean and comfortable   The buffet at The Port  O Call was the best that I have ever tasted  They had every dessert imaginable   They had everything from Fried Catfish  hushpuppies  shrimp  lasagna  beef with broccoli  fried rice  a taco bar  enchiladas  salad  fruit  and even had an awesome breakfast buffet   Gold Coast Casino was clean  and the entertainment was   well   entertaining   Awesome place that I will recommend to anyone  and will definately visit again     
P =>  The Best Clean and Comfortable We stayed at the Gold Coast for   nights  middle of y       Checking in was quick  staff was friendly  hotel and casino are well layed out and clean  Enjoyed meeting BillyTim and Christian  waiters in the Ports O Call buffet  ask to be seated at one of their tables when you go  After seeing the crowds on the Strip  it was a delight to know we were not dealing with them once we got to the Gold Coast  Local people play at the Gold Coast and they are also friendy  The bowling lanes were also a delight  as was the swimming pool and fitness center  We highly recommend this hotel  
P =>  Great Value

P =>   Wonderful stay great location good size clean room friendly staff I highly recommend the Gold Spike  We got a great deal at    a night during the week and     for weekend because of renovation  which was not a problem  We stayed   nights and had a fabulous time  The hotel is clean  the room was a good size and the staff friendly and helpful  Just       for a    oz steak at the Gold Spike restaurant was a good dead  Location is great   just one block to the Deuce bus which runs    hrs and takes you to the strip  and just one block from fun Freemont Street  We were in Vegas for our daughter s wedding  they got married by Elvis at the Graceland Chapel   They chose to stay at the Flamingo on the Strip  We loved being downtown because it was less hectic  They enjoyed a stay at the Gold Spike on the last night because they were sick of the Strip  
P =>  Best Time Ever My family and I visit Las Vegas at least once a year my parents about   times a year  We decided to do a family casino crawl and our second stop was GOLD SPIKE    lets just say our  quot crawl quot  ended their    we had a great time with the staff and the other people in the Casino  Gene was an excellent server and was running all over the place to help everyone    Rita was a riot and such a nice lady she brought out my family of   and   friends   huge plates of wings and some cake for free  We also were given T shirts   overall the fun was the best part about this place   Great people  great time      quot WE LOVE THE GOLD SPIKE lt  WE LOVE THE GOLD SPIKE quot  Next time in Vegas I will be back      
P =>   How can you not love the Spike  My friends and I have been traveling to Las Vegas over the course of the last month for work  We are not really into the high dollar casinos and are were just looking for a decent place to play cards  We stumbled upon the Gold Spike by accident it was the    Sexy Blackjack sign that drew us in  What is    Sexy Blackjack  basically it is    minimum Blackjack dealt by pretty young girls in tight black shorts and white t shirts  Since that first night we have been going back twice or three times a week and have gotten to know the staff pretty well  Here is the long and short of it  The dealers are pretty  nice and will talk to you  This is unlike the Asian drones at most of the other casinos in town  There are three Blackjack tables and a roulette table  so talking with and getting to know the dealers and pit bosses is very easy  We have spent some quality time with pit bosses Susan  Peter  and Rita  and the great dealers Nicole  Sasha  Tina  Mimi  and others  Contrary to the one review Rita is very cool  k the manager who has been there every night we have  is one of the most professional and patient people that I have come across  Hey it s a casino people get drunk and obnoxious  but k handles them with respect and patience  I have not stayed at the hotel and don t plan to I am a Hilton points snob  but I will continue to go the Spike to gamble with my new found friends  So if you head in and find Susan tell her that Keith  Joe  and Dave sent you  
P =>  Everytime I visit the place is getting better  We stayed there for a couple of nights over the New Years holiday        and enjoyed our stay  We new ahead of time that the place was under renovation and we are very familiar with Downtown  My only complaint then was that our room showed wear and tear from years of use  I wasn t moldy  filthy  bad smelling or infested  Just old  We just finished up another trip to Vegas for y  th and stopped be to check things out  A lot of progress has been made and it s looking better  They still have work to do but I m considering staying again for New Years  All I can say about those that complain about the neighborhood is this  The front entrance is only one block away from the south end of The Fremont St Experience  Two trips   pleasant both times  
P =>  Gold Spike Dump  Stayed at the Gold Spike for the weekend Friday Sunday worst hotel experience of my life  The room was a dump very old  dirty  tv didn t work leak in the tub and and it just looked run down and smelled horrible  They shouldn t rent these rooms for ANY price they couldn t pay ME to stay in them again  Save your money and book a hotel at a decent place in a nicer area  
P =>  Stop your whining about the Gold Spike You can get a room at this place for about        a night in a package deal  maybe less by now  No it s not for everyone  that SHOULD BE apparent by the price  But we have the usual moaning on here by people that think a hotel that costs     of the price of a HOSTEL in cities like NYC or San Fran should be above the quality of a Motel    Give me a break I m a single female  amp  I do agree that the area is a bit sketch but if you do like me and follow a touristy group walking west to the main touristy part of Fremont Street there s no reason to fear this part of the city  I have stayed further EAST and that gets much more frightening I needed a clean bed and a shower  i got that here  The food is insanely cheap it s not the healthiest but what do you expect for        Go someplace fru fru  pony up a few more dollars  stay on the South Strip if you can t hack it here  There s a gazillion hotels in LV  If you re scared of the Spike there s LOTS of alternatives  
P =>   security sucks my friend and i stayed at the spike for one night  we arrived early afternoon the casino bar and restaurant are very clean  which is very impressive considering the way the outside looks  we had gambled at the bar most of the day and the bartenders are wonderful When my friend and i were returning to our room in the early morning  we were harrassed by security  a very rude man named ED  He made us feel like we were low lifes  I have never been treated like this at any hotel  We then checked out that day and finished our stay at the plaza  Your security needs to treat people with more respect 
P =>   Gold Spike is great deal but need a strategy The Gold Spike was a great deal       once I found a room that didn t have odor and had a working air conditioner  The people at the front desk were cooperative and it got done STRATEGY   before you unpack your luggage     check for odor      be sure cooling element works on a c unit     check the shower head for good pressure      check TV      lights A room switch at this point is fast and easy PRICE   What a deal  fri       sat       sun      mon        tax       ROOM       good a c  good shower head  good kg bed  good overstuffed chair DINER   friendly people  yummy specials  Eat them  Bisquits and Gravy          pm  am  Steak and Eggs          pm  am   Steak  amp  Shrimp       all time  Ham and Eggs       all the time BAR   cheap    c frozen drinks       scooners of beerCOUPONS   use them    bj matchplay  drawing      off foodCASINO   remodelled  but     s style penny slots are gone  but where have all the winos gone RESTROOM in CASINO   high quality remodel and clean BUS STATION   easy   minute walk  Return to Airport for       FREEMONT EXPERIENCE   easy   minute walk  Lots of FREE bands this summer under Freemont Experience   Rare Earth  Three Dog Night  Jefferson Starship  Canned Heat   th Demension  Big Brother and the Holding Company  Bill Haley s CometsNegatives TV only   channels  one snowyLamp had broken  n Off switchLight Bulbs    W  too dull to read a newspaperSlow shower drain  but workableUsing my strategy  given cheap rate       I ll return again Ken from Kansas City 
P =>  get what you pay for if you are looking for a place to gamble it is perfect    but to sleep  you get what you pay for  As many deals as there are stay somewhere else until remodel is complete  The rooms were not done yet  Our room although clean was loud  had only two tv channels with no remote or power button   scaffolding outside the window which banged against the window all night with the wind and our power was knocked out  Funny as it was at the time there are plenty of hotels that offer the same rates  Construction starts early in the morning if you stay mon  fri  It is close to freemont  and parking is very close  staff was friendly  
P =>  In Contruction To be honest  I held my breath when I entered my room because of the neighborhood I was in  downstown  and expected mystery stains  funky smells and a creaky bed for the price I paid      howeverrrrrrrrrr  I was pleasantly surprised and laughed at myself for the deal I had gotten  Though it s going through a renovation right now  the rooms are quite clean and pillows are nice and fluffy  Great value even though I didn t get a remote control and TV only has about   visible channels plus my bedside lamp was missing a bulb  I did notice most of the female card dealers and waitresses are cute    year olds  
P =>  old spike gets a new look Stayed at the Gold Spike bc I love the Freemont St area of Vegas  Was surprised to see that the inside of the casino has been renovated and looks pretty good  The rooms are not yet renovated but once they are I is not sure how any other hotel downtown will be able to compete  Stop in for the      breakfast  You won t be disappointed  
P =>  Downtown is a   block walk through the ghetto I stayed at the Golden Spike one night  I had stayed in Vegas for a week at the Golden Nugget and Luxor  Our flight was delayed and I tried the Plaza  they were booked  but offered the Golden Spike  one of their sister proprities   Since money was tight  the price was right  However  the Spike is   blocks from Freemont Street  which means you must walk through the ghetto to get downtown  Also  the room was disgusting  yellowed  old  no remote for the TV  water was dirty and didn t work properly and there were quite a few scary characters  I don t suggest this hotel  basically you get EXACTLY what you pay for and then some  As a recommendation from the Plaza  I was disappointed  but I should have known better when I heard the price  
P =>  It s really not as bad as everyone says    My friend and I had to find a hotel the very last minute and I happened to stumble upon this hotel on Expedia  The price was just right for an overnight stay  I read all the reviews here so I came here knowing that it may not be all that  So it wasn t  But surprisingly  it was pretty good too So here s my take on it   REGISTRATION CASINO AREA There s only one way in and out of this place  through the front door  Registration is in the back past the   rows of slot machines  All the broken slots are lined up by registration in front of the security desk which is an actual desk  Yes  there are no more table games either  But the signs outside say that a New Gold Spike is Coming Soon  We got there and there was someone sitting in the back who looked like she was about to fall asleep  I think i may have woken her up not seeing the sign on the counter that says  quot Will be back in    minutes quot   Haha  This is a first for a hotel casino  But that was fine with us  We just walked back to the bar and got a couple of    beers while we watched a basketball game on TV  All the TVs are still CRT  The crowd is filled with locals waiting to go to work drinking beer  They were fun to hang out with while we were waiting for the registration desk to open  About half an hour later we went back and the lady at the front desk was very nice  She can even write upside down which was pretty cool  It was a totally different person than the one who was napping in the back   NOTE  everyone staying in the hotel has to show their ID  You also have to get a parking pass which is free  THE ROOM We got our room for      You walk in and it smells like disinfectant but that goes away once you get used to it  The TV has about   channels available  no cable  and you have to put a     deposit on a remote if you d like to borrow one  There s no iron ironing board  There really is no closet  There s a long bar near the door to hang your clothes  There s also an armoire where the TV is  It s just fine for a couple days  The A C is old and it s just enough to cool your room to room temperature  The beds are comfortable  In the bathroom you ll find conditioning shampoo and soap  That s it  The water pressure for the shower is surprisingly strong So go down to the casino  win a few bucks and this place is paid for  There are at least   security guards at night outside the hotel  I didn t see one scary person outside at all at  AM when I got back to the room Overall  it s a pretty good place to stay for a night when you d rather use your money for other things while you re in LV  The people here are nice too  Check it out  
P =>  You re stayin  in the ghetto when you stay at the gold spike This place is foul  Absolutely the worst hotel and casino you can get in the area  Disgusting in every way  Crack heads  hookers  and people you don t want to meet are here  Loosers and users hang out here  I was terrified my car was going to get broken into  The casino is a dirty joke  I would never want to touch any machine in the place  The room had no phone or remote control    need to deposit money to get those  No ice bucket because there is no ice machine  unlocking window which made me super nervous about leaving my room  No mirror on the wall because the druggies stole it  Dirty shower  bathroom with a tub shower whose drain barely works  Water is up to your knees in just a few minutes  This is by far the seediest hotel I have ever stayed in  I only stayed    hours  and I will NEVER be back  The only people who will enjoy this hotel are people who come from and are used to the ghetto  It truly is like a little piece of compton right there in vegas  
P =>  Love the Spike       My then Boyfriend and I drove up to get married    found the Spike the staff was very helpful the drinks are a buck and the room was very clean and comfortable   We only stayed long enough to get hitched but we are going back this week and staying there again   For     you can t beat the Spike for a place to crash in between partying on the strip Love the Spike        
P =>   Great if your on a tight budget This is about as cheap of a room as your gonna find in Las Vegas The Good  low rates  friendly staff  clean room  nothing fancy but at the price  I can not complain  Downstairs is a casino and a cafe  where you can get good food really cheap  This hotel is in the heart of the downtown Fremont Experience and within walking distance of the bus depot  the greyhound station  and the bus to the strip  It s a small place  and is a more downscale than staying on the strip  but if your one too spend less on a hotel and keep more in your pocket for fun  than this is the place for you  Good parking also The bad  not on the strip  but downtown  No extras  not fancy  But I really have no complaints  If your wanting a cheap room  remember that you get what you pay for  so don t complain about this place  because for the price  it is not bad at all  
P =>  Good Times at Gold spike My Husband And I Stayed At The Gold Spike On A Thursday we had a good time Gambling the staff was nice and parking was a breeze  We will Stay here again  
P =>   Wooooooooo  Vivaaaaaaa Las Vegas   D Me and my friends had a blast  Awesome employees  cheap     shots and beers  Really close to Freemont St  Free parking  We didn t go to LV to sit in our room so while it wasn t like the hilton or whatever  who cares  Cheap price   like     for   nights  I d def  stay here again 
P =>   Reasonable When you get to the front desk  you are not sure of what to expect because it looks so so    But the price is great  the room is reasonable  Good bed  cleaness ok  At the end a good deal      
P =>   not as bad as people say    This place was not as bad as people are saying it was  NOT NEARLY as bad  We booked for a whole week    nd   th and it was only     dollars   FOR THE WHOLE WEEK  I arrived there near midnight and the parking area was well lit  and i didnt see homeless people walking around like others have said  I am a woman and i didnt feel threatened at all  and i was by myself  You walk in to the casino and see all the electronic game machines and a big security booth right by the front doors  I checked in at the front desk and people were very helpful and polite  It did smell of smoke  but it was tolerable  Elevators worked nicely  Got to my room and I was expecting the worst after reading some of the reviews up here  But to my surprise my room didnt smell horrible as others have said and the room was clean  The air worked just fine  the tv DID only have   channels but i wasnt there to watch tv  In the room there was a round table with two chairs  a stand with the tv on it  a dresser another big oversized chair  two night stands and a bed  The restroom was smaller but did what it was needed for  The pluming is slow there but it never once got backed up   it was just slow  Wireless was available from this thing called cheetah network  You pre pay   we payed    dollars for the week  but u can pay by the hour or day if you d like    and it was a decent connection  The bar was small   but useful and very inexpensive  we got two large drinks both with over   alcohols each for only   dollars  you cant find that anywhere else in vega  Plus shots and beers were only   dollar  The diner was sooo good  and very affordable  open    hours its convinient  THe first night we got cheese burgers and fries and drinks for only   somthing  and the cheese burgers were sooo big and good  everything we tried there was good and very affordable  we didnt eat one bad meal there  the hot dogs were HUGE for only   dollars and the breakfasts were big and yummy for only a little bit more    so over all it was     times better then i expected  the people were really nice and polite  and freemont street was   minute walking distance away  so was    hour walgreens  also what made it so worth it was a bus you can catch right infront of fremont street that takes u directly to the strip and stops at every hotel and comes ever    minutes  for only   dollars a day u can ride as much as you wnat up and down the strip  the bus was roomy and had two levels  VERY awesome no doubt that i would spend another week at the gold spike  I attached some pictures  some of them are taken after we already messed up the room mind you lol  but you get the point  
P =>   Great experience at the Gold Spike saved a ton of     Booked on Travelworm     By far the cheapest hotel in Vegas at      for   nights on a very busy weekend  from what I understand      for   nights isn t uncommon at the Spike PARKING  There are two lots  one just to the right of the Gold Spike  and one behind it  The one to the right is flanked by Ogden Road  Las Vegas Blvd  and another motel  Security periodically walks this lot  The back lot is right in front of the security trailer and seemed more secure to me  The two guards I talked to were both friendly  Parking passes are required  and they seemed to chase off loiterers  I did not feel unsafe leaving valuables here CASINO  The casino is small  and has only electronic machines  There are no table games  There is a smoky aroma to the whole place  but nowhere near where the other reviews are making it out to be  If you ve ever gone into the home of someone who smokes indoors  its like that  The jackpots are small  at one point  they announced the winner of a progressive slot machine at       There are two entrances  with a security booth between them  The bar is to the far right  the diner to the rear right  and the hotel check in directly in the middle of the casino and all the way towards the back  I gambled about     here and the odds seemed pretty bad  There are a lot of locals  but most are friendly blue collar folks looking for some cheap gaming  The casino has a  quot Copper Mine  quot  which is actual slot video machines that take pennies  There is a soda machine and a snack machine  and waitresses dressed in regular street clothing were walking around comping drinks  BAR  The bar is pretty small  but the allure is that it s dirt cheap    oz Coors draft is     They also offer    Pucker  or flavored Vodka shots  They offer Pina Coladas and Daquiris for    as well  each about   oz in a plastic cup  They are a full bar  so you can order about anything you want  but for the price i d stick with the dollar menu  You won t find drinks any cheaper on Fremont Street or on the StripDINER  The diner at the Gold Spike is  awesome   They re    hours and serve basic but hearty food  The first night I stayed there  i went down for the  quot Ham Steak and Eggs quot  meal which was        The ham steak measured probably       inches across  with two eggs  two pieces of toast  and hash browns  For under   bucks  thats a steal  The second night I had their breakfast special  which was like the other  but came with two huge sausage patties instead of ham  and was        I ordered both of these between   and  am  and the cook and cashier were both very polite  The food was delicious  and I would eat there again without hesitation  They also serve spaghetti  burgers  hot dogs  fish and chips  and a few other  American  style foods HOTEL ROOM  The hotel room was spartan but clean  if you ve stayed at a Motel   or a Super    this was a step up  albeit a small step   There is a small table with two chairs  a large king sized bed    queens in some rooms   two mini closets  a three drawer dresser  and a    quot  television which only picks up about   local stations  There is also a desk and chair  but no internet access or writing tablets pens  The window does open about   inches for circulation  and the air conditioning unit worked just fine  Flanking each side of the bed were small tables  which both had a lamp on them  and a telephone on one  I did not use the phone so i cannot comment on the clarity or reliability  The carpet is pretty run down and the paint isnt exactly gleaming  but the room was very clean and presentable upon check in  I saw no bugs or grime  and the bathroom was clean and stocked with an extra roll of toilet paper  two bars of soap  a bottle of shampoo  and two of each  towels handtowels washclothes  From my room        th floor  farthest room on the left  i had a view of Ogden Road  and the Fremont Hotel  I heard very minimal noise from surrounding rooms  and the doors do have   locks  a chain lock and a deadbolt  I felt very secure in the room the entire stay  With some new carpet and new paint the room would have looked awesome  The maid was friendly and made a point to learn my name and asked me each morning if I d like my room made up  as she was usually a room or two down when i left to go gamble  SURROUNDINGS  One block over on  rd street and Ogden there s a great bar called  quot Sidebar quot  which is pretty swanky for this area  Next to it is an awesome restraunt for burgers  Triple George  and near that is a biker bar called Hogs and Heiffers  Lots of action and people around this little strip of bars  and I spent a good portion of my nights there  A   minute walk from the casino lobby gets you to Fremont Street  Left on Fremont is Hennessey s Bar  which is also a great irish pub  Jillian s is across from Hennessey s if you re in to pool or bowling  CONCLUSION      a night  Sign me up  Cheap and excellent food  dirt cheap drinks  centrally located  and safe  The Spike isn t for people who like to be pampered  don t expect room service or lavish rooms  But  if you can handle self sufficiency and dont want to pay too much  the Spike is for you  I will absolutely stay here again  
P =>   Good Value We were splitting our trip between Vegas and Laughlin and decided that this place was cheap and worth a try  We have always stayed on the strip in the past and were curious about downtown so it worked out well When we got there they put us in a standard room  although I had booked a  quot suite quot   After going back down and talking to the   person doing registrations they put us in the right room  To apologize for the error they charged me the cheaper rate for the   nights that we were there The room itself was on the threadbare side  It was well worn but clean  Could certainly do with a coat of paint and some new carpet but    The room was fairly large with a balcony  not much of a view though  They were also putting new mattresses in the rooms while we were there The casino was dirty with a fairly rough looking bunch gambling in there  While my wife didn t like it we had no troubles at all  They also have several security guards around all of the time  We even won a few bucks on their machines The diner has seen better days but if you are a little adventurous the food can t be beat at their prices  Real plates would be nicer than the paper ones that they use but oh well The location is only a couple blocks from Fremont Street but with the Lady Luck closed they are fairly dark blocks at night  That being said we made the trip several times on foot with no problems  In fact  we had more people stopping us for change on the strip than downtown Finally the parking  While the lot is small and behind the hotel they have cameras and security in the lot most of the time  Plus  on the weekends and some nights  they have a guard in the lot making sure that you are gambling or staying at the hotel before they let you park  As a result we always had a parking spot So to sum it all up we had a good time and would certainly consider staying here again if we were staying downtown  This hotel casino certainly isn t for everyone but if you have a sense of adventure it might be worth a try  
P =>  For    bucks on a Friday      Dont get sacred away from a truely cheap place to stay in downtown Vegas  The rates monday thru thursday arent much of a deal but on the weekends  when everbody else jacks up thier room rates by      a nite the SPIKE SHINES  The Casino is very seedy and dump  but my room was clean and fair  TV remote was missing but there was plenty of hot water and a comfortable bed  Plenty of nice security people and checkin and checkout was simple  I will stay at the spike again  
P =>  Cheap and nice Picked it as a cheap place to stay  Staff was great  the room as good as any budget hotel  Every one was happy with the hotel    friends were with me  An example of the service the staff picked up our scattered shoes and put the pairs nice and orderly in the closet  Something I have not seen at the       nights hotels Also the view from the suite was really good I can only guess people giving the poor reviews have never stayed in a Super   or some how figured that for     a night they were getting a some suite at the Rio Would I go back again     I m going back in ch       
P =>   Really liked it  Great value  Two women travelling alone on a budget  Perfect  We payed        a night through Expedia  I expected the WORST after reading some of the reviews here  but was pleasantly surprised  We stayed on the non smoking floor and had no issues with stale smoke  Yes  the room only had   channels  but we spent most of our time on Fremont St  Yep  the tub backed up when we showered  but we expected it from the reviews and it was not a big deal  We did not utilize the tiny  dark casino  I ate one sub standard dinner and one great breakfast at the cafe  Again   casinos and food galore on Fremont street anyway  We were not bothered by anyone  we felt perfectly safe walking the short distance to Fremont  I read a review that there were bedbugs  and checked thoroughly for them when we arrived   there were none If you are looking for a cheap place to crash while venturing out into Las Vegas  the Gold Spike is a great deal I liked it  and will stay there again when travelling alone or with a female friend BTW  if you are coming from the right direction  stop at the Nevada Visitor s Bureau in Boulder City on your way in  ask for the coupon that will get you a page of coupons at the Fremont St  kiosk  My friend and I ate   for   buffet every lunch and dinner the whole three days we stayed downtown  
P =>   Oh baby    The Gold Spike is an under rated downtown hotel that s perfect for college kids  people on a budget  or those who just want to have fun for cheap  If you re trying to impress your girlfriend wife or you re terrified of seeing homeless people  stay at the Wynn and stop writing reviews about this property that have nothing to do with the actualy quality of the room or service delivery The purpose of my trip here was simple  long weekend with the boys  and we wanted the most fun and cheap Vegas experience possible  None of this volcano pirate ship shooting water fountain polar bear cage near the blackjack table stuff  We wanted cheap booze  cheap gambling  and the most colorful characters you can find in Las Vegas  Three of us were going for four nights  so we wanted something big  comfortable  yet cheap  Our friends and cheapovegas com gave good reviews of the Gold Spike  Convinced  we called room res  and got quoted a two room suite with two beds  one sofa pullout  balcony  two tvs  and  fridge       for Friday and Saturday     for Sunday and Monday  Beauty  Booked it  We arrived into Las Vegas late Friday night  and no cheap     trip to Vegas would be complete without taking the CAT bus from the airport  At       and with round the clock service  you can take comfort knowing you won t have to wait in the demeaning cab lineup and you won t get ripped off by corrupt cabbies  We hopped on  and approaching the Downtown Transportation Centre   we passed the really dated and old school Gold Spike  Our eyes lit up by the really unstylish Gold Spike marquee and we couldn t help but laugh  this place is going to be AWESOME  We got in to the DTC at     hrs and had no security issues worries walking through the bus terminus  unlit park  and city block with our rollaboards  despite some previous reviewers saying they wouldn t do the same  We get into the place  and oh man was it great  Sketchy people with such tremendous stress on their face playing penny slots with the most positive Tom Jones song blaring out on the speakers  The lobby area completely blocked off with police tape so the custodian could buffer the carpet  yes  carpet   The hotel registration clerk was a class act  A pure heart of gold  which is why we didn t really care that she took five minutes to do her paperwork before she would help us  and continued doing her paperwork while checking us in  The rules which were posted behind the counter were even funnier than the marquee   housekeeping hours are between              one set of towels per guest per day  towels are not given on your check out day     there is a     deposit required to have the telephone turned on in your room   and my favorite   there is a     deposit for the use of a remote control for the television in your room   What a place We got our keys cards and were assigned to the top floor  room      We walk into our room  flicked on the light  and our low expectations were by far exceeded  Although the furnishings and interior design were really tacky and old  the room was exceptionally clean  The room had two chairs and a table  a couch  one tv in the living area and one in the bedroom  a sink area which was separate from the toilet and shower  and a mini fridge  The fridge could barely hold    beers  but it was good enough  The room didn t have any rooftop lighting  only lamps in the corner  and a hangy light over the table  No cable on the TV  but good reception for all basic channels  We had two heating AC units for our room  one of which was probably older than me  and a brand new one  The older heat unit worked quite well  but the newer one didn t  We didn t bother addressing this out of laziness and the fact that it wasn t very cold  I stepped onto the balcony to take in the magnificent view of the eight storey city hall parkade and the shut down Lady Luck  This was incredible  leading me to my first epiphany probably from the beers  Sharing my ecstasy  I yelled to the people  who looked like ants to me  in the parking lot   I m on top of the world   Apparently  one of them was an outsourced security guard who thought I was on the roof  He yelled at me to get down  liquored up and confused  I told him I was on my own balcony  but he didn t believe me  summoning backup to respond to a  code     In no more than five minutes  two security guards came knocking to our door  asking about all the fun I m having  First off  it was an epiphany  not just  fun   And secondly  I told them I was on my own balcony  The light bulb in their head turned on  and they wished me a good night  Nice guys  We went to the parking lot  looked up  and realized that the  balcony  really looks like the roof  Whoops  After our CSI work  we deserved a break  So went south a block to take in Freemont Street  Listen  this surrounding area safe  There s way too many people and cars circulating around the spike at all hours for it to be unsafe  just read up on e Jacobs   Eyes on the Street  theory if you don t believe me  After getting gooned off multiple half yards of margaritas on Freemont  we returned to our room to pass out  Despite the fake headboard and lack of bed frame  the beds were comfortable and the sheets were clean  For all four nights  we had no problems sleeping  and there was no noise to complain about After our first night  a shower was in order  and my god  the shower nozzle was the worst I ve ever seen  and this includes a month long visit to India staying in various    night guesthouses  It was just a high powered hose spewing out a powerful burst of water  But the water was warm  and it made our visit just a bit funnier  Afterwards  for our  pm breakfast  we thought we d give one of the  succulent  foot long  hotdogs  a try        and you get a    oz pop with it too  Beauty  We ordered to a friendly clerk and got our food fast  Uh  yeah  The hot dog s color was that of my pale white skin  and the taste was no better  Having the  chef   who kinda looked like a thinner Rudolph Giuliani  complete with FDNY hat  stare at me from the kitchen while I ate my food was by far the creepiest thing I ve ever experienced in Vegas  I ll never go there again  even though    for steak and eggs is a steal  Housekeeping was great  they not only turned down the beds  but they cleaned up our empty beer bottles and pizza boxes  We also had no issues leaving wads of cash  or one of our friend s last assets  a stack of  uh  entertainer cards  on the table  Their one towel per guest policy was strictly enforced  even if you tip  But we did get exactly   containers of shampoo as an act of goodwill after the first day  I guess they audit the towels but not the shampoo The slots area was fun  The  c keno slots still had the chained down pen that you touch to the screen  the  c video poker had an impressive         progressive posted on a half burnt out LED screen  and the copper mine is an impressive alcove of the oldest slots priced at  c  Signs reminding patrons that  quot The wearing of wave caps  do rags  and bandanas on the property of the Gold Spike hotel and casino is strictly prohibited quot  were everywhere  My buddy  who started off with    credits  hit a jackpot and ended up at     credits on the  c wheel of fortune slot  He decided it was best just to walk away while on top  so he cashed out  Cashing out     credits seemed to be quite overwhelming for the machine  so he had to have his       paid out by hand  The cocktail waitress was a doll  we tipped her    per two drinks and she kept the beer coming  Great way to get ripped for very cheap  We needed a late checkout on our last day and we were told this was impossible unless we paid for an extra night  Inquiring with the heart of gold night clerk  she could give us an hour later than checkout   pm  We checked out without incident  but their policy prohibiting the holding of bags was annoying  When you pay      tax in for a two room suite that sleeps at least three for four nights  you can t get it all  I guess  Low maintenance people who just want a safe  quiet  clean place to pass out that s way off the beaten path will be delighted with this place  And with cheap tables at the El Cortez and the Freemont Street just a block away  you can t go wrong  If you go with the thinnest of expectations  you ll love this property  So will your wallet  Tips  When going to the gold spike  or downtown for that matter   TAKE THE CAT  Service every    minutes around the clock  and it s        The     will get you to Fremont  and while the     won t  it ll take you to the Downtown Transportation Centre which is two short blocks away Just don t eat at the caf   It isn t that bad  but just go to McDonalds or something  A Walgreens is located a block away  at the corner of Fremont and  st  Get your kitschy souvenirs and redbull here  Best pricing  Best nearby pizza delivery is a place called Boston Pizza  not to be confused with the really bad Canadian pizza chain   it located down the street  they deliver fast  and the pizza was greasy and perfect after all that cheap gold spike draft       If feel bad having all your booze comped  the best place to buy liquor is from the liquor store that you have to get buzzed in to  that s beside the Western hotel casino   For all of your table gambling needs  go to the el cortez  as the gold spike has NADDA for table games  Although the dealers are not very skilled  they re nice  and the comps are great   The DTC is a block away and will get you ANYWHERE you need to go in Vegas  Catch the strip only Deuce at the DTC  there s always a bus waiting and you re guaranteed a seat  
P =>  Found the Gold    The moment I went in I knew I had to write a review  for I had read many awful ones    be I was expecting such a horrid hotel that it wasnt so bad but for me it was just what we needed My boyfriend and I went to a convention on il         we were both very happy with this hotel    some of my thoughts The casino is not like the ones in the strip but it lets you feel a little more of a  quot real quot   quot underground quot  Vegas    the people there are not turists and you can see it  At night  our room  got noisy    with the real sounds of the city    ambulances  police cars    so what  you are sleeping in a very BIG CLEAN bed    and have a very nice decent CLEAN bathroom with cool water pressure    the ONLY thing I didnt like and maybe if the hotel changed the ROOM CARPET it would look amazing    cause it was rather dirty    yet for that you have sandals  For the smoke smell    which is expected    use some incense or something and its gonna be fine  Didnt like the value meals though but if you have no money they can taste really good  Then    as a plus    you get the Fermont st  just like one block away  So for those that dont NEED the glamour lights and the big fancy hotels this is a perfect choice    Specially if you have a car to move around   Its cheap   yet you dont get less for what you pay  I shouldnt recommend it so much  cause then it might get too crowded  hahacheers  couldnt take pictures sorry    
P =>   Great for minimalism I stayed at the hotel last ober and am planning on going again this year  All the reviews are correct  You can save some money  but you may be dissappointed with the accommodations  I didn t expect much and that was a good thing  The price was good  but the place is as described  Fortunately I was on the  th floor and away from most of the smoke  The clientele that are at the hotel are definitely ecclectic  I only stayed in the room long enough to shower and sleep  I walked to the strip  only if you can walk a couple of miles   There were some individuals at the Blackjack tables that I made friends with and they seemed genuinely likeable  I did not worry about my safety outside   either in the parking lot or on the sidewalk walking to the strip  Would I recommend this to my friends   only if I tell them not to bring the wives  not the cleanest of accommodations   For me  it worked out well and I hope this year will be the same  
P =>  Awesome for the price  I just got back from a three week Las Vegas trip  yes  that s right  THREE weeks    The duration of my and a buddy s trip was the reason for us to find the cheapest place possible  After doing some research  we found this place for an average of     night for the whole three weeks  Splitting it came to a spectacular     person night which was great for three weeks  Now it is true that the casino reeks of cigarette smoke and the place is filled with locals  some with mental issues   but overall I thought it was great  We minded our own business and no one bothered us  We stayed on the third floor  non smoking floor  and upon arrival of our room    we were pleasantly surprised  The room was clean and a good size    queens  and the swamp cooler helped tremendously  The bathroom is SMALL but got the job done  Wireless internet is available through something called CheetahNetwork  Do NOT sign up for them unless you want internet that cuts out FREQUENTLY and is unreliable but does work occasionally  works great at about  am   be it was just my room   The hotel is about a block away from Fremont Street which is the place to be if you re hanging out downtown  There was also a Walgreen s close by which was convenient for little things  We ate at the    hour diner a few times and it was satisfactory  VERY CHEAP food and not so bad tasting  Overall  I was very satisfied with my stay here considering the price I paid and I would happily stay again  However  I hope this doesn t offend anyone  but I would NOT recommend this place to any of my female friends because of the location  vibe in casino lobby  and folks that hang out here  Hope this helps  
P =>  Nice Rooms Shabby Casino I went to Vegas for a week to play poker  The casino is dingy  dirty  smells and is somewhat unpleasant  but i came for the rooms not the casino   The gold spike had the cheapest rate that I could find so I booked it  It took a little time to check in as there is only one clerk  The elevator is old but worked fine  the room on the fifth floor was a suprise after comming thru the casino  The bed was nice the room was clean the shower worked great  I had no problems for the week I stayed at the gold spike  After reading some of the earlier reviews I wonder if the rooms on the lower levels of the hotel are nasty like the casino There are a lot of not so well off people in and around the gold spike  There appeared to be plenty of security and police in the area as well  The parking lot is small and well lit  I went to try the  quot free quot  breakfast and overheard two of the cooks arguing about why they were out of bread  It looked dirty in the restrauant so I didn t stay and abandoned my gold spike dining experience I suggest the following tactic if you are planning to stay at the gold spike  a   bring a friend and make him or her check in and make sure he tips the clerk at least a twenty  b   once checked in get a good gulp of fresh air  outside if you can find one  and hustle across the dingy smoke infested casino to the old but reliable elevator  c   if you are lucky you won t have to smell the casio  get to your room and pretend you never had to go through the lower casio  d   repeat the process to get out and back in  I have no idea what type of bar  machines  table games they have  because i didn t enjoy being in the casio at all If you are tight and saving money makes you happy the gold spike experience is for you  
P => Hit the jackpot at the Gold Spike  I read all the  mixed  reviews here and at a few other sites before deciding to gamble and book a weekend at the Gold Spike  This was Vegas  after all  so why not gamble on the hotel room  too  As far as I m concerned  I hit the jackpot Yes  this is an older joint  Yes  lots of locals do come here  as do many other folks from around the region  like CA  AZ  and UT  Who cares  The same could be said for any other place downtown  Why do they come here  Because they realize that fake marble columns and gold paint fillagree aren t worth the extra      on a weekend night  Personally  I can t argue with them  I ve stayed downtown quite a few times  and now this is where I ll always stay  Skip the regular rooms  I ve never been in one  but they seem hit or miss by the reviews  Spend the extra     Mr  Pennypincher and get the suite  For that extra ten spot  you ll get a large  clean room  great beds  a balcony with a good view of Fremont  nice bathroom  fridge  coffeemaker  with coffee   and a powerful A C that works  All of that for about     a night on the weekend  Where else can you get all that  and get it clean  Nowhere  my friend  nowhere The casino is about the same as any of the downtown casinos  except the ceilings are lower here and smoke tends to stay closer to the floor because of that  I smoke  so who cares  There isn t one place downtown that smells better  and I ve smelled them all  I d skip the diner  but when you have every restaurant and buffet on Fremont available to you for a   minute walk  why wouldn t you  The coffee shops at Binion s  Vegas Club and California are superb  The     Brew Pub at Main Street is just awesome  try their handcrafted beers  and the buffet over at Main Street is one of the best in town Drinks at the bar are extremely cheap     for well     for a HUGE beer  Can t beat that with a stick on any night of the week  The Gold Spike rivals Casino Royale in the dollar drink department  and coming from a diehard fan of getting ripped at the Royale  that says a lot  That said  this place and  any  place downtown will not be suitable for some people  If you re afraid because you re in a neighborhood where people drive    year old cars  you won t like it here  If you think of any segment of society as being lower than you  then you won t like it here  And  if you get uncomfortable when a stranger tries to strike up a conversation with you  or ask you a question  you won t like it here  So  please stay away  The rest of us who are enjoying ourselves will thank you for it  
P =>  Our room had bed bugs too  The Gold Spike has cheap room rates  but it s a case of  quot you get what you pay for quot   Our room was filthy and we were told no other rooms available  Like this other reviewer wrote the rooms at the Gold Spike have bed bugs  The last morning there I woke up to find drops of blood on the bed sheets and red bite marks that itch  thanks to these critters  On my next trip to Las Vegas I won t be so cheap  I m going to spend the money and stay at a hotel where the maids do their jobs and clean the rooms  and hotel management makes sure the rooms are free of bed bugs  
P =>  A Real Value Located Downtown  there s plenty of Police  amp  Securrity  A CAT bus stop is a block away to take you to the Strip          a night represents a great value  I have spent many vacations here  I reccomend asking for a top floor suite  The Casino can be a bit scarey  and smokey but this is a casino  not the Vatican   
P =>  Surprisingly pleased with the Gold Spike I have just returned from my   night stay at the Gold Spike and I couldn t wait to get home and add my review of this hotel  I was nervous to see what my room would be like after reading the negative reviews on this site  I must say  I was very pleased with it  considering the price I paid       for each of Friday and Saturday  and     for Sunday Hotel rooms in Vegas are extremely inflated on the weekends and I refuse to pay double what I did for the sake of a few hours of sleep and a hot shower  My room was well kept  the floor I stayed on was a non smoking one  the bathroom was adequate  complete with complimentary shampoo  shower gel etc  The carpet had some stains on it  but so has the carpet at the   star locations I have stayed at  Let me add too  that I was a single female  traveling alone and at no time did I feel my safety was threatened  Not only did I feel very comfortable at the Gold Spike  but I wouldn t hesitate to stay there again  My room was much better at the Gold Spike than the vintage room at the El Cortez that I stayed at last time   and that room cost me more  The casino downstairs is extremely smoky  as mentioned in previous reviews and the less fortunate locals do seem to favor this one  but again  I never felt threatened  I am very disappointed to discover that the casino has removed its blackjack tables  This was one of the few casinos left that you could actually play a hand for only     Overall  I was pleasantly pleased with my stay at the Gold Spike Hotel  If you are looking for   star luxury  go elsewhere  If you are looking for a clean  comfortable  well located  affordable stay near Freemont Street  give the Gold Spike a try  
P => good for the budget traveler Definitely not a luxury hotel  If you can push your way through the thick smoke in the casino to get to the registration desk you ve passed the biggest hurdle  The price of this hotel is very low and includes a great breakfast  The hotel room was quite clean and sufficient although there were many cigarette burns throughout the room  Recommended for the budget traveler but not those looking for luxury of any sort  
P =>  A Las Vegas Treasure The price is right  Rooms are spacious with a great shower  The chili dogs are to die for   you just might    If you are on a budget  I highly recommend this fine hotel  
P =>  i d stay again one thing to remember if you are going to stay here  it is cheap so don t book the place on that basis and then whinge about what you get  i stayed here for a couple of nights in sep       i was on a budget and it was extremely cheap   for what i paid it was a real bargain and i would stay there again yes it is a bit rough around the edges  it does stink of smoke and the people in the casino are a bit dodgy   those are the only bad things about the place  my room was non smoking  it was large  everything worked  there was loads of storage and the bed was comfy  the staff were friendly and helpful and the bar was really cheap  i just took my drinks up to my room  no problems at all  my room was just like the one in the photo  
P =>  cheap and authentic I love this hotel  every time i travel to Vegas i stay there  I m british  female and always travel alone and i always get a raised eyebrow when i say where i m staying  it seems that the locals think its a bit of a dive  Granted it looks a bit dingy in the casino and some of the rooms are a bit threadbare but it s clean and close to the action and what you save in room rates you can use on having fun If you want to experience seedy  real vagas then stay here  If you want plastic and sterile  there are plenty of other places to stay  Oh yeah and heres a tip  some of the rooms have been refurbished and the suites are much nicer than the ordinary rooms  if they re quiet they ll upgrade you for free if you ask nicely and even if you have to pay the extra it will only cost you a few dollars more 
P =>  Watch your wallet What a deceptive photo This was recommended to me by a vegas hotels dot com website and all I can say is what a rip off It is indeed like walking in to a human ash tray and homeless shelter I never felt safe and worried about my belongings when I left the hotel Outside I was constantly accosted by the down and out many of whom I saw walking around inside the casino It is obviously the local hang out and I saw many times where people where checking in and paying cash for the room That s always a bad sign I would never stay there again it soured me on Vegas  
P => Yes I m going to say it     Never Again  If I had known what I was getting into  I would have NEVER stayed here  I called myself finding a bargain because they offfer free breakfast and I would be saving money  The pics of the rooms are way too bright for what they really are  The hotel and casino is too dark for my taste  Some people may like that dark allyway feeling  but not me  After getting a bad impression from the casino  the elevators  the personnel  I was forced to go to my room because I had no extra money for another somewhere else   like on the strip for this trip  When I got to my room  it was dark  the carpet was stained  there were even stains on the walls  What the heck  I turned the TV on and discovered that the TV only carried   channels  Oh my goodness  So I go downstairs to see what the gambling was like  I found machine after machine that was broken  The people who wonder into the casino are mostly locals  Let s just say their a colorful bunch  The next morning I had a problem with the water drainage in the tub while trying to take a shower  House cleaning called someone to fix it  but it did the same thing for the duration of my stay  When I went down for breakfast  I got a good look at the  diner   It was missing a stool at the counter and they had yellow  caution  tape tied all around it  I saw the same lady take orders  handle money  and get the orders to customers  Oh I didn t mention that she picked a couple of pieces of toast off the counter with tongs after they had fallen off the plate  and then proceeded to deliver the meal to a customer did I  Well she did  After seeing that  I could imagine what else goes on in the  diner   The floors in the diner were always dirty  leftover plates  plastic  were left on the counters and booth tables until someone cleaned them off  The entire experience was just not good  I couldn t wait to get home and stayed away from the place as much as I could  If you plan on staying here with plans of traveling to the strip  be prepared for the distance that separated you  Like I said    Never Again  
P =>  Great place with great prices I have stayed at The Gold Spike numerous times  It is a great place to stay not only for the price of the rooms but for the type of people that stay there It reminds me of years ago as the people are not that young  Why people staying here have to worry about what type of people are playing the slots I dont know as I think most people that are in the Casino are quite friendly  amp  mature  I think the Hotel rooms are very nice  amp  roomy apart from the tvs in some of the rooms as they dont work that well  I have stayed at this Hotel about   times over the years with no problems as there are always adequate Security on Duty  Cant wait to go back there again  
P => Travelling alone and female   it was great value and I felt safe  After reading the responses to my thread about being safe at the Gold Spike I was worried at first  Then I realized that mostly women encouraged me that I would be fine So I arrived on a Sunday at about   p m   Found parking at once in one of the two parking lots  Well lit plus security   what do you want more Then you pass through the tiny but peaceful casino  there were always security guys who kind of had an eye on everybody and everything and were helpful with door opening and directions  to the check in counter  there it took a long    minutes because they were changing shifts  I was holding my breath during the elevator ride  whow what a smell  I expected the worst with the room But the room was nice  clean  I had a non smoker room  with enough place  towels  soap and shampoo  TV  phone and alarmclock was existing as well  It was quiet at night  aircon worked well and I was happy about the good and quick parking and walking to Freemont Street    minutes   I had paid about US     for a night and it was very very very good value  The hotel is excellentfor the money  if you don t need a pool or if you don t want to impress your boyfriend or girlfriend  I felt safe at any time  And safed a lot of money  There are a lot of Motels further down on Freemont Street   these can t be recommended at all   you can see from the outside that these place are not safe And  a word about the visitors locals in the casino   yes there are  quot interesting quot  and strange people gambling there  but they have not had very much luck or money in their life   and some of them are old and not in a good shape   but I cannot agree with other visitors who gave a bad review here  expecially about the locals   I had not problem at all in the casino or walking around in the streets nor did I have any bad impression of the gamblers in the Gold Spike   let them just do what they want to do  
P => Gold Spike is best over all value in Vegas The Spike has the atmosphere of     s Las Vegas  It s my favorite spot  always a few winos in the bar area  but no problems  It is the warm underbelly of Las Vegas  Smokey and dirty  Sure in the casino area  but my room was clean The old box unit Air Conditioner  while a bit loud  chilled like a ice cube Good shower heads Firm bed  Cheapo Bar was a plus     Well Drinks  Giant  quot silos quot  of beer    or   bucks       heavenly Penny slots were a plus  stretch your funds  Cheap room rates          per night  Friendly people behind the hotel desk Free breakfasts  Hotel Guests  Free two for one meals  Hotel Guests  Free morning bingo for those in the slot area   minute walk to downtown bus terminal  Bus back to airport for        Get any place in Vegas for a buck  It is a wonderful practical transit system Use Plaza s Swimming Pool down the street  same owners   Ask at front desk Great Deli Sandwiches  Avoid the fried stuff  but tuna salad  chicken salad  ruben       yummy It is a low rollers paradise Again  I loooove The Gold Spike  
P => Never Travel to Vegas with Cheap People I traveled to Las Vegas with a group of cheap  non gamblers  The four ladies I was with made their own reservations  separate from mine   thank God for small favors  They ended up staying at the Gold Spike          per night  for   days and   nights of hell  I stayed at the Rio for the entire time and they ended up staying with me the last night of our trip  When we arrived on Fremont Street  they were dragging their luggage and we could not find the Gold Spike  We ended up asking a man that was HOMELESS   He directed us to the Gold Spike and told us it was the luckiest place in town  He failed to mention that the room was dirty  dark  dusty  and the casino smelled of fresh and old urine  It is a local place  but even the locals are kinda scary looking  No lie  there was a blind may playing the slots when we walked in    My friends complained of the smell and the dirty bathroom  Each night we were in Vegas  they returned to their rooms before the sun went down because they were fearful for their lives  Leason learned for my travel buddies   you get what you pay for  
P =>  Gold Spike was fine We were expecting the worst after having seen the reviews for this hotel  but we were pleasantly surprised  Yes  the casino itself is kind of seedy  with some down and out people here and there  but our room was all that you could ask for  Very quiet  a good sized room  perfectly ordinary in all respects  In fact  my in laws were staying at the Stratosphere  and our rooms were practically identical  I will definitely stay here in the future  
P =>  Cheap and easy    I Was staying on Fremont street and promised my self I wouldn t leave without checking out the Spike and the Western  Well   I made it as far as the Elco on my walk to Western and got scared so I hung a couple of lefts and made it over to the Spike at   a m  Sunday morning  I bellied up to a blackjack table and bought in for         this was my last few hours in Vegas and I had last my gambling stash but wanted to get a few more drinks in before going to the airport  I played    blackjack and had a really friendly waitress bring about   drink every    min Also  they bring a you a Bingo card to play for free while you gamble  I think you win     but it was fun fun fun  The     lasted me about two hours of drinks  gambling and people watching  can t beat that with a stick  Only thing I would do different is to go there sooner next trip    
P =>  What A Joke    Talk about beind deceived    We booked our trip based on the lovely photos of this hotel posted ont he web  I would certainally like to see the room where they took these pics  cause it couldn t been at this hotel  The rooms were your typical cheap hotel rooms      very hard beds  a cheap swamp cooler  amp  a very funky smellFor the price  I could have dealt with this  but taking a   minute shower because the tub wouldn t drain totally ruined it for me  Had we not already booked  amp  paid for the rooms  I would have ran as fast as my feet could have taken me     I only wish I would have taken a camera with me so I could have posted pictures for all to see      Only stay here if you love the Ghetto   
P => Never believe what you see on the web Where to begin Oh yeah I was on line looking for a hotel on the old strip that was decentely priced and that looked nice Well Gold Spike was on there and had a beautiful room for viewing I thought for the price it s great and liked what I saw  Well when we walked in I thought we were stepping into a human ashtray   I had already purchased the rooms months ago and we were good to go or so I thought  the staff starts giving me grief because I won t put an additional deposit per room down Can you believe that they wanted me to put more money down then the room actually cost After we finally got on the elevator to go to our rooms I was now over powered by the smell of burning rubber  I was scared the elevator was breaking When I got back to the hotel later that night after dinner I needed an ice pack for my leg I called the front desk to ask where I could find an icemaker her exact words were  quot In the restraunt quot  click  I couldn t believe how rude some people can be  The next morning my friend called the front desk and asked for some extra towels  again the front desk quot  There down here come and get them quot  click  At that point all I wanted to do was go somewhere else but ofcoarse no refunds Now I know not to believe what you see on the web  
P =>  Hey I ve got a suite in Vegas  I suppose you could say that the hotel has seen better days   but i think it s always been like it   it s smoky   perhaps overpoweringly for some  it s tired looking and the clientelle may freak out some but it s a fun place   very cheap slots  cheap table minimums  waitress service and decent front desk staff  The rooms are surprisingly decent for what the hotel promises from the exterior and public areas   I stayed in a standard room for one trip       which was an equivalent inn style room and a suite for another stay        weekend  which is really just a big room on the top floor but itdoes have a balcony with a view towards the freemont street area  A free breakfast is included in the room rate if you ask but the ambience of the hotel doesnt really lend itself to making you want to eat When all is said and done  this is not the Vegas for those wanting to impress or live it up   it s a cheap room  especially at weekends  and a cheap gamble  The area is one block from the freemont street experience and one block from the bus station   and can appear a little unsafe although I ve never had an issue with safety myself  
P => Bus Station Ambiance  A Must See The place is the smokiest  dingiest casino and hotel I have found in Vegas  I have never stayed there  usually stay on the strip somewhere    stayed at the Westin  old Maxim  just off the strip this time  but something about this place intreagues me so much that I have to pay a gambling visit each time  That is as long as my lilly white lungs can stand the putrid smokey smell bellowing forth from the casino If you go  take a camera and try and get some shots of the casino clientele  They are definetly some of the oddest lot you will find in Vegas  But you seem to see all types there   bums  low rolling locals  a few curisioty seekers from the strip  It takes all types  right  I made my wife visit it one day after visiting Fremont Street and she alked in and immediately put some clothing over her nose and mouth to be able to breathe  and ran out the other side of the casino  I had to take her to the Wynn afterward for drinks to recover Go visit the spike  You ll get a kick out of it    
P =>  Definitely worth the money We came to Las Vegas to go rock climbing for a few days at Red Rock Canyon  so we spend very little time in our room  For the money  about     a night  this hotel was well worth it  Our room had new furnishings  pictures  and the bathroom tiles looked new  The room was very quiet  The casino was dirty and smelly  and the street the hotel is on is a bit sketchy  but it didn t bother me at all  I lived in Berkeley  CA for   years  so I m sort of used to it  The neighborhood is just   block from the Fremont Street Experience which was fun  We usually stay at hotels like Super  and Comfort Inn  and I think the room was slightly nicer than those chains  
P => A Good One Nite Stay Needed to add a night and stayed at the Spike for one nite on    th for      It was a clean room two queen size beds  I was alone so it was fine for me  The bathroom was small but clean  The water pressure was excellent for a shower  Got a free breakfast that you could have at  am which was perfect for me because I was on the road at   am  I found parking no problem in a small lot out back  I probably saved around     by staying there one nite  I would stay there again for one nite or maybe two at the most  I prefer hotels with casino s that have poker and are larger with more amenities  
P => Lovely Smoke free room My husband used to go here to play penny slots before the current craze  It was smoky  dirty  with less desirable clientele  Now  the casino has cleaned up and brightened up considerably  but still badly needs smoke removal improvement  The rooms  however are a different story  Ours was clean  bright  attractive on a smokefree floor  The biggest hotel problem is the parking  Apparently a formerly available leased adjacent property is now involved in a bankruptcy    or something  and limits guest space  We definitely would use this in preference to extremely high weekend rates  
P =>  What were we thinking  Just got home from our trip to Vegas  I know one thing  I will never stay at the Gold Spike again  It is true  the casino is very dark  dirty and smokey  The room wasn t clean and we saw cockroaches  The bed was very uncomfortable  We could feel all of the springs  The area surrounding the Gold Spike didn t seem safe at all  We saw a drug deal go down  The only reason we stayed at the Gold Spike was so we could see some shows on the strip and have dinner at a nice restaurant  Next visit we will stay at a much nicer hotel  
P =>  The price is right at  the Spike     The Gold Spike hotel rooms are a little worn  but they are much cleaner than the appearance of the casino would suggest  Though others who ve reviewed this place have said that there is not soap provided  my friend and I had a fresh bar of soap each day of our four night stay  For     on an il Saturday night  the rooms here are a steal  Yes  there is an air conditioner in each room  but I would recommend leaving it on even when you are not in the room  as they are situated low on the wall  and it takes awhile to cool the room  As for the casino    I played here at   in the morning just to conserve gambling bankroll after a tough night at the higher limit tables on Frement Street  Yes  the people here are  quot one step above street quot   sic   what that means is that they are real people  not the type who look down upon lower class  financially  that is  people  I did not feel threatened here  in fact  the atmosphere was quite loose  and I didn t feel as though anyone was out to impress anyone else  They were here to drink and gamble cheap    nothing wrong with that  Finally  I must say that the smell of the casino is indescribable  It is more than just cigarette smoke  it hits you even before you open the door of the place  and there is no term appropriate for it  The best I can think of is an  quot acrid pungence quot   In other words  if you really are a gambler   or you just have a stuffed up nose    give  quot the Spike quot  a try  
P =>  pretty nice here actually i stayed at the stardust last yr   paid   times as much for a room that wasnt as nice as this one  there was a four poster bed in the room   i had never seen one in any other hotel i stayed in  it was awesome the only complaint i had about the hotel is that they didnt have ESPNin the room  otherwise the gold spike was an excellent choice 
P =>  A different slice of life Just returned from Vegas and have no complaints about  The Spike   room was clean  good size and maid service every day  Casino certainly had a few characters but never felt threatened then again i live and drink in Jarrow   Paid        a night  money i saved help pay for trip to Grand Canyon  a must do   Cheap shopping to be had at Premium Outlets shutlle bus from nearby bus station only a        For an excellent meal try Harrahs steak restaurant in Harrahs casino on strip  not cheap at      including drinks but excellent food and out waiter Rick should have been on stage One thing about the Spike is you will certainly have an opinion i loved it but spent most my time outside it  If you get bus get     up and down strip    hour ticket only       hop on and off as you like personally i walked but its a good hour and a half from downtown to Ceasars etc  
P =>  For a place to sleep you can t beat the Gold Spike I read most of the reviews here about the Gold Spike before deciding to book a room there  because it was the only place I could find a with a dirt cheap weekend rate   and I ll admit I had some second thoughts  From reading the pure horror in some of the reviews here  apparently some people think the Gold Spike is one step above sleeping under a bridge in a cardboard box  and that it attracts the same kind of clientele Well  I m here to tell you that those people are wrong  Having said that  the Spike is definitely not the best choice for everyone  If you re the type of person that has to stay at a Holiday Inn when you travel because Super   isn t good enough for you  then you re going to hate the Gold Spike  If lower middle class people make you uncomfortable and longing for the security of your Lexus  you re going to hate the Gold Spike  If this is your first trip to Vegas and you re looking for the exciting action of the Strip  you re going to hate the Gold Spike  If  on the other hand  you just want a cheap place  close to the action on Fremont Street where you can crash at night  then the Gold Spike is one of the best values in town Our room and the hotel part was a touch worn but still clean and very serviceable   imagine a Motel   that was renovated some time in the   s  and you re pretty close  Others have written about the casino being a smoggy den of intrigue  but I didn t find that to be the case at all during any part of our visit  Granted  the weather was nice and the casino doors were wide open most of the time  so that probably helped ventilate it  but still  I didn t find it to be worse than anywhere else  The Spike dates from the old days of primitive casino technology  and so the ceilings are about as high as in your house   if there was a bunch of chain smokers in there  I imagine the smoke could pile up The Gold Spike is an ultra low roller casino  and so it attracts some low rolling locals  Like I said  if you re of the Cadillac and country club crowd you ll probably find them scary and intimidating  but having met a fair amount of them at the Spike s blackjack tables I found them to be more benign and friendly than most of the tourists in this town  Likewise the staff   this place isn t exactly the Bellagio  but I still found every employee I encountered to be more than friendly and helpful I plan to go back to Vegas again in a few months  and the Gold Spike will be high on my list of places to check for cheap rooms  You could probably find a better value on a weekday with some shopping around  but their weekend rates are hard to beat  
P =>  Not for the Faint of Heart    Just got back from the Gold Spike over Easter weekend  Always trusted Tripadvisor reviews so I knew this was not the Ritz  We are seasoned Vegas travelers  so we opted for something a little out of the ordinary this time  That  the Gold Spike is  My best description is   An innercity Greyhound station with rooms attached  Everyone is correct with the smoke smell comments that come from this place  The room was big enough  and clean somewhat  Very used and abused furnishings  but sheets that were pristine white  A bare bones bathroom that had poreclin missing in the sink and caulk coming apart around it  but  it was clean  The shower and curtain were also clean  The carpet  well I would not walk barefoot on it  You get no ammenities in this place  bring your own everything  soap  shampoo  etc   We did get housekeeping daily with fresh towels  Our view was lovely  overlooked the roof and every rooftop airconditioning unit  One of the few hotels in Vegas where the actual windows still open though Staff  while not polished  poised or even clean at times was very friendly and helpful  The diner we would not eat at  but did provide on of the BEST cups of coffee ever had in Vegas    Loved the stuff  Casino  well  your not going to become a millionaire here  but your money seems to go a long way  You are a very short walk from Freemont street and across the street from the El Cortez  I was worried about the neighborhood reading previous reviews  but found everything to be safe and fine  There certainly was security seen around this place and the area  We literally slept     hours every night in Vegas  so for us  these accomodations were fine  We paid        per night for a Fri Sun  Holiday weekend stay  You can t beat that  Would we stay here again  NO  Would we recommend it to others  Only if you really want a place to shower and lay your head for a bit from exhaustion  If you are going to Vegas for the first time  this is not the place for you  If you like Vegas and want to try downtown  try Fitzgerals or the Plaza  If you and your buddies are getting away for the weekend to get drunk and whoop it up  by all means this place will suit you fine  
P =>  The Reviews are True ch   through    I had foolishly planned to stay at the very cheap GOLD SPIKE        per night but the reviews here and in the Las Vegas Advisor were just too scary  I am glad I changed hotels  I did visit the GOLD SPIKE and it was as bad as the reviews said  I am told that the rooms are nice but I found the casino dark  smoky and noisy  the carpet was filthy and the crowd was a step above the street  From my room at the Lady Luck I observed that the police are at the GOLD SPIKE all the time  Drugs and prostitutes are common  Apparently tourists will meet a regular seeming girl there only to be confronted by her pimp outside the place demanding payment  Bad news  
P =>  Right out of a movie I walked thru the Gold Spike once and that was enough  It is perhaps the dankest  darkest  nastiest dive I have ever seen  The people I saw in the casino were low lifes  trailer trash  and hockey hair  mullet  meth dealer types  It was right out of a movie where the undercover cop has to walk into a tough joint  I lasted less than   minutes  If you stay here  you are making a big mistake  Not cool  
P => great for people watching and cheap drinks       couldnt get enough of the place ended up at there bar every night the drinks were the cheapest in town the people in there were very friendly no matter how strange they seemed the table games were cheap and very fun to play with the variety of characters i will stay at the gold spike every trip i make to vegas             
P => Get what you pay for This is not a nice motel  but it is a nice place to sleep  If you re going to Vegas to travel the strip and see the sights  while only spending time in your room to bathe and sleep  this ll do just fine  But  if you re looking for a nice room with a nice casino downstairs  this isn t it  
P =>  okay for the money this is NOT where you take your mother   but once out of the casino  the room was worn  but very clean   large suite of   rooms and a great balcony for pennies   the food wasn t bad either   you get over the smell of the casino after awhile  
P =>  Can t beat the Gold Spike  I loved the Gold Spike  You simply can t beat it in a town that I found can be so very expensive  Our room was large and clean  the showers were hot  and the casino was tons of fun  We were a little unsure about the place at first  having read some reviews here  but we paid     tax included for a Friday through Monday stay    nights   The restaurant was a little scary and we did not have the courage to eat there  but it is so close to many others that it was no big deal  Highly recommended for a cheap and adventurous trip to Vegas  If you need luxury  go ahead and pay the extra          dollars a night on the strip  they are happy to eat up your money  But  if you are like me and would rather spend that money on having fun in Vegas  the Gold Spike is the place to stay  Don t let the dingy casino scare you  the rooms are surprisingly nice and worth every penny  
P =>  Best Weekend Bargain We stayed two weekend nights in mid ober and  once again  found this to be an incredible bargain  At     per night including tax for a Friday and Saturday  no casino in Vegas can touch this  You really are maybe a   minute walk from the Freemont Street Experience  perhaps   minute from the Lady Luck  The carpets may have seen better days and the bathrooms are a little worn  but the rooms are more than adequate and certainly on par with properties nearby that charge   or   times as much The diner is CHEAP  and they give you   for   coupons each day For players  drinks are  of course  free and this includes the mighty    oz  jumbo beer  Even to purchase it is a mere    A good deal during the week  but this place will save you literally hundreds on the weekend  Try it  
P =>  Another great vacation Jack and I just returned from a lovely   weeks in Vegas  as you know we prefer the downtown for the atmosphere and colourful people events  looses slots  hot blackjack and so on  Yes we could have easiely spent        USD for a night at the Luxor but by staying at the G S we trimmed that to less that     Gold Spike is a very friendly enviroment and w look forward toreturning in the very near future  The rumours shold start circulating about the plans to modernize the area and it is our hope the G P is only given a cosmetic overhaul  This is the place to try it out  be open about it and think of the      bucks in your pocket 
P =>  the third world of vegas The Gold Spike is the third world country of las vegas  When you first enter  there is a bit of culture shock     you see a dilapidated building  funny looking people  and lots of smoking  soon you adjust and you realize that your pocket change goes a long way  whereas    is the standard tip for a cocktail server in vegas  it s like a    tip here because the patrons here don t tip at all  it s rare in vegas  at a    table  no less  that a server comes around before you are ready for another drink  and the    tables are great  single deck  with no      however  the    drinks at the bar leave much to be desired  the casino is relaxed  the staff dresses casual  this place is perfect for a guys trip to vegas  as the fairer sex might be a bit disgusted  
P =>  A Really Good Place  The Gold Spike is not for everyone  for the price it is a GREAT bargin  I was there in uary     amp  will be there again in ust  I liked the downtown location  amp  the smokey casino is  quot interesting quot  with penny  amp  nickel slots  The cafe was too scary for my taste  and it is easy to take the CAT bus to the strip and thanks to the LV police  there s little crime to worry about  for     a night I get a huge suite with two A C units  a fridge  a dining area  a wrap around terrace  a sofa  a king sized bed and a good bathroom  What else do you need   
P => Great Bargain    My husband and I spent a week at  the spike  in ember  After reading the reviews I didn t know what to expect  For a room under     a night it was better than what I expected  The staff was helpful  the room was actually very large compared to the other Vegas hotels  and the cheap blackjack was great at the end of the night  Included in the price of the room was a free breakfast and that wasn t bad either  I always felt safe walking to or from Freemont at night and the property did have security working outside every night we were there  Is it as nice as Mandalay Bay  Far from it  But it s cheap  was clean  and instead of spending money on a room I spent very little time in I spent it in the casinos  
P => ent place that grows on you Like some readers  I was a bit apprehensive about what to expect after reading the reviews  For         a night  it was pretty decent  My husband and I were put off initially upon entering the very smokey casino  but after checking into our room  the place started to grow on us     The room was clean and decent  and perfect for what we needed   a bed and a shower  The air conditioning worked fine   a little loud  but nothing too disturbing  and I am the world s lightest  most sensitive sleeper   The food at the diner was pretty good  too   nothing fancy  but great prices for decent quality meals  Location was pretty ideal   right in downtown  walking distance to Fremont  and a short ride to the Strip  And the service staff was really friendly  The only negative comment I d have is the smokiness of the casino  but really   we didn t come to Vegas to stay holed up in one hotel casino  So unless you re super sensitive to smoke  which you ll only get walking through the casino  I d recommend the Gold Spike as a good  cheap place to hang your hat at the end of the day  
P =>  Cramped smoky and dirty I ve stayed in a lot of Vegas hotels  both Strip and downtown  and this was easily the worst place I ve stayed  I know it s the cheapest  but do they have to prove it in so many ways  The room was shoehorned into a corner  the door looked like it opened into a closet   the front desk  located in the casino itself  looked like a     hour motel desk  and the whole place reeked of smoke  I suppose this could be called  quot Old Vegas quot   but yikes  Unless you are really strapped for cash and are a smoker  do yourself the favor and spend the other     to go somewhere else  
P =>  Not bad Not Bad  After reading the reviews on the website  I was real worried about this hotel  But  for the price  it was just fine  Overall  the beds were very comfortable  the showers were very hot  and look out for the water pressure  The lighting in the hotel room was very dim  but open the drapes  let in some hot Vegas sun  and you having lighting  Very close to Fremont Street  and only a     cab ride to Caesar s Palace at the center of the strip  If you can walk quickly through the yucky casino to the elevator to sleep and shower  you can handle this place  The casino could really use a remodel job      s wood paneling  and stunk of stale smoke  need a new ventilation system for sure  Still  for the price of      including all taxes and fees for   nights over a long weekend  I know the price can t be beat    
P => Great for low rollers The Gold Spike is not for everyone  If what you want is a decent room with a decent bed to sleep in and an adequate bathroom to shower in for           a night this is the place for you  If you desire anything upscale or fancy don t even think about it  In other words  if Motel   is fine you will like this place and if you like the Hyatt or riott skip it  The casino is dark and populated with some strange characters but they typically have one    double deck and one    single deck blackjack table  full pay on a natural  going at all times and a    single deck table open in the evenings  There is a fourth table that I have NEVER seen open  If you like blackjack without high limits this place is for you  Cheap slots abound if that s what you are into  Usually one cocktail waitress so service is not speedy but I have waited a lot longer in other places  I stick to Heinekens but have heard the mixed drinks are weak  Overall  if you like cheap gambling and don t need luxury this place is great  Otherwise  stay far away  
P => Enjoyed My husband and I decided to go to Vegas for our   th Anniversary  We were there from         to         and have never been there before  We stayed at Gold Spike and read all the reviews before going so didn t know what to expect but we thought it was a great place to stay and plan to stay there next time we go  The people were so nice and helped push the elevator button when are hands were full  They just were very helpful  It is walking distance from the bus and only cost   to ride the bus all day  We had a great time and anyone who isn t planning on just sitting in there room will enjoy the stay  Nothing fancy but it is were slept and ate at night  We did do most of our winning in the casino too   
P =>  You can t beat it for the price You can t beat this place for the price  Located in downtown Las Vegas  the old strip   Had a nice king bed  There are a lot of homeless people around and you have to be careful but for the price it was surpisingly nice  
P => Hey a nice place to stay at a great price  I like the  quot the spike quot  a lot  Me and My Fellas always stay at the gold spike  The rooms are nice and the people are friendly  Most of the time when you are on vacation you didn t be in your room due to being out sightseeing or partying  The Gold spike allows you to spent less on a room and more on your vacation  We are going again from april   th to   rd   We Love it   
P => Funky  Old School  Vegas If you are into people watching     Blackjack and nickel slots  you will love this place  If you want to book the Jacuzzi Suite at the Luxor  keep looking Yes  it s well worn  the Casino  not the clean  remodeled rooms   but it is the real and authentic deal  I ve stayed here on most trips since       and really appreciate the VIP treatment that would require a large bankroll on the Strip  I also agree with the locals that downtown Casinos offer the best slot machine odds  
P =>  Retro Downtown    Give It A Try  Every other review written about the  quot Spike quot  is probably true    it s all in the eyes of the beholder  I booked there because of price  At about     a night  the Gold Spike was by far the cheapest decent place this time of year in Vegas  Driving up it looked a little sketchy  but I ve seen worse  From the other reviews  I was ready to choke to dealth when I walked in the casino  I am and have always been a non smoker  I found the air in the casino to be just fine  Sure  there were plenty of people smoking  but nothing worse than any other casino s air  and even better than some  Even sitting next to someone smoking at the blackjack table wasn t too bad  The ventilation seemed great to me  The rooms were perfect  clean  comfortable  safe  and dirt cheap  I asked for and got a non smoking room  and it was indeed a non smoking room  Outside temperatures were pushing    and the air conditioner worked fine  Walking a block to the Fremont Experience and the other downtown casinos was never scary  no matter what time of day or night  I saw security walking and on bikes all time and felt safe  There were a few bums around  but I was never bothered  Played some blackjack at the casino  and the    minimums were great  Didn t see that anywhere else in town  Some of the dealers couldn t count very well  which added to the entertainment of it all  The other gamblers in the casino were some of the most colorful characters I ve ever met  Give the  quot Spike quot  a try if you want a good  cheap room  and don t mind a little local flavor  If you want a fancy hotel  a pool  and ritzy service  than go somewhere else  
P => bring some reeze

P =>  This place is a trip   Love it   
P =>  A Clean Quiet Really Cheap Suite  
P => 
P => Great place With the exception of the  quot free breakfast quot  which is really a sales presentation  this is a great property  I would highly recommend if you are a  nd or  rd timer Vegas vacationer and you are a little tired of the strip  This is a great place to bring a family  I would recommend renting a car for your strip show visits  We found a garage on the strip  near the M amp M store  where we could park for       all day  There was a full kitchen so not all of your time has to be spent looking for places to eat  This property is very close to a Whole Foods and Wal mart  Parking can be challenging if you are coming in late from a show  Very close to M Casino down the road if you want to gamble but don t want to deal with the strip  I recommend Red Cup cafe for all   of your meals  Portions are generous  You can bring your leftovers and put them in the full size refridgerator that is available  I will stay again  
P => you can cook but you can t swim  cold pool The rooms were big  the kitchen well appointed  You don t have to eat out for every meal  But we were disappointed that none of the pools were heated enough to swim in  And the sofa bed mattress is awful  
P =>   very pleasant accomodations but a little far away from The Strip Our family traded into a   bedroom apt  timeshare for a week and it was great  I knew it would be   miles from The Strip but didn t think that would be a hindrance  The rental car was in my name  and I was therefore the chauffeur for all the trips in and out of town  A shuttle was available most hours of the day  but for a fee  of which the others chose not to take advantage  The South Point Casino is next door and a good diversion  but not as spectacular as the biggies in town  As for driving  Las Vegas was an easy city to maneuver  I    went right into the city    minutes away and The Strip was only a block or two from any exit  Parking was free in all the casinos  At least in mid ember  the traffic was not horrific  but then I am from the Washington D C  area  and even the taxis were agreeable to letting me in when I was in the wrong lane  We rarely had to park too far from the hotel casino entrance  Now  the   bedroom unit was very lovely  had an entrance foyer with two   bedroom units with locked doors off it  Beautifully furnished with flat screen TVs on living room and bedroom walls  Kitchen was well furnished  Bathrooms very nice with standup shower  a jetted tub was in the bedroom area across from the closet  The complex is HUGE and still building and timeshare sales are going strong  Our building  Daisy  was next to a parking garage  which we only needed once  It was a little hike to the pools and the fitness center  but they were great  and the outdoor jacuzzi very nice  I liked that the pool furniture  when moved across the cement decking  was nearly silent  There were big piles of towels and an attendant at the main pool  The fitness center was well equipped with   TVs and busy in the morning    am  There were barbecue grills and tables in this area also  but I don t think anyone from Daisy would have schlepped the hot dogs that far  Check in was easy  We arrived       hours before our  pm check in  They did the paperwork and took my cellphone number  called an hour later that we could go in  We had towel service midweek  Internet access was free in the lounge in the main building  but only   computers were working when I wanted to print out my boarding passes  so they were very accommodating at the front desk though they couldn t fix the computers  In unit wireless cost        for the week  Check out was just a phone call to tell them we were leaving  card keys left in the unit  Elevators had posted activities for the day  there were usually     things  but we didnt  attend  The area is great  We visited Lake Mead  the Hoover Dam and Red Rock Canyon for hiking  Spent   days at Zion and Bryce National Parks in UT before going down to Las Vegas  Want to return  
P =>   HAD THE BEST TIME   We stayed   nights at Grandview in the Daisy building on leval    Everything was nice and clean and well decorated if you stay more than three days there is limmited maid service   pickup service   YOU NEED A RENTAL   We parked our rental vehicle from FOX   they are the cheepest   in the parking garage that has plently of space  No problem with parking  The room had everything  well stocked with dishes and cooking utensils  dish and dishwasher soap  washer  amp  dryer incl soap  Lge table and   chairs  sofasectional and a chair  Two T V s  one in living room and one in bedroom  Large bathroom with   sinks and large shower  and jet tub  The pool area was nice with large swimming pool  warm  and hot tub  Towels supplied at pool  We hate to do timeshare presentation it takes up too much of your time  The location is very good right on Las Vegas Blid  five minute walk next door to Southpoint  five minute drive to M resort south  Five minute drive to interstate and same distance for grocery shopping at Walmart  Ten minute drive to the strip Being off the strip is a good and bad thing There is a outlet center and a reg mall just north of the location  Only thnig I would like to see is a REAL Chicago style pizza place and a family stlye resturant for breakfast  Not a Ihop   hate it    This was our fourth or fifth trip to Vegas so we did more site seeing this time We went to Valley of Fire worth the trip and a must see we also made the trip to Hoover Dam that was only    miles from Valley of Fire We also made a trip to Mt Charleston  There is a lot of driving you need a car      
P =>   Four nights   Grandview in Las Vegas We stayed   nights at Grandview in the Jasmine building  Everything was nice and clean and well decorated  By the amount of vehicles in the parking lot the building was full  but was very quiet  No problem with parking  The room had everything  well stocked with dishes and cooking utensils  dish and dishwasher soap  washer  amp  dryer incl soap  Lge table and   chairs  chesterfield and chairs  Two T V s  one in living room and one in bedroom  Large bathroom with   sinks and large shower  and jet tub  The pool area was nice with large swimming pool  warm  and hot tub  Towels supplied at pool  Asked to do timeshare presentation  lined and nothing further except letter under door inviting us again  The only negative about accommodation is our condo faced east and sun bright in morning as only wooden blinds in bedroom   Bring eye covers  The other was couch sofa had very thin mattress  The location is very good  five minute walk next door to Southpoint  five minute drive to M resort south  Five minute drive to interstate and same distance for grocery shopping at Walmart  Ten minute drive to the strip  
P =>  LOVELY ACCOMODATION Stayed for a week with   friends Accomodation was great had everything we needed in apartment Everywhere was so clean Very spacious and comfortable The weather was very hot and made use of the pool and sunbeds most afternoons Would definately recommend Grandview  Staff were very nice  
P =>  loved it stayed for   weeks  The appartments are great  There is everything you need  The shower was huge  the bathroom was really nice  the kitchen was really well equipped  there are free buses going to the grocery store and shopping outlets and loads of other places  appartment really clean for a smoking one  bed was great huge very comfortable  best bit the jucuzzi bath really nice  barbe equipment available and pool open to late so you can get into jucuzzi at night  really nice people there and very quiet and peaceful at the pool  went next door to southpoint a few nights  After   pm     pounder and chips      great  
P =>  Average at best We stayed at the Grandview and  initially  liked the property  We stayed in the newest building on the first floor and that worked well for us  However  after about   days we found ants in the bathroom and on the  th day we found a bug in the bathroom we couldn t identify   all were alive  When we discussed with management they told us they have those issues on the first floor but we weren t told when we checked in  The resort is kind of far from the Strip but we didn t find that to be too much of an issue  
P =>  Would go back again and again This property is excellant  We stayed there for   nights  and really enjoyed everything there  It was really quiet  and very nice  The  bedroom was plenty of room for a family of    
P =>   Nice Place away from the Strip My in laws were in Las Vegas for the AARP convention and traded their timeshare week in Pennsylvania for the Grandview  Each master suite consists of       bedroom suites with their own separate doors opening into a foyer and the main door to the hallway  It was a very basic suite with all the amenities that a normal timeshare has without all the bells and whistles  It contained a regular size kitchen  bathroom  master bedroom  master bath  It also had a small living and dining room  The living room had a pullout sofa  an entertainment center with DVD player and large old school TV  Master bedroom had a king bed  smaller TV and no DVD player  Master Bath had a nice jacuzzi tub  separate from the actual bathroom  fairly big walk in shower and dual sinks  According to the sales folks    buildings are completed with   more coming  They have   thousand units now  and I m guessing with the other   buildings  they will add another     or so rooms  Access is very easy  as it is south on LV boulevard  about   miles or so from the Mandalay Bay  Or  you can access it from I    as well  It s located right next to the South Point Casino  The only real complaint I had was that the walls seem to be very thin  I consistently heard running water and chairs being moved in the other units around us  We didn t take part in the timeshare lockdown  but on one of our walks around the complex  I did see the sales center where the models were  and they were nothing like the unit we had  I m not sure if this is how they are planning to remodel in the future  but I thought of the classic  bait and switch technique   quot Take a look at this beautiful model unit  Nice furniture         quot  plasma screen TV s  etc  quot  And oh  by the way  this is NOT the unit you will actually be getting if you buy here  LOL So  in conclusion  I probably would not stay here again unless it was the same type scenario  Not because I didn t like it  just to many other places to stay in Vegas  
P =>   Great stay We stayed at the Grandview in t  We were in one of the new buildings    th floor   end unit  The room was well furnished and clean  I like that it was two separate rooms with lots of space   full kitchen with utencils  The only downside is that the jacuzzi can be loud and you re not supposed to use it after     Not too far from the strip  about    minutes  in the car  Loved the location because we were not in the hustle and bustle of Las Vegas  There is a casino right next door   Southpoint and a new casino further down the road    quot M quot   
P =>   Don t be fooled by positive reviews  this is a   star wannabe place Based on the glowing reviews on Expedia and Trip Advisor  which is now owned by Expedia   which is worth noting  I decided to try Grand View  This place is a Time Share Nightmare  If you are expecting a luxury condo experience   do yourself a favor and pay a little more to stay at The Signature at MGM Grand which is so vastly superior that I am sorry I didn t stay there this trip  We were given a handicapped room  did not ask for one  on the  rd floor of the Daisy Tower which had a view of a garbage dumpster and sounds to match  No fresh air in the room which smelled of disinfectant and damp carpeting  Do not pay more than     a night and you will have nothing to complain about  The decor is absolutely frightening Red  White and Black  Stripes  Diamonds  Plaids  Checks all mixed together to make you queasy  Drapes do not match carpet and windows do not open  Air conditioning LOUD and sporadic  Only one small bathroom sink  I cannot imagine what people do who come here with children or more than   people   The faucet is the kind they use at Gas Station restrooms  where you have to press it for the water to come on and when it does you had better use it fast before it shuts off  There is no way to regulate the water temperature  I ended up using the kitchen sink to wash my face  If you have an extra mirror   bring it so that someone can use that sink The cabinets were very cheap   everything about this place made me cringe as I felt like it was built in the      s and yet IT WAS JUST COMPLETED  I think they may have salvaged a lot of the materials from hotels that were blown up over the years  Terrible sound proofing   no security  I felt trapped  If you think you are getting a deal  think again  the extra room in the living room is not really suitable for sleeping   there is no closet space or shelving in there  I don t think I would be as annoyed if the reviews were more accurate   one person actually insinuated this place was on a par with a five star property on the strip  There is NO SECURITY   light in the entryway was out  PLEASE do not make the same mistake  This is a zoo with time share sales pitches and people looking confused everywhere  It is not relaxing and there are much better choices out there NO FREE INTERNET        per night  and a        per night charge to USE THE SAFE IN THE ROOM NO RESTAURANTS ON PROPERTYNOT AFFILIATED WITH SOUTH POINT CASINO   so you can t charge food there to your bill Good points    flatscreen TV s that worked  A large jacuzzi tub  took    minutes to fill A comfortable mattress  with very rough sheets   had to use my own   A working kitchen with large refrigerator and stove Thank goodness I brought my own sheets because the sheets on the bed were rough as sandpaper and the comforter was queen sized  on a King Bed   Calls to housekeeping were not returned  Check out is       am  Sharp  
P =>   Happy with My Choice I found a buy one night get one free on Expedia for the Grandview so I took it  Friday and Saturday for only      What a deal  Anyway  My room really was an apartment furnished like a model unit   very nice  The room had a great view of the strip and the jetted tub was a plus  As others have mentioned the walls are thin but my neighbors tried to keep the noise down but still rather audible  Also as mentioned before  do not expect the usual hotel service or amenities  The pool   spa area was very nice and very crowded during my visit If you are familiar with Vegas and can find a deal on this property then by all means go  Price wise at full retail this property may not be competitive with hotels in the same price range if you consider the incentives offered  Last  the timeshare thing  It was offered during check in and I said no thank you  No hard push at the front desk thus the timeshare aspect did not come into play  
P =>   Far from the Strip but excellent hotel Even though it is ideal to stay on the strip  this is the best hotel if you decide to stay far from the strip  Definitely need a car but every hotel in Vegas has lots of parking so that is not a problem  Did not use any of the services because we spent the whole time on the strip  Suites are very roomy  comfortable and clean and have a fully equipped kitchen  Only minus found was that there is a     charge per day per computer for internet connection  
P =>  Great Experience The Grandview was a great place to stay   reserved as a Last Call vacation through RCI  We were assigned to a one bedroom in the Daisy tower on the   st floor  This is a newer tower and it was very nice  granite countertops  flat screen TVs in the livingroom and bedroom  Whirlpool bathtub in bedroom  Lots of storage   extra hanging closet in livingroom and drawer space for the person on the pull out couch  One can judge a place by how they take care of problems  Upon arrival  our coffee pot was leaking and it was replaced with a new pot within minutes of calling  They encouraged paying an extra     for use of in room safe but we declined and were able to use the safe with no deposit  We didn t pay for in room wireless internet   I went to the lounge and used the computers for free  and was able to print a coupon as well   The exercise room had two out of order elliptical machines and the treadmills were all somewhat different  It would be good to post some operating instructions for this equipment because people were confused on how to operate the treadmills  There is also good shopping nearby off of Blue Diamond  Target  Kohls  Sally s Beauty  Ross   We declined the timeshare presentation at check in and received another better offer for the presentation a couple days after check in  We did not do the Grandview timeshare presentation The Southpoint casino which is right next door is very new and nice  It has several restaurants  movie theater  bowling alley   we ate there several times  They have some fantastic after midnight specials in the caf   Great access to I    and I     from the resort   only a few minutes from the strip  We did attend a timeshare presentation at Wyndom   received     casino play  two free buffets  two tickets to the comedy club and two vacation vouchers  We were two women traveling together  one single and one without hubby   We went to Hypnosis Unleashed  Terry Stokes   Freemont Experience on Sat eve and saw a great band  www ybrband com   Harrah s comedy club  Let s Make a Deal game show  search Google for free tickets available on line   The Price is Right game show  the CSI Experience at MGM  
P =>  Wonderful Hotel Very Far from Strip My husband and I stayed here for   week during our honeymoon  a wedding gift   We stayed in a beautiful   bedroom suite with all the ammenities of home  a large  fully equipted kitchen  in suite laundry  comfortable living room  separate bedroom  and huge  gorgeous bathroom  Not at all what I expected a timeshare to be like  Since the use of the timeshare for the week was a gift from a timeshare owning relative  I never attended any of the sales tours  etc  so I cannot comment on those  The pool was beautiful  the grounds well kept  Absolutely pristine  The only things I can complain about is that there is no restaurant  except a small snack shack  on the grounds  and at the time when we went  the only nearby restaurants were the ones in the casino next door  South Pointe   which we didn t find very good  Also  it was a very long way from the strip  Even though the address reads  quot Las Vegas Blvd quot  it was a very long trip from the strip  and with paying for the cabs and airfare  we probably could have paid to stay on the strip with no cabfare needed in a package deal for the same price  Sure wish it was on the strip  as it really is a beautiful property  nicely furnished and decorated  If it was on the strip  I would have loved to buy a timeshare there as well  but it s not worth the hassle of being away from the shows  no where to eat  You basically get ready to go out for the day and expect not to come back till after dinner  Unless you want to take the free daily  maybe more than daily   shuttle to the grocery store  or the shuttle to the strip that is always late  takes forever  and for which you have to wait on the hot pavement for over an hour  
P =>   Not a Hotel Grandview is located   miles away from the strip  There is a complimentary shuttle that runs back  amp  fourth throughout the day  but service stops at about  am  Overall Grandview is a nice timeshare resort  If you are looking for a hotel with room service and a casino and amenities of that nature  this is not the place for you  They have a pool which is nice and a  quot deli quot  onsite  but outside of that EVERYTHING else is on the strip  This is not a bad place to stay  I actually had a GREAT time in Vegas  but if your looking for more of the Vegas  quot life quot  I wouldn t suggest Grandview    however if you are looking for the Vegas  quot life quot  as well as the ability to be removed from the  quot life quot  this is the place to be  
P =>   Great place We stayed at Grandview Las Vegas from         We had a great time  It s a very nice resort and well taken care of The pros   The staff were very friendly  always willing to bend over backwards for their guests  The hotel was very clean and so were the rooms  The rooms were spacious and nicely decorated  The beds were comfortable  The jacuzzi in the room was so nice too   Really appreciated the washing machine and dryer  we were only supplied with one tiny box of detergent   it s so nice being able to do some laundry while on vacation  The rooms all have kitchens  I loved that  We definitely saved some money by making breakfast in the morning  The pools were very nice and clean  There were plenty of chairs at the pool   we have been to some hotels where it is a nightmare trying to find two chairs after ten am  I only wish we had more time to spend relaxing there It was nice that this hotel is so close to South Point since there is no casino at Grandview  Also gives you a little bit more for food and restaurant options  We didn t even really eat at the Grandview so I cant really comment on the restaurants  Actually  my husband bought us some food from  quot the deli  quot  it was okay  We mostly ate on the strip We rented a car for the week so the distance from the Grandview to the strip didn t really matter  The cons   Nothing horrible  The pillows were actually horrible  They were all lumpy and just really uncomfortable  And the jacuzzi hours sucked  The hours were from  am   pm  Who is in their room during these hours  So we didn t get to enjoy the jacuzzi that much One more thing was housekeeping  from what I understood they would only clean your room after you have been there for a few days   I thought that was odd just because I like getting housekeeping everyday We booked a show through the hotel and they made us pay cash which was a little inconvenient  don t understand why we couldn t pay with a credit card  The distance from the strip isn t a bad thing  just be prepared to spend    ish a way on cab rides to and from the strip if you don t rent a car  All in all  it was a great experience  I definitely would stay there again but would recommend to rent a car to anyone that does stay at this hotel  Also make you sure go to one of the grocery stores near by and buy some groceries  may as well take advantage of the fact that there is a fully equipped kitchen as you definitely can save some money  I wish we have cooked more meals there  I would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends and family  
P =>  Very Impressed   Arrived at this property knowing it is a time share or related to a time share  To my surprise  I was checked in and not given the  quot sales pitch quot  once I announced that I was visiting on business  The suites are spacious  well decorated  convenient full kitchen  ammenities where not in tune with the luxurious style of the suites  There was a dinning room  living room  full kitchen  closets  a  quot Jaccuzi Tub quot  between the bathroom and the bedroom  My only complaint would be the   door deal to access your suite  My neighbors where rather strange and liked leaving their door open going in and out at all hours of the day and night  However  being a GM at a luxury property  I realize that human behavior cannot be blamed on the hotel management I will recommend this property to friends and relatives if they plan to visit Las Vegas  My overall impression is   Impressed  
P =>  Needs sound proofing If you are standing in the bathroom or in your bedroom and the downstairs  upstairs or next door neighbour has a shower or runs the tub  you cannot hear yourself speak  Our neighbours woke us up at  am just walking around and the other neighbours woke us up at     am with their shower  Great value but housekeeping needs to learn how to wipe down and clean doors and kitchen  Food splattered on walls  dirty doors  Dishwasher in pieces on kitchen floor  water bottle on counter and plumber sweat smell in condo upon arrival Nice place to visit  do not buy  
P =>   As good as advertised This place was perfect for us  My wife and I took our    yr old daughter and two of her    yr old friends to Vegas   Yes I know why in the hell would we ever do that to ourselves     I looked online and found this place for an a amazing deal  buy one night and get the second for free  so the choice became obvious  My best friend and his wife stayed there last year and nothing but great things to say  I feel the same  the place was perfect  The room was great  the jacuzzi tub was WONDERFUL  The was just ok by Vegas standards and parking was a challenge  they have more than enough space for parking but you may have a walk a bit  but that s par for the course in Vegas   This place is a timeshare deal but they operate as a hotel so upon check in they might ask if you re interested in having  Breakfast  with them  that s a veiled attempt to get you in a sales meeting for the time share  Just tell them no  they are very polite and will continue on with your check in  Lastly for for the gaming the South Point may as well be on the same lot as it only a few steps away All in all a great place  
P =>   Great stay   will go again  We were a party of   adults who shared   room at GrandView  Everything was great   from the reception to checkout  We requested for a corner room on a high floor with a good view and got it  The room was clean and well decorated  The   TVs were great  We cooked and used the washer dryer as well  I would recommend the hotel and will come back again The only thing   not really negative    that the hotel is located a little far from the strip  
P =>   great place to stay My husband and I have only gone to vegas a couple of times and have stayed on the stripThe last ime we stayed here  we really loved it  Love that it is not on the strip  Very clean and large rooms  When you stay in a hotel room you have where no to where to hang out  Here  it s like a little apartment  You can get a few groceries and drinks for day time  and night time munching  The casino right next door has a great buffet   Also a liquor store  You can also get a taxi there to get to the strip  There is also a shuttle for a nominal fee It takes you to a couple for hotels and back  A little bit of a ride but there is no drinking and driving this way  Better for your budget   There are   pools  one heated and one not  The timeshare tour is long  so if you have no interst in buying don t take the tour for the free stuff  If your just on vacation don t waste your time or their s  after all they are there to sell    I understand some have complained about hearing other peoplebut  it is just a hotel don t forget  not a place to live  We loved it and won t sty anywhere else next time we go  
P =>   Wonderful Stay Inspite of some of the bad reviews my husband and I stay at Grandview Resort was very pleasant  The beds were comfortable the rooms were nicely decorated and clean  Sometimes you may hear next door guest voices or the running water of the tub because the walls are so thin but we didn t hear much of that at all The staff didn t bother us we only received our one reminder call of the resort presentation tour  Just my advise please do not take this tour it takes most of your time when you could be touring Vegas it is extremely too long  We were told    minutes we were there to listen to this sales pitch for   hours  The resort has a free shuttle bus that takes you to the market and to other places through out the week  The resort also have an outside company shuttle bus called Ritz Transportation that takes you to the strip for       a day  The shuttle bus also picks you up and drops you off from the airport to the resort for       per person that beats paying for the expensive cabs  I would recomend this resort just don t take the timeshare tour presentation too long  
P =>   Pros and Cons    We have been at the Grandview for a couple of days now and stay through Saturday  I read all of the reviews before coming and wanted to add some of my own Pros and Cons of the resort   Pros    Very comfortable bed and pillows     Clean room    Parking  although I read that others had an issue with this  we stayed in the Daisy building  parked in the parking garage and have not had any issues    Conveniently located to major highways and the StripCons    WiFi is NOT free in the rooms        per day   The media room is has very slow computers      The front desk employees speak very broken English   When you check in  they try and get you to go to their sales pitch on time shares by offering      cash or show tickets  This is a   hour presentation   DON T DO IT     The pool with the water fall is freezing     The rooms are poorly insulated  You can hear the other rooms running the bath tubs  etc  Overall  this is a nice hotel  I would stay here again  
P =>   Very nice but a few problems  I stayed at the Grandview with my husband this e  We enjoyed it alot  Everything was clean and well decorated  It also had the most comfortable bed I ve ever slept on  Next door is the South Point casino  at which we spent alot of time  They have a bowling alley and movie theatre and a very nice spa  However  it appears that the Grandview condos were put up quickly and a few finishing issues had not been resolved in our unit  First  several pegs were missing underneath the kitchen cabinet shelves so that the first time we went to grab a glass  all of the dishes nearly slid out onto the floor  The entertainment center doors had never been properly screwed in  so they didn t work  At least one of the faucets had been installed wrong so it didn t turn right  There were other things that I can t remember  All in all  they were small issues  but they should still fix those things  Secondly  the pool area was nice  but they only played really boring music  Lastly  they don t have free WI FI and that is a dealbreaker for me  You can pay for it for like     for the week  but that s ridiculous  Yes  they have internet  but it s in the main building  so you d have to trudge over there every morning   NO THANKS  I was planning on buying into this place  because I could use it for business  but if they don t offer free WI FI to owners  or free shuttle to the strip  I m not interested  
P =>   Beware the Timeshare lecture Our arrival at the Grandview was nothing short of Grand  they welcome you and set you up in an awsome suite with   star everything  They ask you to join them for breakfast the next day on them and just to give them a review of the hotel  In return you get   tickets to a show in Vegas or      in gifts  NOT WOTH IT                          The    min survey turned into   hours of sales  They wasted half my day on stupid time share  Aside from that the place was great  Request the Daisy building because it is close to the parkade  
P =>  Nice Resort away from The Strip My husband and I stayed at the Grandview at Las Vegas for a week  The resort was very nice and the furniture well appointed  We stayed away from the pool due to the noise and traffic in that area  The suite was nice and clean and the kitchen was furnished with up to date equipment  The living room and bedrooms were fairly nice size  Overall  the place was nice if you like being away from the traffic on The Strip  A car is necessary to get around since it is located about six miles from The Strip  The resort does not allow smoking in the suites  which is great  The problem  however  is that the smokers hang around the entrance and you have to walk through thesmell of smoke to get to and from your suite  The other problem is the thin walls where you can hear the drain plumbing as the guests upstairs and nearby run the shower and tub  As for the time share presentation  it takes every bit of three hours and the sales dept  manager got upset and rude  even insulted us when we refused to purchase  We were told that we had to stay for the entire time because it costs       for each person that they bring in for a presentation  When we checked in  we were invited to have lunch and to learn about what was going on at the resort  It was not until we got to meet with the person in the sales dept  that we were told that it was for a time share presentation  Skip it if you can  not worth the rudness  
P =>  Good but not great  This property is nice  but nothing great  My wife and I are very forgiving and not very picky  so it takes a lot for us to complain  Let s go through the positives and negatives POSITIVES  Nice pool  friendly staff  tastefully decorated rooms  convenient to strip and other shopping   restaurants  checked in early NEGATIVES    Stayed for week and did not receive mid week linen exchange    Bed had a dirty  hair covered blanket and no mattress pad when we arrived  We had to call for a new blanket  sheets  and mattress pad    TV reception in bedroom was fuzzy even with cable   Walls are very thin and noises from other rooms and pool could be heard easily inside our room  We were on the  th floor   Kitchen counter tops and cabinets not very clean All and all  it was a nice vacation and an acceptable hotel  Nice for families and vacation with the kids  but not for a romantic getaway for two  
P =>  Was perfect for our family and what we needed  Was a very clean  and roomy place  We rented both sides  so that the kids had one side  and the adults had the other  Has two nice pools right by our building  The condo style setup was very nice  and so was having a full kitchen  so we were not going out every night for supper  Beds and hidabeds were comfy  Design was great  Highly reccomened as an alternative to a cramped hotel  
P =>  Glad to have booked this resort despite the mixed reviews  This is an RCI exchange  The Grandview was a little further south from the strip by about   miles on Las Vegas Boulevard but well worth our stay  With two kids in tow  we wanted something a little more laid back and thought it was a great location The resort was large with multiple buildings and a couple more under construction across the parking lot from our building  though we really didn t hear any of the usual construction noise since the work was mostly interior  The buildings closer to the front are the  quot older quot  ones and I was told that they re gradually being updated  Having arrived at   am after driving through the night from Southern Idaho  we lucked out by being situated in one of the newer buildings  Building    quot Daisy quot   and next to the parking terrace TIP  call ahead and request a non smoking room if you need one  especially if you anticipate a late arrival or you could get stuck with what they have available The unit was great  It was a   bedroom but it felt nice and large  The room had a great pullout couch sectional with a chaise  The interior had a thoughtful designer feel with nice furnishings and granite countertops  There s a jacuzzi tub in the master bedroom and the bed was just perfect for us  if you don t like hard as a rock firm beds   The bathroom is REALLY spacious with a makeup table in between the two sinks and a large    quot  corner shower  Complimentary soap and shampoo along with the usual laundry soap  dishwasher soap  and paper products  There is midweek  quot Tidy Service quot  to change your towels  make your bed with the same linen  wipe down counters and provide you additional comp sundries if needed TIP  If you run out of the comp soaps  they will charge you a nominal fee if you ask for more but the housekeeping carts are never far away  sooo    you get the idea The amenities are pretty good  Currently  there are   or   swimming pools open and multiple jacuzzis open til midnight  The main one with the waterfall is in the middle of the resort complex along with the large excercise room  a must for me   nice barbecue area  at a      heat     convenience store  buy flipflops  the concrete is HOT   and activities center  Free facials on Wednesdays   The business center is in the registration building and there are many courtesy computers for guest use but the room is rarely empty during the day  I paid     for   day wi fi connection in my unit  sorry  it isn t free   Now I know others complained about the minimal resort activities but the South Point Hotel and Casino is a quick hop across the street and has more than plenty to entertain both young and old TIP  Skip the icky pizza from the resort convenience store and head across the street to South Point s Del  Deli just inside the casino entrance for your breakfast  lunch  snacks  and to die for pastries and bring it back for a pool side meal  Our other favorite  Try the Big Sur Oyster Bar for dinner  The casino also has a huge movie complex with    theaters  large bowling alley  arcade  spa  scheduled shows and your usual number of restaurants  Still awake after midnight  Try bowling for a buck and fill your belly afterwards at the casino s Coronado Cafe with their graveyard breakfast specials that average    dollars    bucks if you want steak and eggs and it is HUGE  TIP  Loved the penny slots  If you re a gamer just for fun  the penny slots just might entertain you  They re looser  according to a local  and we won a combined total of      from just a     start between my husband and myself  It paid for a couple of dinners and movies The resort also offers courtesy shuttle trips to the grocery store  Las Vegas Outlet and Town Center Mall  a few other resort casinos including Mandalay Bay and Fremont Street  There s a schedule that you will receive with your welcome packet  If you do not drive to LV or plan to rent a car  I suggest you look that schedule over upon arrival and call the front desk to reserve your number of seats because there s only one shuttle per destination  Yes  I suppose it could be an inconvenience but we found that we simply scheduled our plans around our reservation with the courtesy shuttle and used Ritz Transportation at    pp on unlimited rides per day to and from the strip  If you plan on making multiple day trips to the strip  this is probably a big drawback to the resort services offered but it still beats a cab ride Last  I want to say that if you don t want to join the timeshare sales people for the usual dog and pony show  just tell them kindly  no when they first call you  Yes  we were called once more after that but respectfully declined again  They even slipped a couple of notes under our door with their teaser promos but we simply threw them away  I ll admit that when you step into the front lobby most days  it feels like a giant pool of barracudas with their prey in tow but the few  quot guest service quot  staff that spoke to us were quite nice  I am a timeshare owner and I expect this with virtually every resort we ve visited and have even encountered our share of those that tend to be predatory in their tactics but I think they do eventually leave you alone FINAL TIP  If you haven t tried the website restaurant com yet  check it out  You pay only     for a     gift certificate  There are a lot of restaurants that participate on the strip and surrounding areas  and even in your home area probably   Meals on the casino restaurants are great but expensive  Google  quot restaurant com discount coupon quot  and save even more  We loaded up on gift certificates this week when the website offered an     discount on your total order  promo just ended but replaced by a     off discount through couponmom com or fatwallet com  Hope this helps and good luck  
P =>  Great surprise in Vegas and a place to come back We went to the Grandview on a RCI exchange for two weeks  We initially wanted to stay in one of the Hilton resorts but they were already booked so we chose the Grandview instead  But what a wonderful surprise it was  We loved our stay  The room was big and well equiped  The staff and checking in and out was efficient  The location next to Southpoint with its restaurants and casino is ideal  The food and buffets are extremely reasonable priced and of good quality  The shops and supermakets are all nearby  The Grandview is not on the Strip  it s on the Southern part but we didn t mind that at all  We had a rental car and we went there many times to the hotels  restaurants  theatres and shopping malls  The Strip is too big anyway to walk everywhere so who needs an accommodation on the Strip  We made severak day trips to places outside Vegas as well  like Death Valley and the Hoover Dam  Lake Mead and Boulder City  The timeshare presentation is not that bad as some people think  We know what these presentations are like but we had a nice salesperson and a great breakfast and tickets for the Cirque de Soleil  So not bad after all  The weather was lovely so we also enjoyed the pool  In fact we liked our stay so much that we will return this year  We could easily book the Hitlon this time but we choose for the Grandview again  
P =>   Happily off the strip   star luxury stay  Resort provides a shuttlebus to the main strip  but we found the South Point Casino next to The Grandview suited us better  The apartment was outstanding and came fully equipped and with a jacuzzi  Gardens and buildings well kept and maintained  
P =>  Much Better Than Expected Thanks to reviewer who suggested staying in the Daisy building and asking for a room that ends in     We stayed in     A and it was gorgeous  The decor was contemporary and very nicely done  which as my husband said is a rare compliment from me  The kitchen and bath are upgraded with granite and nice floor tiles  The view from the living room was of the pool area at South Point Casino  Bed very comfy with a flat screen tv and a larger one in the living room  Tips  Call ahead to request the room type building you want  ask for a higher floor  goes up to    or     Expect to get hit up to attend the    minute presentation when the front desk agent sends to over to get your parking voucher  This was the only time we were asked  Wireless internet is     day in your room  but you can take your laptop down to media room and get wireless free  They also have free internet access on their computers in the media room for    minutes  If you stay in Daisy building  you re closer to parking garage than the other buildings  park in garage and then enter Daisy through the SIDE entrance will save you a lot of walking in the hot sun  Great place   enjoy  
P =>  Just had    nights  Brilliant  not a single problem loved it every day  Make sure you book the courtesy coach early Take a drink into town with you Go on the grocery shop trip   bucks  Lt white rum  Take no notice of other negative reviews they are all rubbish  
P =>  clean The rooms we had or should I say the condo we had was GREAT  They were very clean  had everthing you needed  dishes washer amp  dryer hair dryer   The beds were so comfortable  amp  big The bath room were large even had a jacuzzi tub  The only area for inprovement is to have more rackes for carrying suite cases  We waited for an hour for one  ask a man that work there how to get one  he said try the other buildings  Never offered to help  All so the walls are very thin  be careful how loud you talk  
P =>  Very nice home base close to the strip If you don t mind being   miles south  but still on Las Vegas Blvd   this is a very nice place to stay  We would go back  There are about   or   high rise buildings looking out over the desert and mountains  one building is currently under construction  right next to our building   but never a noise issue   Landscaping is very pretty  the buildings themselves are new and attractive  It s an easy drive to all the Vegas attractions  and we found it nice to escape the noise and bustle after a long day  especially with children  Parking was sometimes a challenge after everyone came in to the property at night   but no big deal The SouthPoint Hotel and Casino is right next door   it is a new large full service facility with bowling alleys  movie theaters  casino  shows  and a world class equestrian center  Las Vegas  newest full scale hotel casino  called M  is also less than   miles further south   the last building on the strip   and it is incredible   very sophisticated and our favorite property we visited in all of Vegas The Grandview units are large  attractive  nicely equipped  and very clean  We stayed in the Jasmine building with our   kids  ages          and had a   bedroom unit   which is really   one bedroom units with a common foyer entry   so you get   full kitchens    dens    full baths  and   bedrooms   spacious and great for parents being able to stay up after the kids go to sleep  Completely sound proof   never heard another guest  Flat screens  great appliances  garden tubs  and handsomely appointed  Our building had its own small pool  and we also walked across the parking lot to another set of buildings where there are   large pools  Like I said  the action on the strip itself is a quick straight drive up the blvd    about   miles   or you can get on I   and loop behind the strip to save time in traffic  There are groceries  restaurants  a Walmart  etc  within a mile of the property  We rented a car  but Grandview also offers a shuttle Check in and check out was easy and pleasant  and there was no pressure to attend timeshare presentations after a simple no thank you  We did not need to contact the staff for anything while there  so I can t speak to service other than to say our units were immaculate and everyone we encountered was helpful and polite Things in Vegas with kids that we loved     Valley of Fire  preferred it over Red Rock Canyon   Hoover Dam  Adventuredome  although CircusCircus is showing its age and does not feel clean   the amusement park was nice   Tournament of Kings dinner show  the Bellagio fountains  the Secret Garden and Dolphin Habitat of Seigfried and Roy  the roller coasters  and y  th fireworks and dinner at the beautiful M resort  Other than our side trips to see the desert west  Cirque de Soleil s Ka was probably the highlight of our vacation   awesome  Go to tix tonite    locations on the strip  for discounted tickets on many shows and dinners  Not so impressed with   the Sahara  smokey and dirty   Bonnie Springs Ranch  sweetly hokey but not worth the time   the Caesars Palace Atlantis Fountain show   but loved the Forum Shops  the Sirens of TI show   free and very well done  but way too sexy for kids Food   best buffet  by far  was at the Wynn   and a beautiful property to see  Best burger place   Burger Bar in Mandalay Bay  Best upscale meal   the Italian restaurant at M Vegas is Vegas   and even more so during y  th week   Go and enjoy  
P =>  Upscale and modern pad Clean  modern rooms with nice details and finishes  This suite was one of the nicest we ve stayed in recently  The walls are thin  so we appreciated the advice of another traveler to request an end unit  Still  the sound of a midnight shower above us woke both of us up the night before our flight  Valet on the strip was cheap and easy  so we weren t worried about a non central location  Wi Fi was only available in the conference room area  
P =>   Had a wonderful time and wasn t ready to leave  My family and I had a wonderful stay at the Grandview at Las Vegas  There were   of us     adults and   children      and      I was skeptical due to some of the reviews that I had read but now I m wondering what all the complaining was about  We did the timeshare presentation because I m starting to think that we are timeshare resort geeks  We also wanted the discounted show tickets  The lunch  sandwiches  delicious cookies  and lemonade  was good and the conversation was great  During this presentation  I learned more about Las Vegas than I have on all of my previous trips put together  there have been many   We didn t buy  but enjoyed the presentation and received our tickets We stayed in Daisy  the newest building  We were very pleased with the decorations and furnishings  The mattress and bedding was extremely cozy  We called for more towels on the first day and they were brought immediately  The only thing we felt we were missing out on was a cookie sheet to bake our cookies and a pizza pan for the frozen pizza we tried to bake  Oh yeah  the toaster didn t work either but  toast in the oven was just as good  We had no trouble with the parking considering we were right next to the parking garage  By the way  we were told during the presentation that each new building  will have a parking gargage nearby My sister and friend exercised at the workout facility several times  We noticed that the equipment was outdated and were wishing for the equipment at our health club at home There were many children at the resort but there were no kid activities  We didn t have a problem with that considering we had so many plans with the kids and the area  Circus Circus  Excalibur game area  Shark Reef  MGM Lions  M amp M factory  free shows  Hoover Dam  etc  etc   After hanging out at the pool several half days  we wouldn t have been able to handle anymore  We had a wonderful time at the Grandview at Las Vegas and can t wait to return  
P =>   Just as Nice as First Time This was our second stay at the Grandview in less than a year and keep on enjoying the stay there  As before  check in was  st rate  very quick and very friendly  I am happy that they ask if you prefer a smoking or non smoking room  I was also asked if I would like to stay in the newest building  Daisy  which we were happy to stay in  I appreciate the fact that once you say you are not interested in a presentation  you are done get your parking permit and off you go  The only bad thing is that smoking is allowed  and encouraged by the location of the ashtrays  directly outside the exit door of the building  Rarely did we leave or come back without having to walk through a cloud of cigarette smoke  be this was done to prevent lazy smokers from putting out their  butts  on the ground if ashtrays were further away Our   th floor room was wonderful    large LCD TVs  cable TV and DVD players  full kitchen  wonderful bath  dining room and one of the most comfortable bedrooms I have ever stayed in  For me the bed and many pillows were WONDERFUL  The thick drapes allowed me to sleep until   and as late as   a major accomplishment for me as I get up at      am for work  Noise was never an issue for us and since last visit        parking has improved due to a new parking garage  I consider the service excellent  A call to the front desk requesting a sheet pan was responded to within minutes  The common areas were very clean For us  this was once again a very relaxing week  We would not hesitate staying there again  
P =>  Grandview was very nice suprise My wife  her parents  and I stayed at the Grandview from         to          We used our timeshare exchange through RCI  We stayed in the Sage building rooms      A  amp  B  This building had easy access to the pool and lobby Check in was seamless and we were able to check in a few hours early  The Grandview personnel do try to get you to go on a    minutes timeshare tour  They offered us a         comp at the Southpoint casino  When we told them  quot no quot  they then offered us         cash  My wife and I turned them down because our vacation time is more valuable then any timeshare tour for a         Our units were very roomy and well stocked with household necessities  There were a few issues with unit     A the room safe would not open  the toilet overflowed  and the remote did not work the bedroom TV  We called maintenance and security and they responded in less than    minutes  Security opened the safe and maintenance unclogged the toilet and replaced the TV in the bedroom  To me this was great service  The rooms also had a great view of the strip at night  My in laws enjoyed the whirlpool tub in the room  I have read some other reviews about noise from the tubs at night we did not have this problem  but you could hear people in the hallways at any given time  The only other problem was the sofa in      A needs to be replaced  The cushions are falling into the pull out bed underneath The pools were nice just like the resort pictures with the waterfalls  We did think the pools were cold in the early afternoons  but they did seem to warm up around   PM  The hot tub by the pool was pleasant and relaxing We ate our breakfast and lunch in the condo  We would walk to the Southpoint Casino for our dinner  The casino has about five restaurants  The buffet was reasonable  and on Wednesday night it was prime rib and Friday night was crab legs  wife loves them  We did rent a car to be able to go to the strip at night  The resort does offer a shuttle to the strip but we like being able to come and go as we pleased  This was the first time for my wife in Las Vegas  So we took in all the free shows such as the pirates at TI  the volcano at the Mirage  Fremont Street light show  the talking statues at Caesars  and the fountains at the BellagioWe stuck to our plan to go to the pool during the day and do the strip at night for entertainment and gambling  We all had a great time  The resort worked well for us and our plans  
P =>   Excellent   We loved the place and would go back I would have to agree with the person below    BUt we did do the timeshare presentation and they were very good with us  We spent a total of   mins and received two show tickets and     cash  Once we told them we were not interested they said have a funtrip and look forward to seeing you again Everyone on the resort was very nice    The workers would go out of there way to help you We also stayed in the Daisy and we never heard anyone    
P =>   GREAT property  We stayed there with friends in one of the two condo  or  quot two bedroom quot  units for six days and it was wonderful  We were in the new Daisy building and it was beautiful  We had read reviews that complained extensively of thin walls and noise and were expecting the worst but I have to say that we didn t hear one single thing from any other unit  It was VERY quiet  All the employees were very friendly   very welcoming  accommodating and helpful  We were asked once if we were interested in the presentation about purchasing a timeshare and when we firmly said  quot no  thank you quot  they left us alone  Great casino with good restaurants within walking distance and a quick drive to the strip  the new M Resort  amp  Casino and a great outlet mall  We highly recommend this property  
P =>   Wonderful experience at the Grandview My wife and I and my wife s sister and brother in law celebrated our anniversarys at the Grandview at Las Vegas  The facilities were beautiful  the large pool area was great  and the staff was very friendly and helpful  The Southpoint Casino  next door  was laid back but on par with the hotels and casinos on the Strip  We had the Sunday brunch and it was excellent  unfortunately the casino seemed to like my money It was an easy trip down Las Vegas Blvd to the strip and parking was easy I would highly recommend a rental car  We traveled to Hoover Dam and Red Rock Canyon  all within easy driving distance Although they were constructing a new building behind ours  noise was not an issue We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here  
P =>   Great stay  Use these tips to enjoy the most of the Grandview  We had a very pleasant week long stay at the Grandview and we appreciated the tips from previous reviewers  The weather was great  the pools we never overcrowded  and the rooms in our building were fantastic  Best things   New units are nicely decorated  and well outfitted   Great ajoined  Br units make fantastic  Br suites for groups    New parking garage provides plenty of space  South Point Casino next door is a great quick fix for gambling  buffet  etc    Plenty of pool side space between the   pools Addressing previous comments   Poor sound proofing  Yes  this is true  But its overstated  Request an end unit  see tips below  and you ll be fine   Poor parking  New garage is open  Parking space is plentiful Here are our my suggestions for making the most of the resort   Request one of the new buildings     floors   We stayed in the newest  Daisy  The condos were impeccable   Request a unit number    Like               etc  These are the corner units so you only share common walls with one neighbor  We stayed in       Rent a car  You absolutely need one   Say no to the Timeshare presentation request at check in  and then unplug your room phone  You ll be left in peace for the rest of the stay Criticisms   Gym is outdated and poorly equiped for anyone who regularly exercises   Smoking areas are immediately outside main entraces to the condo buildings  You have to walk between the smoking benches to enter the buildings   Wireless signal strength in new building  Daisy  is extremely weak  Unusable  really  
P =>   Amazing Resort with everything you need  Ok so i stayed at this resort with a friend using my parents RCI timeshare We were a little bit jubious as we wernt to sure what the accomodation would be like  we were literally expecting a   bed apartment  What we actually had was TRULY AMAZING All apartments have a side a and side b  so in reality if you have a   bed apartment you have both sides We each had our own kitchen  living areas  bedrooms  jucuzzi Tubs  and bathrooms  it was phoniminal The rooms were clean and comfortable and anything anyone could possibly need Now the resort is quite far away from the strip but please dont let this put you off  the run a shuttle bus from   am onwards till      am to the excaliber hotel and back  It doesnt take that long to get to the strip maybe    minutes  however this    mintues probably saves you at least     in a taxi so please tip the drivers  my friend and I witnessed so many people not tipping the drivers which i felt was unfair  and most of the poeple who tipped were not American which suprised us even more They have thier own computer room with about   PC s in it  please note that guests are meant to only be on there for    minutes at a time but that didnt stop other selfish guests clicking back on to use it even when there was a queue for people to use the internet  However when that isnt happening its a nice area to check emails  they have free wifi in there so you can bring along your own laptop  and they have coffee facilities too which are free of charge The pool area was nice  plenty of loungers which i have to say are mega un comfortable  but they provide free towels and there is also a snack bar which serves breakfast lunch and dinner options along with beverages and coffee etc There was also a fitness room  but we were on holiday so why would we use it  The south point hotel is located next door and great if you fancy a night close by They have a huge casino  lovely resturants  breakfast is only      a bargain in my eyes  and the service is good The mexican resturant is also nice  although order much less that you would  we wasted a lot of food We were asked to attend a time share presentation at the grandview  which we attended as agreed  the agents in question were friendly and courteous although the lady my friend had showing her around seemed a little rude and blunt in her pitch  realistically why would i want to buy something that i can use of my parents plus living in the UK  the flights arent cheap throw that in with maintence etc etc and it gets too pricey     I would def reccomend that others look at what they have to offer cause believe me  the apartments are out of this world The only   issue is  we only had a maid in   time in the week we stayed  who made my bed in my suite  and changed my friends towels in hers    we found that a bit bizarre To sum it up  i would reccomend Grandview to anyone  the value to me to buy an apartment would work out way too expensive with other costs  however for US and Canadian residents your a fool not too Everyone is friendly and welcoming  any problems we had were sorted immediatley Great resort  Great People  
P =>   Fabulous Place       We arrived   st and stayed until   th  We were is the Daisy Bldg  th Fl  Yes there is a little bit of construction for the final Bldg  The old Bldgs are    stories tall  The new ones are    stories tall  There are   pools  a work out room  The garage opened when we were there  I had no problem finding a parking spot  It seems the people who complained are the ones who can t walk or are to lazy to walk   or   min to there room   They must park in front of the bldg  Coming from NYC   or   blocks away is like parking in front of your apartment  There is plent y of handicap parking  The room was a   bedroom  larget enough for   people  waser  amp  dryer  micro wave  etc all the conviences of home  We ate b fast  amp  lunch at the resort  Wal mart is   min away on Silverado Blvd  easy to get to  We bought all our food there  The south point casino is right nexr door  about   miles up the road the new hotel  quot M quot  is open  The time share people did not bother us  The place is clean and new  You do need a car to go to the strip  We had a nice time and I don t have any complaints  I can see after a few months that the place can get worned down  The do have a Free tidy service for people staying  days or more  Do visit the Valley of the Fire  about   hour from the place as well as the red rock canyon     min away  I would go back  As always if you don t like what you get you can always change your room or ask for a freebie for something  
P =>  Nice room but bring your earplugs  I stayed at the Grandview from the   th     th of il and booked through Hotels com for     a night  We were put in the Jasmine building in room    B  This stay was part of a    night tour and was our last   nights in Vegas  our third time here  I booked the Grandview as it was something different from the usual Vegas hotel experience  having stayed previously at the Tropicana  Ceasers  Planet Hollywood and Signature   the rest of Vegas was very expensive for these nights and the fact that it had a full kitchen inc washer  dryer was a big plus We were aware how far it was from the strip          mins drive in moderate traffic  and that you really need a car to stay here  This didn t bother us and the fact that you can cross a small road to get to SouthPoint in under   mins walk is a great plus  The parking was not  Now  I had read that the parking was an issue and thought i ll take the chance  If you park before about     pm at night you won t have any issues   after this you ve got about a    min walk back to your building  It doesn t sound like much  especially after some of the walks we ve had from hotel car parks i e  Planet Hollywood  but you would think that someone would have factored in the number of rooms   off strip location   most rooms will have   car and have appropriate number of spaces available  But sadly no and it is a major pain  especially at  am when you ve come back from a show and are tired Check in  We arrived   hours earlier than set check in time and were told we could have our room right away  the process overall was a bit lengthy but we were happy  We were then told we had to go to someone else to pick up our parking pass  Thankfully many people have mentioned previously this is where they pounce on you  trying to get you to go to the timeshare presentation  I politely declined this but the woman was very pushy and took a while to take the hint The room itself was immaculately clean and had a good number of plates  dishes etc  The decor is a bit blah and the paintings on the walls pretty awful but overall we were quite happy with both the bed and living areas  Also  as I mentioned we were away for    days so having a washer  dryer was a great benefit before we headed off to LA and probably what swung us to book this place So overall the bedroom  kitchen and bathroom were very pleasant and we had no issues  The pool area was nice enough  pretty basic but clean with a nice view out to the new M Resort across the desert The main issue we had was the noise  First of all we noticed that we were at the back of the Jasmine building which faces onto a new building being constructed  but when we arrived there was little noise  At  am the next morning  after being out until  am  we woke up to beeping  crashing and clanking   general LOUD construction noise  I was unimpressed  Then came the noise from above and to the sides of us  Someone coughed in the next room  it felt like they were in our room  The people above us were obviously having a game of musical chairs   as they moved them so much  on tile floors  that we could hear every little creak  Also  each room has a jacuzzi  with a sign stating not to use before  am or after   pm  evidently there are a lot of people out there who can t read  as the noise from the jacuzzi itself and the water running through the pipes was unbelievable  We were glad only to be here for   nights and if the rest of Vegas hadn t been so expensive for the rest of our stay I think we would have moved  It s all just quite a shame as the complex isn t bad  it s very clean and the rooms are nice but it s been ruined due to the poor construction of the rooms and general layout Obviously I wouldn t recommend staying here and wouldn t go back  
P =>   RCI Points are a Ripoff   Wow  Where do I start except to say that this is a timeshare resort that let greed get in their way  If you go to Las Vegas and want to enjoy it   stay on the strip or downtown not here Beware of the reviews on this site   most are from the owners of this timeshare Good things   Very clean and new  Bad things Located about   miles from south edge of the strip   Either depend on their shuttle or a     minimum Taxi ride each way  Not enough Parking   they are building a parking garage   It is not centrally located   so expect to park a long way from your room Isolated from the Vegas strip   Paid        RCI Points for this   day stay   Not worth it  They don t make up the room each day  Very thin walls   You can very clearly hear the toilet flush and the shower run from next door  It is so loud that we thought that my son was in the shower      day for internet access Moral of the story   Do not join a timeshare  They verbally misled us   If there is a class action lawsuit we would like to join in  
P =>   Great ResortLocation and weather  This hotel is very nice  clean and I would go back in a heart beat  The location is out of the way so you ll need a car  They do have a courtesy bus to the Luxor  Las Vegas is a great city  We liked the Frozen Magaritas while walking up and down the strip  We took two kids G   B    We weren t sure at first however there were a lot of families The kids wanted to see Chris Angel  To save money we played with the timeshare sellers mind for an hour and half until they got so mad at us that we were given the tickets        ea  half price  and sent away  They are so much fun to play with  so many final offers  Tell them you are owners so you get a softer pitch  The hotel is close to the airport and strip  The huge Southpoint Casino is next door  Great ice cream shop  bowling and if you want a drink just sit down at the penny slots and they ll bring you a free one  Grandview has a nice pool and snackbar convieinence store If you don t want the timeshare pitch just be firm when you go to get your  quot parking pass quot They will call the next morning at      for a second try  Be firm again and they will leave you alone  Not that bad really Red Rock Canyon  Valley of Fire and Hoover Dam are all great day trips  
P =>   Nice   but very austere  Older buildings are    stories  newer ones are higher   and all look alike  very plain  That said  the rooms are very nice  comfortable and quiet  The two bedroom suites are mirror image one bedroom lockout units  actually a very good idea  and quite functional  If you re traveling with friends or family  each party has significant privacy if desired  Unless you have a pool side unit  forget about a view unless you enjoy parking lots and buildings   and a glimpse of the mountains in the very distant background  The main pool area is large  with many lounges and an unlimited supply of very nice pool towels  Again though  everywhere you get the feeling of austerity  There is a small snack shop and grill adjacent to the main pool area  but they only serve soft drinks   Almost forgot  wireless internet is available in your room for a  quot hefty quot        per day  small weekly discount available   too much     in my opinion  I looked at this as a BIG negative  since you have to pay even in the lobby area  Important note  the elevators are very fast   we experienced no long waits during our stay  We re not fans of high rise condos in general  but this one worked out quite well for us  It is located quite a ways south of the Strip on Las Vegas Blvd   BUT the Strip is very easily accessed via I     so location was not a problem for us  Besides  there is a large  quot kid friendly quot  casino  SouthPoint  located right next door  Besides having all the usual adult amenities  this casino has a multiplex movie theater  a huge bowling alley  a video arcade and a reasonably priced snack shop for affordable casual eating  It also has the usual offering of restaurants  from a Deli  a Buffet  etc   on up to the very pricey places we generally shy away from  One thing you should be aware of   it is a timeshare and you will be offered the opportunity to take a sales tour  yeah  I know  what a surprise    This comes right at check in  when you go to get your parking pass  We actually took the tour and got      cash two show tickets for    bucks  not bad all in all  They are persistent  but not high pressure   expect three levels of folks with ever increasing offerings  One last thought  the Strip is expanding south and this place will be very well placed in the next few years  
P =>  Off strip location with all the comforts of home PLUS   We spent a week here visiting family  Stayed in a   bedroom with full kitchen  It was an added bonus for a grandma visiting grandchildren  We even got to bake cookies  Very comfortable king size bed and large jacuzzi tub in bathroom  There is a queen size pull out bed in the living room  The unit was decorated very nicely and basically was very clean  We did notice that the floors could have been cleaner  evidenced by dirty socks from walking around the unit We were disappointed that WiFi was an extra charge of        a week  They did have a business center available with only   computers and a limit of    minutes of use  At times there was a long wait to get to a computer  If you want computer use  plan on paying the extra for it The off Strip location was nice for us  although there is a Casino next door and you are only minutes from all the activity of the Strip if you want it Shopping for our needs was very convenient  Lots of stores within a short distance  even a Super Walmart and Starbucks The staff was very accomodating and friendly  We did attend a sales presentation but were not pressured to purchase  The presentation was not required but did earn us         for about       hours of our time  We will definitely stay here again  
P =>   First week wonderful  Second week   not so good      We stayed at the Grandview Suites for two weeks in early ruary  The room was quite nice and we wanted to be off the strip so this hotel was perfect  The staff at the hotel were quite accommodating and friendly and did their utmost to ensure that our stay was enjoyable  But things changed a bit the second week  On the first evening of the second week  we noticed quite an unpleasant odour in the bedroom which became worse and permeated the whole room by the second evening  On the morning of the third day  we spoke with hotel staff and were told that it was probably due to the fact that the hotel room had been vacant for quite a while and it was probably standing water in the pipes  They suggested that we run the taps which we had been doing the whole time that we had been there  It was so bad that I could not sleep in the bedroom at night and we bought room deodorizer to try and get rid of it  When we mentioned it during our checkout  we were given a small credit on our bill and were told that one of the managers would call us the next day  We never heard from the hotel again and this was disappointing  I would definitely go to Vegas again but I don t believe that I would stay there  The hotel displays signs that say if a guest cannot rate their stay at the hotel   of out   to let them know and they will do everything within their power to rectify that  Unfortunately  we did not give them a five and would probably not stay there again  
P =>   Everyone was very nice and so helpful I had read a few reviews  and was a little scared  Let me tell you  I was pleasantly surprised  The rooms were great  one minor problem with a bathroom fan  The one elevator quit for   days  but there was another  We called for Towels  as we didn t want maid service and blankets and each time  they were there in a matter of seconds  The pools and hot tubs  and area  VERY CLEAN and VERY NICE  A Towel guy there for you  very clean bathrooms  Great Fitness Center  The shuttle was very nice and easy  and accomadated with no problems  We did have a car so if all of us      in total wanted to go somewhere we did but if we wanted to split up we took the shuttle and it worked great  Very clean  They turn the rooms upside down after people leave and clean  we seen them while we stayed doing it to other rooms  If you want a little downtime it is great    If you want downtime and a little more nightlife The South Point Casino is there  If you want LOTS OF ACTION  stay on the STRIP     Don t consider this beautiful place  There was construction going on  we never heard it  
P =>   Good Out Of The Way Location Stayed at the Grandview for   nights in y       The room was decent  but nothing spectacular  Did have a full kitchen and dining area  I liked the location because it was on the strip  but away from the main area of the strip  About a   minute drive to the action area of the strip The biggest issue with this resort is parking  It gets pretty difficult to find a spot at night when people start to settle in  but that was almost a year ago and the issue may have been addressed since then   There is a Casino right across the street  Nothing like the bigones further down the strip  but you can hang out there if the larger casinos seem too crowded  
P =>   Great base for a week in Vegas Spent a week at the Grandview in Vegas with   other guys  I booked our stay thru a military vacation club and the guy on the phone recommended the place  So for less than a hundred bucks per man  we had our digs for the week  We got twin units side by side on the   th floor  each had a king size bed with a vast bathroom  with shower AND a jacuzzi tub  which we all used over the course of the week  and we found it to be very soothing  Also each unit had a living room with a couch with pull out sleeper queen size bed  Finally  there was a nice kitchen fully equipped for cooking  and several days  we saved money and ate in for breakfast  or dinner  On site  there is a large pool which was open  but only a few hearty souls were really using it  as the temperature was in the   s for most of our visit  although some attractive ladies were out sunbathing  which we appreciated and may have gawked a time or two  There is also a really nice large hot tub out in the pool area which we got to use  and found it to be very relaxing They have a nice info center in the reception  and you can get some great tickets and advice on shows from the very helpful people there  Word to the wise  though  if you do any of this stuff  you are EXPECTED to attend one of their incredibly high pressure sales briefings  in which they all but force you to sign your life away to buy one of these timeshare properties  It was my first experience  and I was totally bewildered at how intense it was  but I didn t make any purchases  despite their best efforts  If you use the tickets they give you for any shows  just go  nod your head  but don t sign anything  All in all  the Grandview was a great vacation spot  and would be good for just about anybody to visit  I would go back again in a heartbeat to take in another week or so in Las Vegas  
P =>   The Grandview was Awesome  My husband  amp  I stayed at the Grandview with another couple who booked it through their timeshare  It is located off the strip but within a   minute drive of the strip  It is a grouping of high rise apartments with a couple of pools  amp  hot tubs located around the property  There was some construction going on next door but we didn t really notice it  Our friends had booked a   bedroom condo  amp  what we got was   x   bedroom condos    it was amazing   we each had our own self contained   br suite complete with fully equiped kitchen  entertainment area  separte bedroom    person jacuzzi tub  spa like bathroom with corner shower  amp  double sinks  amp  washer dryer  It was impeccably clean  amp  very new  Absolutely no complaints  The staff were friendly  amp  helpful  The pool areas were clean  amp  well maintained  It is located besdie the South Point Casino that is a new casino  There is a coffee shop  restaurants   amp  reasonably priced buffet   horse shows  stage shows  concerts  etc  in the casino     minute walk  We thouroughly enjoyed our stay with no complaints  
P => 		   New Year s in VEGAS Hello  My wife and I stayed at The Grandview in Las Vegas for a week to spend New Year s in Vegas  We had a GREAT time and a GREAT stay at this Resort  We were in the brand new Jasmine building  we had a one bedroom suite with a family room and full kitchen  The resort exceeded all our expectations  The only one negative was the fee of     a day for the internet  We used it one day to plan our outings  Other than that our week vacation was a nice break from the Net and all other technology devices  The Resort had a welcome breakfast and we did the quick tour  it was painless  and we were given two show tickets and     in gaming at the Excalibur  We paid     dollars out of pocket to secure the tickets  Not bad for two show tickets and     dollars in gaming  The resort is on the South end of the Strip Blvd  The Resort Casino right next door was Amazing  The South Point had everything  definitely check it out  I guess that is about it  definitely a Great Resort and we thoroughly enjoyed our vacation  THREE MUST SEE s while in VEGAS     The Valley Of Fire     The Hoover Dam     Mt  Charleston  
P =>  yes nice place  I read the prior   reveiws and they were all consistent and right on  Most all the reviews are   or   stars historically so you are getting very dependable reivews on this property and consistent results  yes  the extras tend to cost    internet      and you don t get as many freebies but if you are expecting a mid level time share you will be pleased  rooms are large suites  very nice  fully equiped just not high end  i e  full kitchen w laminate cabinets and countertops South Point casino next door is a plusthey do a lot of cleaning  staff always cleaning something  chemical smell in the elevatordidn t have a grandview from our room fitness center is small and undersized for this many rooms 
P =>   Nice place to stay Nice place  with perfect amenity for a family vacation  However  all side services are very expensive  Internet is     day      
P => Nice Place Stayed at the Grandview from Friday     to      We arrived early and was able to check in with no problem  They sent us to the next desk for the parking pass and when they asked if we owned at Grandview  my husband responded yes  no further questions were asked and they gave us our parking pass  we do not own here   We stayed in the Jasmine building on the   th floor  The view was of the desert and mountains and we were able to watch the sun rise most mornings as we had problems adjusting to the   hour time change  The one bedroom condo was supplied with everything one would need for the week  We enjoyed the location as you were only minutes from the strip  Walmart  grocery stores and right next door to South Point if you needed your Casino fix  They provided soap to wash clothes and when they came to clean mid week  they left another pack of soap and we were able to wash our clothes again before we left  Check out was a breeze as we just called them and left the keys in the room since we left at      a m  I would recommend the Grandview if you are looking for a great condo with a good location close to the airport  and close to the strip  Parking is a problem if you return late and when they complete the rest of the buildings problem will be a big issue  Some people were parking on the street  
P =>  Wonderful Stay Stayed for the weekend  Hotel is located off the strip so you will need a car  Rooms were immaculate  bigger than the average apartment  Jacuzzi tub in bedroom and separate shower  South Point Casino is located next door and is within walking distance  Casino is nice  has a movie theater and bowling alley  and a number of good restaurants to choose from  When you check in they will tell you to go to the next area for a parking pass  the rep will try to talk you into going on a tour of the property  timeshare purposes   but just nicely decline  If this is your first time in Vegas  i recommend staying on the strip  If it s not  and you want a nice quiet location with relatively easy access to the strip  stay here  
P =>  Has its pros and cons We chose the Grandview as a time share trade  Normally we stay at the Venetian for a yearly trade show as it is very convenient and beautiful so have mixed feelings about our experience at the Grandview  As strictly a time share experience was quite disappointed in the following   There are about   large buildings  about    stories high making the surroundings look like an huge apartment complex  Many buildings with parking spots  and not nearly enough of them   It s still a work in progress as there are more buildings being built  with little effort to make the surroundings appealing  We were in the Jasmine building and while the suite was very clean  it was the smallest of any time share we have had with pretty cheap amenities  e g  tv  dishwasher did a lousy and very noisy job  please put covers on the duvets as I doubt highly the duvets above the flat sheets are also washed after each new guest   This was also the first time share we had with no balcony  Not that there were any nice views  The pool area was sad to say the least  The photo on their site is only one pool area  The others were far from luxurious  Their mid week clean up is limited to change of towels  We have had real clean ups mid week in other places  For us it worked out ok since we have been to Vegas many times and this time enjoyed the convenience of having a kitchen for breakfasts and lunches  There are many grocery stores not far from the Grandview  including a Trader Joes which we love   Rosati s has excellent chicago style and other pizza that will deliver  The area is very quiet and away from the crowds  It was nice to have hotel and casino right next door  they have a great movie theatre  and pretty good deli fast food counter  But if you want the true Vegas experience this is not the place to have it  I must admit I did miss the excitement of staying on the strip  lounging at beautiful pools  and wandering the hotels  The Grandview is about a    minutes drive to the strip on the highway  depending on the traffic  but driving there is a lot different than staying there  
P =>   Good stay  My husband and I got married in Vegas and decided to stay here for a week while we were in town  The room was absolutely wonderful  We had a great time here  Only one of the two pools were heated and the hot tub was constantly crowded  The only complaint I had was the timeshare presentation  When we signed in  the person at the desk had told us to sign up for one and we can get discounted tickets to a show  We signed up for a meeting on Wednesday late morning        A M   They showed us around the property and the new models  We told them in the beginning we were not interested in getting a time share but it was suggested to us to take the presentation  They were really insulting towards the end of the meeting  They implied were both work a holics and my husband didn t treat me right  excuse me       I was highly offended from that but moved on  The South Pointe is located across the street and has a ton of places for you to eat  movie theatre  gambling  bowling  The walls were thin  but I didn t have any problems with neighbors water running  The parking wasn t terrible and it was a short walk if you couldn t get a spot in front of your building  All in all  if I came back to Las Vegas  I would stay at the Grandview again  
P =>    LOVED IT  I just returned from a great girls get away On a previous trip to Las Vegas my husband and purchased a time share through Grand view  and I could not wait to go back and stay so for my birthday I took a few friends We absolutley loved it  There s nothing negative about it  The room was very very very clean  the grounds well maintained sevice was great   South point was a definate winner I ve never won anywhere but South Point changed all that  and it s right next door The pool and jucuzzi was lovely The only problem was returning to the room and finding no parking near our building  so just stay parked and use their shuttle  You can t go wrong here you ll love it too I highly recommend Grand view to all  
P =>   Nice Place This was a very nice comfortable place to stay  especially if you plan on being in Vegas for a week or more  We had all of the comforts of home  It was nice that the bedroom is private from the rest of the condo since we had our daughter with us  There was a pull out sofa bed in the living room  a full sized kitchen  a dining room  and a laundry area  The pool area was very pretty but they use salt to keep the water clean and it looked a little dirty  My only complaint was regarding the hotel s itenerary of activities going on    it states that some of them are free and some cost  I decided to try out the  quot complimentary facials quot  one day and was severely disappointed when I was ushered into a y Kay party  There was no turning back once I got in there  The sales lady was extremely pushy and I felt jipped  I thought that was false advertising and very unprofessional for them to call it a  quot complimentary facial quot   Just be aware that nothing is free there  Not even the game room  It costs    cents to play any of the games  Othere than that it was a nice place and the casino next door is nice too  
P =>  Beware  Don t make any credit card or collect calls from the room  The Resort is very clean and neat  the pools are kept up and there are plenty of towels  We have two kids and other than the pool there was nothing for them  The resort said there was a game room  but it was empty   There are no on site ammenities  other than the kitchen and laundry machines in each room   which were nice   So don t think you can run down to the loby and grab some laundry soap or soda  The resort is a glorified hotel  and the colors are bright and agitating Beware  Don t make any calls from the room unless they are local  No credit card calls or collect calls  The charges are absolutely outlandish         flat rate per call  There are no notices  or recordings to warn you  Just a fat bill on your credit card or home phone bill if you use the services  I placed a call for less than   minutes and got the        charge on my credit card as a suprise when I returned home  And don t plan on getting any adjustments from the phone company they contract with or with the resort  
P =>   Nice but Average Resort Overall  Grandview is a nice resort  Really just average to tell the truth  Nothing about this resort stood out to me  The timeshare people were not pushy  We decided to go on the tour to get the      in gambling chips that we cashed  Easy      made  We constantly heard the people above us moving the chairs  That was very annoying  We heard our neighbors next door talking  People were using the jacuzzi s outside of the posted times  That s bad when your trying to sleep in the morning  There is no sound insulation in the rooms Our room was clean except for the snails on the bathroom counter  I bought some Clorox and took care of that problem  The blinds didn t work so they stayed shut the whole week We got back to the resort around   am every morning and there was parking  we stayed in the Iris building   We were afraid of that after reading the other reviews Make sure you rent a car since your about      minutes from all the action  We liked being in control of what we wanted to do instead of depending on a shuttle or bus  Silverado Ranch Blvd will take you to Walmart  Target and any other stores you have at home The Southpoint Casino buffet is only good at breakfast    The dinner buffet is disgusting The only casinos we won money at were on Fremont Street  Make sure you go there if you plan on gambling  The odds are better We own a timeshare through RCI and we will not stay here again unless everything else is booked  There are much nicer places than this one  Next time we ll plan our vegas vacation at least   months in advance and book at the Wyndham  
P => Excellent stay We stayed in a   bedroom unit in the Jasmine building  Tons of room for a group of   adults and   kids Given this is a timeshare property we were never once approached about sitting through the timeshare spiel There was is a ton of construction going on but we never heard a thing You need a car    IF you intend on travelling to the main part of the strip  The highway access is but seconds from the Grandview and from there the strip is literally about a      minute highway drive Great place  great stay   will do so again  
P =>  Undecided Myself  Wife  amp    kids love the Grandview  An apartment  with a pool  amp  a Casino  bowling  amp  movie theatre across the road suits our needs while in Vegas  Check in was friendly with no hassles from timeshare sales when I got my parking pass  Never had a problem getting a park all week  Nice to have a choice of   pools  amp  the   on its own was a lot quieter The reason I m undecided about staying again is because the walls are thin  If you had noisey neighbours it would be a nightmare  on the last day I could hear next door just talking in their bedroom  Every time someone moves their chairs in the unit above you hear it loud  amp  clear  
P =>   Great staff  The staff at the Grandview was very helpful and friendly  At the last minute  we had to book another room and were immediately given another suite with only a     additional charge for maid service  It s relatively new  and we enjoyed it very much  It felt like we were living back in our condo with the fridge  roman tub  washer and dryer  And I like the fact it was away from the strip  It was close to the Primm Outlets  which saved me tons of money since there were many great deals  
P =>   Great Place Bad Service This is a great place to stay if heading to Vegas  Really great prices  large clean rooms  lots nearby  The only complaint I have about this resort is the service and people working there  No one was friendly  even when checking in  I didn t get one smile or hello from anyone there  The housekeeping and janitors seemed to use the elevators more than the guests  so it slowed us down alot   Another problem I had is when checking in  I signed for the set rate for the rental for the week   THEY made a mistake in charging me  then charged my credit card for additional charges without even advising me  I am still trying to get it sorted out   even after trying to get it sorted out before leaving the resort   So check your credit card statements BEFORE you leave the resort    
P =>  super time    My stepson who is a RCI member gave us a week at the Grandview for our   th birthdays we had such a GREAT time we got a timeshare and are going back     
P => 	 Totally surpassed all my expectations   I was quite nervous about where I was going to end up when I booked this through my time share  for there weren t that many pictures on the website  However  RCI stated that this place would be a gold crown property  I read up on trip advisor and there were some good and some bad but I decided to stick with it and take my chances  Afterall it costed      for the week and it was a     sq  ft  room with full kitchen  king bedroom with jacuzzi and queen sofa pull out I went down with   of my girlfriends and was so happy when we walked in the room  or suite  I should say  It was huge  as I had anticipated  with a big kitchen  bathroom and two tvs  Beautiful and clean  I have absolutely no complaints at all about the room    mins  for real  not    like they say  from the strip which was nice cause it wasn t too far and we didn t get caught up in the hustle and bustle of the vegas strip  Payless car rental has super cheap cars so it gave us a chance to go to the outlet malls and stuff without getting stuck in the strip traffic  which is insane Service was great  They did want me to attend a meeting      deposit for show tickets i would get if i went   which i forgot to go to  not on purpose   But they were cool  they refunded me my money back without a hassle The   pools were big and beautiful with plenty of chairs for everyone  Daily activities throughout the day for all patrons It was wonderful and I definitely would stay there again and I refer it to you all as long as you don t mind not staying on the strip  
P =>   Don t attend sales pitch unless you have    hours My wife and I got talked into a sales presentation on our last afternoon in Vegas for our Wedding Annversary with the promise it wouldn t take longer then   hours and we get free gifts  So we bit and went on the sales tour  Long story short tour took   hours  rep wouldn t take NO  They have you    min south of town so you can t walk back  Every one there probably    couples were pissed off  Got our free package of vouchers too late to use the show or exhibit tickets that night  Went to the Stratosphere and buffet  The gambling   were a joke   limited machines jackpot payout only  What a way to screw up your last night in Vegas Price started at        and last offer was  x the days for        Interest rate was       which almost doubled the total cost  Do the math before you buy 
P =>   So   so This is a timeshare located quite aways from the Strip  or almost anything else  None of the rooms appeared to have a view  Ours was of the side of the casino next door Compared to other timeshares  the rooms are SMALL  We had a sleep four unit with one bedroom and found it cramped with two couples  Since there was only one bedroom  the second bed is a fold out sofa  The mattress is very thin  comparable with a dog bed  There was a separate shower in the bathroom and a jacuzzi tub that was nice The staff was friendly and the security staff was very professional as we found out after an accident  We did not get a chance to try too many of he amenities We did find our keys would suddenly stop working and had to make numerous trips to the front desk to have them recoded We smelled the breakfast being cooked every morning by the unit next to ours  We also heard the chairs being moved in the unit above us  Loud and smelly would describe it  Fortunately we weren t there much As it is quite far from the strip  you will probably prefer a car  They do offer a shuttle that seats    and leaves every two hours starting at   am and you do have to reserve a space  Trips back are first come first and are also every two hours on the return If you get a car  plan on parking on the street or at the casino next door if you get in later  We were told they were building a parking structure  If you do get a parking space  it appearred they were smaller than average  Our rental G  barely fit in one There are numerous tours of the property as they are building and selling more units  If you do stay  try to get a unit facing away from the construction They do offer activities on some days for the kids that change from day to day They did try to get us to come in for a sales tour  The rewards they offer are less than the average being offered by other timeshares in Las Vegas   
P =>   great time again Just returned from our week in Las Vegas at the Grandview  Once again  we had a wonderful time  It is a bit off the main strip  but that is what is appealing  We have been to Las Vegas     times in the past    years  We love to come back to a quite area   it is very peaceful  The strip is not that far down the road   yes  we do rent a car   park at the Tropicana and walk the strip  If we were new visitors to Las Vegas  than staying on the strip would be the place to be   you want to be right in the middle of the action  But  like I said  as regular visitors  we now enjoy the quite of the Grandview area    which in a few years will be built up  tooThe South Point is right next door and there is an excellant restaurant across the street   The Boulevard   great food      Make sure to check it out We had a few small issues  called the front desk and within minutes it was taken care of  We have noticed a difference in staff in the past few visits  Much improved    very friendly and helpful  Like with any new venture it takes time to iron things out  
P =>   Enjoyed Our Stay at The Grandview My husband  my   year old daughter  and I stayed at the Grandview for seven nights from ust              We stayed there through a timeshare exchange that my mother in law arranged  Our room was in the Lily Building  Room    B  Our one bedroom suite had a King size bed  two night stands  a TV in a stand dresser  a closet with a laundry basket  safe  ironing board  amp  iron  The dining area has a table for four  The living room has a full size sofa bed    side tables  TV with shelves  a closet area  DVD player    arm chairs and a coffee table  The kitchen is fully equipped with a toaster  coffee maker  blender  stove  microwave  dishwasher  and a full size refrigerator  There is a sunken Jacuzzi tub  The bathroom is roomy with two sinks and a shower  Toiletries include conditioning shampoo  lotion  and two bars of soap  There s also a closet with a washer  amp  dryer  We loved our room You are provided with liquid dish soap  soap for the dishwasher  and one box of laundry detergent for one load of laundry  You are also provided with one regular coffee and one decaf coffee  both make a pot of coffee  If you want more  it will cost you extra  So I recommend bringing extra coffee  amp  sugar  and extra laundry detergent if you are going to do more laundry and not want to pay extra Parking is free  Local and toll free calls are free  Reservations of   nights or longer will receive a midweek cleaning service the  th day after your scheduled check in  Fresh coffee is available in the lobby every morning  High speed wireless internet access is available in the rooms for       for one day         for   days  or        for   days  There s also complimentary internet access in the lobby  In the lobby  you can also check out board games for free The pool area is great  And it was never too crowded  There s two outdoor pools  a jacuzzi  and fitness room  One pool features a rock waterfall We had our own car  so transportation was not a problem  Everything was within    minutes away We did decide to go to a    minute timeshare tour  but we didn t feel super pressure like the people approached on the strip did  And we didn t come across any rude salespeople  We thought that the various timeshare offers were a good deal  but it was a bad time for us to make such a purchase  For our time  we chose to receive three tickets to the Tournament of Kings Dinner Show at Excalibur for a total of     and it included a     dining credit at the MGM Grand  The Dinner Show was fabulous and we used our dining credit at the MGM Grand Buffet for lunch We really enjoyed staying at The Grandview and would stay here again  
P =>  Pleasant Stay but far from the action We just returned from a week at the Grandview and by and large it is a great value  We paid     nt for a full size one bedroom unit  this is less then half the price for simular units located on the strip  The condo itself had a full kitchen a large bathroom and a jacuzzi tub built for two next to the king sized bed  Everything in the unit was clean and worked fine  We did not notice any of the noise problems listed by other reviewers  maybe we just had quiet neighbors but we never heard anything other then running water from above us in the bathroom  Now the parking situation is tight  We always found a spot but the lot was always full and finding a spot was never easy  The resort is building another tower and if they do not add more parking things will go from tough to impossible as far as parking your car is concerned All of our contacts with the staff were fine  everyone was friendly and helpful both the front desk as well as the maintenance and security people who worked the grounds  We were asked about taking a time share tour but when we declined we were not pressured at all My only problem with the stay at Grandview is that if you are used to staying on the strip and being in the action this is not your place  The resort is a good fifteen minute interstate ride from the parking lot to the Strip and Flamingo intersection  only if there is no traffic problems  and in Vegas no traffic problem is a real gamble  We vacation in Las Vegas frequently and this was our first off the strip stay  while it was a great value and nice place to stay the distance to the strip can be a problem if you want to stay close to the action If you want a nice place to stay at a good price Grandview qualifies  The next door Southpoint casino is a nice locals casino with lower table stakes and good food for the money available  Just keep in mind you are not getting the full Las Vegas experience this far from the Strip  
P =>  The perfect vacation For the third year we have had a GREAT experience at Grandview Each year we stay longer  This year we stayed   weeks at Grandview and one week at the Palazzo  Next year it will be   weeks at Grandview  Always clean  always accomodating  always plenty of parking for our car  The couch was a little uncomfortable but sufficient  The closeness to South Point is a HUGE plus  The restaurants are our favorites around expecially Primarily Prime   This place is just GREAT       
P =>  Enjoyed our stay  We stayed at the Grandview for a week and loved it  We stayed at the Iris building  We never had a problem with the construction next door  The staff was very friendly and helpful and the room was very clean with plenty of space  I like the fact that we were not on the strip  The room and the location made us feel like we were at home  It was very easy to get to the strip  You could just drive down Las Vegas Blv or take I    north and take just about any exit  If we ever come back to Vegas this is where we will be staying  
P =>  Do Not Purchase a Time Share at this hotel We were roped into a sales pitch because of the free gifts that were offered  I have never experienced a hard sell of this intensity before  If you do the math    and you need a good memory for that because if you don t bite  you can t take the paperwork with you    the special offer is very misleading    the monthly payment comparison is a three year payment schedule versus an eight year payment schedule  The interest rate is    percent  which is insane  If you go with their special offer  with lower monthly payments over a longer time  we figured you would pay an additional         over the asking price  Once you have had the hard sell  you get the soft sell before you leave            goes down to           there are only    of the cheaper packages left  But I later learned that they make the soft sell offer at the end to everyone  Enjoy the place as a hotel  but don t buy from these crooks  We did get our show tickets and        vouchers for food or gaming  Avoid the time share pitch like the plague  it is a very bad deal  
P =>   We loved it  we stayed here for a week  our daughter    year old  and we loved it  we stayed in jasmine  bldg name   and that is brand new  the big pool was great and the jaccuzzi noise that everyone is complaining about was not a distraction at all for us  there are grocery stores within   miles  so you can almost get anything  nobody bothered us for the timeshare  but we took it anyways for gambling       that was fun  very well appointed units  we loved it parking was an issue if you reach after   pm or so  but you can find something always  they are ok with you parking on the streets outside and do monitor them the wireless internet worked fine  but has a     fee everyday  the dialup internet did not work somehow  the staff there was always willing to help in any ways possible  we had some electrical issue with the first unit  they changed us the next day  
P =>   First Stay at Our Home Resort My husband and I visited Las Vegas last tember for our Anniversary  and while visiting the Golden Nugget were talked into attending a presentation at the Grandview  Long story short  we liked what we saw and I returned     e   with my mother and aunt to check out what we bought into We arrived in Vegas around midnight and upon check in  it turned out that it was in my husbands name  although I had booked the reservation   They asked if they could contact him  which would have been   AM at home  The night manager was able to look up our ownership and everything was OK  except that the clerk helping me commented that my  quot husband quot  should really add me on    I OWN IT AS MUCH AS HIM    A little discriminatory  I thought On to our room  it was exactly as the model suite had been  We had a ground floor room in Sage  at our request  Very close to the front desk  the pool  and the walkway to South Pointe  We were supplied with all of the amenities of home  which was great  I found the bed clean and comfortable  the apartment clean and well furnished  and the tub in the bedroom is a nice touch  My only complaint is the floors were dirty   I am not sure that it was the ceramic  I suspect it was the carpet  which looked in need of a good cleaning  or even replacement I loved having a washer and dryer in my room  I went home with a suitcase of clean clothes  We didn t take great advantage of the kitchen  but if I was to return with my husband and children  I am sure that I would Housekeeping came in mid week and changed the towels and garbage  you can have daily housekeeping at a charge I found the pool area beautiful  and not packed like the strip hotel pools  My hope is that as they continue to build  they also build additional pool areas  because pools this size will not accomodate the projected growth of Grandview I have read that parking is an issue  we didn t have a car  so I can t comment  I did inquire though  for future visits  and the gentleman at the desk that day told me that a parking garage is being built at the back of the property in the near future  We used the bus system  did not know about the South Point shuttle   and for    a day it is unlimited  Being so far from the strip  it is    mins     hour to reach the strip South Point   WONDERFUL  I left money in many strip casinos that week  but loved South Point  We could come home at a decent time and walk across the street to enjoy slots or bingo  They also have movies and bowling  which is great for families  I enjoyed both the lunch and dinner buffets  and also ate at the Coronado Cafe and the Sandwich shop  and all was good I will definitely return to the Grandview  
P =>  A Solid Value    I have read previous reviews that stated that the Grandview hassled their guests with efforts to sell them timeshares  That was not my experience  I was asked once  I declined and that was the end of it   So far as the room goes  it was not elaborate but it was everything that our family wanted  It was very  very clean and had every product you would need including dishwasher soap  razors  coffee etc    All included in the room price It was fully furnished  All the comforts of home  It was a very comfortable home type atmosphere  It never felt like a hotel  The South Point Casino is next door and for my money its one of the best in Las Vegas  The pit bosses still actually comp the players The Grandview is for a certain type of Vegas person  You cannot want to be on the  quot Strip quot   If thats the kind of action you want  go there because its definitely not at the Grandview  For those of us that try and avoid the  quot Strip quot  it is ideal  Very peaceful and very relaxing You need a rental car to get around but I think a rental car is desirable anyway  particulariy if you want to go to the outlet mall  avoid taxi fares or go to the dam  We always make a pilgramage to the  quot Strip quot  once or twice and need the rental for that too Its a great value  Just don  t expect a   star hotel  You will have to do a few things for yourself     like carry your luggage from the parking lot to your room  However  once settled in  you will love it so long as you are not a  quot strip quot  junkie  It has  in my judgement    star value and comfort Loved my stay and would stay there again in a heartbeat  
P =>   This place was FANTASTIC                     I first started getting on Trip Advisor about   months ago  I would read the reviews everyday  and was getting very  very scared and nervous about staying at the Grandview    Everyone was talking about how thin the walls are  outside noise  parking  and rude customer service people     What a load of crock         When we first checked in  the gentleman was very nice and sent us over to get our parking permit  and the other service rep asked us ONE time if we would be interested and we said no  we will let u know if we are and that was that   No pressure at all    The Bell hop was nice and gave us great insider tips for parking  which was never an issue at all   We got home around    most nights and almost always found parking   On the nights we didnt we just parked on the side road  not a big deal people    A little excersice never hurt anyone    The room was beautiful  big  and felt like home   If we needed something like extra pillows or more garbage bags we called housekeeping and they were there within   minutes everytime  with a smile on there face  We never heard noise coming from any other room  and construction     never heard that either    By the way we stayed in the Lily bldg   We had our two kids with us    One is    and the other is      They loved it  as did we   We would highly reccomend this place to anyone who wants to visit Vegas  We will be staying there again next year      
P =>   Great Clean Comfortable Option if you have a Car My husband and I found the Grandview to be an exceptional option in Vegas  especially if you have a car  We couldn t believe we found a brand new  one bedroom  nicely furnished  clean  spacious  modern condo for just     a night  We are used to staying on the strip  Ceasar s  Bellagio  but now that we know about Grandview  I think we d stay there from now on  Despite other reviews that described difficulties at check in  we had no problems  Per others  reviews  we were prepared to have to sit in on the timeshare schpiel  but no one ever approached us about that  We even got the free parking pass with no problem  We checked in within    minutes and got a room immediately  Positives  big space  modern furnishings  clean  big glass shower  two sinks and lots of bathroom storage space  jetted tub  washer and dryer with detergent  full kitchen  full living room with dining table  king size bed in separate bedroom  Also  we found the casino across the street  South Point  to be terrific  It s got a great deli with fresh bagels  hot grill and fresh pizzas  open early a m  to      pm  And  jaded as we are about expensive tables on the strip  South Point had    tables all the time  plus no crowds  and it s brand new and clean  the croupiers were a little rough under the collar  but it provided lots of color to our gambling   That casino also has a bowling alley  movie theater  Negatives  all the reviewers who spoke of the hot tubs being used in the middle of the night were absolutely right  sure enough  our first night at around   a m   we were woken up by banging  clanking and sounds of water and jets from one of our neighbors using their hot tub  The walls are very thin  and obviously  no one obeys the signs requesting hot tub use only from    am     pm  Also  the bed was not the most comfortable  but not terrible  the sheets and blankets are polyester  No one came in to clean daily  so either ask for more bath towels at check in or use the   you re given sparingly  Last negative  parking  Arriving back at the hotel around   pm   am  you d find zero parking spots  Cars were nudged into any space they could find  Another warning  there s a whole new condo building under construction now  so once that s populated  the parking will really be a nightmare  There are also pools and scheduled activities parties  but we didn t get to attend those  We liked this place because it gave us a relaxing  quiet and very comfortable feeling away from the hubub and crowds  and prices  on the strip  FYI  a cab ride from the strip to the Grandview cost      w  tip  and on I     DO NOT take Las Vegas Blvd South to anywhere from the Grandview   
P =>   Not bad at all   We have just returned from spending a week at this establishment Was aware that getting the parking pass is really a ruse to get you to sign up for the timeshare talk so told them we were not interested in any of the shows and were just there on business  It worked and we received no hassles Stayed in the Sage  which I think is one of the first bldgs built so we knew that things would not be brand new  Yes there is normal wear on some of the furniture but none of it looked ratty  It was quite nice  We had all the amenities needed  Only had to ask for more towels  Knew from reading this before hand that parking could be a problem  but we found plenty in the back of the building so never had an issue  Also from reading previous reviews we were aware that running the water in the jacuzzi is loud  it is   and that moving the dining room chairs across the floor can be pretty noisy  Being on the top floor because we smoke  we had no problems with any noise above us and were careful to just lift the chair or move it quietly so as not to cause to much noise for anyone below us  I was worried that the blinds in the bedroom would not be dark enough for us to fall asleep at night  but we were always so tired that it did not matter  Renting a car is a good idea  and we had no problems driving up or down the strip  I just was not too happy with the poor lighting on the south strip at night  Never have had good night vision and it was a challenge at times to figure out the right lane would suddenly become a right turn only lane  I would say that if you are a first timer to Vegas  staying on the strip is a real treat  But having been before it did not bother us and we actually did spend more time at the SouthPoint  Although not the fanciest casino  it is not too bad  Ate quick sandwiches at the Del  Deli which were very good  The desert selection looked very yummy as well  Also had a couple of meals at the Cafe Coronado there and the food was quite good  Excellent Chinese food there We had the lunch buffet at the Bellagio  I think the buffet at Paris is better  Spent way too much on dinner at Stacks in the Mirage  did not impress us  to me they were trying too hard to be  quot the Place quot   Just costs you more  But if anyone is the least bit a Beatles fan  Love is soooo worth going to  You will hear things in their music you have never heard before  Visually entertaining as well  I would stay here again  Clean and a nice layout  
P =>  Unexceptable Behavior       My family stayed at the Grand View in uary       It was a complete disaster  During that stay the entire hotel floor we stayed in flooded with dirty  smelly water  OUR SON WAS NEARLY ELECTRICUTED       All of our electronics and some other items were completely ruined  To make matters worse  no one offered us any help at all  Their were people crying over an intercom system for help  It was completely awful and horrible  I will NEVER go to this hotel again and I would certainly NOT recommend that any one else stay there either  It is now almost e and no one from that hotel has called me back to apologize  let us know if the water was hazardous or not  or any thing  They did not offer us one simple apology for our ordeal  If anyone else stayed at the hotel during uary and had a simular experience please contact me to talk about it because this behavior from the hotel is completely UNSATISFACTORY and UNEXCEPTABLE       
P =>   Not okay This property leaves a lot to be desired  Very much like a cheap apartment not a gold crown condominium  The two bedroomswould be like   one bedroom studios  Our unit had no complimentary shampoos  bubble bath  nor a facility guide likeamenities  They recommend a rental car  good idea  but parkingis scarce  If you are parking after   p m  you ll be parking at the casino next door  the laundry room door in our unit was repaired poorly and the doors would barely close  The TV wouldn t work on the cable box and the unit was just not ready for occupancy  There are blackout drapes in the living room but not the bedrooms  I don t sleep in the living room  We did the time sharepresentation  but I told them I wouldn t buy it for         let alone the          I would stay at a strip hotel before I would stay here again  I ve stayed at the Jockey Club  Grand Vacations at the Hilton  Harbour Lites  Portofino  and several other Blue Green properties and this one just don t cut it  We are doubtful of hearing back from management even though we left a summaryof the shortcomings upon check out  Stay here and form your own opinion and beware  
P =>   A very nice place to stay  We had a very nice time here  Yes it is away form the  quot strip quot  but for us that was a plus   just be sure to rent a car   And if you gamble South Point Casino is just across the street  This is a time share resort  I didn t realize that until we got there   but unlike the other time share resorts we have stayed at  these people were very freindly and not pushy at all  I was asked about attending a presentation  I declined  and that was that  The rooms were very nice and very comfortable  The pool area was beautiful  The only thing I seen that needed improving was the parking  If you come back late you better be prepared to park somewhere away from your building  Don t take this wrong it wasn t that bad  If we go back  I would stay here again   
P =>   No Parking We traded into Grandview from RCI through Wynfham for very few points  which should have warned us  Don t get me wrong  the accomodation was fine but the other problems preclude us from returning We had decided to try staying off of the strip for the first time And when I say off of the strip I mean off of the strip The problem is that we like to visit strip casinos at night  Imagine  and when we return after midnight  there was no parking  The last night I think we parked three blocks away from our unit  With the construction going on it will only get worse I seems to be a nice resort for a place to stay  My wif e says the pool area is lovely  But who goes to Vegas for the pool We were very disappointed in the casino as well  It lacks variety and I think the slots are very tight Also the     charge for use of the safe is BS  What happens if you don t pay the charge  Rob this room the safes not being used Anyway  we will be staying on the strip from now on  
P =>  horrible Booked exchange through RCIThe room had cheap furniture and was not clean we stayed in a smoking room and couldn t beleive the smell We during our stay never found a parking spot near our    story building had to walk about      feet from parking at night with a room key that wouldn t allow us to cut through the pool thus the walk was quite a bit longer Speaking of keys we went to the front desk   times to get keys to the gated pool and finally gave up  one morning after a late show the key did not work on the room We were awakened to the sound of now    floor buildings going up before   am every day The customer service sucked  they just pushed you out of the way so they could have the space for timeshare tours that they took in and out of our building    lily  all day Once at the pool    small pools for hundreds of units currently   buildings with    floors each  you can be stared at by thousands of timeshare tourers I never complain and this is my first reveiw stayed at many timeshares never this bad  
P =>   Excellent Place to Stay My husband and I stayed at the Grandview for a week  Friday to Friday using an exchange week through RCI  I read with interest all previous reviews  keeping in mind complaints such as noise from construction  whirlpool tubs  scraping of chairs  noisy neighbours  lack of parking at various bldg  and pushy time share agents  We booked into the Iris Bldg  adjacent to the main registration bldg  Highly recommended  Units recently renovated  steps from Casino opposite and lots of parking  never had a problem finding space   Ask for unit overlooking the front as construction is at the back of the bldg  We did hear the occasional scraping of chairs  but floor is tiled and some noise can t be helped  People around us were very considerate re the whirlpool tub   Grandview has rules re usage    a m       p m only   Had no problem with time share agents  Just told them we were not interested and they left us alone Overall  Definitely recommend renting a car for your stay  We never used bus service  we rented a car  but heard it was inconvenient and costly if you have a family  Really liked the location off The Strip  but only steps away from a really great Casino  South Pointe  We ate in two of the Casino restaurants  Garden Buffet and The Coronado    both excellent value for money  Suggest you check them out  If you have a car  grocery shopping is only minutes from the Grandview  There is a Food   Less en route from the airport and an Albertsons and Walmart close by Facilities  Our one bed unit was excellent  Very large with separate bedroom  Huge bathroom and shower   definitely built for wheelchair access  Kitchen is fully equipped and stocked with dish washing dishwasher laundry supplies  Tip  bring a universal sink plug  dollar store  as there is no plug in the bathroom sink  Pool at our bldg  was closed due to on going  construction  but main pool was open with loads of sun loungers available  There are   pools     used by children  the other by adults  There is also a small work out room  quite adequate for a short stay  we did not use it   On site grocery cafe  There is a small grocery cafe by main pool  They make salads other small meals for take out at reasonable prices  
P =>   Not a great situation The suite was great when walking through the door  Everything was clean and we were set for a great vacation   However  before      a m  EVERY day  the loud construction started on the building next door  You deinitely couldn t sleep once this started You could hear the hot tub in surrounding rooms during the  quot quiet times quot  of the night  It definiitely is loud enough to wake you from a solid sleep There is NO shuttle service to the downtown strip so if you want to go  you pay over     for a cab  according to staff  or you ride the city bus  which was recommended by staff  So  took the city bus  took between   to    amp      hours every time we went to the strip  It was very very scary at night  I would not recommend taking the bus after dark  Plus who wants to waste       hours roundtrip in a nasty bus If you like to sleep in a dark room  sleep in the livingroom  The bedroom has blinds which are useless I feel bad for anyone who is on the way to the Grandview  Well  if you plan on staying at the hotel and swimming at the pool and not going into town it s not bad     but if you re there for the strip  go elsewhere  
P =>   Fantastic spot  But    Could not ask for a nicer spot But       the only two things that drag this resort down is    After   pm good luck in finding a parking spot  You will probably have to park at the South Point Casino next doorif you get back after   pm  And guess what this is Vegas baby  You won t get back until afterward   pm if you are under   yo    Do not expect quick response from management if you e mail them with any questions you will probably have to e mail twice  I feel everyone is much too busy through the day trying to sell tell shares  If you are up early you can watch all the mercedes rolling in taking up precious spots at the front near the office and  quot Sage quot  building  They appear to me to be the time share closers  Do not take me wrong  other than parking and response time by e mail it is a great spot to stay if you have a rental car or your own   about    min from the action on the strip   Scott L 
P =>   Great Stay in Vegas The Grandview provides nice condo style accomodations off strip  with just the right level of activity privacy  We used the resort through an exchange deal with our timeshare  I read the reveiws posted in advance and was prepared for a few problems with check in but found everyone very willing to accomodate all requests  The rooms were decorated quite nicley and the kitchen had most everything one needs to fix a quick meal for vacation dining  We called the service desk when we couldn t get the TV to work and within ten minutes a great young man had us all fixed up   he simply put the right remote into my husband s hand  The bathrooms had whirlpool tubs which was one of the real pleasures of this trip for me  The resort is located across the street from a new casino which has several nice dining choices  Resort pools were clean and nicly appointed but a bit cold for our stay in ruary  No problem  we really took advantage of the hot tubs  two  and enjoyed visiting with the other guests  I think there are shuttle services available for the shoppoing areas and to the casino strip but we just never connected with them  We had rented a car and used this for our trips about town  Cabs from downtown to the resort run about     one way which seemed a bit steep for the short trip but this was Vegas after all  I was not aware there were no houskeeping services offerred in general and so you have to call for fresh towels or linens as needed  But this was no big problem unless you are pretty spoiled by true resort services  The Grandview has a big parking problem  There is simply not enough resort parking for the guests who have cars to park  They know this and have started a major expansion for their guests  A few RV s took up    spaces alone and should have been made to park in the trailer area  The resort is secure with key entry only  Lots of nice shopping malls and outlet style complexes  And there were two grocery stores just down the road with a nice variety of produce as well as typical fridge and cupboard stock  Yes  we were asked to accept a timeshare presentation  We accepted just to hear more about the resort and all the building going on around the place  We had a very nice tour guide  breakfast  and got to see Mama Mia in the mix  Aside from the resort   if you are going to Vegas and have a chance to see Terry Fator at the Hilton GO  This is the guy who won America s Got Talent  He providede an hour and forty five minutes of constant top notch entertainment  I am not a big Las Vegas fan in general  I don t gamble  I like the shows and the sites  But the Grandview was worth the trip and we hope to visit it again  Sincerely  Dixie 
P =>  Customer Service  Safety issues  Parking spots  Follow up  Our family flew to Las Vegas  NV last week to attend my oldest son s Wedding  We arrived on ruary          and registered at the Grandview Las Vegas  There were no pickup courtesy vehicles  shuttles or vans for the Grandview at the airport like other hotels were providing for arriving guests  Upon arrival  the couteous cab driver dropped us off and our luggage at the door  we paid him  and my son saw that there were two         year old bell captains  in the doorway of the registration building using luggage carts  He proceeded to ask one of them where we could get one of the carts to place our luggage  In a very irritable tone of voice one of them stated that  this is mine and you can t have it   They then just kept on talking with each other and walking through the parking area  I wish one of them could tell us where we could go to secure one  We just wanted to use a cart to place our luggage on for the purpose of checking into the resort  I am disabled and requested a room for the handicap  The young lady who greeted us from behind the counter at about      P M  stated that  all of the rooms in the building are the same there is no need for that type of room   My son wandered around and found a cart  pushed it towards the entrance door of our building  we saw no helpful disabibilty type ramps on the way  We rode the elevator up to the  th floor  checked out our facilities for our week long stay  Clean enough  no problems  We noticed that the shower stall step which is low enough to get in out of but we also saw that there is no safety type of grab bar  a violation of the ADA   no type of sitting stools in the stall  no shelves to hold shampoo  hair conditioner  shaving equipment  or soap  Everything has to be placed on the floor  Thank God  the floor wasn t slippery when wet  Later that evening  my son and his future wife had to take a cab back to the airport to rent a van for transporting all of us for the week long stay  The first night  he had to park the van in front of the lobby where we checked in because there were no parking spots anywhere near our building  The next morning we noticed just about three parking spaces for the handicapped in the doorway of our building  I am the only person attending that brought along my handicap display card from Wisconsin  There are approximately    floors with at least    or more rooms on each floor per building  with five such buildings  The construction noise was apparent because they are in the midst of expanding for more buildings on the grounds  We were given a guest card upon check in to be placed on our rented vehicle windshield for security purposes  On one day alone  I counted at least six vehicles  taking up valuable parking spaces for paying guests at the resort  I was with the Wedding party most of the time in the van  my wife  son and future daughter in law never got a handicap space all the time we were there   During our week stay we had the opportunity to speak with other guests we had invited to my son s Wedding  At least seven other families and some individuals stayed at the same location and in different buildings  Everyone of them had the same type of comments concerning the shower stalls  noise  the lack of handicap parking spots in the facilities  Many of us had seen the abuse of automobiles  trucks and vans without the guest cards on the dashboards throughout the week  Where s the security  Unauthorized vehicles should have been towed away to make room for those paying guests  Some of the employees were very nice people and offered help whenever we requested  I feel that there is a need for the lack of safety measures to be looked at and disabled parking spots should be increased in number  As I stated  I never did see any type of ramp for wheelchairs on the grounds   After calling RCI on        to register my comments  I got the name of the contact person who is Tamara Valerio   Administrator of the resort  I called her on        at just about       a m    CST  As of yet          at        a m   I have received no reply  This is a true review of our stay  
P =>   Vegas with a baby  It CAN be done   This is the second trip to Vegas for my wife and myself in as many years  and this time around we brought our   month old daughter with us  Last time we stayed in The Cliffs at Peace Canyon via an RCI exchange  this time we figured we d try its newer sister resort  Grandview at Las Vegas  We were not disappointed Check in was quite easy  However  we weren t impressed with the immediate attempt to get you to attend a presentation  With our situation  we had gotten there later  we were tired from the flights  we were hungry and had grocery shopping ahead of us yet  so we would have something in the condo to eat the next morning   our luggage didn t make the connection and hadn t arrived yet  and we had a screaming  exhausted baby to boot  They should really wait at least a day until people are settled in properly to try their pitch  It s only courteous They try to lure you in with a free bottle of wine  Take it at your own risk  They re pretty good once you say no  they don t twist your arm like most places do  Even if you re owners at another resort  they ll still try to upgrade you somehow from what you already own  It doesn t matter to them one way or another The condo itself was very nice  The TV didn t work properly  they were on it  The DVD player didn t read our DVD s at all  they got us a new one in    minutes  They have a crew of people around the resort with walkie talkies  like cops on the beat  that respond to problem calls around the clock  Now THAT S service The other problems we experienced were minor  There is not exactly a lack of parking  Rather  it s just other guests parking in front of your building  At night when you get back from your activities  you may have to drive a little further from your building to find parking  and then walk a little  be it through the pool area or wherever to get between the buildings to get to your building  There is still enough parking for everyone  it s just spread out everywhere  We thought the kitchen could have used more utensils   if you have a larger family  you will not have enough bowls  plates  utensils  etc  to get you through the day without having to hand wash them once  and we go on vacation to try to get away from doing that if at all possible   And there were no balconies on these buildings  We missed having a balcony  This is a big thing that the Cliffs at Peace Canyon has over this place The accounts of the units and pictures are accurate   this is a very nice place to stay  South Point next door is very handy   the buffets were half the price than anything you ll find on the Strip  and they were better  made the Grand Buffet at the MGM a total rip off  Stay off the Strip if you want value for your dining    And yes  we were very impressed with our daughter on her very first trip  She travelled very well and sat through the shows extremely well  She even looked like she was enjoying them   I generally wouldn t recommend bringing young kids to Vegas  but if you do  there are many shows and attractions that they will enjoy  Las Vegas does have a little something for everyone  
P =>  Very clean off the main strip Very nice hotel  We stayed there for a week and the only true complaint we had was that our DVD player didn t work  One quick call to the front desk and it was fixed within    minutes  The room was very open and had everything we needed  It is a bit of a distance from the main strip  so if you have a car you should be OK  free parking at most of the casino s  I d recommend the Paris  pretty easy to get in and out of and right in the middle  The Southpoint casino is also right across the street  Not a bad casino  the slots seem to be a little tight and I didn t have the best of luck on the tables  but I did see some people do quite well  I would definitely stay at the Grandview again  
P =>   A Great Deal We stayed a week at the Grandview Las Vegas because of the great package price we found on Hotdeal  Many reviewers mentioned a high pressure sales presentation to sell you a time share  We avoided this by saying up front the trip was a business trip and wearing a business logo shirt  This made the entire check in very fast and friendly with no hassle  The unit has a fully equipped kitchen including frying pans and dishes  Food can be purchased nearby at the  Food   Less  store North of the location  Earlier reviews mentioned free DVD borrowing at the front desk or from guest services  This has been discontinued  There is a DVD player on the main TV in the living room  a Blockbuster is about two miles East of the location  Also several area McDonald s now have a red box DVD vending machine with    rentals  The pool area  two pools  is secure and has a nice waterfall  A large round in ground hot tub is also available to use SouthPoint casino is just across the road to the North of the complex  They have maybe six places to eat including an oyster bar   For cheap eats try the Golden Gate    cent shrimp cocktail downtown  validate parking at the Golden Nugget   or try the great       steak dinner  ask for it   not on menu  at Ellis Island  behind Ballys on Koval   these deals can t be beat       We loved the Grandview hotel for it s value and location  and hope this deal is still availabe next time we travel to Vegas  The photo s everyone else has posted are accurate  room was very clean  
P =>   Great Stay We just got back from a week at the Grandview and it was an amazing stay  Check in was a breeze with no hassle about the time share presentation   It probably helped that we checked in at midnight   We had a top floor room in the Lily building with a view of the pool and  beyond that  a view of construction in progress  The room itself was clean and well appointed  great big tub for two  double shower and tasteful decoration  As for noise from neighboring units  there was none  We did the time share presentation midweek and it was worth it for the freebies  They do a hard sell so be prepared but be polite  Transportation turned out to be no big deal  we caught a CLS shuttle at the airport for eight bucks a piece round trip and made it to the Grandview in    minutes  We set out the next day on the CAT  Vegas  mass transit system  Caught the     between Grandview and South Point and rode to the South Transfer Station  It takes about    minutes to get there but there are ample opportunities along the way to pick up groceries  liquor and it stops at the Vegas Outlet Mall  From the transfer station it s a short ride on the Deuce  the double decker busses  to the strip  We traversed the entire strip from Mandalay Bay to Fremont Street over the course of the week  The Deuce stops at every attraction along the way and a five dollar day pass covers all mass transit throughout the city  We used the CAT system to hit the Zappos outlet on yland and rode that route to the downtown station to catch the Deuce back again  We ended up catching the bus to the airport which is a ten minute ride on the    from the south transit station  The staff at the Grandview were very cordial and helpful  security was always visible and maintenence was quick and helpful with a malfunctioning lock  We will definitely stay at the Grandview again  
P =>   A great place to stay in Vegas yet away from the crowds  My wife and I stayed at the Grandview from    to    in       we traded one of our RCI weeks for this location  and we glad we did  In general  it was a great place to stay The resort is composed of several high rise towers  about    stories high   Most of the the rooms are lockout connecting rooms  so if you are two families  you can stay next to each other  At the time we stayed there  there were   towers in operation  and another was being built  I understand more are to be built in the future  We stayed in room    A of the Sage building  which overlooked the pool area and which is the closest building to the main desk building  While some people have commented on paper thin walls  we did not hear anything from any nearby rooms  However  because of the tiled floors in the dining and kitchen areas  the movement of chairs on the floor above us could be heard at times  and was rather loud  But since we spent most of the time outside the resort  it was not a real problem for us  I would recommend taking along one of those white noise generators for sleeping   we have one an take it with us on every trip  it completely blocks out all external noises and allows us to get a good night s sleep The resort is relatively new and clean  We were very pleased with our accommodation  The staff were friendly  but not that helpful when it came to assisting with outside events   for example  we had wanted to see  the bone yard   which required advance reservations  and the staff refused to get involved for us  There appeared to be a lot of staff in the main lobby  however  most were sales people  aggressively trying to sell us a unit  And I do mean aggressively  If you have no intention of buying  avoid them at all costs  Vegas  like other real estate in the country  is on the downswing  thanks in part the subprime mortgage crisis  While there is a lot of expansion in Vegas  property values are low right now  and it is difficult to unload a timeshare there Speaking of expansion  my GPS was practically useless there   many of the newly developed areas were not on my GPS maps  Gives you an idea how fast Vegas is growing The living room has a large TV  although it is a CRT  not the newer flat panel screens  Same in the bedroom  Lots of cable channels to choose from  The kitchen is well equipped with all the expected appliances and utensils  There is even a garburator in the sink  The resort supplied complimentary coffee for our coffee machine  The main bedroom is also large  with a good firm queen size bed  and lots of storage space  Just off the bedroom  and between the washroom  is a Jacuzzi tub  Lots of hot water was available  The washroom is large  with two wash sinks and lots of counter top space  Also storage drawers and cupboards under the sinks  A hairdryer is included on the wall  The shower stall was large  almost twice the size of a normal shower stall  and had glass walls and door  All lights in the unit were compact fluorescents that even worked in   level intensity  Unfortunately  the worst lit room was the kitchen  which has rather dim pot lamps in the ceiling  Each unit has individual heating and air conditioning controls  And each unit also has a clothes washer and dryer   very handy Although we were told the resort was fully occupied for the week  we saw very few people  The temperatures were low   about  C at night  and   C during the day   so it was definitively not the type of weather to sit out by the pool  They did have two hot tubs outside in the pool area  but the water was more luke warm than hot  We chose to use the hot tub in the room instead  At poolside  there is a small deli convenience store  which is open most of the day  There is also an indoor gym workout room next to the deli  however I have nothing to say about it since we did not use it The resort is located about   miles south of the main strip  A car is highly recommended  They did have a shuttle bus that could take you up to the strip  but it cost about    per person per day   There is also a city bus that runs down to the resort area  but you need to transfer to another bus once you get to the strip area  There is also a shuttle running to and from the strip from the SouthPoint Casino across the street Speaking of car rentals  there is a new central car rental area for the airport  and it is run very efficiently  A common shuttle bus runs from it to the airport and back  All the major car rental companies are in the same building  which is located south of the airport away from the heavy traffic of the strip  Renting a car there and driving down to the Grandview is just a few minutes  Between the airport and the Grandview on Las Vegas Boulevard  there are a number of places to eat  as well as a large Food For Less store for groceries and other items  as well as a well stocked Discount Liquor store There is a Las Vegas information building directly across the street from the new car rental building  However  it appeared to have very little  information   and seemed to be more of a sales agent building to get you to buy timeshares  Anytime they ask if you are married or how long you are in town  beware  Our friends came up the answer   quot Yes  we are married  but not to each other  quot  That seemed to turn off the sales agents  The best information building I found in Vegas is across the street from the Convention Centre  at Paradise and Convention Drive   located on the west side under the walkway over Paradise The whole area around the Grandview is newly built up  including the large SouthPoint Casino Hotel directly across the street  It is about a one minute walk from the Grandview   great for gambling and loading up on the free drinks  since you don t have to drive back  And being a casino off the main strip  the minimum bet on most tables is just      not    or    like many of the large casinos on the strip  The SouthPoint also has a great breakfast and dinner buffet at very reasonable prices While the Grandview advertises wireless internet in every room  there is a charge  and it is not cheap  About    a day  or     for the week  They do have free internet terminals in the activity room off the main lobby  but there are only   terminals and they tend to be rather busy most of the time  despite a timer on each one that limits usage to    minutes per session  There are also a couple of Ethernet jacks in this room  so you can bring your notebook down there and connect for free  bring an Ethernet cable with you  The resort complex appears to be fairly secure  at night the buildings are well lit and locked down  and your need your room key to enter the building  I saw security personnel patrolling the grounds  Despite this  I saw one incident of a car break in one morning   the car window was smashed and the police were taking a statement from the owner  I decided to not keep my GPS or anything of value in the car overnight In summary  we found our stay at the Grandview very pleasant  It was away from the main strip  yet close enough for us to get to easily  I would definitely return there and would recommend it  
P =>  Loved it   going back in  We stayed at the Grandview during the CES convention                We had a suite overlooking the pool area  The furnishings were new  the bathroom is huge   there is a separate area for the whirpool tub  and the bathroom has a shower  toliet and double sink  The kitchen is a nice feature  and we used the washer and dryer  The hot tub outside was very nice and we used it a few times late at night  The pool was open   but too cold for us to get in  A great thing is that it is just a few minutes walk over to South point  We had several meals there and also could gamble at night and just walk  quot home  quot  I ve booked again for  for a girls week  
P =>   The Grandview was awesome   There was   of us who stayed at The Grandview at Las Vegas for   nights and we were all very impressed with our suites  We stayed in the Iris Tower on the   th floor  The suites are clean  roomy  comfortable  the whirlpool tub is fabulous  the bed is awesome  and the kitchen is handy to have  same with the washer dryer   The only thing was that the maid did not come daily  and when she did it was a fast clean  but the suites were very clean anyways and they do supply you with enough soap  towels etc for a few days  I was amazed that the outdoor pool and hot tub was open till midnight  and very warm   There was construction beside us  but it wasn t to bad at all  You don t go to Vegas for a relaxing holiday anyways  There is a free shuttle across the street at South Point Casino and that will take you to Mandalay Bay Hotel  from there you can get on the free Tram that will take you to New York or Luxor Hotels  then there s the Deuce bus that s on the strip for        We used that and rented a car as well  The restaurants in the South Point Casino were very good  you must try the buffett  and be hungry     Huge selection of food   It was an awesome trip and I didn t think I would go back to Vegas for a long while  but we will be planning it again in about   years  Lots to do and see     
P =>  I like the Grandview a lot  With some minor exceptions  I always enjoy my stay at the Grandview  and I ve stayed there   times so far  They are all newer buildings with very nice one bedroom apartments  The units are in pairs and can be combined into two bedroom units for larger families  The weird thing is that there is one hallway door  then two doors inside a small foyer  each one leading to a unit  If you re utilizing both units  you can leave the inside doors open and only open and close the door to the hallway  However  if you re alone or a small family and are only using one unit as I always do  you have to open two doors with your key to get into your unit each time and it gets old  especially if you re carrying things  The units themselves are large  quiet and clean with brand new furnishings and appliances  nice sized kitchen  and a large jetted tub off the bedroom  The king size beds are firm and comfortable  although the foam pillows are so thick that your neck might hurt in the morning  Maid service is typical for a timeshare   once per week with a midweek towel replacement and trash emptying  Haven t used the pool or hot tub  but I ve heard other guests say they were clean and the hot tub was nice and hot  The small food refreshment store isn t open very late  but it s adequate  I recommend going to the Food   Less just a bit north on Las Vegas Blvd  and stocking up your kitchen  Two tips  first  when checking in  they send you to a another counter for your parking pass and to try to sign you up for a sales pitch  I tell them I m in town on business and then they don t attempt to give me the pitch  Second  don t stay on the west side of building      the early morning construction noise starts early  Overall  I give a big thumbs up to the Grandview  
P =>  Had A Fabulous Time My dad and I had a two bedroom condo for the Thanksgiving Holiday  It was extremely spacious and was stocked with more than we needed  We had a wonderful  fabulous time  This place is beautiful  extremely clean and housekeeping is just great  The staff is willing to do whatever they can to make the stay enjoyable  We will be going back for Christmas       If they had a restaurant onsite it would be even better  However  it is right next door to South Point Casino and they have plenty of restarants available  Would recommend Grandview any day of the week  
P =>  Away from the strip   but a real gem  Our family of four stayed for   days over Christmas       Note  our kids are    and    and had a real blast but I do not recommend young kids in Las Vegas  The young children we saw  and their parants  looked miserable  If you have young children  go to Disneyland and take them to Las Vegas later  This is a suite property and our room was a one bedroom  King bed  living room  Queen sofa bed   full kitchen  most non  food supplies are provided  and dining area  Price was about        per night  This is a new hotel with our room in superb condition  It is about a   mile drive directly south of the strip essentially on Las Vegas Boulivard  Rent a car to get here to get around or you will be unhappy   parking is free at this hotel  rental cars in vegas are cheap  This hotel is about    minutes easy driving time from the airport  Thee is a Food for Less grocery store on las vegas blvd and I suggest you stop in there to stock the fridge in your room  Buy some coffee too  Although there is free coffee at the front desk  that desk is    minutes walk time from your room from some locations  There is a coffemaker and micro and stove in your room  It is nice to have a cold beverage waiting for you when you get home from an active Vegas day  Although you are      min  easy driving  away from the main strip  there is one giant casino next door  Southpoint  which has    or so theatres and    or so bowling lanes  Bootlegger Bistro is   minutes down Las Vegas blvd towards the strip and is a great restaurant find  Prices are reasonable  portions are large and its a bit of old Vegas  Lots of pictures of celebrities   a real nice spot for a family dinner  I highly reccomend the pizza  We used this hotel location to take a one day bus tour to the Grand Canyon  bus picks up from Southpoint  next door   Now  going to the Grand Canyon was the highlight of our trip  but it is one heck of a long bus ride    hours each way  and cost about        each  But the   hours on the rim of the canyon is spectacular  Also  the outlet mall in Primm is good  about    minutes West on the highway   Very easy to get from this hotel to anywhere in Vegas  
P =>   Nice hotel clean good for chemically sensitive Booked this hotel through Hotwire  It was like a   bedroom apartment with a nice floor plan  The floors were tiled except for the bedroom This hotel is great for chemically sensitive individuals since they have all tile floors  do not use air fragrance in the hallways nor the rooms and the bedding does not smell like detergent  The rooms have also out gassed There is also a washer dryer in the room in case if you need to wash the linens with your own fragrance free detergent Overall  it was a good place and they did not pressure us into purchasing a timeshare  The only time we were asked was during registration   we kindly declined and they left us alone for the rest of the stay  
P =>   Great Place Out of the Action of the Strip We have stayed twice at the Grandview  once in ember of      and again in ober of       While this property is basically an RCI timeshare it is offered on many of the standard travel sites and can be booked just like any other hotel  Which makes me wonder why anyone would pay a large up front price for a timeshare unit and then have the annual maintenance fees only to be locked into the timeshare restrictions of dates and durations of visits  Anyhow the bottom line is that I sort of like this place and I think most people that stay here will also if they are prepared to deal with the location which is about six miles south of the main strip action The rooms are really the best part of the resort  Each one bedroom unit is a well equipped apartment  in fact they are larger than some one bedroom apartments that I am familiar with in Southern California  Each unit has a well equipped kitchen  a washer and dryer in the unit  a king bed in the bedroom and a queen sized sofa bed in the living room  There is a large bathroom with a shower and a Jacuzzi just off the bedroom  The two bedroom units are an exact duplication of the one bedroom units with all the same equipment and amenities  In fact they are completely separate units with separate entries which is ideal for two couples  but may provide too much isolation for parents wanting to keep a close reign on smaller children   teenagers would love it  There are also two large screen TVs in each unit with a DVD player attached to the living room set  The resort has a selection of DVDs that they lend out at no charge to the guests There are two nice pools  one heated  and a small deli on site  There is no restaurant  however  there are several options at the South Point casino right next door as well as another restaurant  the Boulevard Grille  across the street They now have wireless in all the buildings  but I consider it very expensive  They want     per day      for   days and     for the week  They do still have the public computers in the lobby which I was able to use about anytime that I wanted although others have mentioned having a problem with access to these  They no longer have FREE wireless in the lobby as they did in the past Most people will probably want to rent a car  however  we did not and got along just fine by allowing the extra time required for public transportation  If you drive in from California the new exit ramp from I    is now open and is very convenient to The Grandview  Cab fare from the airport will cost you about      There is a shuttle service  CLS  that we used for the trip back that will take you to the airport for    per person  You have to schedule it    hours in advance and allow a couple of hours before your flight and this works out great  We saw several people use this throughout the week  They were right on time and only made one more stop prior to going to the airport  Took us about    minutes total  During our stay we used the South Strip Trolley which picks up right at the Grandview and you can transfer to the Main Strip Trolley at Mandalay Bay  This requires planning and allowing extra time as they are not always on schedule  but we got along fine  They have a strange fare schedule that requires you to buy a Day Pass for use between     AM and     PM and a Night Pass to use between     PM and midnight which is sort of screwy if you want to go to the Strip at   PM and come back at   PM you have to buy   passes  But they are only       each and they allow you unlimited use of the trolleys on all the routes during the time that they are valid  They do have one way passes  but they are only for one trip and do not provide transfers to other trolleys   Along with the transportation issue there are a couple of other things that you might want to consider about The Grandview  For instance  there is still construction going on not only at Grandview  but also at the casino next door  South Point  This can be noisy  in some locations although during both of our stays we have been fairly close to the construction area and have not been disturbed too much by it  You just have to take your chances and asked to be moved if it is a problem for you  Also some reviews have complained about the exterior lighting being a problem in illuminating the units at night  Again this hasn t bothered us mainly due to the location of the units that we have stayed in  It appears that the exterior lights that are the culprits are mounted just below the  th floor and the  th and  th floor rooms probably get the worst of it  The buildings do look nice all lit up  but give us a break and turn off the decorative exterior lights at   PM There were several planned activities every day  mainly for the kids  While I am a strong proponent of NOT taking kids to Vegas  if you insist then this is a good place  You are away from the strip and there seems to be enough activities to keep the youngest ones entertained  Teenagers will be hopping the trolley to the strip anyway so don t worry about them they will make there own entertainment  For the smaller children there is also information on child care facilities in the area  So if the kids have to come this resort should work out better than most as you have a lot of room and there are things for them to do either supervised by you or someone you hire One other thing that we really liked about the Grandview was with the South Point casino right next door we had lots of dining and gambling choices without the hustle and bustle of the strip  so a couple of days we didn t even leave the area  We ate at the buffet which was not outstanding  but a good variety and inexpensive  The Silverado steakhouse also serves a good meal at about half the price that you would pay on the strip  It was really nice to have your own casino with lots of friendly people and machines that would take your money and you could walk back to your room in   minutes   it takes me longer than that in some of the mega resorts on the strip when your room is in the same building The bottom line is if you don t have to be in the heart of the action on the strip and want a large comfortable place with lots of amenities and a friendly staff the Grandview should suit your needs just fine  
P =>  Great Stay We own a   bedroom unit at the Grandview and I must say it s worth every penny  We stayed the week of     nd and it was wonderful  We had deposited our   week through RCI and then had to come to Vegas for a reunion so we decided to book here  There we four of us so RCI gave us   of the   bedroom suites which was really great  We stayed at the IRIS bldg which is the newest one and closest to South Point  WE had very little encounter with their front desk clerks so no complaint there  I called a week before and requested rooms with a nice view and they gave us really great rooms  We had   parties in the rooms and we were surprised that no one complained about the noise level so I think this bldg s insulation is better than the others The trolley stopped at the Grandview which was convenient but having South Point across the street made all the difference  You definitely have to have a car so you can go to the strip and other places  
P =>   front desk personnel they should teach their front desk representative how to communicate people some of them were rude first day of staying already have problem when we called up the front desk they put me on hold for a long time and never answered the phone  
P =>   Great Place We stayed there   de mayo weekend  so needless to say  Vegas was packed with the Oscar match going on that weekend  We are owners at the Grandview  They got us last   We really liked how it looked and since my husband and I like to get away to Vegas w o the kids  it seemed like a great place to come to   I m    and my husband is     We bought a   bdrm and it s great  The only complaint I have is that the housekeeping does not come  but once a week  You have to request that they come any other time and I believe  pay a fee  That was a negative  but everything else is really nice  The decor is very nice and it comes with a full kitchen and a dining room and living room  We really like the jetted tub  It has a washer and dryer  too  We didn t get to enjoy the pool  but definitely will next time  The Southpointe Casino is next door  so I heard the food is good there  It is about   min  from the main casinos  but it s not bad at all  Plus  they are already going to start building other casinos next door  Soon  it will be part of the strip We didn t have any safety issues there  There were guards outside at night  Considering how packed Vegas was that weekend and even the resort was packed  but no break ins or vehicle thefts that we heard of  There are timeshare people around  but that s to be expected when it is so new and more phases are being built  We personally liked it a lot and can t wait to go back  We were going in t for Labor Day weekend  but couldn t make it  so we rented it out and there were no complaints  I hope this helps  
P =>   Wonderful stay Been back in England for a day now and already looking into booking into the Grandview for next time  Clean rooms  good equipment and friendly staff  Saw security guards posted at the car park entrances all night long   Pools are nice though the shop could sell more  groceries    staff in there were very friendly  This place is recommended for the car driving tourist to vegas   Don t go on timeshare tour if you don t want to   but if you do prepare for a   hour hard sell   Overall Grandview is a great place to stay  
P =>  A nice stay in Vegas My wife and I stayed for a week in tember at the Grandview and really enjoyed it  The place is almost new  so the rooms and grounds were in great shape  The staff was friendly  We didn t want to hear their timeshare pitch  and there was no further pressure once we said  quot no quot   The   rooms were well furnished with washer dryer in room  full nice kitchen  jacuzzi tub and separate shower  confortable bed  and two TV s  You have to pay for wireless Internet service which was a bit of a downer  but it worked fine Location was fine for us because we had a car  It s right on Las Vegas Blvd     miles from the strip  We went to the South Point Casino next door  but didn t like the place  so we did all of our gambling and entertainment on the strip and one night downtown  The South Point looks pretty nice from the outside  but inside it s nowhere near as nice as any of the main casinos on the strip There is no restaurant on the premises aside from a small sandwich  quot pizza quot  place  where the service could not be any slower and  quot pizza quot  needs to be in quotes Overall  if you have a car and don t need a restaurant or huge pool on location  the pool is nice but relatively small   this is a great place to stay  
P =>   Fine resort Stayed at the Grandview as part of a timeshare swap  Staff friendly  if you ignore the timeshare sell  Easy to get to the strip  left out of the resort  drive straight for   miles    Rooms clean and well kept  South Point casino is right next door if you need a quick fix  Overall excellent base off strip  
P => Grandview   great value A great placet to stay   almost new so in very good shape   very nice pool area  The South Point Casino across the street offers some great values on meals  cheaper than cooking  and the casino has very loose slots  The trolly to the strip works OK  as the hotel is about   miles south of the airport  a long way from the stip  The only negative with the Grandview is that the rooms are not well soundproofed   we had quiet neighbours so it was OK  but this could be a big negative  
P =>  It s okay BUT         Just got back today from the Grand view  Saturday    ober Its not bad  but poorly named  there isnt a grandview  unless you have binoculars Good for kids to stay at  but the small shop is poorly stocked and staffed  food   less is about a mile away to get provisions  and there is a shuttle bus laid onPools are fine  but one is solar heated and it was freezingIts about   miles from the strip  so a car is essential  unlesss you want to wait for the tramCheck in ws really good and the staff helpfull  The oom is pretty standard for a time shgare  nothing outstanding  even though it is sold or rented as luxury unitThe activities listed each day just never happenedPC and internet access was limited as PC s went down on a regular basis  there was one working when I leftThe time share presentation went on a bit long  all we wanted was the free tickets  they go through the whole speil  then just as you think you are at the end  they hit you with a final offer  and WOW does the attitude kick in  they just vant wait to get rid of you  talk about the bums rush  still we got our free tickets IF you want to buy a timeshere I d recommend the NEW planet Hollywood  now this is an outstanding and LUXURY TS  worth a visit All in all  its not a bad place  but not outstanding in anyway  but ideal if you like to stay away from the hustle and bustle of the strip and dont mind being   miles awayThe South pointe next door does a really good buffet for breakfast lunch and dinner  and it beats doing your own cookingThe South Pointe has a great bowling alley and cinema and all the usual gambling tables and slots  so its worth a visit 
P =>  Loved the Grandview at Las Vegas  Very roomy and with a full kitchen no less  We spent   nights at the Grandview at Las Vegas  and our accommodation was excellent    we had a   bedroom with a full kitchen  Across the courtyard was the fitness center and swimming pools and spas  The only negative I saw was the pool was too cool to really enjoy    the weather was warm  mid    s  but when you got into the pool  it was cold  Perhaps the heat could be turned up a few degrees so you can float and enjoy the water  be next time it will be warmer  The South Pointe casino hotel is next door  and the Coronado Cafe has very reasonable prices  and the food was very delicious  We ate there for all our meals  Inside are   restaurants  so there is something for everyone there  Grandview does not have any restaurants on site  so you need to have a car to really go anywhere besides South Pointe  We walked at least   mile before we got to a bus stop  but we were able to take the Trolley to the strip for       for a   hour pass  I loved that the refrigerator had its own ice maker  Though we did not eat in the unit  we basically wanted to stay at this resort as we are an every other year owner of   week now  and having spent time there  we will now know what to bring when we come and stay for a week  
P =>  Great room  As a whole the place is convenient  we rented a car  to everything  It s our  th time in Vegas so we also traveled to the Hoover Dam  Red Canyon  Rafting on the Colorado  Etc The resort s staff was not very helpful with information so we went to the local AAA for that  The supposedly concierge service is given by the sales people  amp  I heard information only when a salesperson passed by with potential costumers  Otherwise you don t get all the needed tips about the grounds  the nearby Casino etc   When you ask they mostly   don t know or don t have much patient for you  You feel as if you are disturbing them  But   to be fair   some of the staff where very nice The most annoying part   Computer Availability   Stinks    Yes they have Wireless service to the rooms         day   as most hotels have today   But   No free wireless service whatsoever     Not next to the business center or around pool  On top of that for such a large place they had   computers available     min  max use  at the beginning of week  At the end only        What s the reason for being so tight fisted I wanted to use the pool but as a lap swimmer it kidney shaped and that was annoying For those who like pools  the weather was chilly and one pool was heated   that was a pleasant surprise  As a whole   for an exchange price you will not get an spacious apartment in Vegas as a time share  I don t know how the other timeshare units are but heard that they are great  Especially the Hilton 
P =>  No Noise just a great suite Just finished staying at the Grandview for the tember long weekend  Nice new clean suite with all the kitchen you need My wife and I stayed in the bedroom and her cousin and husband on the sofa bed  They were a bit concerned about the pullout bed but they found it to be supportive and comfortable We never really heard any of the noise that most people did complain about  We actually thought we didnt have any neighbors but we did see them a few times in the hall and they had a small child with them and grandparents If you are concerned about the noise just bring a pair of earplugs to sleep with  we did but never used them Renting a car is a must  and much easier to get around than we thought  All the casinos have valet parking which is quick and free and saves your feet  Just tip       when your car is brought back safe and sound The fastest way to the strip is ti just take the I    around the back of the casinos and then just turn on to the connecting street that you want  On the Memorial day long weekend it only took us     minutes to the strip and about       to downtown The southpoint casino is very nice next door  It has lower limits and is less crowded than the strip casinos  Dont miss the graveyard specials at the restaurant there  My wife took in a hot stone massage at the spa there and was quite pleased Anyway  we have stayed at the Bellagio  Mirage  MGM  and Ny Ny before and this stay was just as good  The full kitchen allowed us to keep some leftovers and make breakfast or have drinks or snacks available  The key to making this stay as good as the strip is the renting of a car  fast and easy to the strip and can relax away from it if you want Remember to have positive expectations and thats what you will find  If you look for the negative thats what you will find Only negative was that we did not receive a wake up call we requested  luckily we always use the alarm as a back up Have fun and enjoy  
P =>   Grandview is great We own a unit at the Grandview and have just finished our  rd visit during the Labor Day week  The unit was just being cleaned when we were given the keys so we had to lock up valuables and go elswhere for a while  This was the first time the RCI representative attempted to coerce us into watching her sales pitch after we had politely refused  I hope this NEVER happens again I love the place  We have always been in the Primrose building and were given a pool view unit on request  We have never had a problem with noise from other guests  Some things were missing from the unit but a call to housekeeping got most of them replaced immediately Information was received for any questions at the desk  The pools and hot tubs are wonderful  The only problems were the parties consuming copius amounts of alcohol  much beer on the table with several quart bottles of rum and Jack Daniels and getting loud   Children      went unsupervised  They were playing rough with no supervision bumping into swimmers The location is great with the SouthPoint Cassino next door for gambling  entertainment  and dining  Just hop in the car to go on trips around Nevada  go downtown by interstate highway  or go to the strip by shuttle  taxi or bus Thanks for the good time  
P =>  Wonderful Stay Bought this timeshare   years ago and made our first visit from                  The resort is quite beautiful with a very nice pool and plenty of parking  The room was unexpectedly nice  much nicer than rooms we have had at MGM and Luxor  and the full kitchen was a treat  We had no problems with elevators or noise in the room as other reviewers have mentioned  It is about a    minute drive to the strip which was no big deal  The South Point Casino next door is also very nice  I would recommend this to anyone not requiring a room on the strip  i e  not on their first visit to Vegas   
P =>  GREAT EXPERIENCE Have just come back from Grandview having bought a timeshare last year  one bedroom unit   The facilities were great but it was nice and quiet  We stayed at the Iris building which has just opened  You need a car as it is about   miles from the strip but things were easy to find one you became familiar with the roads and all the hotels seem to have free car parking  Would definately come back here again  Liked it so much we bought another one bedroom suite  
P =>   Fantastic place to stay  don t listen to the negative reviews  We used our timeshare points to book at Grandview about a month or so before our trip  I won t lie  I was a bit bothered with all the negative reviews and was almost thinking of cancelling and paying for a stay someplace else  The supposed loud noises with the hot tub when a neighbor uses it and the moving of chairs in other units were non existent for us  I was seriously expecting so much worse than what we experienced  but I have absolutely nothing but good things to say about this place and the staff  We never bothered with any timeshare tours  in fact  we never even came into contact with any staff except at check in  We got to choose the newest tower  Iris building  and had a unit on the   th floor  The lady who checked us in said if we weren t happy with the room  we could gladly check into another one without a problem  We never did move as again  we didn t experience any of that crazy noise that was mentioned in some reviews  Yes  walls may be a little thin but given that the parking lot was always so full  the building was still so quiet even though we always bumped into a lot of people in the elevators  And speaking of elevators  even though there were only    the longest we ever had to wait for one was a minute  The washer dryer is perfect and the pool was a nice place to cool off in that hot oven weather  If there was a fitness center  we didn t try it  You can bring your laptop and sit in the lobby while you surf the net or you can use the free PC s they have in their internet room  If you do decide to stay here  as many have mentioned  it is quite a ways to the Strip so rent a car if the Strip is more your thing  Otherwise  South Point is perfect for your gambling  bowling  arcade  movies  eating needs    all of that just a few steps away Would definitely stay here again  
P =>   A Great Week At The Grandview My wife and I stayed at the Grandview           to            It was one of the most relaxing vacations we have ever experienced  Check in was a breeze  The units have a living room with a TV and a DVD player  a small but adequate dinning room  a fully equipped kitchen  and a bedroom with a comfortable king size bed and a TV in the room  Next to the bedroom is a jacuzzi next to the bathroom  There is also a washer and dryer tucked into its own closet  There is a slight noise when people in another unit run their jacuzzi  Other reviewing have described this noise as intrusive to their enjoyment of the unit  My wife and I hardly noticed it You can check out DVD s free of charge from the main desk  The pool is very nice with a snack bar between the pool and the fitness center  The Southpoint Casino is next door  The Southpoint has gambling  many restaurants  a movie theater and a bowling alley and a kid s play area  Between midnight and  am the Coronado Cafe has a graveyard special with a very cheap breakfast The Southpoint food is good  but very good food reasonably priced can be found across the street at the Boulevard Bar  amp  Grill  Flori one of he co owner  along with other family members  work in the restaurant and provide warm  friendly  service to go along with large portions of excellent food reasonably price Because the Grandview is four miles south of the McCarran International airport that is just South of the strip  I recommend renting a car  With a car you can shop for food nearby to cook in your unit if you so desire  and you can visit the strip where there is plenty of free parking My wife and I went to the Valley of Fire  the first state park in Nevada  where there are magnificent geological sandstone structures From now on my wife and I are going to stay at the Grandview instead of a hotel  
P =>   Comfortable Stay   Beautiful Rooms Beautiful condo like setting near the Las Vegas Airport This was a great family place off of the strip  The pools were a lot of fun  The full kitchen and big bathroom was a thrill for the kids I was impressed by the other guests  Everyone was nice and polite and friendly  a rare quality to find these days  The front desk was always helpful  I received a Fed X package and they called me as soon as it arrived  not all hotels will do that  The only bad thing is that there is no internet connection in the rooms   but we found a comfortable couch in the lobby where my daughter and I could get a fast wireless connection  and coffee   
P =>   Grandview is great stayed   wk  at the Grandview  or first RCI exchange  wow what a nice place  approx   miles south of the airport next to the new South Point Casino  stayed on the  th floor overlooking the pool area  had the  quot A quot  side suite approx     sq ft  very roomy for   people  master bedroom has king bed  amp  jacuzzi tub  huge bathroom with large shower  amp  his  amp  hers sinks     quot  tv in living room  amp     quot  tv in bedroom  fully furnished including stacking washer  amp  dryer  put that to good use  nice to have with kids  very clean  amp  new looking   large pools  amp  hot tubs  vegas in july is very hot       F  but dry heat  pools  amp  pool area very clean  also has a arcade for kids and a snack bar for drinks  amp  food  very nice and fully equipped gym there is   free internet computers for the complex in the internet room  it gets pretty busy so if you have a laptop with wi fi bring it along   i wish we would have thought of it   great to check up on your emails outlet mall shopping is close by and SouthPoint Casino is next door but if you want to go to the Strip on Las Vegas Blvd  it quot s best to have your own car or rent one  the start of the south strip is about   miles away overall we were very impressed with the Grandview at LasVegas i would stay there again for sure  
P =>   very enjoyable We stayed at the Grandview from the   th through to the   th of ust and found it to be everything we had hoped for  We stayed in the new Iris Tower where everything looked practically brand new  The apartment was clean  very spacious and well appointed  with no problems at all with noise or lift availability The bed was extremely confrotable  the large jaccuzzi tub was glorious after days spent walking up and down the strip  and the kitchen had absolutely everythng we needed We made frequent use of the Strip trolley which never let us down time wise and made travelling to the Outlet Centre for shopping and to the Strip for sightseeing extremely convenient Southpoint next door gave us an option of not having to go far at all if we wanted a meal out or a  gambling flutter  close to our home base We will definitely be visiting again  and would recommend this hotel to anybody  We went without our   children this time  but when we return we will will take them with us  as the activities we saw planned at the Grandview each day as well as the pool area would keep them very happily entertained  
P =>  More Than You Can Ask For  I arrived early and check in time is at  pm but they were very pleasant and got me in a room early the front desk is very friendly  I was very pleased with my stay and would come back again  In fact they even had a private laundry in your room Very comfortable and it had a feeling of home to it  THEY EVEN HAVE DISHES FOR YOU TO USE    EVEN POTS AND PANS  oh i did have a problem with finding the remote control in the bedroom but i called the front desk and about two minutes later i heard a knock on the door  seriously The resort is very nice and very well maintained  I DON T THINK I WILL EVER STAY IN AN EXPENSIVE HOTEL EVER AGAIN  You will not be disappointed with your stay because it s not just a room it s a little apartment with the feeling of home to it  
P =>   Nice hotel far out location I stayed at the Grandview for a couple of days earlier this month  I thought the room was great  The kitchen supplied everything we needed  the bathroom was spacious with a nice shower area  The jacuzzi tub was basically in the bedroom but convenient to relax in and watch tv if you so desire  I stayed in the new tower and had no problems at all  There were two elevators but I never waited long to be lifted or dropped  I would recommend this place to people with kids in tow I would say that the good thing for me was when I got there  I didn t have to see all the gambling  If I wanted to gamble  I could go across the street to South Point  I really regret doing that as I am a prior resident of Las Vegas  Their machines had no mercy on me and I only went there for the convenience  After leaving South Point  my hotel room was a great place for me to take a breather and relax  I would stay there again but most likely would stay at the Orleans or Gold Coast where the gambling is better for a gambler like me  
P =>   When Your Neighbor Loves the Jacuzzi Tub      You know there s a problem when you see a sign posted on the tub stating it should be used only between      a m  and       p m  The neighbor s tub might as well be in your own room when it s turned on  and oh boy did our neighbors turn it on    at      a m  at       p m   and at various times in between  There s no sleeping once a tub is on  the water rushing through the pipes creates a noise unlike any other hotel noise I ve ever heard  Also  the chairs need some sort of sliders on the bottom because when the neighbors drag several chairs across the floor for several hours  as our neighbors did while partying one night  the noise of chair legs scraping across tile floors travels right into the room next door  I ve never called a front desk to complain before  but we ended up having to call the front desk three times  Bottom line    bad neighbors but the issues could have been prevented with adequate plumbing and with    cent sliders on the bottom of the chair legs  We left a written complaint with the front desk clerk upon check out and her lack of interest indicated we probably won t have a response  We won t be back  
P =>  great place to stay  I read the reviews before booking  Am always a bit reluctant with some bad reviews  I m amazed on how many people are so dissatified with just about anything  My experience was great  The units are very clean  Very well equipped  Couldn t think of anything that was not supplied  The workers were all pleasent and helpful  The location is ideal with a car rental  Without it I would have found it difficult  The pools and exercise room were fine  Daily coffee in the morning  free internet and activities for the kids  Was not approached once regarding timeshares  Yes the elevator had problems  Big deal  It was fixed  Would rebook here without any reservations at all      
P => nice place to stay Stayed at the Grandview from e   rd through the   th  The room we stayed in was very nice and very clean  The room was spacious including the bathroom  The staff was very accommodating with any of our requests  They gave us a room near the pool so it was very convenient  I was not disappointed in the Grandview at all  I would stay there again   We took the trolley from the South Point Casino next door to the Grandview to the Mandalay Bay Casino  From that point another trolley took us to the Strip  We found out that there is a free shuttle at the South Point Casino that takes you to Mandalay Bay  There  you can board a tram to the Excaliber and walk to New York New York and other casinos  We also rode a bus one evening and they are very nice  air conditioned and cheap         The buses run on a very good schedule  Taxis are readily available if you need one  The drivers are very amiable and knowledgable about Las Vegas  We ate at the South Point Casino and enjoyed our meals  especially the Graveyard Special  It was       for a delicious breakfast  Their       prime rib special was wonderful for dinner  If you buy meals on the strip  expect to pay a great deal more than that    A great experience and hope to go back again  
P => New and Cool I enjoyed my stay here  The locations is       minutes away from the strip near the las vegas outlet mall  grocery store  which is great because of the fully equipped kitchen  and many restaraunts  The jacuzzi tub is an excellent feature in the room along with the DVD and CD players and washer and dryer  The site offers free DVD rentals and a shuttle to and from the strip  I got an excellent rate through hotwire  Since this place is a timeshare resort  if you arent interested in purchasing a timeshare dont waste your time attending the timeshare presentation  but if you do attend they offer cool comp  gifts  
P =>  Loved it  We had to book at the last minute  our son and daughter in law welcomed their first child  We travel to Las Vegas   or   times a year and always stay at the SouthPoint  Well this time their room prices were outrageous       per night  for a Wednesday  amp  Thursday  Someone told us that the Grandview  which is just steps from the Southpoint  rents their condos timeshares by the night as hotel rooms  We were very pleased  the price      per night  was the lowest in Las Vegas for a   star property  and the unit is spacious  well furnished  and very comfortable  We had no noise problems with other guests  in fact we never saw anyone else in our building    The refrigerator is very noisy though  and the a c could be quieter  But overall the unit is great  and we will stay here again  
P =>   Never judge a book by it s cover  I can t really say that I hated the Grandview  although  I didn t love it all that much  I stayed there for   days  and six nights  The beds were horrible  and the pillows lacked luster  The shower and Jacuzzi were nice as they were large enough to fit two comfortably  The washer and dryer unit worked well  but were small  Although  it wasn t all that frequent   Noise was an issue  The pipes would moan whenever water would be used  and the walls we so entirely thin that you could the television of your neighbor  For those who prefer to stay in the room  the kitchen was well stocked  and the televisions had many channels  The pools are small  shallow  and only the upper one is heated   However  they to aid in beating the heat of Southern Nevada  WARNING   Do not attempt to eat at the caf  by the pool  You will regret it I took my laptop thinking that like any other modern establishment in this world at least The Grandview would have Wi Fi  but it didn t  I didn t even bother using the computer room as I heard from other guests that the computers there were heavily firewalled and blocked most sites  Transportation is a biggie as the Grandview is so far from the strip  There is only other grocery shuttle that travels once per day at noon  However  there is a The Las Vegas Strip trolley that faithfully comes every    minutes  and only costs       for a day  or night pass  There is also a new ish bus called  the deuce  but it only goes as far south as the Outlet mall  It costs       one way  or       for a    hour pass  Both the trolley and the Deuce go Downtown  We decided that it was best to get on the trolley until the MGM  It drops off right beside a huge store called  the grand canyon experience  from there you can walk to most places  Do most of your souvenir shopping at the Grand Canyon Experience   they re fair priced and offer a great variety  The South Point   Hotel  amp  Casino is right across the way complete with bowling alley  cinema  arcade  child care and a great buffet  I highly doubt the Grandview would still be above ground without the South Point around to pick up its slack  Overall   It s a nice place to stay if you don t really care where you are  I wouldn t buy the timeshare if I was serious about my investment  and had already seen many presentations  Just because it s the cheapest doesn t mean you re getting anything special  
P =>  Lacks Customer Service The front desk staff at the Grandview could use some lessons in  quot Customer Service quot  AND courtesy  They will not link group rooms or assign your room until check in  We had reserved   rooms for   nightsand ended up on the smoking floor because that was all that was left by the time we checked in  Since we made the reservations for our family trip weeks in advance  I was furious  It is doubtful we will stay at the Grandview again  Too many places in Vegas value their customers and treat you with the respect you deserve  I d rather staysomwhere that cares if you are there  whether you are an  quot owner quot  or not  
P =>   Nice Place The Grandview is a great place to stay if you are going to be in Vegas for more than a few days  If you get tired of being on the strip  then you can just relax by the beautiful pool  The jacuzzi tub in the room is very nice  especially after a long day of walking on the strip  and the bathroom is HUGE    One tip for those going    use the bus system to get to the strip if you don t have a rental car  The bus is easy to use  and picks you up very close to Grandview  Just be sure to give yourself at least an hour on the bus to get to the strip  
P =>  Stayed twice now want to own This is the second time that we have stayed at the grand view  and this time we also stayed at the bellagio as well  it was nice to compare life off and on the strip  We love it at the grand view  the rooms are simple yet luxurious  having a kitchen is so perfect being able to buy drinks and have constant ice on tap and the option to eat in if you fancy it is delightful  and a sad thing to confess on our honeymoon is that we actually came back with every item of clothing in our suitcase was clean and dry thanks to the super efficient washer dryers  The rooms are clean and loads of towels and nice touches  the jacuzzi is a lovely touch however is quite noisy and you feel you ought not be in there too long for the sake of the neighbours  the swimming pools out side are lovely and the two spas are also very enjoyable i feel they will need to expand on the outside area as more buildings go up  yes we did que for the parking permit and did go for the presentation it took   hours but we walked away with   show tickets for    bucks so we considered it worth whileyou do need to hire a car here as it is far from the strip and the trolley bus is annoying  we did that last year and got very tedious  its nice to be able to be on the strip when you want to be and be away when you do  we spent every evening in the south point which is a really friendly casino and you get to know the waitresses and the dealers lots of free drinks on tap  we went to see spamalot Superb   and also Ka i didnt really enjoy it  all in all it is a great place to stay i would agree with the noise issues with neighbours partially i could hear coins dropping on the floor and on the last night at  am all i could here was an inconsidereate idiot using the hot tub for an  hour we intend to go back asap and as soon as we can afford it will be buying time share here it really is a great place to stay 
P =>   Love our place We are owners here at the Grand View and have stayed here twice already  Check in is always quick and easy  the rooms are very nice and I don t know why someone is complaining about the bed  I had the best nights sleep on it  The people are always friendly  and folks if you don t want to go on the upgrade  quot tour quot  DON T GO  It s optional   not the resorts fault you decided to go and didn t like it  We went the first year  we did not go the second  There is never any obligation to go  We enjoy the activities they have  the food run shuttle  and the new deli pizza place  The only issues we have are the chairs  When people slide them across the floor it is very noisy and we had a group of people above us that I swear sat in the chair and scooted themselves around the entire room  I also think that the shuttle service to the tropicana should come back  that was very convenient for us our first year out  All in all I m glad we own here and look forward to going back in ember  
P =>    A Great Location Super Service  What a great trip to Las Vegas   Grandview  Check in was fast but when you go to get your  quot parking pass  or any other items at guest services be expected to go through a quick sales pitch about the resort and taking a tour  There is a brunette there and her name is ey    she is so over sold on the timeshare tours that she will make you feel bad if you don t take a tour  It s best to say you re tired and that you will get back to them  We never did and they never called us either  Using the internet was a pain because it was only in the lobby    but it s nice to have and it is FREE to use  The room was exactly represented by other guests as ALL rooms in this resort are exactly the same  A two bedroom is just two  one bedrooms  The room at times could be VERY LOUD because of other guest using their jetted tub  The doors are hallow  so you can hear exactly what goes on in the next room  And when you stay here make sure you close the interior door every time  It does not close automatically  With the not closed it could allow guest from the other unit into your unit  Also there is a     surcharge to use the IN ROOM SAFE  Have YOU ever heard of that  The rooms are well decorated and have DVD players and LARGE TV s  The activities they offer are ALL geared toward KIDS and they ALL cost MONEY  starting at      When staying here makes sure you rent a CAR  I saw the Trolly Twice during my one weeks of vacation  The car rental rate is about      per week and is much worth it   The resort is under construction but it s not loud or annoying  If you have any questions ask the people in the Orange Shirts and White Pants  These people are really more the restaurant and tour experts   BOB is awesome and is so smart   he knows every good restaurant and tour  Tamara is awesome at the front desk  If you have any problems please go see her  She can fix anything  Also if you ask for the Lily building you can see all the concerts at South Point   Overall  the stay went FINE and is not as bad as some have described it  We stayed in the oldest building  built in       and had no problems  I forgot to mention the new airport car rental center is about   miles away from the resort  
P =>   Not the best lacked service  Our stay at the Grandview was free due to a change made to our timeshare points   a bonus week  We were never told about going on a tour and since we were owners at one of their resorts in Florida  we were not required to take one   however  we had to fight with the  quot customer service quot  people there about it  who claimed they would charge us for the room if we did not take a tour  They eventually figured it out and we did not go  amp  did not pay  We arrived on a VERY windy night and after taking a great while checking in  after paying     for a cab since there is no airport shuttle   the person who checked us in did not correctly access our entrance cards  so after hauling all our luggage ourselves to an entirely different building  against the wind  we got to the building and couldn t get in  One of us had to go back to get correct access to the cards  The rooms were nice  not the most comfy furntiture  but it sufficed  The lighting in the bathroom stinks and there were no shelves in the shower for shampoo or anything  The jacuzzi tub was nice  but very loud  We had questions about transportation and were assured no problems before our arrival  Trying to get information from any of the people at the front desk was a complete joke  None of them have a clue about anything  When I called to ask about the Trolley schedule  a lady asked me if I had the schedule  DUH  It is supposed to run every    minutes but it doesn t  amp  instead of being picked up at the front  the Trolley stop is in front of a different building without shelter  amp  in the middle of a parking lot  The bus only runs out there once per hour   amp  although there are plenty of bus stops getting to it from the strip  there aren t any for a long way going towards the strip  We did a LOT of walking  If you think you don t need a car   you re wrong  We ended up renting one on the  rd day we were there  They boast how convenient that is as the front desk   just call and they ll be there  We requested a rental and were told it would be there at       AM  Well  they forgot to call  so at        someone was there to pick us up to take us to a rental place  We got back with the car at      PM   totally wasting half a day  Rent one from the airport and all will be fine The people at the front desk didn t even know about restaurants in the next casino or where a grocery store was  FYI   there is a      and some other little grocery store about   mile north   amp  a larger one further north  amp  only one restaurant is open next door late  The buffet there was fabulous though  the Southpoint Casino    so much to choose from  amp  cheaper than those on the strip If you stay at the Grandview   it is nice and they certainly leave you alone because there is no service there  but be prepared with your own transportation  And make sure your entry cards are given correct access the first time  
P =>  Excellent Value If you re smart  you can steal this place for a few bucks a night  It has all the comforts of a nice little apartment  Way more amenities then you d get on the strip for  x s the loot  I enjoyed partying on the crowded strip  then retiring to the quiet retreat of the Grandview  You need a rental car to get around but it s a    minute drive to the strip w o traffic  or a   hour drive if traffic is heavy  Walls are thin   plumbing is a bit noisy  but for     a night   shut up  I booked this place online and prepaid  so   I never had to deal with any timeshare salesmen at all  Boulevard Bar and Grill across the street is open   hrs  Quality food  Reasonable prices  Tommy is an AWESOME bartender  Take care of him  Next door to the South Point Casino  Pleasantly nice  loose slots  tons of stuff to do  movies theaters   bowling  shows  I will stay here again for sure  
P =>   Horrible Beds No comfort   The grandview is great but the beds are extremely uncomfortable  They need to update the matress is all of the rooms  The other amenities are great  Overall very good stay  Friendly staff  extremely clean rooms and spacious  Affordable prices  
P =>  Rooms ok the rest isn t    I stayed here over the Super Bowl weekend and got an awesome deal thru Orbitz but that s where the good ends  Check in was extremely slow even though there was no line  The man at the service desk took fifteen minutes looking at his screen  Then instead of just giving us the piece of paper that is the so called  quot parking pass quot   he sent us five steps over to the concierge  This is where they try to hawk the timeshare part but if you re not interested  then they stop  They gave us the wrong directions to our rooms  for those who will stay here  you will know why this matter  You go outside and drive to one of the next buildings if you have a car  walk if you don t  Even though the building is fairly new  probably less than     years old  it is already showing wear and tear  Our cabinet door in our room fell off the hinge  The area around the bathroom sink had water damage  The blinds in the room does not move to flip to the other direction to block out the sunlight  The room was ok but the walls are not paper thin  they re paper tissue thin  I stayed in places where you can hear the noises next door but this place is ridiculous  Everytime the unit next door turn on their water shower  toilet  tub   it is like a tsunami going through your room  This is the main reason I will never stay at this place again  It was so loud  unnecessary loud  They charge for daily housekeeping which I wonder if they ever change the sheets b c it looks so used and old  I looked at the housekeeping cart and noticed there were only a few set of sheets in her cart  That really makes me wonder  You need a car to stay here if you want to visit the strip which is less than    minutes away  My overall experience was not too good except for the price i paid  I go to Vegas quite a bit and have stayed at MGM  Aladdin  Monte Carlo  NYNY  Stratosphere  Excaliber  The Residence Inn  Fairfield Inn  and others  The price wasn t worth it in the end  
P =>  Perfect for our party of   We stayed at the Grandview the week of       th and had a great stay  The place was absolutely spotless  We were a party of      parents and   college kids  We had a   bedroom suite connected by a common foyer  We put all the kids on one side  and my husband and I had the other half which worked out perfectly  We did a hugh Costco run on Sunday  amp  because of the kitchens  we were able to eat the bulk of our meals at the condo  This is a hugh plus not eating out every meal  especially when you re traveling with   people  We used pretty much everything that the place offered  We did laundry on a daily basis  cooked out at the gas grills by the pool  and the kids loved the jacuzzi  South point hotel across the street was a big plus  The kids could get the city bus in front of the hotel to go to the strip  They offered a real cheap breakfast after midnight along with     bowling  Make sure you take a drive to the Grand Canyons  Because it was off peak  we were able to book the mule ride which was an absolute experience of a lifetime  Would definately stay there again  
P =>   Beautiful Rooms We had a great stay here  we had two units right next to each other  Our children stayed in one and my hubby and I in the other  We stayed in the newer of the buildings  It was great  Although it is a little further down the strip it is still close to shops  and a Casino right next door  The casino has a great bowling alley with over    lanes so the kids loved it The service was great but I must admit that the front office staff are a little up tight and they really dont seem to know much about anything  The computers went down in the internet room and no one could tell me what happened or when they would be back on Overall it was a great stay and in the holidays they do have a childrens workshop which we found very good The walls are very thin  and if your planning of having a spa bath later in the evening after a big night of gambling or a show  forget it there are time limits on when you can have them because the walls are so thin  
P =>  Very nice off the strip stay We spent a week here     th thru   th  for our parents   th anniversary    of us stayed quite comfortably in a two bedroom suite  Both fully equipped  The Southpointe next door was wonderful   We ate meals there very cheaply and meals were excellent  Steak eggs  hash browns and toast Monday thru Fri  Until   a m  for       Do not take trolley   Double decker buses way to go with pass for week very cheap and they run all day up and down strip  Just be aware they only run til midnight to Grandview  Don t get caught sitting at bus stop after midnight or no ride back   Grandview was clean and staff friendly and willing to give info for golf  etc Would definitely stay again   Enjoy your stay  Lorrie P  Delaware  Ohio 
P =>  So so mediocre Went there as part of a family trip    not my choice and not my taste  A bleak and desolate place once you leave your rooms  While the apartment itself is clean  nicely equipped and spacious  almost everything else is awful  There is permanent construction noise  starting incredibly early    around            there are currently   buildings in the complex and they are planning     so be prepared for ongoing work  The walls are paper thin and the sound of water running in the surrounding apartments is so loud that you can t hear anything else  The location is incredibly isolated from the Strip and  while we had a car  the drive to the Strip takes awhile and there is literally nothing around in walking distance except for the Southpoint Casino  which pales after a while  The common spaces are jammed full of timeshare tours  at all hours of the day and into the night  The  quot internet room quot  has only   computers and children using them constantly  The pool looks nice but it s much too cold to use it at this time of year  
P =>   Best spot and Price if u rent a car The Grandview at Las vegas is fairly new   i believe it was built in       so everything still looks and feels new  The   bedroom suite has more room then any of the on strip hotels and for half the price   King size Bed and Jet Tub too  plus full kitchen with all the utensils   Yes u are about a    minute drive south of the strip  but the money u save in staying here covers the cost of a compact car rental for the week  PLUS u are right next door to the south coast casino which is only opened in      This casino has excellent prices and food selections at their resturants  They also have a bowling alley and theatre inside   U can t go wrong staying here  as i for   enjoyed the use of the car to drive to the strip hotels Their parking is free and having   outdoor pools and a hot tub to enjoy that wasnt ever crowded Also the peace and quiet away from the strip is nice Quick directions from airport is go south on paradise rd  Airport exit  to     west      west to Las Vegas Blvd exit  then south about    minutes to the Grandview on your right side right beside the large South coast casino    no way u can miss it  It wasour  st time in Vegas and we enjoyed it so much we are returning in     pS  GO to the Grand Canyon  it is worth the drive     hrs each way  We left at   got there at noon and the left at  pm and was back at the room by  pm      in gas gets u there and back   But Fill up in Boulder city as no gas stations for miles after that    I t is truely a site   of a lifetime not to be Missed  The most amazing natural site ive ever seen  Dont pay for someone else to drive u in a overloaded uncomfortable van that will cost u      each  unless u have lots of money to burn  Ps  if u do then send some my way    Enjoy your trip  
P =>   Great Pool We all justed loved our time at Grandview  The pool was great  the unit was clean and pretty  The staff was nice  and helpful  The only thing I could say that I did not like was there was no schuttle service to and from the strip  We were told by RCI and the hotel that there was but when we arrived the front desk let us know they no longer had a shuttle service  They do have a taxi stand the cost is about twenty dollars to and from the strip  There is a casino right next door to the Grandview and that is nice  because you have a place to go eat or get coffee etc  My friends and I will stay here again  Thank you 
P =>   Pros and Cons    OK  here s the list  PROS     Beautiful units  New  tile floors  Pottery Barn ish decor and furnishings  Kitchen was fantastic    Swimming pools were fabulous  Lots of deck space and great hot tubs  Waterfall was not operating  but still enjoyable    Located away from strip   lets you get away from the hustle and bustle   South Coast is next door  If this casino were not here  I would not have enjoyed the stay at all CONS    With the tile floors comes noise from dining chairs next to  above and below the room     Not alot of insulation between rooms  Could hear people on both sides when talking on phones  Could hear water running  but that s not a really big deal    Muzak in lobby and around pool is SO loud  I don t understand why      Shuttle situation is poor  This is perhaps the worst part of the place  There is a grocery shuttle   time per day and they only let   person per room go unless there is room  There is no shuttle from airport  It is approximately     from the Grandview to Mandalay Bay  so getting the trolley pass is best bet  HOWEVER  the trolley is supposed to run on the     hour  but was late almost every time we took it  Sometimes people had waited an hour to get it  A place of this caliber and price should have shuttles to the grocery store more than once a day  and at noon  at that   and should have some other options IF YOU GO Rent a car   if nothing else  just to get you around the grocery store  outlet center and to the strip  However the lot is totally full and then some in the evenings  Cab from airport is about        Bring a fan or something for white noise if you are a light sleeper Overall  I give my trip a    The property is beautiful  but again  for this caliber of place  more amenities w  regard to shuttles should be provided I d stay again  but rent a car and bring fan to drown out noise from other units  
P =>   Great stay in Las Vegas  This hotel time share is worthy of the  quot Gold Crown quot   check in went great  everyone was very helpful and went out of their way to may sure we had a great stay The main attraction for this place is the fact that the  quot South Coast Casino quot  was across the street    a very short walk  At this casino  everything you would like   great breakfast buffet   slots   theaters   bowling lanes  etc  Easy drive to the  quot strip quot  on Las Vegas Blvd   
P =>  so convenient We are owners of a timeshare at the Grandview and this was our first time to visit  We arrived on   th and departed on the   th  We rented a car although we had heard of the shuttle service and the trolley car transportation  We had several people flying in from different parts of the country  and felt we needed the freedom and room of our own vehicle  We were very pleased with the check in service   fast and informative  We had a two bedroom  which accommodated six of us very well  We went to a nearby grocery store  about   miles  and purchased items for breakfasts and snacking  We prepared breakfast each day as we planned our outings  We were relaxed and leisurely  Our biggest pleasure was the convenience of the South Coast casino right next door  Those who wanted to gamble or eat at different times could do so easily by just walking across the street  We found the buffet pretty much like most of them in the casinos on the strip and the Silverado Steakhouse was excellent   We ate there twice  The pools were beautiful and not crowded at all  although we only walked through the pool area  and never actually went swimming  There was a lot of construction going on  but we were never bothered by any of it  The only noise that was a little bothersome was the running water in the room next door  When they used the shower or bath  it sounded like it was in our room  One of the complaints I had read about in other reviews was the light coming in the windows early in the morning  Evidently  that has been addressed  because our rooms had beautiful wooden blinds beneath our sheers  It is nice to see they are trying to take care of the complaints that they are getting The kitchen was very well furnished  There wasn t a thing we needed that wasn t there  except some storage bowls for opened or uneaten items  like cheese  sliced tomatoes  etc  Next time I will know to buy ziplock bags or glad throw away containers  All in all  everything was more than we had anticipated and we were very happy with our stay  
P =>  Fine Condo Hotel But Not a Resort We stayed here on a      week coupon from RCI  While the resort is almost new  it already shows wear and tear and the common areas could use a good scrubbing e g  scuff marks everywhere and we noticed small items on the hallway carpet that were there all week  The pool area is not luxurious and the position of the buildings had it in shadow by   pm  It s  miles to the strip but the new but bland South Coast Casino is next door  The retaurants are OK  the Mexican is the best  The time share tour was not hard sell but we ve been through enough of them to recognize the sales puffery and that the Grandview would be a very poor investment           to say the least All in all a fine place if you are just looking for someplace to relax between trips to the strip or for sightseeing in the desert  
P =>   Very pleased with the Grandview We are timeshare owners at the Grandview and this was our first stay here  We were really very pleased with the apartment and the facilities overall and the staff at reception were polite and helpful  Having the south coast next door was great  good place to eat and meant that you didn t always have to go up to the strip Our only minor negative point was that the trolley bus and the free shuttle up to the strip were not all that regular and we ended up hiring a car  We enjoyed our holiday and would not hesitate to recommend the Grandview and we will most definitely be coming back  
P => Nice but not great We stayed at the Grandview for   days in ust  It was okay  We had a nice one bedroom suite that was nicely appointed  We did not have any of the noise problems that the previous reviewers had mentioned  We did have some  quot smells quot  that came from the unit next door when they were cooking  but it really wasn t particularly unpleasant  The accommodations were nice and clean and the bed was comfortable  We used the gym   days and it was fine  A few treadmills    ellipticals and a couple bikes and weight machines  Would have been nice to have some dumbbells free weights  My husband and I own at the Fairfield Grand Desert and the Grandview is certainly not as nice  If you considered the Fairfield as a riott or comparable  the Grandview would be like a Holiday Inn  I would recommend the Grandview to families with kids  Their resort activities seem more geared towards kids  And not if you were planning to spend a lot of time at the  quot Strip  quot   We didn t use it at all  but  the shuttle looked like it was way too small for the lines of people that were waiting  I would rent a car because you are at least    minutes from the south end of the Strip The best thing was that the South Coast Hotel  amp  Casino was right next door  We ate there every day and the Big Sur Oyster Bar has great food  If you are going to stay that far south of the Strip you may as well stay at the South Coast  
P => Over promised under delivered We needed to go to Las Vegas for the MAGIC tradeshow for a week and I saw some great rates  My main concern before booking was internet access and transportation as the Grandview is ALL THE WAY DOWN AT THE END OF THE STRIP   soooo NOT close  I called TWICE   the first to ask and the second time to confirm   and I was told the following    Internet   Dial up is available in the rooms   ugh   But you can use wireless downstairs in the main lobby or use their computer room  for    minutes MAX before the systems boots you out      Shuttle Service   They have a shuttle that runs all the time Point number   was correct and managable  Point number   was a blatant LIE  They DO have a shuttle  but it doesn t start until   am   Our tradeshow started at  am   Also  there is some quirky hour at     pm that they just don t pick up  So anyone looking to come back to the hotel from the strip  between     pm and     pmwould have to wait until the     pm shuttle  That sucked and they don t point it out to you  Needlesstosay  I was not HONESTLY informed of the shuttle s limitations until AFTER I was checking in  I was furious   what s the use in calling ahead if you re going to be lied to   ALSO  keep in mind that they tell you on the printed sheet with the shuttle times that the return ride picks you up at the REGISTRATION area of the Tropicana  LIE  You have to go around to the back where the buses drop off   they don t tell you this at the Grandview OR at the Tropicana   they just assume you ll figure it out Other issues  When we got in  we had tons of luggage and we arrived a little late   around      am as our flight was delayed  The guy who checked us in  CHRIS  informed us that we would have to lug all our stuff to the room  which took him    minutes to find our reservation as they are completely disorganized  without a rolling cart  He even said he d go look for one and then told us there weren t any  While my husband and I were struggling to get our bags to the room at the far end of the complex  we encountered SEVERAL rolling carts which further exemplified the staff s either laziness or lack of care for the guests Maid service   We were there for a week  They say that housekeeping will come in the middle of the week to clean up a little  NEVER HAPPENED Pool towels   If you get to the pool later in the evening  better bring your own towel b c they will not replenish them throughout the day Taxi to the strip   Be prepared to rent a car or find other means of transportation to get around  To the convention center  we spent     one way or     to the edge of the strip  TOO EXPENSIVE South Coast Casino   Pretty nice as its right next door  Get the fun book   it s pretty valuable and you can save a little money  Their shuttle starts at  am   take it if you don t want to have to wait   more hours for the Grandview s Food   There s a little convenience store up the street at the Shell gas station and a little further on the opposite side  Jay s  for small groceries  In the mini mall with the Shell station  there s a great liquor store   they have a good selection for reasonable pricing  Also  across the street from the Grandview and the South Coast is a little   hr restaurant called the Boulevard  The food s good and a less expensive than the South Coast s place  Try the spinach bacon pizza and the ceasar salad   we enjoyed it Construction   We were in the far building of the complex  The SAGE building is right across from the new wing they constructing  They start early and there s probably some noise related  See if you can get a room in one of the other buildings All in all  the hotel rooms at the Grandview were nice  I would go back only if I was completely on vacation and wasn t expecting to go to the strip a lot  You need a car there and a lot of money to travel  Don t expect the staff to be very accomodating or competent  
P =>   Grand Time at the Grandview I stayed at the Grandview with my family in  of       We found it to be very clean  roomy and comfortable  We had a one bedroom suite with a pull out couch in the living room where the kids slept  The kitchen was fully stocked with everything we needed and the washer and dryer were very handy too  They also have a very nice pool area with a waterfall that the kids enjoyed  The staff were all very friendly The Grandview is on the extreme South end of the Strip so we rented a car and it worked out quite well  We liked being able to go the the Strip and then be able to get away from it when we were ready  Righ next door is the newly built South Coast Casino the has all tha gambling you want as well as cheap meals The walk in shower is huge and our only complaint  and it s a minor one  is there are no shelves or anywhere to set anything in the shower Next trip to Vegas we would surely stay at the Grandview again  This is way better than a hotel room on the Strip  
P =>  NICE PLACE  Well  I read the reviews here before I left  I am EXTREMELY pleased about the resort overall  The rooms were VERY nice and had plenty of amenities  I stayed at the Fairfield last time   and this is nicer in my opinion The negative things  which aren t that big of a deal  computer room needs more computers  One morning I was woken by someone s running water  The biggest thing for me was in the bedroom there are no curtains to shut out the lights   just blinds  once the sun comes out  it makes it much harder to sleep as the sun comes in the room Get the SouthCoast fun book    best fun book I ve seenOh  if they try to have you take a tour or a presentation  they might try to give you a  quot Casino Royale quot      free slot play    the lady told me you basically get     of slot play and keep the winnings    this is NOT true  Went to the casino royale   and it s  quot promotional slots quot    and a COMPLETE JOKE            It s complete bait and switch  fraud    do NOT go there EVER Still  this is a nice place   not perfect    but very nice    I d go again in a heartbeat 
P =>  Glas I did not invest I was just in Las Vegas and was solisited to attend a presentation for a time share  it turned out to be the  quot Grandview At Las Vegas quot   I was told at the presentation that this resort is strictly for time sharing only  When we were given a tour of the resort  I asked the question in reference to the people staying at the resort and I was told that these are people on a timeshare trade  Wow here it is being advertise as a hotel by  quot expedia  orbitz  cheap tickets and hotels quot  I just realized on why should I invest in this time share  and it wasn t cheap  plus paying a      fee a year for upkeeps so I can only use it  as permitted  a week a year when alI I have to do is book the same resort through the above mentioned   com  web sites I am glad that I walked out of the presentation without spending over        where I can have this resort for a lot less simply by using it as a hotel when I please The resort is quite a ways from the strip and if you are in Vegas to enjoy the strip you can do a lot better by staying in one of the hotels on the strip for the same price or less  
P =>  Very Nice   Too Far from the Strip The wife and I went out for a quick  three night stay at the Grandview in e  The rooms were very nice and quiet  Typical for a new resort  Pool seemed a little small  and very cold  It was the first time I have experienced a     degree ambient temp  to my surprise when I was in the pool I thought I would freeze   We sit through the timeshare pitch  just for the free stuff  It was a little dragged out for us  we sit through those from time to time and this one went for    hrs  The comp wasn t that good either  we had to pay     to get the Carrot Top show tickets  And the true Vegas shows were buy one get one free  The shuttles work well  if you don t mind planning your day around them  There are   to choose from  the Grandview runs to Tropicana every     hour til  or  then every hour til  am  The South Coast runs to the BArbary Coast which is a good deal because it s in the center of the strip next to Ballys and the South Strip Trolly runs to the South end of the Strip  didnt experience it   All in all a very nice resort  although point values are over rated  Cost me   k points to exchange there for three nights  includes a Saturday  
P =>  Peaceful We arrived on Friday night and left on Thursday morning  we were scheduled for      rather than       They quickly worked this out  We received wine and coupons for restaurants  etc  The casino next door is new and awesome  the only place where we didn t just throw money away  My husband and I enjoyed sitting at the picnic table early in the morning and late at night  next year we will cook outside  The breeze and clean air are refreshing  The suite is supplied with all necessities one can imagine  we loved having an in suite washer  dryer  dishwasher  jacuzzi tub  wonderful   and shower  According to our guests  the sofa bed was very uncomfortable  but the regular bed was fine  We will return at least once year  
P =>  Nice inside but a hike from anything Overall I d recommend the Grandview  My biggest complaints were  the distance from the strip    miles from Mandalay Bay   the lack of wireless in the room and the horrible parking As much as it is nice to be away from the crowds around the strip  it is very far away from anything  You definitely need a car to get to and fro  They do have a shuttle but we didn t want to get stuck late after the bus stopped running or be faced with a full bus and have to take a taxi back to the hotel We stayed Memorial Day weekend and the strip was a zoo  Friends at a strip hotel complained about the noise there  I was happy to return to the very quiet Grandview The parking is terrible  They didn t plan enough spots and it s hard to find a spot near the building  It wasn t just the holiday weekend as I ended up back there for a day   weeks later and the parking was no better It may be petty but you would think that in new construction you would put wifi in the rooms  There was wifi in the hotel lobby  which didn t work one day  and a computer room off the lobby but I would rather not check email or do business in a crowded room like a lobby which always seemed to be teeming with loud and bubbly timeshare salespeople and their prey The positives QUIET No casino  If you want a casino there is a big casino hotel right next door  The buffet here is good and cheap  no  not an oxymoron Big rooms  Comfortable bed Great glass shower Even better Jacuzzi tub Typically well equipped timeshare kitchen and in room laundry The pool looked nice but we didn t use it I ve stayed in   other timeshare properties in Vegas recently  Hilton and Shell  and this is by far the best  even if it is in the middle of nowhere  
P =>  I d love to go back  We just returned from the Grandview at Las Vegas this morning following a stay e         arrranged by my timeshare exchange company RCI  It was further from the centre of the Las Vegas strip than I anticipated  but with a rental car there was no problem It is a beautiful  well kept resort which has an active sales team but there was no obligation to take  quot the tour  quot  The   bedroom unit was perfect for   people with a full kitchen  king sized bed  living room  full kitchen  washer dryer    TVs  jacuzzi tub and shower stall  The pool area was picturesque  especially at night but it was so hot  I didn t understand how the guests could bath in the sun during the day  There is a nice fitness centre which sometimes had a short wait  The resort had free DVDs that could be borrowed  including recently released movies  There was also a complimentary shuttle that I took to the Tropicana one day with no problems  The internet room was popular and each guest was limited to use for    min  A real plus for the resort is the easy access next door to the South Coast Casino and hotel  It is a huge and is complete with restaurants  theatres  bowling alley and equestriancentre  We tried the reasonably priced buffet a few times and the food was quite good I would not hesitate to return  
P =>  Wonderful experience Stayed at The Grandview for four days in e and we enjoyed ourselves  Yes  there is major construction in front of the buildings but it was not a nuisance or a distraction  This area south of The Strip is building up rapidly with new resorts  restaurants  stores and its about   miles from the Mandalay Bay Casino  The new casino next door is beautiful and the buffet is great Grandview staff was wonderful  One older gentleman driving the shuttle was especially nice and helpful Only negative experience was at the small store near the pool  Lady in charge was downright rude and did not seem to want to be bothered by customers  Oh  and the prices were outrageous  A    bottle of   Advils was priced at    Besides this rude person  everyone else we met was pleasant and extremely helpful  
P => Nice Place Stayed at Grandview end of      nice facilities  large rooms  full kitchen  large TV a bit of noise between rooms but not bad    pools  shuttle  South Coast Casino right acrossstreet easy walk in morn  Seattle Best Coffee shop  decent gaming  nice buffet   amp  several other resturants  A car is helpful but not necessary  enjoyed the stay  staff was good  security on site       all areas were clean and well kept  some construction noise sinceaddit  bldgs are planned  
P =>  Grandview visit and review Wes stayed at the Grandview the week of      th  The accomodations were excellent and would reccomend them  The condo was very clean and very comfortable  I have read about in previous commnets that the walls are thin and it is noisy  Believe me it is  We did not have a car for the first few days and got by on the shuttle bus to the Tropicana or the trolley to the outlet mall and the strip  We found the front desk VERY helpful in getting us a better rate for the car and with directions  The only draw backs I could find on this resort are as follows  There is starting MAJOR construction around the towers  Currently there are three towers in their complex  The plan is for       When we were leaving they were getting ready to start digging   new towers  Also we found SOME  not all  the shuttle bus drivers to be rude  They would routinely show up at Tropicana or at the office late  They would claim that they had been in the pick up areas but that we were the one s at fault for being late  I would avoid the shuttles if possible as they are not as relaible as the trolley  Do cab it from the airport and then rent the car from the resort  They have a special deal worked out with Budget rent a car and they pick you up right at the lobby  There is a small store kitty corner to South Coast where you can pick up snacks and suds  Be careful around the pool areas as it sometimes gets suddenly windy and the pool chairs and tables go move into the pool  The South Coast casino is right next door and has a great buffet  When you go into the South Coast make sure you sign up for their players card  They give you a coupon book that gives you   for   breakfast or lunch  
P =>  Good ol  Grandview We stayed at the Grandview for the second year in a row  We go every year for the Kentucky Derby partys  We love the Grandview because it s always clean and the people are friendly  The great thing this year is that the Southcoast Casino opened up right next door  We were able to walk to the casino and back in about   minutes  No car  no cab  The Southcoast is really nice and they have some good resturants  We had another great year at the Grandview   
P =>  Pleasant Surprise          My wife and I and friends just returned from a week at the Grandview at Las Vegas  We had a   bedroom located on the  th floor  The resort was a pleasant surprise  Check in was smooth and directions to the resort were clear and precise  Only drawback was the need for additional help at the front desk  The rooms were huge and both were equipped with full kitchens  This was a novelty since most resorts that offer and A and B unit usually offer a mini kitchen in the other unit  One noticeable drawback was the lack of a balcony to sit out on and enjoy coffee in the mornings enjoying the mountain views  The pool area was nice but with the strong winds in the afternoon  umbrellas became quite unstable  The pool was quite cool  even though air temperature in the upper nineties  A car is definitely a must since you are located approximately six to seven miles from the strip  although the resort did offer transportation to and from the strip  One caveat if you utilize this transportation is that seating is limited on bus and first and last boarding came be filled over capacity  There is a grocery store about a mile north of the resort  and food prices are decent  The resort did a good job at scheduling tours and events on and off the strip  but due to the lack of help  gives you time if crowds are large  The South Coast Casino next door is open and new  It sports a large bowling alley and a fairly open casino that wasn t overly crowded and smoky even during peak weekend hours  I would definitely recommend this resort to others and will visit again myself  
P => Beautiful but noisy  The Grandview is beautiful  We stayed in a   bedroom lockout unit which gave us two one bedroom units each with its own kitchen  jacuzzi  washer  amp  dryer and living room  The      sq feet for the two rooms was more than enough The furniture and decor is gorgeous and perfectly fitting to the desert location  There are tile floors and area rugs in the living room and dining room while the bedroom has wall to wall carpet  The jacuzzi tubs could easily fit two people The pools were simply beautiful  There were two pools and one large jacuzzi  One of the pools has a free form rock formation complete with waterfall  Music is piped into the pool area adding to the peaceful environment We requested a handicapped room at time of booking but even though they had it in the notes they had not saved one for us  We checked in on Sunday and had to wait until Tuesday to get the handicapped room  That was both inconvenient and hard on our handicapped person  The day we switched rooms they tried to get us to vacate the room we were in before the other one was ready  We  of course  refused While there is no on site restaurant  the South Coast Casino is next door and has several restaurants including a breakfast at the cafe for less than two bucks if you go before   a m  The location is   miles from the start of the mega resorts on the strip  They offer a free shuttle but if you don t mind driving a rental car it seems to be a better option since valet parking is free at every hotel  However  beware that you may have to park very far away from your building s entrance  not good for if you returning late at night   The parking lot design was not done very wisely and handicapped parking is very limited The insulation between the rooms does not seem to exist  You can hear everything  Thanks to reading previous reviews some of our party came prepared with enough ear plugs for the entire party  It really was weird how loud everything was at this property The decor is and layout is very upscale  The noise  if you are prepared  is easily managed  Even with the negatives  we really enjoyed our stay here and would come again  
P => Great Experience We did an exchange and felt the accommodations at the Grandview were excellent  We had a spacious room with a nice jacuzzi right off the bed room  The kitchen and dining areas were a nice size  The room we stayed was at the Lilly building  I believe we were the first guests in the room  This was the first time we didn t rent a car  I m glad we didn t  Driving in Las Vegas especially along the strip is impossible  The resort provides a free shuttle every     hour and every hour in the evening to and from the Tropicana  There is also a trolley       From the Tropicana you can take the Duce  double decker buses  for     or    for    hours  The bus will take you up to Fremont Street and if you are in Las Vegas you have to see Fremont Street  A   mile cab trip from the airport is about      forget about getting around using a cab  The South Coast Casino is right next door  The food there is so reasonable we didn t even do any grocery shopping  also opened       It was too cold to use the pools but some people braved the cold and use the hot tubs  On site deli is convenient for some room supplies  I would recommend the Grandview  presently it is off the strip but with all the construction that soon will not be the case  
P =>  Absolutely outstanding My husband and I stayed at the Grandview the first week of        We are owners  This was our first trip there  The staff was very professional and very friendly  The units were immaculate  A nice quiet place to stay  You do not need a car  You can take a taxi to and from the airport  The Grandview has a free shuttle to town every hour  until  am  It takes less than    minutes to go from the Grandview to town  The shuttle leaves you off at the Tropicana  From there you can catch the bus for    that takes you anywhere down the strip  Or you can cross the street and get on the monarail  We preferred walking  We were told that the shuttle back to the hotel at   pm can be full  One person from each unit can sign up to go to the grocery store  This shuttle leaves from Grandview every day at      oclock  The grocery store is   minutes away The best part about the Grandview is the amazing Casino that opened up next door called South Coast  Look it up on the internet  It is right next door  We can t say enough about staying about     feet from a beautiful hotel casino  It has several restaurants  It is bigger than the Showboat casino in Atlantic City  What a great time  
P => Pros and Cons The resort itself is very nice  Clean and extremeply spacious  More like an apartment than a room  arate baster bedroom with jacuzzi  large bath  and full kitchen  Washer  dryer  dishwasher  all the amenities       Pool area clean and spacious  fitness facility  game room okay No on site restaurants  but the South Coast Casino with restaurants  etc   even Starbucks is a minute walking Definitely need to rent a car  Not close to anything yet  Transportation is sporatic  so do the rental Staff was courteous although we had to beg for a phone book   we were told  quot you people steal them quot   Whoever  quot you people are quot   I have no need for it unless I m there Four hours for pizza delivery  that was not a faux paux FOUR HOURS  The only real irritating things are there is not enough parking  Had to park two buildings over and this wasn t even the really busy season Shlepping groceries for a block or two gets tiring    And at   AM  if your neighbor anywhere around you decides to shower  this is Vegas ya know    AM is early   or go to the bathroom at   AM  you hear the water running   and LOUD   no insulation  So bring your earplugs Otherwise  kudos    Would recommend  Also  great for those with kids    
P =>  Superbowl every year   My husband and I and several of our closets friends have gone to the Grandview for the last   years  for our annual Superbowl Party  We love it  The rooms are perfect for a get together with several people  We usually get a   bedrm condo  which is really   one bedrooms  And with the new casino accross the Parking lot it will be even more convient  We like being off the strip  but a rental car is recommended  We have never had a problem and will be there again this year  
P =>  Top class time share  but please remove sales animals and give decent internet  We really enjoyed our stay at the Grand View over New Year s Eve  Vegas was very windy over this period  which got better when we moved to another location later in the week  so we couldn t make use of pool but it looked great  Pros  Very nice resort and the arrangement of units sleeping   that can be joined for   works extremely well  The gym was very adequate with good quality equipment  Local supermarket also handy  We couldn t experience the activities as they were closed during the New Year period but they had this great clown come in who did the most amazing balloon art and kept kids and adults enthralled for a couple of hours  Cons  Definitely need transport   not as close to Vegas Strip as it seems  yes  its on the strip but about a    minute drive from the main attractions  even if using the new Deuce bus  The main desk staff were not very good or helpful  We were quite frustated at their responses and lack of helpfulness  They really need some training to represent their resort well   there are about    people all standing at the desks but they just look at you blankly and if you go to one of them   they direct you to somebody else  Also   the constant flow of sales people showing people around does make you feel a bit like a guinea pig   they do need to make this less obvious to people who have either already purchased or are staying on an exchange as this does spoil the experience and will go on for along time given the large expansion plans    more buildings short term to    long term   The worst   which I say to all of these timeshare resorts   is please catch up with the times and provide decent internet services  The tiny  overheated internet room in the main building was constantly full and very uncomfortable to work in  At the very least   they should provide a wireless network for the main building so people can sit comfortably if they have their own computers but for such a new resort that is still being constructed   why don t they provide fast internet to the rooms  even at a cost  so people can be with their friends families even if they do need to do some work on vacation  This is something that needs to be addressed by all RCI resorts AND QUICKLY  Why a resort like this would be constructed without this capability just baffles me  
P =>  A Great Time We had a wonderful time  When we purchased our unit  we had no idea if the pictures would live up to the actual  We were more than thrilled and completely enjoyed our accomodations  I personally loved the tub  what a relaxing way to the end the day  This is a little paradise for my husband and I  This is our reward for working hard all year long  They were outfitted  with all the things we needed  If we had a service problem  there was no problem getting the help we needed  If there was a negative it would be these things  I will not attend another sales meeting again  this was on the sunniest day that we had there   It rained     of the time of our visit   A record breaker for the area  This year we plan to drive there over a week and stay  There is so much to see a do  that I cannot see the time going slowly  We are excited to see the new Casino across the road  and ultimately the new mall that will be built I felt the service staff at the front desk were helpful and responsive to our needs  And I imagine over the years we will make good friends Little Town Ontario  Canada 
P => Another RCI Gem   The first thing I have to say is I wondered if I stayed at the same place as the people who wrote negative reviews about the Grandview  I just gor back from a   night stay  I own a time share from RCI and I was lucky enough that RCI has space here  This place was excellent   Allow me to break it down in categories Check In  The check in was fast  no lines  and dont beleive the feedback about them hounding you  Nobody tryed to sell us anything  The first line they check you in  then they direct you to a line where you receive your welcome stuff and parking pass  I checked in on a Saturday at      p m   Early  and was in my room by      p m Rooms  We had a   bedroom unit  this was like no other   bedroom timeshare  allow me to explain  There is   door that opens to a foyer then there are   doors in the foyer  Each room has it s own kitchen  dining room  master bedroom  living room  huge bathroom  and a jacuzzi   Usually a   bedroom at other timeshares have   kitchen and   bedrooms in   room  this was a great suprise Amenities  The activities at the resort are not that good  then again I stayed there in ember which is a slow season  I m sure they have more stuff in the prime season  There is   beautiful pools with waterfalls  and hot tubs outside  The exercise room was ok  There was   treadmills and   bikes and   ellepitcal machines  There was also weights and other equipment  Here is a tip  if you are serious about your workout use the treadmill next to the scale that is the only treadmill calibrated to correct speeds Location  The resort is at the end of the strip  we had a rental car  Recommended   but the resort does have a free shuttle which brings you to the action  It is about   miles to the Mandalay Bay  If you have never been to Vegas  Mandalay Bay is at the top of the strip  Even though it wwas   miles it was a easy   miles as the road is     lanes and no heavy traffic  Here is a tip  As you may or may not know you could walk faster than the cars move on the strip   lol  serious though   Park you car at one of the first hotels you come to  like MGM Grand  New york New York  etc  From there you can either walk  take trams  or the monorail  bus etc  That way you are not stuck in traffic and it is faster to get back to resort Finally  dont beleive the negative reviews you read  this place is spotless  totally clean you will love it   If you have any questions please email me I would love to answer them  
P => Absolutely devine  We will be staying again in        We are owners and after having stayed in many LV hotels  Excaliber among them  we are just amazed at the helpful staff and perfect rooms  The staff even had some wonderful suggestions regarding ethnic food stores we were searching for   We were provided with plenty of linens and towels and even some coffee  tea and detergent We heard NO construction while there yet there was construction on site and next door with the new casino going up  Although the hotel is far down the strip there was shuttle service provided  They should be using the larger bus at all times as some people would get left behind  This did not happen to us  but I could see where this would raise someone s ire  They are even really good about having children s activities which is quite generous as children should be a big no no with all of the adult vendors and people handing out material EVERYWHERE on the strip  Las Vegas is great for couples and groups but not very child friendly  I just cannot say enough great things about this place  
P =>  Grandview is Just Fine The Grandview is right next to the South Coast Hotel and Casino which is opening uary       This will make it an absolutely perfect location  We had no problems at this hotel  The staff was friendly  the rooms were spacious  we were in one bedroom lockout unit and clean  We needed more clean towels and called twice to housekeeping  They did not respond so we called the front desk and told them we d be there in five minutes to pick up our towels  Within two minutes housekeeping knocked on our door to deliver the towels The pool area is very nice and there is a small  but adequate exercise room  I would absolutely go back  I ve stayed on the strip several times and was more than happy to not be in the traffic and noise  
P =>  The Good and Bad We are owners here at the Resort and had our first stay at the Grandview  Everything was really clean  spacious and nice  They have a few activities for kids and family such as Craft time  ceramics  magic show  balloon artist  movie night and a hot dog sale of course for a small fee  they also have free movie rentals  small collection   a internet room that kids mostly occupied  and wouldn t let working adults use to catch up on their jobs or school  I couldn t believe that they let these kids sit there and play solitare and go to kid websites and just mess around  maybe they should have the computers for kids in the activities room  It s nicely equipped with towels  coffee maker  toaster  dishwasher  that         wahser and dryer  I liked alot   pots and pans  cheap ones   utensils  plates  cups for    nice big tv in the living room  a smaller one for the room  spa tub  big shower  his and hers sinks in bathroom  nice decorations and a cheap venting system  When we made food the smell would stay in the little entrance way that leads you to the two doors  It was gross  All the sales people walking around is very annoying  They should do something about that  It didn t bother me at first but then we were trying to BBQ outside and every salesperson that passed by at to show off that we were BBQ ing and we felt like guniea pigs and part of the show to sell a timeshare  Then my husband started to get really annoyed with them and would just give them no response cause they were interferring in our family time  And everytime we ran into a salesperson and people they would ask if we were owners and try to  quot sell quot  these people  We also went to a timeshare presentation for some free Shark Reef tickets and the man was really nice in the beginning and was full of compliments and before you know it when we were saying no that we didn t want anything he had a fit and started acting really dumb with us  The resort would be      better if those snakes of sales people would be off the premises  I had a really positive experience with the workers till the day before we left I went up to a housekeeping lady and asked her for some trash bags and she gave me attitude  She rolled her eyes and made a grunting noise  She runied my whole day  then later my family member went to ask for towels and she did the same to him  I didn t want trouble so I didn t say anything back to her  Now that I think about it  I should have reported her  I never heard construction work going on and maybe on our  rd day there a construction worker fell off a scafle  spelling   and died  That was really horrible  Also the exit of the resort going towards the strip is very dangerous  we almost got hit   times trying to exit and we seen about   accidents at that corner while there  The cars speed up when they see you trying to pass and that is very dangerous  It s really far from the strip and they have a shuttle that will take you every     hour but we couldn t use it cause it wasn t kid friendly   can you believe they said I would have to take my daughters carseat with me to the strip if I wanted her to ride  I don t understand why they couldn t hold it in the back of the shuttle  or have a time when they would do that  you know maybe in the day and in the evenings maybe save the shuttle for adults  you know anything would work  Theres a Food   Less down the street and very close  a resturant across the street and lots of little shops and fast food joints on the way to the strip  
P =>  Great Rooms  We used an RCI bonus week for this vacation and had a great time  Our room     B Sage building was one of the nicest we ve ever had  For those of you who want to be pampered   this is NOT an all inclusive type of facility as there is no restaurant  no casino  very few activities  the lobby is fairly sparse and so are the hallways leading to the room but once you get there   wow  Very large  nice apartment style room with jacuzzi  large bathroom  dining room table  living room with pull out couch  FULL kitchen and master bedroom with a very comfortable king sized bed  I have read a couple of negative reviews about the rooms and I honestly wonder if they actually stayed at the same place as we did The lack of a restaurant was no not a problem because the restaurant bar directly across the street has GREAT food  breakfast lunch and dinner   try the Fortattas for breakfast Regarding the room service   they usually clean the rooms once a week which was fine with us  On check in  they provided us with plenty of towels and linens  I have  however  read some reviews that complained about getting more towels service  What whiners  There was a maid cart  full of towels  soap  laundry detergent etc   parked in our hallway near the elevator and we just helped ourselves to what we needed whenever we need it  It was fine  No problems This is a very quiet  comfortable place to stay  a few miles south of all the Strip action  I recommend you do what we did   rent a car and drive to the action spots on the strip  All of the big Hotel Casinos  we visited      have free self parking garages  Also it is handy to park by a monorail station and ride it up and down the strip to save walking  it s NOT free  The new  very large  SouthCoast Hotel Casino is being built right next door  we heard NO contruction noise   It s almost finished and should be done next year  It looks very nice and will provide more action right next door  
P =>  Nothing grand about the Grandviiew What a disapointment this hotel is  While the rooms are small but pretty  the staff and the services are just terrible  As an example  when we checked in  it was a    minute procedure  No line  as we checked in late  But the staff people are so slow  so uncaring about the guest  they just drag the whole thing on  You must go to a second line for the  quot parking pass quot  which is issued at the hotel s guest services desk  where they try to sell you show tickets or timeshare sales  After getting our room key and hauling luggage to the tenth floor  we found that another family  upset at our interruption  already had the room occupied  What an embarrasment  for us and for them  It took the hotel staff forever to fix this  while we are out in the hallway waiting  The promised  quot grand view quot  didn t appear at the Grandview  We saw a parking lot and a lot of dirt  this is as far out as you can get from the strip  although on the same road  All in all  we d call this place another RCI disaster  RCI has this habit of high rating places like this which are good at selling RCI memberships    but the quality of the experience is VERY poor  My advice   avoid the Grandview if at all possible  We left word about our check in experience with the front desk manager  the GM  but she didn t even bother to call us back  We left after two nights  leaving our other pre paid five nights to go to waste  What a Grand Disappointment  
P =>  Great Place To Stay The GrandView was a great place to stay  Our trip was from           got a great deal at an auction site for    plus taxes for the week  Stayed in the PrimRose Building  th floor  be careful on the bottom floors lots of crikets and i saw a small snake in the exercise room  The only complaint i would have is the hot water heater in the room was very noisy  sounded like running water next door  But i will stay there again    
P =>  New Construction   Early Wake Up Call We arived   days late and checked out a day early with no problems  It was a timeshare swap and we felt that we were given one of the less desirable rooms facing the new construction because of that  Make sure you ask in advance where the room is located Construction begins at      AM and is not great for a Vegas resort where nightlife surrounds you  The resort is beautiful as are the   pools  You need to rent a car to get there and get around when and where you want to  
P => Love it love it love it      My sister and I stayed at the Grandview e  rd through the  th  This hotel was spactacular   Itwas so nice   it had a full kitchen with dishes full dining room      tv in front room    it just goes on and on    we will be staying here again soon   
P => Excellent Accommodation Check in was fast and informative but we were a bit disappointed that there were no bellmen to assist with bags  We had suitcases and golf clubs that we had to drag to our building  Luckily it wasn t too far away We were very impressed with our   bedroom suite  It was very spacious and tastefully decorated  The jaccuzzi next to the bed was great This hotel is perfect if you are looking for a  homely quot  type hotel  With no restaurant expect to eat out or prepare your own meals  It is far enough from the strip that you can get some peace and quite  The shuttle is available if you want to go to the strip The construction was not a problem  When is hotel is fully completed it will be fantastic  We ll definitely be back   just for the room P S If you need a cab call at least half an hour ahead  They are very slow in getting there  
P =>  Give this one more time to get settled    Grandview is a nice hotel  but too far off the strip  It s under construction for a long time to come  so it s quite noisy  Expect noise to wake you Mon Fri at  am each day  There is very little nearby   a car is a must  as the small shuttle cannot handle the demand  Service is mediocre  at best  Front desk personnel are not well trained yet  Expect constant push to view their time shares  in exchange for gifts   Elevators are slow  so expect a wait  Nice rooms   new hotel  nicely decorated  Small fitness center  Good sized pool area  No snack bar on site  so you drive for all your restaurant meals  Grocery store and Outlet Mall nearby  There is a hotel casino under construction next door  to be completed in Spring       I expect the ammenities of the casino  food  gambling  fun  and reduced construction at that time  will make this a nicer destination for Las Vegas  
P =>  Great Place but a little noisey Stayed here for   nights at the beginning of        Absolutely great rooms with a large kitchen  King size bed  huge bathroom and large TV in living room  All I can say  is I would highly recommend this place if you are going to Vegas for   or more nights and if you have a rental car  It is located just down from the Strip  but parking is free at all the hotels  Nice place to relax  they have a great little pool area Only warning  make sure you get a room facing the pool area  otherwise you will be woken up in the mornings at about      AM by construction noise from the new building  A great place to stay if you are going to be in Vegas for a week  like living in a beautiful new condo

P => absolutely acceptable I recently stayed at the hotel for five days nights  I required a hotel that was convenient to the convention centre and the strip  and a place to lay my head  Greek Isles fitted these requirements The room was clean  the sheets were clean  the tv worked and the door locked  The staff were friendly and very helpful   I had a number of questions throughout the week to which they responded happily Breakfast in the restaurant was excellent and the beer and a tequila  for medicinal purposes only  at the end of the day were cold and within budget served by a friendly bar keeper Greek Isles is a good  quot working class quot  hotel  working class   the backbone of the nation  and I would stay there again  
P =>   RUDE EMPLOYEE The cashier in the casino who is working right now is the rudest employee I have ever seen  She is in her Mid Fourties  baly died red hair  skinny  ect  I played Video Blackjack right next to the cage  The machine was giving me nothing but losers     in a row     in a row  ect  I kept saying in a low voice to myself  quot you have gotta be kidding me quot  and counting out loud the exact amount of hands lost in a row  Never once did i cuss  She then came over and rudely yelled at me saying if i didnt like how the machine was i could get the hell out of her casino  And yelled at me to stop cussing  Now I never once used a cuss word  SO she was hearing things  Now I am a regular who is in there   times a week  playing between     and      at a time  I do not feel I should be yelled at by an employee  In this economy you should value every single customer  Since she was so rude I am now no longer be playing any of GREEK ISLES or UNITED COIN S companies machines  or staying in their hotel  With Regards Joseph Wells            pm 
P =>   Suited my needs  Until I actually have money to blow at a fancy hotel casino  I just wanted something close to the convention cnter where I was headed  and CHEAP  This hotel was so inexpensive mid week compared to neighboring hotels  as in half the price  that I was scared about what I was getting myself into  Surprisingly I found an older  but renovated  well loved and clean hotel  The room on the tenth floor had all the usual amenities and a very large window with a view facing north  The bed  the carpet  the drapes  the bathroom  all were near new and I found no reason to complain  Small outdoor pool is open    hours and there is a cardio weight room on the second floor  Also there is a restaurant  casino  and in house magic fire show  none of which I saw   The desk staff can be a bit dingy  but for the price I was willing to put up with that  One ding worth mentioning is lack of FREE wireless internet    it costs     day Would definitely return  and definitely made my friends jealous when I told them about my find  
P =>   Not that luxury but very good choice Las Vegas is the city of lights and luxurious hotels  This isn t so luxurious but it has all you need for a pleasant stay  The only complaint is the distance from the strip  which may be covered in about    minutes with a walk  Rooms are very big and clean  with all the facilities you may expect  There s a big parking all around the hotel and an external swimming pool  Breakfast may be booked for few dollars  There are   pc each floor for the internet connection but at first floor they were quite old and sluggish  
P =>  Outstanding Value Outstanding Customer Service Had a great stay at this hotel  The staff very friendly  rooms look as though they have been refurbished  very comfy beds  location perfect for me  coffee in rooms  refridge in room  large open spacious room  pool very quiet  no long check in lines  just off strip  excellent value for price of rooms  I will return and I will tell friends about the value and great customer service I received  
P =>   Filthy timewarp    This hotel is ABSOLUTELY VILE        The reception smells  the lift walls are carpeted and are stinking and filthy  the walls in the corridor are dark orange and layered in dirt    The floor carpets both in the corridor and rooms are heavily stained    My room  which was apparently a imeshare deluxe room  ha ha ha ha     could have been in the    s maybe     was old fashioned and seriously rundown  There was heavily stained carpets  chairs and curtains  Peeling wood on cabinets and mould in the bathroom I didn t dare take my sandals off when walking around the room    A few of my colleagues had cockroaches in their rooms  I had to wipe my feet on the way out of this hotel       The people who frequent this hotel look like they are stuck in a time warp  It s all very strange    The place needs knocking down                                        I wouldn t stay here again if someone paid me                            
P =>  Newly remodeled I was very impressed with the friendly service I received while staying here  The rooms were clean and they appeared remodeled  It was a great price for the rooms and I would stay there again  
P =>  The food in the restaurant was great  It is a bit run down  but the folks who work there along with the quality of the food in the restaurant make this place worth visiting for lunch or dinner  If you want authentic greek food  they have it  
P =>  HORRIBLE TACKY DUMP DIVE MOTEL    But Rat Pack Show was GREAT  I give the Show a   star and this hotel a   The show at the Greek Isles Hotel The Rat Pack Is Back tribute show to Frank Sinatra  Dean tin   Sammy Davis Jr  amp  Joey Bishop was great   But overlook the hotel it s located in  The Greek Isles Hotel  this place is a run down DIVE  We went to the hotel before the show  they tell you to come   hours early  and the only reason I think is so they can get more money from your being bored waiting around for the show I wouldnt give them another dime as they dont take the money to help out the hotel  We saw the place from outside and almost left     it was just an old dump  Not even old Vegas style place  like run down in need of dire repair  refurbishment  take down the cheap dollar store decor  paint it I could go on      This place is sad and i mean it  The casino  very sad  depressing and even being old  its sad  not old Vegas     just run down sad  amp  depressing I told my husband while in line  a few buckets of paid and removing ALL the tacky unnecessary decor in the line area and casino would do this place wonders  Its seriously a white trash motel  The casino is a joke  its like someone set up a casino in the garage of grandmas house  If your going to only wash up in your room and leave to go to the glitzy other places for the same money  fine  if thats your thing  People  this isnt Old Vegas appeal        this is old as in seriously sad run down  the owner not giving his hotel a facelift or even a good cleaning  It s a joke  you can stay so many other places for the same price if you look for deals or just a few bucks more or maybe you like this kind of place  but seriously  its like an old tacky Motel   out on an abandoned highway as you drive thru a small deserted town across the country  thats the best description I can give it  No charm to it  just a run down dump Its also located in a deserted  construction zone  seedy part of town near NOTHING  The dinner was weird for the dinner show  we were seated with another couple we didn t know at the same table and there was plenty of tables so our romantic dinner wasnt so much and the food was mediocre and don t dare ask for extra bread  Old plastic table cloths  plastic cups and saucers with no coffee cups Christmas time when we went so there was      strings of lights that were falling down because the thumbtacks had fallen out that were used to keep them up  and      plastic gold garland around the casino that was falling off  Outside icecycle lights hanging in the brightly lit casino      Come on guys  seriosuly  this was bad Chicken  Steak or   other dish is your choice  PERIOD  It was about the quality of a cheap buffet in old Vegas but only   small serving  Salad dressing out of plastic containers      just tacky and cheap  We overpaid for the dinner part BIGTIME Long waits for water  you must ask to get water to begin with  and all your drinks  like soda  amp  iced tea  except coffee are extra paid thru the waitress who doubles from the casino bar who has holes in her old worn dress thats   sizes too small for her  But                DO go for the show  The Rat Pack is Back      it is amazing  These guys sound just like the real thing  the show was funny and well put together  the showroom its in has old Vegas style and the entertainment quality was a     We are in our young    s and this was a great show  even for nightclub goers We bought dinner  amp  show combo tickets  i do not recommend this at all           just go for the show  period  Someone please move this great show to a nice hotel so it s an all around great experience  I cannot say enough about the show It needs a shiny new Old Vegas Style theatre in a nice hotel on the strip to showcase the entertainers talents  relive the Rat Pack Shows and so your not dreading leaving the way you came in thru this old hotel  The Greek Isles which is in dire need of being torn down  Even the performers managed to crack a few jokes in the show about how bad the hotel was and how they know they have a good show which keeps the place afloat  which made the whole room laugh  Please someone move this show to a better place Plan on waiting for a cab  they dont go to this hotel often   Most cab drivers dint even know where it was  ours had to ask   others who didnt know either  When we finally got directions  the person who gave them laughed and looked at us like  quot are you really going to that hotel  quot BUT DO GO FOR THE SHOW      
P =>   You want basics this is the place  This is a no frills  basic hotel  From the outside it looks a bit rundown  but once you get to your room  it is rundown  From the faded carpets  to the    s decor  If they renovated the rooms  this could be a great place  But if you need a place to sleep and wash up and no real frills  this is it The locations is decent and you have a    hour Wal Greens and      nearby  which is handy  
P =>   Basic but acceptable I have just returned from   days in the Greek Isles Hotel  or at night it could be called  quot The Greek   les quot  or  quot The Greek Is    quot  depending on which side of the sign your looking at    Having said that the hotel provided a basic but acceptable level of accommodation I really can t say if it was good value for money as I was staying with a friend who s cabin crew  and they don t pay for their hotels  but I got the impression that many airlines use the hotel for crew as very often you passed crew  Delta  MyTravel  bmi  United in the corridors   lifts of the hotel Location wise  its not in a bad position  just down the road is Wallgreens  and Strip Liquour  Dennys       etc    and on the other side is the Monorail and Hilton Hotel     I ve previously stayed at Treasure Island  and I loved that  and given a choice I d go back to Ti anytime  but if the Greek Isles was available  and cheap  i d have no real issues recommending it as a bed and bath service only    Hope this helps   
P =>   It s not all bad    I think this property is being renovated because things were pretty new in our room  the bed was plush and soft  the carpet was new  actually it looked like the whole room had been gutted and re done to be a more pleasing stay  Because looking at it from the outside it looks kind of like a dump  And it looked as if the whole hotel was being updated inside  Our room had a small refrigerator  coffee maker and had plenty of channels to watch on the t v if you need that  I did not check out the restraunts or the shows  But our stay was comfortable and pleasant  
P =>  Rat Pack Was Fun but      Like several other posters I did not stay at the hotel but went for the Rat Pack show  The show is great  capturing the flavor of the older Vegas era  A treat for us nostalgic folks  But it was hard to get any information beforehand and I was told to arrive at a certain time for seating  which didn t happen so I stood in line for an hour  When guests were admitted all the guests who had come for the dinner show had nice seats  I was placed in a seat where I could see nothing at all  Nothing  By craning my neck I was able to capture bits and pieces of the show  So a warning about the Rat Pack show  Be sure you are not placed at one of the long tables in the middle that are like a school cafeteria  I am not sure why the management thinks this is OK  
P =>  I love the Greek Isles    I love the Greek Isles Hotel  We stay here just about every year  We choose to stay here because the strip is a little too crowded for us  quot old ladies quot  who just want some together time to sit and watch a great lounge show   too bad that Steven David is no longer there   he was wonderful  Yanni s restaurant is Wonderful  The staff is fantastic  Yes  it could use some refurbishing  but you can overlook that by the fact that the staff seems to stay  and they tend to remember you from year to year   at least they remember us  It s nice  quiet  safe  comfortable  and it is still within walking distance of the strip  We enjoy the best of both worlds when we stay here  We will always return  Thank you and keep up the good work  
P => Its a dump and a ripoff This place is a dump and has probably never been done up since day one Didn t stay here but went to the Tribute showShow was brilliant butRipped off on the VIP tickets   no food   bad seatsHotel didn t want to know and gave out a telephone number that just rings Toilets were foulShow staff were rude and uninterested   got scalped for another     a head to get better seatsNo taxis and no way of getting themKaroke staff was hustling people leaving show to stay for   for   drinksDrinks served with no glassesCarpets and walls dirtyWhole place stankPlease blow it up next 
P =>  You get what you pay for We stayed here in ember       yes its not art deco  it could do with some refurbishment  its not  on the strip  but at the end of the day you get what you pay for The staff were lovely and in my book that counts for a lot  
P =>  enjoyed the Greek Isles both times   We were lucky enough to stay at the Greek Isles because my in laws own a time share there  The people are friendly enough  The room fits up to   people quite comfortably  There is a large bed and a pull out queen sofa and the room is considered a suite due to the beautiful curtain that can be used to separate the room  Everything was clean  And I am pretty picky when it comes to cleanliness  The only thing I would like to mention is the first visit we used room service for a burger and fries and it was way too expensive    My second visit I made       on the    cent Wheel of fortune  I like it because the casino is more quaint and small  Hope this helps  
P =>  Haunted Vegas Tour My sister and I went on the Haunted Vegas Tour and the show called Shock at the Greek Isles Casino on         The Greek Isles Casino is a very seedy place  We had to get ourselves there for     PM to take the tour  The tour around Las Vegas was okay but the show after and the casino were both creepy  We go to Las Vegas all the time but we will never go near this casino again  
P => not so good      The hotel was in an awful area  and the outside looked even worse  Very disappointed  but the chapel is pretty       
P =>  Very Nice Hotel A pretty good hotel  The room was very nice for a hotel close to the strip  one block from the Stardust   We paid      for a Friday night and got   double beds  a living room with sofa  table and chairs  an armior with a tv  microwave oven and small fridge  The TV gets at least         channels  though your probably not there to watch TV  but if you do want to vegetate in the room for one evening its nice to have TV cable that comes in clear and gets more than   channels  which happened to us in another Vegas hotel   This room would pass for a mini suite in any of the hotels on the strip and probably cost twice as much  The lobby was not very classy but check in was a breeze  I ve read about the strip hotels taking   hour to check in because of the crowds   The casino is very small and smoky  All they have are slots Don t order room service here  We got a burger and fries and they charged     You could almost get a buffet at the Stardust for that  The breakfast was very good  I had an omelet that took up half the plate and came with home fries that took up the other half  plus two slices of toast  That ran    They have several small shows in their nonsmoking show room  We went to see Sixtiesmania  If you re a baby boomer and grew up with the Beatles  Stones  CCR  Doors and others  you ll enjoy this       hr  show All in all not bad  Only thing I would recommend is that they have a weekly rate  since most people who come there are usually there for a week  There are a few hotels nearby  Somerset House and Blair House Suites that do offer weekly rates   Most Vegas hotels only offer Sunday to Thursday low rates

P =>  Nice  A few days in Vegas with my mother and father in tow saw us select the Hilton Grand Vacation Club at The Hilton  We d stayed at The Hilton before  but rooms were better value at the HGVC so we booked there The room was nice   a king suite  with mother and father occupying the master  and me the sofa bed  The sofa bed was just fine  but the hotel staff do nothing to help you set it up  and there are one or two sharp corners on the frame of the sofa bed  which drew blood  But it was comfortable enough once set up The master also featured a spa tub  and a seperate bathroom had a shower and twin wash basins  A ful kitchen was set aside from the lounge area  which had a flat screen TV  the master had an older traditional television  All was clean and the room was serviced daily to an acceptable standard The hotel also features a small health club and pool  Despite being ember  I was able to swim daily in a nicely warmed pool  I did not venture into the gym Location wise  the facility is adjacent to the Las Vegas Hilton and room charging is possible from that property  Set back from the strip  a car is essential  but that isn t a big deal Friendly staff make this a property I would definitely recommend and return too 
P =>   Great property   timeshare swap Once again we chose this swap based on reviews here and a previous stay at another HGVC  It is a very clean and tidy property although our room was only cleaned once in the week  The room was very spacious and had a well equipped kitchen   the free inroom wireless internet was a little lethargic  The shop was well stocked and did fresh rolls  wraps  salads and sweets each day   with very helpful and friendly staff as were all we had dealings with  The reception and concierge were particularly helpful This is a quiet hotel but is adjacent to the main Hilton which is fully equipped with casino and many restaurants   inc an outstanding buffet and has headliner acts  If you are a Star Trek fan please be aware the Star Trek experience closed permanently from t       The pool was quite small but adequate and has a large jacuzzi and towels are provided The hotel is a little walk from the main strip   but you need to walk off all that great food     
P =>   First class customers service and an enjoyable stay  We were relocated to the Hilton Grand Vacations Club  HGVC  at very short notice  We were due to spend our honeymoon at the Meridian Luxury Suites  but found out  via a review on this website      the evening before our wedding that they had closed down  Meridian didn t even have the decency to inform the travel agent   Anyway      the HGVC more than made up for the Meridian s shortfall     We received a warm welcome from Jodi on the Front Desk  who provided us with some much needed essentials after one of our cases went missing The rooms are spacious and well equiped   definately a  home from home    washer  dryer  oven  microwave  large fridge freezer  coffee maker  blender  hairdryer  spa bath  large tv in lounge and bedroom  and best of all    free wireless internet connection  Complimentary sachets of the following replaced daily   shampoo  conditioner  body wash  soap  starbucks coffee  washing powder  washing up liquid  On day one we thought we had a problem with the water temperature  An engineer was knocking on the door within   minutes of making the call  I simply hadn t run the tap long enough   Oops Alice and ian on the Front Desk made several phone calls on our behalf to locate our lost baggage  We can t thank Alice and ian enough for their help  The manager k is approachable and clearly places a great deal of importance on the wellbeing of guests  k was aware of the situation with our luggage and offered his personal support Blanca and the other Maids were very efficient and friendly  We returned to our room each day to find a wonderful towel creation   swans  dogs  birds etc etc The deli is open from early in the morning to   pm  They stock all the essentials plus a range of sandwiches  wraps and salads  plus cakes  muffins etc We never struggled to find a sunbed by the pool  Fresh clean towels are provided by the pool area  There is a bar beside the pool  and free use of barbeques The hotel is located off the stip   a positive or a negative depending on the purpose of your stay  We spent a lot of time on the stip so enjoyed the quieter side of the HGVC We would definately stay here again  Thank you to all at the HGVC  
P =>   Great but quiet If you are looking to escape the Strip and the sounds that come with it  this is the ideal hotel  It was very clean at an affordable price and a cab ride away from the Strip  I would recommend it for older people  
P =>  Good This hotel is clean  beatiful and excellent service  Las Vegas is for adults  Not recomend to bring childrens  
P =>   Great for Kids in Vegas Stayed for   nights in the middle of a road trip with the kids  More of a   bedroom apartment than a Hotle room  full kitchen  washer  dryer etc  Great pool  jacuzzi and free barbecues  Only on block off the strip and probably the only place in Vegas with no slot machines We absloutely loved it   
P =>   Excellent We have been in Las Vegas probably    or    times  I have personally stayed in almost every casino hotel of the city  We are a family of four  my sons are   and     My review for this property is just a word  EXCELLENT  The suites are cozy  very well dressed  it makes you feel even better than at home  The convenience of the washer dryer and full refrigerator and kitchenet is a major plus  I have been in other suites that has these conveniences  but here you do not really see them  they do not invade your space or make you feel like you have the kitchen in front of you  as other places  The whole resort is great  the pool  the gym  free very clean towels at the gym   and the deli market  The deli market has good prices and the sandwiches are just plain GREAT  fresh  and huge  Three of us actually ate only one sandwich  If you have a family  you can not be wrong by staying here  If you want to leave your children playing or seeing the TV     channels    you can go to the  quot quiet room quot  which is a huge lounge  very comfortable and cozy  
P =>  Another great HGVC experience Tucked away just off the strip  the Hilton Grand Vacation was a welcome change from the  quot cheap but charge for everything quot  Casinos that makes up much of Las Vegas s accomodation We had stayed in a Grand Vacations hotel in Orlando in      and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves so our expectations where high for the Las Vegas Grand Vacation     We booked a king suite and weren t dissapointed   For a start it was well appointed with a kitchen  laundry and spa bath as well as TVs in the lounge and bedroom  Features aside  the suite nicely decorated  comfy  tidy and above all else  roomy  Compared to our previous Las vegas accomodation who wanted to charge us an outragious amount of money for basics such as internet access  wireless was part of the service at the Grand vacation and the staff were also really nice Given it s close proximity to the strip and it s amenities I d strongly reccomend the Grand Vacation over Casino s in a flash  
P =>   loved this timeshare we stayed for   days and I loved this place no noise at night  no smoky smells  no overly crowded pool  I think I am getting old  I liked that you could get away from the strip in   minutes and get right back if you wanted to  The bathrooms were nice and we had a   bedroom    tvs and a full kitchen  We didnt find the deli horribly priced  expected to pay more for convenience  and the sandwiches and salads were good and fresh  the pool was a pleasure  plenty of places to sit  clean towels and very pleasant company  we had our grandkids there for   days  pool drinks a little pricy but the slushies were very tasty  elevators quick and the staff very nice  we had zero complaints  convenient parking  free  just across the driveway   mile from drugstores  supermarkets etc w o going to the strip  take a right on Karen down to yland Ave  Would love to stay here again 
P =>  Great Resort This was a timeshare exchange  We had a   bedroom suite for a girl s weekend  It was great  The room were spacious and the beds comfortable  We did not hear noise from any neighbors and we slept late because of our casino hopping  I was very impressed with how this resort was set up  Check in was easy and parking was a breeze  There was no high pressure sales pitch  They left a message on the phone but we were too busy making donations at the casinos to talk with them  No one ever ask us directly to attend a meeting  I really like this resort and would recommend it highly to anyone  The Hilton is less than a   minute walk and the monorail is right there  We had breakfast at the Paradise Cafe and the omelets were great  You can t eat in Vegas for under      even a sandwich and drink  but the Cafe was good and reasonable for Vegas  We had a great time and would go back in a heart beat  
P =>  Calm Nice and spacy rooms  Somewhat distant from action  The Monorail transport option helps though  Would prefer to go again when I retire  
P =>   Very nice for the price As many of the reviews have mentioned that this is a typical timeshare location and the staff are really nice  Parking is easy  check in was smooth  and the rooms are nice  We booked a studio on hilton com for      tax night on a weekend and we were given a   bedroom suite  which was quite nice  It has everything in it including laundry  whirlpool tub  and a flat screen tv There is a little store called the marketplace and it is really overpriced  but what hotel s store isn t anymore  The store has a large variety of food and non food items A nice thing about the location is that it is next door to the Hilton  so if you want a real restaurant  gym  or casino  it is right there  This was the first hotel we ve stayed at in Las Vegas that wasn t in a casino and it was actually quite pleasant to not have to walk through the noise and the smoke before getting to the room  But it is not the typical Las Vegas experience  If you are looking for that  this is not the place for you  However  this location tends to have quite inexpensive rates  
P =>  Great Service I didn t stay at the hotel because my friends booked the wrong hotel  But the registration manager went out of his way to call the other property and got us a room for the same price  for a hotel with better location  It was so nice for him to do that  I will highly recommend this hotel  
P =>   A timeshare property It s a timeshare property  but that just means that you may get a suite w kitchenette  wash machine  amp  dryer  amp  a full sized fridge for the price of a nice hotel room   On this particular trip we stayed in a studio  which is pretty comparable to any standard hotel room  My wife  amp  I are big fans of packing our own beverages and snacks whenever we stay at a hotel   and although the studio suite only came with a refridgerator and microwave   it was still very convienient The hotel is a short walk from the Hilton Hotel Casino  and if you re there to gamble you only need to make that walk once a day  because the monorail is right next to the entrance to the Hilton  A    hour pass on the monorail is    and it takes you to a dozen casinos  The first night we rode all the way to the end of the line and then worked our way back   and just scratched the surface  Between the monorail and a couple of taxi rides  the Wynn looked like it was too far to walk to  we felt very satisfied with both our location and our transportation solutions The hotel property was clean and well appointed  if not spectacular  There is an onsite coffee shop deli convenience store  What most impressed us was how friendly each and every one of the hotel staff we interacted with were  Good job on that  We did eat one meal at the adjacent Hilton Hotel Paradise Cafe  and it was a good  reasonably priced meal  breakfast  We had also recently stayed at a timeshare property in Scottsdale for a Christmas party and loved our room there too  We re definately going to add timeshares as a  quot good value quot  when looking for hotel rooms in the future  
P =>  Good for business Stayed here for a conference at the Hilton Convention Center  It was extremely convenient to stay at the same place as the conference  The hotel was nice  the casino was considerably smaller than the others  but was very luxurious   with crystal chandeliers and all The hotel has several restaurants to choose from  Paradise Cafe was great for a lunch  the Buffet was decent and included wine and beer  Quark s Bar was really fun and had great drinks  but the Chinese restaurant was absolutely fabulous We enjoyed the room  unfortunately  we were in an older room that had not yet been renovated  The room was still spacious and clean and the bed was very comfortable  We did have issues with the hot water when taking morning showers   I guess because so many people were going to the conference early in the morning Having the monorail station there was great and it is truly the best way to get around Las Vegas   especially since the Hilton is so far from the strip We did go see a concert in the theatre  not Barry Manilow  but another headliner  and the theatre was very nice  but could definitely use some updates I would consider staying here again  but  next time  we will stay on the strip  
P =>   Reasonable Hotel if You Want Quiet We are members of the Hilton Club and stayed here while attending a conference at the Convention Center  We had a   bedroom suite  The overall room was great and the small kitchen was reasonably well appointed  fine for making breakfast  wouldn t want to make a meal here   The facility has a pool  a food store  and a very small gym    stepper    treadmills  and a universal weight set   If you want a place that has peace and quiet and no casino noise  this is great  It is within walking distance to the Monorail at the Hitlon  across a long parking lot   You don t really get any discount or advantage at the Hilton itself but if you want a nearby casino the Hilton has one The Hilton  hotel  spa is nice  the gym is pretty small  several treadmills and steppers and several weight machines but relatively spartan by Vegas standards Overall the Hilton Grand Vacations Club is fine if you want a quiet place to stay but it s not anywhere near a  quot Vegas quot  experience  One significant downside is that it s hard to get a cab here at night  During the day they call a cab for you and one usually comes  At night you are just out of luck  even if you call a cab  they don t come   It s   blocks from the strip and far enough away that you just can t flag one either  We ended up going to the Hilton hotel across the large parking lot and waited in the long cab line there  Leave yourself plenty of time if you have a reservation somewhere  
P =>  Wonderful Place to Stay I have visited Las Vegas many times and have previously stayed at the Excaliber and the MGM Grand  When you stay at a casino hotel  it can get on your nerves   the long walk to and from your room  walking thru a smoky casino  very few amenities in your room  etc  I wanted a change and the Grand Vacations Club was perfect We booked a king size suite  The kitchen was perfect  even a dishwasher  There was a small washer dryer unit in the closet  The kitchen had everything we needed to make small meals and breakfast and the fridge was full sized  Our son slept on the sofa bed in the front room and we slept in the bedroom  The bath included a large jacuzzi tub The room was extremely quiet   so much nicer than having to deal with the partying that happens when you sleep  quot on the strip quot   The pool and jacuzzi were clean and heated and nobody was around when we used them  It was wonderful  The MGM closes down their pool during the winter months as do many of the Strip hotels There was a small grocery in the hotel  but I drove a few blocks to a market and stocked up on food  The new monorail is within walking distance of the hotel  in the back of the parking lot   an easy way to get to any of the strip casinos The hotel also had a concierge in the lobby  She was awesome  She got us great seats for Spamalot  even though it was very short notice  All of the staff was extremely kind  helpful  and accommodating  I can t say enough nice things about them Many of the hotels on the strip have shabby rooms and are extremely dirty   this is because many of the visitors are partying and are rough on the rooms  At this hotel  everything was in good order  clean  and beautiful There also was a lounge with a big screen TV and a billiards table  Lots of room to play games  if you wanted  I saw many families hanging out there during the day  but it was never crowded or annoyingly loud Our room even came with a DVD player so our son could watch movies  This is one of the few hotels where we have stayed with that amenity I also work on the road  so I was able to access the wireless internet from my room on my laptop with no problem  The internet service is FREE   included in the room charge   the casino hotels charge extra for that Other than the small market and your room  there is no place to eat at the hotel   however  you can walk to the Hilton which is right next door or eat on the strip  We ate most of our meals on the strip while we visited the various attractions  but it was nice to be able to eat breakfast in our room and also have snacks when we got back in the evening Even better  the price was less than half what the casino hotels charge   let s see  better service  more amenities  cleaner rooms  and a better price  about      nite vs       nite    sounds like a no brainer to me  This will be my first choice whenever I visit Vegas from now on  
P =>  Great Stay I needed to use a timeshare week and wanted to attend a sporting event at the LV Convention Center  so I chose this HGV location  The check in was quick and friendly  My two bedroom suite was clean and roomy  I appreciated the numerous electrical outlets to hookup my electronic toys  My suite overlooked the pool and the front of the hotel  The view across Paradise Road was of the other HGV on Las Vegas Blvd  the Riviera  and the Stratosphere  Although there is condo construction across Paradise Road  there was no noise pollution  Traveling eastward along Karen  I found at the next main street   yland Parkway   two    hour supermarkets   Albertsons and Vons Safeway   The Vons  even  had a gas station  where I filled up twice for       a gallon     I had problems with a dead battery in the in room safe and a backed up toilet  Both problems were fixed quickly  Each bedroom and the living room had separate heating air conditioning system  which was a nice touch  The hotel tower shades the pool area in the morning  making an early morning swim more a polar bear experience  Patio area heaters would have made the area more useable It turned out to be a very long walk between the HGV hotel through the LV Hilton to the LV convention center  particularly on a cold  rainy day  I ended driving most of the time   hehe Check out was also quick with no lines  The quiet  non smoking aspects of HGV was a nice retreat from the noise and smoke of the big casinos  The only negative is the lack of fans in the bathrooms  Bring a can of air freshner I would recommend this location to my friends and family  Because of Hilton policy  I can not exchange for this location for the next two years  
P =>   HGVLV was a Lucky Pick  I had not plannned to visit Las Vegas at this time of year  but lucked up catching a Delta Airlines special          R T from ATL  so I had to go Since I hadn t been budgeting for a trip  I had to look for bargains  I found a good deal for the Saturday arrival at the Las Vegas Hilton  and saw that for about     more for the next two nights  I could move to the HGVLV  I really liked the idea of a kitchenette since I m usually carrying a to go box back to my room after dinners out on any vacation  With no microwave  well   whaddaya gonna do with it     gt  Check in was super  Right away  the Host Concierge Manager Robert took interest in making me feel special and welcome  I was given a wonderful   th floor King Studio overlooking a golf course and facing toward the mountains and sunrise  which I loved  The bed was wonderful  and the kitchenette was just the thing for me to fix myself a drink or snack  or re heat my to go goodies  without having to dress and go downstairs or somewhere else   although I did my share of that as well  I had a rental car and bought myself some groceries and liquor at the Smith s grocery store off North Rancho  By signing up for the shopper card I saved     from my final total of      which included an apple pie  breakfast slice   fruits  nuts  Brie  crackers  chips  a bottle of Stoly Citrus vodka which was on sale for          a bottle of Ecco Dominici Pinot Grigio wine and this neat bottle opener stopper gadget  a bottle of Jose Cuevero ready mixed gueritas  Mr   amp  Mrs  T Bloody y mix  bottles of water  some makeup and a few souveniers as well  I actually brought a lot of this back home with me   no liquor  but the other things I could pack  so my budget trip went very well  Even though I drank only about a third of the Stoly  for     it was definitely cheaper than buying drinks one by one somewhere out  Plus  I had my wonderful view to enjoy while sipping and enjoying my spur of the moment R amp R The room already had a complement of Starbucks coffee pods for the coffeemaker  although I did make a run to the deli grocery downstairs the next morning for more sugar and Half N Half That morning I went to the pool downstairs  Even though it was ember   th  they were saying on the TV News that this near record warmth was due to change on Tuesday  which would be the day I was leaving  The pool was heated  anyway  So I certainly enjoyed a ember morning in the sun by the pool I really liked the hotel toiletries  The lotion smelled wonderful  There was also a ironing board iron  room safe and hairdryer  for those who need these items  In the morning  as a HHonors member  a USA Today hung on my doorknob outside  My room was quiet enough  I did hear muffled voices a few times from the neighbors  nothing irritating  just enough to know I wasn t totally alone up there The room attendants were so friendly and accommodating  Any request I made was immediately and graciously handled I thought I had lost my prescription sunglasses  The day I went to check out  I moved my rental car from the HGVLV parking lot around to the front to load my luggage  When I went around to unlock the trunk  there sat my sunglasses on the back of the trunk  Only in Vegas Great rate  great room  great experience  I hated to leave  and I hope to be back ASAP  
P =>  Nice Hotel Great Location I had been somewhat worried about outrstay here because of some of the blogs I d read  Once we arrived  I was very impressed  We booked a two bedroom which was a one bedroom suite and a one bedroom room hooked together since we had   people in our party  The suite was nice and spacious with a full kitchen  washer and dryer  The master bedroom had a whirlpool  The bathroom had a double sink and large shower stall  The attached room was a little tight  but for two people it was ok  It had a little kitchenette with a small fridge  The hotel staff were very pleasant and helpful  The pool was always clean with lots of fresh pool towels  There is a bar that you can go to right from the pool or sit on a terrace and not be at the pool and still go to the bar  The store had good food even if it was a little pricey   all the food seems pricey in Vegas  It was easy to walk to the Hilton next door for larger restaurants and get to the monorail  We walked to the Sahara also which wasn t too far  The monorail is great for getting around Vegas because traffic does not move  After being in the crowds on the strip it was relaxing to get back to the HGVC and have peace and quiet  Another nice thing about this resort is that you need your card to go to the pool and after   pm to use the elevator  This might seem like a hassle to some people but you felt more secure  Lots of parking was available outside and in the parking deck  We would definitely stay there again  The only negative was that the bathrooms did not have fans in them  
P =>   Hilton   not at its best I agree with previous reviewers about the location  If you want to get to the action on the strip  a car or shuttle are best  If you like the quiet nature of a non gaming hotel  this is a good choice  I stayed only one night in a king studio  I thought the room was pretty small and no different than a typical hotel room  but it did have a fridge and microwave  along with a toaster and coffee maker  The room was clean  but I had problems with my shower and toilet  Neither worked well  The shower faucet was nearly dangling from the wall and the toilet handle required frequent jiggling to get the water to stop continuous flushing  In addition  I had problems cooling the room down to a comfortable temperature  Windows do not open Like another reviewer  I could hear conversations and a baby crying in a neighboring room  not a fun distraction during the wee hours  In the morning  the sounds of people showering in adjacent rooms were pretty loud While the courteous  professional staff were great and the easy  close parking was convenient  I was unimpressed otherwise  and will not return  nor recommend this property  It s likely that the   bedroom suites are much nicer  so I hope future guests enjoy the   brm accommodations  My next stay is scheduled for another Hilton Grand Vacations property  the location on Las Vegas Blvd  I hope to have a better experience there  
P =>  Nice Big Rooms Long Walk My wife and I were contacted by Hilton Grand Vacations Club  to attend a timeshare  They gave us a one bedroom suite  that was nice and large  Full kitchen  washer  amp  dryer  flat screen tv s  the works  We were pretty happy with the hotel  Our only complaint is it is located far from the action  and the cab fare from this hotel to the center strip ran           one way  We Finally purchased a   hour unlimited use pass for the monorail which has a stop next door at the Hilton  The monorail runs every five minutes  and is very easy and clean  I am not sure I would stay here again due to it s location  but we had a great time  
P =>  Great Hotel We stayed here one night with our kids  and loved it  We had the one bedroom suite  and it was a lovely  spacious room  The staff is so friendly and helpful  They have excellent customer service  The pool area is nice  and they have a small bar outside  They have a nice deli inside  with a good choice of food and drinks  We would love to stay here again  It felt small and comfortable  compared to the large hotels on the strip  
P =>   Great stay would love to revisit  I stayed with two other people in a single King with sleeper sofa  I slept on the sleeper sofa  and all things considered  it was quite comfortable  I actually enjoyed not having daily maid service  this is generally a time share property   my friends and I all brought our laptops and there was no concern about items being stolen from our room  The room was very clean and quiet  The kitchenette was a nice feature  although we didn t often have the need for it  It s a bit off the beaten path  but still has a nice view  Access to the Star Trek Experience at the Hilton was great  just a short walk  Also  the monorail was readily accessible  although I didn t use it because I had a rental vehicle  This makes it a great choice for someone who wants to stay off of the Strip but wants to use public transportation Really  my visit was EXCELLENT  My only complaints are the following  Room was on the smallish side   no walking space for anyone with sofa bed pulled out  Downstairs deli sundry shop was ridiculously expensive  
P => Nice rooms good location but too noisy HGVC at the Hilton is a nice hotel with large rooms  meant for their time share customers   Many rooms have a separate living room  kitchen  large bathroom with separate shower and jacuzzi tub in the bedroom  Some rooms have a great view toward the strip The hotel is off Paradise  which means it s not a good walk to get to the strip  However  there is a shuttle  and more convenient  a short walk to the monorail station  The monorail is a smooth  quick way to get to the strip hotels  It should be cheaper  but it can save on taxi fares and kids just love it  I ve stayed here four times  mostly because of the larger rooms and access to the monorail  Check in is always a challenge  they post a  pm check in time  and then expect a   am check out  Recently  I have noticed that the dividing walls between the rooms are too thin  One family was having a normal conversation in their bedroom  and it sounded as if they were standing right behind me as I tried to fall asleep in our bedroom  I complained to the front desk  who called their room to ask them to be a little more quiet  But even after they lowered their voices  I could still hear them  I think the wall construction is the problem  
P =>   Very nice time   HGVC Let me tell you a bit about us before you read the review  My wife and I are both people who enjoy a     star hotel  we are not one s to nit pick at every little thing wrong with a hotel  So please keep that in mind when you read our review  We arrived at HGVC on Tuesday night  parking was a breeze  Not many times you can park your car and walk right into the hotel  Check in was a snap and the staff was quite friendly  no pushy sales pitch to buy a condo or anything  We had a  bedroom suite  witch was clean and had all the little things we needed to make our stay enjoyable  I would recommend a high floor so you can look out unto the strip Both my wife and I like to lay in the sun so the pool was wonderful  a bit small but that was no problem since people seem to come and go  They do have a nice little pool side bar and towels are furnished  Not much more than you could ask for The HVGC is located on north end so if you plan on walking to strip you might think again since it is a bit of a hike  The closest casino was the Hilton right next door   not impressed  The Rivera sits across the street along with Saraha  Both older casino but still lots of action if you are a gambler  If you have have a car I would just suggest just driving down to a local casino and use thier paking garage and accessing the strip from there We did go out the Red Rock Casino   wow   If you get a chance to go out there  We had dinner at the BBQ place  Salt Lick  and then a drink at the outside lounge  It was a perfect night  All and all HGVC is a good solid   star hotel  It is clean has everything you need for a fraction of the price you would pay staying on the strip  Just remember it is not a strip hotel so if you are looking for the hot night life this might be the place for you  but if you dont mind being a bit on the tame side then this place is for you  
P =>   Excellent Hotel for families  Mrs  Gardiner  Kiddo and I spent six nights here in late e  as the two of us were attending a large conference at the Las Vegas Convention Center  This hotel was absolutely perfect for our stay Check in went very well  where we first met some of the friendliest  most helpful hotel employees I ve seen anywhere  and that s a big compliment from me  They continually remembered my name everytime I walked by  and they addressed my daughter by name too  They have an  active  lounge  and a  quiet  lounge  as well as a very well equipped deli convenience store in the lobby  The deli opened at  a each day  and served hot breakfast sandwiches  Starbucks coffee  etc  Full assortment of chips  beer  cokes  vino  etc The pool was small  but that kept things manageable   The Hilton s pool  next door  was an absolute zoo   There was a small pool bar that served drinks at prices very close to the package prices in the convenience store  There are two very nice built in grills by the pool gate We had a Suite  which included a separate bedroom and a fully workable kitchen  more on that later   The greatroom area was also spacious  and had a fold out sofa  Both rooms had large flatscreen TVs  and the greatroom TV had a DVD player  meaning that our traveling Kiddo could watch her Dora DVDs on the big screen  instead of her    portable  Bathroom had a nice sized shower  and Crabtree Evelyn toiletries  A vertical washer dryer unit was nice to have as well  The bedroom had a large whirlpool tub  and a too small  note  only complaint here closet  PERFECT  though  for a small family visit  Housekeeping was sparkling  and everything looked pretty darn new to me Free wi fi throughout the building  and reception was reliably between    and   mbps both in our room and in the lobby area Location is a caution here  depending on why you are in Vegas  It is directly next door      yards  tops  to the side entrance to the Hilton  through which you can walk almost all the way to the Convention Center  The Hilton s monorail stop is just another    feet further than the side door  From the monorail  you can get most places fairly easily  You cannot  though  walk to the strip  at least not with temps in the         range  Parking looked like it was free here  We spent the full six days here without wheels  and had no trouble getting around  The    for   hrs of monorail was a very nice deal  and Kiddo is only    so she rides for free  So  if the Convention Center is your driver for being here  this is a great location  great facility  and great pricing  If you want to be in the center of the gaming action  this ain t it  In fact  there s no gaming in the HGVC at all  you have to head over to the Hilton The HGVC does not  other than the deli  have dining  you have to walk to the Hilton   which is fine  because you can charge back to the HGVC  and get HHonors points   We ate at Quark s twice for lunch  good menu  reasonable prices  and Star Trek characters visit the tables   We also ate at the Paradise Caf   and found the food acceptable  but not great  We had one dinner at the Benihana  as we thought Kiddo would enjoy it  They were helpful with her and her needs  and the cooking show is always fun Should mention that we had one dinner at the Paris Hotel  at Mon Ami Gabi  Third time we ve eaten there  and it really is good  Excellent pricing  and the staff is a lot more friendly than up in the Eiffel Tower  Our waiter there was Dion  and he was superb  see my review at that restaurant for more Back to the HGVC  though  and a further compliment about the staff  While here  we found that an old friend of ours was having his wife and two kids into Vegas after our conference ended  Since we had a kitchen  and they had two boys  we decided that it d be a heckuva lot cheaper to grill out and eat in our suite than to try to feed four adults  with vino  and three kids in a restaurant  I grabbed a cab over to a nearby grocery store  while Mrs  Gardiner visited the front desk to explain what we were up to  within    minutes there were two ladies from housekeeping at the door with another four place settings of dishes  glasses  new silverware  still in wrapper   AND extra papertowels and soap      WOW  One of the housekeepers noticed that I had corn on the cob sitting in a cardboard box and said  You can t serve friends from a cardboard box    then returned five minutes later with a still in the wrapper cooking sheet to serve from  Outstanding  To sum  we successfully prepared and served a full dinner for four adults and three kids    no problem We grilled by the pool  using BBQ tools readily borrowed from the deli convenience store  and carried steaks and corn back upstairs  and ate comfortably while the kids watched TV Net  this was a great hotel for our family  perfect for attending the conference and various meetings  The employees were nothing but wonderful  My compliments to whoever heads HR there  and to the GM  Very  very well done  
P =>   Not a good first stay My husband and I stayed in a   bedroom unit at the HGVC at the Las Vegas Hilton for   nights from il            Due to flight delays we arrived at around  PM  We were then told that the only   bedroom units left were a nonsmoking room on the ground floor and a smoking room on the  th floor  We are not smokers  After checking  and smelling  the smoking room on the  th floor we knew we could never sleep comfortably there so we opted for the ground floor room  We were given room       This would have been a perfect room for us with the added bonus of not having to wait for an elevator EXCEPT for two major problems that really made this an unpleasant stay  the toilet plumbing made a loud banging noise every time we flushed it  really  I felt like I was hearing a performance of Stomp   and the bathroom sink backed up so badly that we used the kitchen sink to brush our teeth instead  Both problems were reported to the front desk within one hour of arrival and then again the following morning but nothing was done to fix it  Front desk said that maintenance was informed but that s all we heard  At checkout we specifically mentioned the problems again and even wrote a note requesting that maintenance fix them before the unit is rented out again  If you re ever given room     at the HGVC Las Vegas Hilton  flush the toilet and run the bathroom faucet first thing before you unpack The full kitchen was nice  We cooked breakfast and had all the dishes  pots and pans to use  Appliances  stove  refrigerator  dishwasher and microwave  were full size  Dishwasher detergent and cleaning items were under the sink  There s an apt size washer dryer unit in the closet in the kitchen with detergent and dryer sheets available  Note that the size of these washer dryer units will only fit a couple of jeans and shirts at most  You ll be doing multiple loads if you have more  Nice granite countertops everywhere   bathroom  kitchen and even on the dresser in the bedroom  Furniture looked upgraded  Carpet  however  was worn in spots and really needs to be changed  Both the bedroom and living room had newer flat panel TVs  Bathroom had a separate shower and jacuzzi tub  I used the tub to soak after a long day of walking the strip  The Paradise Deli was located right around the corner from this unit  which was convenient  They served Starbucks coffee and had a small section of prepared salads  sandwiches and packaged fruits  It s also a small market with a limited selection of toiletries as well as milk  juice and other drinks and some frozen foods and snacks but it s really convenient if you just want to pick something up and don t want to walk too far  We used the gym down the hall from our room  It had a couple of bikes  treadmills and ellipiticals along with some weights  It s a nice size room with adequate machines but really needs to be better ventilated  The Hilton Hotel is a convenient      minute walk through a parking lot  There you ll find restaurants  larger shops with more varied selections and entertainment  The monorail also drops off and picks up there  Monorail tickets can be purchased at ticket machines at the monorail entrance      one trip     two trip      all day pass  Having the monorail at the Las Vegas Hilton was really convenient  We liked the location of this Hilton because it was away from all the action on the strip  It s in a quieter street but with the monorail  has easy access to everything on the strip  This is a good place to stay if you want to be in Las Vegas but not right on the strip  In il       there was some construction going up across the street  Turnberry Towers  but it didn t interfere with the traffic flow or our sleep  With the new Foutainbleu casino going up nearby  there ll be lots of construction around this location in the coming years so don t let that deter you from staying here  The problems I encountered on this stay were specific to this particular room and not indicative of the resort as a whole  I hope Hilton fixes the plumbing problems which are really only minor maintenance issues before renting out      again 
P =>   Great place even if it is a little out of the way I stayed there with my family  amp  fiancee for a week when we went to Vegas this past tember  and what a great place it was  It didn t feel like a hotel at all  felt much more like a home  Flat screen TVs in all   rooms with DVD players  Comfy beds  kitchen was well laid out  sink FACED the living room  it wasn t away from it   the property was clean  pool was nice   I d definitely stay there again  The location off strip was nice too  although it made going everywhere a little bit of a walk  No big deal though  I had longer walks to class when I was at college  Highly recommended  good for families and everyone else  
P => The only place we stay in Vegas My family and I stay at the HGVC at the LV Hilton every time we come to Vegas  The rooms are spacious and clean  My mom is a maid by profession and she was impressed  and have courteous and attentive staff  I feel sorry for the people that stay here one time and have a bad experience  but we have stayed here   to   times and haven t had one problem  Bellman and maid service is always prompt  We love using the grill down by the pool as well as having a full kitchen in the room at our disposal in the one and two bedroom suites  A washer and dryer are included in the one and two bedroom suites as well  Our family loves to go out and we can call down for a minivan cab or walk   minutes to the monorail  You can get your cabbies phone number and call him her directly for a cab  The monorail is a great deal if you want to go down to the MGM as you can purchase a    ride ticket  good for a year  that can be shared by those with you  If its just you and another person thats       one way as opposed to an easy     cab ride  What makes this property so inviting is the fact that it is private and very quiet  The Las Vegas Hilton is a stone s throw from the HGVC and you can catch a cab or the monorail or just plain ole walk to the strip  If you need to be close to the action stay at the HGVC at the Flamingo  but if you like to stay at a quiet  well maintained hotel  the HGVC at the Hilton is the best place to be  
P =>   Great For Mini Getaway  I stayed in HGVC in LV Hilton on memorial weekend  Got a very good rate on a sold out weekend and this hotel is very family welcome  unlike the LV Hilton which is VERY smokey   I am still coughing from the excessive smoke in the casino lobby as of now   The hotel lobby is small but efficient  The staff was very friendly and did find us a room to upgrade us to the one bedroom suite  which is an added bonus The One Bedroom suite have everything you needed  This is what you will get in Living room  Philip LCD TV        quot    a sofabed  dining table for    full refridgerator  full washer dryer with detergient  dish washer  blender  coffee machine  and a stove  and a DVD player and   little bottles of water with a box of chocolate In the bedroom  u get a walk in shower  a king size bed with a tv  non flat   and a spa jacuzzi tub  The only thing that I don t like about the tub is that its in an open area  Which means no privacy to take a bath unless you are travelling with special someone   I think lots hotel in vegas tend to have a tub in an open area   thats kinda odd  As a HHonor member  you ll receive a     voucher thats good for purchase at the deli on the  st floor  which is also very reasonbly priced for a hotel property The hotel also have shuttle  don t know if its free or fee based   and best of all  free wireless internet   Most of the hilton property that I have stayed at don t have this option  and its VERY quiet and not far from the monorail station and pretty easy access to everywhere in vegas  even to the strip  because paradise blvd basically got NO traffic compare to LV blvd  Overall  a great stay  I will this property if they can change the mattress to the new Hilton mattress and update the furniatures  
P =>   Best Place I ever stayed in Vegas I go to Vegas for the NAB Conference each year  and usually I stay at one of the big casinos  This year I brought my    year old son  so I wanted to stay in a place that had a kitchen  From the reviews  I decided to try the Hilton Grand Vacation Club at the Las Vegas Hilton  We loved it This is the best hotel I have ever stayed at  Everything was almost perfect  We had a one bedroom suite and it worked out great  The king bed in the master bedroom was very comfortable  The jacuzzi tub was really nice and great for relaxing after a long day walking around at the convention  The bathroom was huge and the shower was nice and big  Since we were there for   days  the washer and dryer unit in the suite was a big plus  We washed clothes a couple of times  There was a free box of detergent in the room  and we asked for more and got it It was great having a full kitchen  even though we didn t use it a lot  We love eating out The free internet was a huge help  All of the other places I have stayed  charge around       a day for internet  This adds up over a week  We rented a car  so when we wanted to see the sights of Vegas and go shopping  we could get around easily  Everywhere you go has plenty of parking and it is free  The money we saved on internet fees  paid for the car  Also  you park right in front of the hotel and go right up to your room  No smoke to walk through  that was a plus The store in the lobby is very convienient  They sell starbucks coffee and make all kinds of deli items  All in all it was a great hotel  We would stay there again  Probably next year for sure  
P =>   GREAT FOR FAMLIES my wife and two boys stayed from                 we loved the quiteness of the hotel    it is off strip and i loved it    we drove to all hotels on the strip   do valet parking will cost        the cost of the monorail is      pp if you buy the    trip   the monorail leaves you far off the strip and a long walk away   valet leaves you in front of the hotel   worth      to valet  pool area was very nice as well is the store   i would most definetly stay here again in the future   if you want crazy stay elsewhere  if you want quiet after running around the strip this is the place     
P =>   Great stay   Location could be better Not one bad thing to say of the hotel itself  We were in the penthouse suite and loved everything  The location is between the Stratosphere and Circus Circus at the far end of the strip  The trolly stops right at the front and the monorail isn t too far away  Just leave yourself enough time to travel when going to a show or exhibition  
P =>  Great Stay Just returned from a week here  We had the   bedroom unit which was very spacious and very clean  The property is kept in excellent condition  The construction that is going on across the street is not even an issue  We enjoyed our stay very much and would not hesitate to return sometime The monorail stop at the Hilton Casino is a very short walk  Cabs are right outside the door if you prefer that  All of the employees we had dealings with were very courteous  helpful and always greeted you with a smile  A special thank you to ia Teresa in housekeeping  What a special person they have there  I hope the management realizes that     If you re considering going here  do so with confidence that your stay will be very nice  
P =>   Hilton Grand Vacations   Non Resort Hotel ideal for Business Travellers On Karen Avenue Paradise Road a couple of  parallel  blocks from Circus Circus   Sahara  Not too far from the Stratosphere although a substantial hike to New York  New York or downtown  Handy for the convention centre  Although the Las Vegas Hilton is easy to spot  the Grand Vacations are tucked behind one of the multi story car parks that serve both hotels  Major constructions are taking place close to the hotel although this did not disturb the my time here  from   pm to  am for a couple of nights  This is not a resort hotel  a requirement of company policy for some folk  and has been geared to a different  mainly business  market Rooms are standard business size with fridge  microwave  toaster  coffee facilities and enough pots pans cutlery for those that need to do a limited amount of self catering  My room was clean and well presented and afforded a nice view of the sunrise through the mountains  If you are coming from Eastern Time  you ll probably catch this  Hotel has a nice pool area  not too overwhelming  which looked in good order  They provide a free outside grill should you happen to have packed your sausages  The hotel has a deli shop for your immediate needs but does not have any restaurant facilities  Definately no free lunch  or free breakfast  here Very small business centre   one PC  minimum    charge  but free wi fi No queue at the desk and good sevice   my request for a quiet room away from elevators  ice machines and conctruction was met with minimum fuss I paid     per night through company travel web site No complaints and  providing the price was right  I would use again  
P =>   Sedate  Our standard room  no full kitchen or jacuzzi tub  was well decorated and in excellent condition  It included a small kitchen counter with a sink  microwave  mini fridge  and utensils  amp  plates  The entertainment center had doors to hide the TV  and included a nicely sized TV and a DVD player  The hotel was nice and quiet  and not crowded at all even compared with the fairly mellow Hilton next door  However  it was still pretty convenient to get places  because the monorail stop for the Hilton was just a short    minute  walk across the parking lot  The concierge was helpful for little things like getting airline boarding passes printed and letting us know where to store our luggage after check out  they have a bell desk in the lobby  The  quot deli quot  and convenience shop was grossly overpriced  not unlike the convenience shops inside other hotels I had a problem with the bill  which was that the rate I was charged did not match the rate quoted when I made my reservation and paid my deposit on the Hilton web site  The staff could not correct it at check out time  but I was able to get the error corrected over the phone afterwards simply by providing the confirmation number  
P =>  Excellent exchange  Excellent exchange  Great rooms we had two ajoining ones  Superb beds really comfy  Brilliant deli on site  Would definatley choose this one again  
P =>   Great for business travelers Great hotel for business travelers  Twelve minute walk from the conference center  Professional staff  Rooms are clean and full of conveniences  like refrigerator  toaster  sink  coffee pot   Get the      lunch special at Thai Red Pepper at      Paradise Rd     minute walk for a relaxing atmosphere and great food   Capriotti s further down the road has very good subs  
P =>   Great place  Stayed here overnight to see a show at the Hard Rock  We were very  very pleased with these accommodations  Room was very spacious and clean  Had a lovely bathroom and master suite along with a great big tub too  The kitchen  while we did not use it  was nice to have  The washer and dryer came in handy for washing our beer and cigarette smoked soaked jeans  gross   Property was very quiet and easy to get in and out of  We will definitely come back here  It is a great hotel for a family or a group of friends because the rooms are huge  Great price too         for a Saturday night   can t beat that  
P =>  perfect for business traveler Stayed here for   nights  The proximity to the Hilton and the convention center made it an ideal location  The only negative would be the bedding  If they upgraded the linens and provided better pillows it would make a big difference  Other than that  it was clean and quiet which is just what I was looking for  
P =>  Nice and comfortable ideally located We stayed at the HGVC for a week as part of an RCI exchnageThe Hotel is nice and quiet  We stayed on the Strip last year at the Mirage  and felt this year we wanted somewhere a little quieter  but close to the Strip  This place was perfect for that The rooms were of a very good size  we had a   bed appartment with a   bed studio attached  and were very tidy  if in need of a little updating  and very clean  The staff were very friendly and the deli on site was useful  The proximity to the Las Vegas Hilton and the mono rail was great also Nice pool area with waitress service mostly 
P =>  Great Family Stay     Thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Hilton Grand Vacations with my husband  sister and daughter  The kitchenette was very convenient for making something quick in the mornings for my daughter  Spent lots of time at the pool which was very nice and clean  provided towels  though they could have been bigger   The staff was very nice  the rooms were clean  Overall great stay  no complaints  Did not receive any calls regarding time shares as others had noted  
P =>  Great weekend stay   Just returned from a weekend stay at the HGVC Las Vegas  Checking in on Friday at   PM was a breeze  We were the only ones in line  The service was friendly and professional We had a   bedroom suite  The unit on the  th floor was clean and it was nicely decorated  It was only my wife and I along with our   year old son staying in the suite  My wife and son took the main bedroom and I took the  nd bedroom  Each had a king sized bed  The room was slightly dated  but it was nicely decorated and kept in good clean condition  I d rated it an   out of     The kitchen was nicely furnished  We ate out  but if you wanted to cook  all the pots and pans were there along with cooking utensils  There was a sponge and dish washing detergent along with plenty of towels to wash the dishes  The bed was excellent and the amenities were nice  There were plenty of towels  There is also a washer and dryer in the unit  They even provide you with detergent and fabric softener  There were plenty of storage space and lots of room to spread out  The pool area was great  It was mostly family and it wasn t too crowded  Most of the pool was   to   feet with the middle being   feet in depth  My   year old son had a blast  The   Jacuzzi were kind of small and I think it would only fit   or   people at a time  However when we were there  not too many people used the Jacuzzi  I didn t use the gym but it looked well equipped  Parking was convient  It shares the same parking structure as the Las Vegas Hilton  It is a     minute walk to the Las Vegas Hilton  The monorail is also about a     minute walk  We had a car  so we didn t use the monorail  Friday night we ate at the LV Hilton buffet  During check in they give you a     off coupon  It has all the beer and wine you can drink  for those that like to indulge  We checked out on Sunday morning and it was a breeze  Checked out at   AM and there was only one other person in line  Again  very friendly service  Overall  a very good experience  
P =>  OK stay close to the strip We just returned from our stay at the Hilton Grand Vacations Club and enjoyed our stay  This hotel is nice and close to the strip  We requested a smoking room and had a little studio with microwave  mini fridge and whirlpool tub  which was nice after a long day of walking the strip   The   bedroom suites are beautiful have a full kitchen  The pool was very enjoyable Some negatives The furnishings could use some updatingCleaning service came at very inconvenient times  our afternoon nap time  we went two days without cleaning service The timeshare calls to the room were a bit annoying 
P =>  A quiet escape from The Strip We just got back from a weekend at the HGVC at the LV Hilton  Room was great   it was a   bedroom  with a big living room  big bathroom with separate shower and jacuzzi tub  full kitchen  washer  amp  dryer    everything you could need  We got a good price by agreeing to sit through their timeshare presentation The pool was nice  the lobby  amp  common areas were roomy and well furnished too On the downside  this is a condominium complex  It s a five minute walk from the Hilton and the monorail  and a couple of minutes farther to get to the Sahara  It is off the strip  and it s quiet  The only restaurant is a  quot deli quot  off the lobby  and there s a bar at the pool  Most of the people seem to drive to this location  hence taxis have to be called  and they cook at least some of their meals in their condo  The monorail is a godo way to get around  tho   it worked great for us All in all  a good place  and a great place for those taking their children to Vegas  
P => Best Trip Of My Life We visited the Hilton two weekends ago  We had a two bedroom  two bathroom suite  The master bedroom had a jacuzzi  and it was wonderful  Our coach folded out and was very confortable for my sister to sleep on  We had a kitchen with a dishwasher and everything  and the other bedroom had a king size bed  a fold out couch  a full size bathroom  and a smaller kitchen  They had coffee for you to make and clean coffee cups  My husband and I slept in the big room  my sister slept on the fold out couch  and my dad and step mom slept in the other room  and we never had a problem with hot water  My husband  I  and my sister arrived late about      pm   but we called ahead and informed them that my father would be checking in earlier in the day  They had no problem with that and he got right into the room  The best thing about the Hilton is that you don t have to walk threw a casino to get to your room  There is no wating for an elevator or running to people on your way  You walk in the door and can go right up to your room  The casino is about a minute walk  One suggestion that I have is if you are wanting a taxi just allow yourself enough time to walk over to the casino to get one  You can call for one to be sent over  but they don t always come  We had no problem walking over to get one  It was beautiful weather and we enjoyed every minute of it  My little sister went down to the pool before getting ready for her wedding in our room and she loved it  It was a nice size and very clean  They had a little grociery store deli for you to get food and snacks at  If you went over to the casino you could charge drinks our dinner back to your room  and the taxi rides were not very expensive for where we went  we went all the way out to the Palms and Freemont St  We all had the time of our lives  and really enjoyed staying at the Hilton  
P =>  Hotel was just ok I booked last minute on their website and received an AAA rate for one night of        on a Saturday night stay  I arrived early and had no problems checking in early  pm  I rode the CLS shuttle to the HLVC for     round trip  The hotel is far from the strip but the monorail is just a short walk  My room was on the  th floor with a pool parking deck mountain view  I had a king size bed with a kitchenette  If I have one complaint about the room it would be the cleanliness  The trash under the sink was not emptied from the previous guest and there was a used condom in there  Also  the refrigerator door  on the outside looked like it could use a good scrubbing  The dishes found in the cabinet had dried food on the plates They have a nice sitting room near the lobby with a pool table The room has a safe  free of charge   I took the monorail down to the strip and had a ball  It was just an ok hotel in my opinion This was my first trip to Vegas   I stayed at the Harrah s my second night   I will post that review as well  
P =>  Great place with a small  but      The HGVC is a fine resort with excellent faclilties  and ideally located to share the facilities of the Hilton Hotel next door   including the monorail to travel The Strip  However  due to our travel agent s lack of knowledge  and our own inexperience     of us  Mum  Dad and   teenagers  were squeezed into a tiny studio apartment which left hardly any floor space It was bearable as we spent most of the time out of the room anyway being tourists  except for the    year old who couldn t tear herself away from the    TV channels some days   So we had a good time  You will too if you make sure to get room apartment suite which meets your needs  
P =>  Another great stay at the HGVC It s been awhile since we have stayed at this HGVC at the LV Hilton and there have been some nice upgrades to the property  There have been new bedspreads  and reupholstered furniture put in the suites  making them more colorful  It also has the new Hilton Suite Dreams bed by Serta  which is very nice  plus the new Crabtree  amp  Evelyn bath amenities and the new Hilton Clock radio  The rooms are spacious  clean and comfortable  Great location to travel about Vegas by car  If you travel here and expect to be in the center of the action you will be disappointed  for that you will need to stay at the HGVC at the Flamingo  But if you are in Vegas to relax  visit family or on business it is a very convenient location  
P => Very good stay  My wife and I stayed at HGVC at The Las Vegas Hilton from            It was a very pleasant stay  The property is new  We received a   bedroom unit     which didn t bothered us since it has a large living room with a sofa bed  one queen bed in a master room with a bath and a king bedroom  Our bedroom had a king size bed with a large tub with jacuzzi     Everything from the bedrooms to the kitchenette was in excelent condition  We really reccomend to stay here  However  keep in mind that this hotel is not on the strip and a rental car is very useful   regarding the staff  they were very kind and helpful  specially at their Deli where we tried their sandwiches  The only thing I didn t like was the check out time which I think is too early     am  for Vegas  We also got to see the other HGVC on the strip  which has a not so good location  It is next to the Circus Circus    
P => Excellent value for the money We ended up at the Hilton Grand vacations las vegas after the Hilton at Cancun was blown off the map by Wilma  We weren t sure what to expect as we had made the booking very quickly  We were given a wonderful room on the top floor with great view over Vegas  The bed was large and comforTable  The lounge was great and we had a kitchen and laundry facilities thrown in too  It was lovely to be able to wash our clothes ourselves  The bathroom was great with a double vanity and shower and there was a seperate spa hot tub in between the bedroom and the bathroom  We found the staff to be courteous and helpful  The in house store sells all the basics you need and their deli food was very nice though we ate on the strip most of the time  We would heartily recommend this hotel for someone wanting to stay just off the strip but a couple of minutes from the monorail  
P => what a great place      We stayed at the HiltonGrand vacation Club inLas Vegas on Karen St We were very pleased with everything The staff was friendly service was excellent and the hotel was clean and with nice ambiance It was a quiet retreat from all the hustle and bustle of the casino Truly a nice place to relax and be pampered I give this hotel two thumbs up I like to thank my sister in law for giving us this gift to stay at this nice resort Joy Rick and Mike of NJ 
P => Great place to stay  This is the  th year in a row that we have stayed at the HGVC to celebrate a family   st birthday party  I can t say enough about how great the accomodations are   we have always stayed in a studio condo  but several other family members have stayed in the two bedroom suites  We had a luxurious king size bed and a queen sleeper sofa for our two kids  The tiny utility kithen fit our needs perfectly for our weekend trip  The bathroom is also spacious with plenty of towels for     The staff is helpful and friendly  The deli is open at very convenient hours and has great food made to order and wonderful coffee and even vanilla lattes   The pool is good sized and a lot of fun and the cocktails at the outdoor bar are wonderful   The mango peach slushy thingee with alcohol in it is fantastic in the     degree heat   our kids loved playing pool in the lobby guest area  It s nice and quiet  very different from some of the Vegas area hotels  The two room suites are wonderful and have a big living room  dining room and full kitchen  Of cuorse  we did get a great rate      for three nights  with points  but let me tell you  it was well worth it  The close parking  privacy  cleanliness  hospitality and excellent service always makes this a memorable trip  Even if our kids are     now and really don t like sharing the queen couch    but it s a free room for them in Vegas  and they don t spend much time in the room at night   and they get to hang out with the family  Oh also the monorail is within a   minute walk  I highly recommend the    rides for     that can be shared among several people  Easy and cheap way to get downtown with no designated driver  Just remember they stop service at  AM  
P =>  Excellent accomodations My wife and I stayed here the week of e    on an RCI exchange  timeshare   The facilities are excellent and the staff was helpful and friendly  The location is just north of the Las Vegas Hilton and a coupon book was included  The monorail stops at the Hilton and the Sahara  both nearby  We opted for a rental car  based on the weekly cost  and more flexibility We had a two bedroom unit which was luxurious and spacious with a view to the west toward the Strip  That view has been obstucted by the Turnbury Condominiums  the fourth is now under contruction  We will definitely stay here again in the future  
P => Coulldn t have been better  I researched far and wide for a suite in Vegas  and we ended up selecting the HGVC Hilton Las Vegas  We rented a   bedroom suite for the   of us  my sister  niece and babysitter  and we were more than comfortable  Perfect location for families looking for a suite with kitchen  washer dryer and all the amenities needed in the room  The monorail was in test mode  so we were not able to take advantage of that  but will this year  Best of all  it was a little over      for the week    How can you beat that  As for the Hilton Rewards guys comments  he was obviously looking for handouts  which you will not find here  Highly recommend  
P => No place for a Hilton Honors Member I recently booked a room at the Hilton Grand Vacations Club at the Las Vegas Hilton  I am a Hilton Honors Diamond member and I used a honors rewards coupon for one night at the Hotel  My first problem with the hotel is that they are not found on any information at the airport  so it was very difficult to locate  as there are two hotels relatively close to each other   I ended up going to the wrong hotel and vallet parking my vehicle only to find out I had to pick up and go to another location  When I finally arrived at the other hotel  they had jumbled records of my reservation and they had absolutely no clue about Hilton Honors coupons  So I spent    minutes at the front desk while the night manager tried to contact the day manager to find out if this coupon was valid  After all of this I asked if I could borrow a cable for the internet connection and they told me it would be     insult to injury   Furthermore  the HGVC is supposed to offer a free Deli voucher for breakfast to Hilton Diamond members and this never happened and at that point I was afraid to ask with the turnaround time on answers  There was a box of chocolate truffles and two bottled waters on the desk when I finally made it to my room  It would have been a nice gesture except for the fact that the chocolates were addressed to another hotel guest  Did I eat them anyway  Yes  Do I feel like I was a valued Hilton Honors Member  Absolutely not  Will I ever  voluntarily  stay at a HGVC again  No way  The rooms are spacious and clean  The TV remotes didn t function properly  Definitely not worth the        points required to stay there  That is why the Hilton Grand Vacations Club at the Las Vegas Hilton is no place for a Hilton Honors member  
P =>  Great bang for the buck  We stayed at the HGVC in ember       We rented a two bedroom unit  which was a   bedroom unit w a door that opened into a studio suite for the second bedroom   We got the   bedroom unit for one week for       for the week through Ice Gallery w no trade in  Couldn t beat the price   I would never rent a suite from HGVC as it was very small and had only a partial kitchen  However  the   bedroom unit was very nice  Everything in there was new    new furniture  tile floors  linens  etc  The unit had a full kitchen and a washer  amp  dryer  too  Very nice    would definitely rent a   bedroom from there   We didn t spend a lot of time in the room but it was certainly nice to come back to in the evenings  The resort seemed very quiet when we were there    the community rooms had some older teens playing pool and that was about it  The pool spa was empty    probably just too darned cold outside   Staff was very friendly nice and other than the one voicemail message that they left on our phone re  attending a  presentation   we weren t bothered by them at all  The deli had some delicious items that we purchased last minute    it was pretty tasty  although expensive  but that was to be expected   All in all  it made for a very nice  base camp  while in Vegas  Very clean  nicely appointed room  and a very quiet place to come back to  I didn t miss the clanging of the slot machines at night at all    We would definitely recommend renting a car to make it really easy to get to the strip from HGVC   
P =>    Hilton Rocks       We stayed at the   Bedroon Suite at the HGVC at the Las Vegas Hilton from ember              The suite was absolutely immaculate  extremely spacious  well decorated and tastefully finished  It had a supersized California king bed in one room  I think Shaq could even fit in it   a very spacious master bath  and a relaxing jacuzzi tub  The other room had a full sized bed and a living room set  w  a pullout sofa if you need it   and a bar kitchenette  The second room can be a self contained  well decorated studio suite by itself  The main kitchen was well equipped and complete  except no coffee  the only minor drawback   Each room had a TV  and there was a big one in the main living room  Service at the front desk was great  smooth  and professional  We did not get hassled by any timeshare salespeople  It is best for those who have a car  but if there is none  it is a hop away to the monorail station at the Hilton Hotel next door  In all it would be very easy to recommend it to anyone  
P =>  You can do better for the money The hotel was OK  but for the money that you pay you can do better in Las Vegas  It relatively close to the Las Vegas Convention Center  so if you there for a convention it is OK  However  there are alot better hotels for the price  
P =>  Small yet Personable HGVC         First  I shall say thank you merci beaucoup  danke schonn  obrigado  and gracias to the entire staff at the Hilton Grand Vacation Club FOR MAKING MY WELL NEEDED VACATION A REAL VACATION  We  two    yrs old boys and my friend  arrived at the Hilton Grand Vacation Club two hours before check in  The receptionists was polite and professional and directed my three guests and myself to a clean comfortable and well air conditioned lounge area  The bell captain promptly took our bags to the holding area while we enjoyed drinks by the pool  Our rooms were ready within an hour  The adjoining queen bdrms rooms with a full kitchen lvrm  dining area and washer dryer were provided as requested from the initial search  Big cozy and new like furniture was throughout the suite  The bonus was the pool view from the  th floor The Hilton Grand Vacation Club at     Karen Avenue is away from the strip  approx    minutes by cab       The walk to the monorail is about   minutes costing       one way or       rtp  I suggest you pack a suitcase with favorite foods libations  snacks and soap powder  The little store in the hotel have variety but some things are expensive Spectacular sunsets  and beautiful views of the mountains  city lights  Stratosphere  Circus Circus  No slots available here but The Las Vegas Hilton is right next door   min walk   
P =>  A Very Good Value Just spent four nights in a one bedroom suite and we were really pleased with this place as it had everything we wanted  a good full size kitchen with settings and cookware for    a quiet environment overall  ie  no slots in the lobby   an excellent king size bed  jacuzzi soaking tub  en suite washer dryer etc  Really a complete apartment  Eating and everything else in Vegas has gotten much more expensive in recent years so if you have special dietary needs or want to save your bucks for the games then this can be a good value  The place was clean  service was good and it s a   minute walk from the main Hilton and all its activities including a monorail stop  We won t even consider another place on our next trip to crazy town  
P => comfortable Nice place  very clean and comfortable  Deli only and no room service  ent food at the deli sandwiches  salads  etc  Hotel was fairly quiet  which is good to us  Monday through Thursday and alot more noise by Friday  fourth of y weekend   Small pool but attractive landscaping  We used it  the pool  in the morning before       AM and were usually the only people actually in the pool  A couple people poolside smoking away which is unfortunate but Las Vegas is not for nonsmokers  There is a small health club room with a couple of treadmills and a universal type weight machine adequate not fabulous but at least it did not cost       per day to use it  There is also a small red path track that goes around the HGVC hotel  I would recommend renting a car until they get the monorail up and running as the hotel is off of the strip by several blocks and is on the northern end by the Stratosphere  The Las Vegas Hilton is about a quarter of a mile away and you walk through a parking lot garage to get there  I guess you can use the pool there but it was quite crowded and noisy we prefer a more peaceful atmosphere  Several restaurants and casino are available at this Las Vegas Hilton  By the way  don t confuse this with the Flamingo Hilton that is on the strip not too far from the Aladdin  There is another I guess brand new HGVC hotel on the strip that I heard was quite nice  At least four Hilton type establishments on or near the strip  Very confusing initially For those of you who like white noise they have a good fan system and it was pretty quiet in the rooms at night otherwise  
P => Nice  We stayed at the HGVC at the LV Hilton in il of      for a weekend  The suites are nice  and a great value  We paid around      per night for a   bedroom suite  compared to hotels on the strip where suites go for          per night   We generally stay in suites at   and   star hotels  so we re used to great service  superb rooms  etc  The staff was great  very friendly and more than eager to help  The big downer about this property is that is just not a convenient location  It is a        cab ride to everything    and its not the expense that s a bummer  but the hassle  You can t walk ANYWHERE from here  If you don t mind waiting around for the monorail  you re in luck  but we re a little more princessy than that      And although there s never a cab line  there s also never a cab waiting  You have to call for one  Also  the pool at the HGVC is tiny and unimaginative  You can use the pool at the LV Hilton  but we didn t go there  so I can t comment on it  Next time we ll book earlier and stay at the HGVC at the Flamingo Hilton  Great deal  lots of space  much better location  
P =>  Me Too I want to add my voice to those who really liked this place  At this hotel  you are away from all the noise and smoke  The pool is great  A resturant on site would have been nice and it was hard to make a left hand turn out of the parking lot  Overall  however  I would highly recommend staying here  This was my wife s favorite place we ve stayed in Las Vegas  
P =>  Wow Extraordinary  What more can I say  It had everything you could possibly want need or use  I stayed in the one bedroom suite  there isn t a need to talk about all the amenities  because every post before this one has done an excellent job already  I do want to add that our suite had a washer dryer in it which was cool  I guess our only disappointment was a resort this grand should have a shuttle to the strip  I have also stayed at the Bellagio The Orleans  Westgate Flamingo Bay Condo  but when I return to Vegas I ll stay again at H G V C  
P =>  Absolutely Fabulous   After staying in numerous places in Las Vegas  and various timeshares in the US and the Carribean  I have to say this is absolutely the best of all  Most definitely an incredible value   What an incredible view  just a block off the strip so it was your choice to be part of the hustle and bustle crowd or relax away from it  Quaint deli in the lobby  pool table  TV lounge  and very nice  clean pool area  All employees were friendly and made every effort to accomodate our requests  We had a   bedroom which consisted of a   bedroom unit with attached studio  would comfortably sleep    a nice kitchen and addt l kitchenette    tv s  washer dryer  great jacuzzi tub in master  beautifully decorated  Remember this a time share  and compare accordingly  While you may not have the gourmet room service  you gain a home away from home where you can be very comfortable and have anything you want nearby  
P =>  it is the best hotel in vegas this hotel was awsome  i stayed in the  bedroom suite  this thing had a spa bathtub  a sleeper sofa  quot in a living room quot   kitchen  quot i mean a real kitchen quot  and last but not least a master bedroom  i went when it first opened in nov       i got the suite for only        a night  you ll never see that agian but it is still low priced  if you just wanna have fun and come back and relax this is the place  it would really be worth it if you brought along     people  
P =>  Good Hotel Good Hotel with very nice rooms  The are spacious  and have large kitchens  which is a nice surprise  Not much in the way of dining  but we walked next door to the Las Vegas Hilton  so that worked  If you don t mind a couple minute walk then you are fine  No room service here though  Nice pool area  Very comfortable  
P =>  Great value at Hilton Grand Vacation Club on Karen Ave   
P =>  Great Condo Near the Convention Center  
P =>  Great Suite    Best Value I ve seen in LV yet  
P =>  Nice for the price   
P =>  Very Very nice quiet comfortable and big rooms   
P =>  Nicest Suite in LV  
P =>  vakantie Las Vegas  
P => 				  
P => 
P => Excellent value friendly staff great breakfast  Stayed one night  visiting relatives  Great and stylish room  Good to know you can pay less  and still have a stylish updated room to stay in  Stayed last year when the hotel just opened  was so impressed  stayed again this year  Great breakfast included  
P =>  Highly Recommended Stayed           The beds are a dream   the best of the   hotels of my trip out west  Overall a very clean and comfortable place with nice  up to date decor  When I had a little issue at the desk the manager came through with good customer service  The breakfast was very decent  cheese omelette  prepared in advance   bacon  hard cooked eggs  yogurt  muffins  juice  cereal  bagels  etc Regarding location  I didn t mind being off the strip  about a       minute drive on city streets  straight up Rainbow Blvd  then turn right   depending where you want to be on the strip       in fact I preferred being away from the hustle bustle  though I m not a big casino person  We flew into Vegas  rented a car  amp  came here from the airport for an overnight stay prior to departing for the national parks   we only visited the casinos briefly  
P =>  Outstanding Help in Our Hour of Need My wife and I were booked in for one night at the HI Express on the Beltway on arrival in Vegas  The flight was delayed by   hours and we finally arrived at     am  just as the sun was coming up  The hotel was esy to find despite being sleep deprived and the duty staff could not have been more helpful  giving us a late late checkout time of  pm  Breakfast was fresh and served with a smile   just what we needed after    hours without much sleep  The room was really clean  quiet  large and well appointed  with a hyper comfortable bed  Those   hours were the best sleep we had in   weeks in the US  We cannot praise the hotel enought for all they did for us   if only they had been running the airline  
P =>   Great Hotel Great Value  I consider myself a very picky traveler when it comes to choosing hotel accomodations  I stayed at this location for New Years      and it was clean and the staff was quite pleasant  The rooms were cleaned promptly and toiletries replaced as necessary  The free breakfast was a plus  Would most definitely stay again  Beats the Las Vegas strip prices tremendously  
P =>   Comfortable Beds  Holiday Inn Express always has comfortable beds everywhere I have stayed  The free breakfasts are always served with protein and not all just bread  But the comfort of the beds is the most important thing for me  
P =>   Loved the Rooms Breakfast and Nice Service One of the Best Hotels to Stay  Good Spacious Rooms  Newly built and Good View of the Strip from the Windows 
P =>   New Quiet Off the Strip by Nearby This is a fairly new HIE located away from the Strip  but close enough to drive to the Strip easily  And the price isn t bad for Vegas The room was pretty average     clean  everything fine except lighting which was only Fair  Same with the bathroom     all OK except for the Fair dim lighting  Since the place was fairly new  it was neat and clean  and security was good  Reception staff was Very Good     friendly and helpful We did have three negatives about this hotel  the AC was noisy  the WiFi reception was poor  and the lobby coffee in the early morning was old and cold  We look for coffee available and maintained in the lobby       especially since we re usually up and about at   AM   and most of the chain hotels are very good about this  we never use the in room coffee pot because we once saw a maid at another hotel rinsing the coffee pot out using a used wash cloth and hand towel  and it occurred to us that this is probably standard practice    Overall  using our own     rating scale  we give this hotel a      Good Average  
P =>   Perfect in every way We stayed at the Holiday Inn Express y    amp          It was wonderful  Upon arrival they gave us a box of chocolates as I am a Priority Club member  There was also always a bowl of fresh apples at the reception desk all the time  At night  they put out individually wrapped freshly baked cookies at the front desk  The room was immaculate  the hotel is quite new  The bed was extremely comfortable  They serve complimentary continental breakfast every morning in a beautiful dining area adjacent to the lobby  Breakfast includes some hot items like cheese omelets and French toast  There is a large Plasma TV in the breakfast room  There is a complimentary shuttle that will pick you up and take you back to the airport  The shuttle will also take you to the Strip and pick you up for free  We drove our car from Los Angeles  so we didn t use this service  The front desk staff couldn t have been more helpful and pleasant  There are two computers adjacent to the breakfast room with free internet access       If you have your own laptop    I don t    there is free interenet access in your room       We used Priority Club points         per night    to  quot pay quot  for the room  So for us all this was FREE It is about a   min drive to the Strip from the hotel  While the Strip is noisy and crowded  the Holiday Inn Express is quiet  serene and relaxing  They also have a small no frills outdoor pool and jacuzzi  and a small fitness room with a few state of the art machines With the money we saved on the hotel and breakfast each morning  we got tickets to see Bette Midler at Ceasars  She was fantastic   She got   standing ovations  had me laughing at her banter and crying when she sang her famous ballads   quot Wind Beneath My Wings  quot  and  quot The Rose  quot Also  there is a great Chinese restaurant called Grand China just up the road from the hotel  It is one of a chain in Vegas  The food is excellent and reasonably priced   We paid about     for lunch for two Also  because I am a Priority Club member  I called and asked for a complimentary upgrade  They upgraded us to an  quot Executive Suite quot  which had a separate sofa seating area  a microwave and small fridge  Also had in room coffe  which we didn t use because there was complimentary freshly brewed coffee available all day in the dining area Loved this place  Highly recommended  
P =>   Great Stay I had read on tripadvisor that this was a good place to stay in Las Vegas  and I wasn t disappointed  My top priority is that the place I stay is clean  and my room was very clean  My room was large and spacious with a desk and desk chair in addition to the usual motel furniture  The entire motel was non smoking which I really appreciated  I also chose this motel because I could park my own car  instead of valet parking   the refrigerator in the room  and free wireless Internet in my room  The price for the room was below what other places with such amenities would cost  The service from the front desk was excellent and there were no hidden fees  I just had to pay the agreed upon rate for the room and tax  I would certainly recommend this motel to others   I should say that I am a Priority Club member   
P =>  Nice place  Recommended  Very nice place to stay  Clean rooms  fairly new  We re picky and would definitely stay there again  Several restaurants within a block or two  
P =>  Very Impressive  We were pleasantly surprised at the upscale decore  The room was very nice  the bed comfortable  Even a rain showerhead  And just a skip from an exceptionally tasty restaurant with reasonable prices  Blackjack Lodge   We arrived totally exhausted from our long flight from Maui  so weren t interested in more than rest and relaxation  thus I can t comment on the convenience of the strip  but if you are looking for exceptional value  a friendly staff   and comfortable  attractive surroundings THIS IS THE PLACE The internet worked well  the FREE breakfast although  slightly  limited  was very tasty  and appreciated the shuttle to the airport  They even gave us a   hour late check out with no extra charge when we requested it because of our flight times  I have been treated with less consideration by much more expensive establishments  Will I stay here again  Absolutely  Will I recommend it to other travelers passing through  A resounding YES  We were very happy with the service and accomodations provided here  
P =>   Clean New and Four Miles To Strip Holiday Inn  Rainbow  amp  I      Las Vegas Booked a two night stay in an Executive Room  and was very pleased  Hotel is only a few months  quot new  quot  and is positively spotless Beautiful and dramatic design  colors  and textures abound  both in guest room and common areas  Room is somewhat similar in appearance to  quot The Hotel  quot  at Mandalay Bay  albeit on a lesser scale Although hotel offers limited shuttle service  you would be well advised to book this room in tandem with a rental car From McCarren Airport  take I     WEST to Rainbow Blvd  Hotel is just North of exit  While driving to the Strip  I found Russell Road  just   blocks north of hotel to be a quicker conduit  A   mile drive door to door brought me to Mandalay Bay  which is the Southern most Casino on the Strip proper   I actually passed by the other Holiday inn Express on Polaris Avenue   which appears to be appx    blocks to Strip This is a non gaming hotel  but there is a small Restaurant  Bar with limited gaming just a few feet from the lobby entrance Across the street is a sandwich shop  and a    hour convenience store  This is an area of new development  with only a handful of alternate dining options in the immediate vicinity of hotel  Computer kiosk off lobby  nice small pool and jacuzzi  suitable for a dip and not much more  Typical HI Express breakfast fare  muffins  cinnamon rolls  h b eggs  yogurt  cereal  toast  fruit  etc All in all  a very positive experience  
P =>   Good option I choose this hotel because the week i planned my vacations  there were some sort of convention and all the rooms in the strip were above          per room The rooms at the HI express southbelt are clean and spaciosus  there are a shuttle betwen hotel and Mandalay Bay at       am  without return  so it s necesary to rent a car  The duration of the trip betwen the hotel a to the bellagio took me    to    mins  in my rented car  There is a complementary breakfast with hardboiled eggs   yogourts  cinnamon rolls  etc  Just outside there is a good restaurant Black Jack  that opens    hrs  and serves breakfast  lunch and dinner  Good Option   Overall it was a good option due to the rates on the strip  
P => 
P =>   Nice clean hotel in the middle of a ghetto Stayed here over the weekend for another softball tournament  If you are here for gambling I see no reason why you would stay here since it s    miles to the strip and rooms can be found for     there  But we were here for the tournament and thankfully we found this  quot oasis quot  in the middle of what can only be described as a ghetto  The area is crawling with steetwalking  quot hookers quot  and other seedy looking people  Had to get gas twice and was approached by one guy who wanted money for gas and the second time a homeless guy was pushing his cart just feet from my wife and kids  The hotel itself is very nice new and clean with friendly staff  comfortable beds and really nice showerheads  There s a small  quot business center quot  where you can surf the net if needed  As I said  if you NEED to stay in this area  this is the place to stay  Otherwise  the area is not that safe  
P =>   Great surprise  Nice  clean  updated   but the AC failed while we were staying there  They got it up and running within a couple of hours though  The customer service was superb  Would definitely stay there again  Right around the corner from the racetrack yet still close to the strip  
P =>  Love my stay  nice  Excellent hotel  very clean and comfortable After staying   nights at circus circus in Las Vegas  Cirucs Circus was sooo BAD  all the bed sheets and linen was had clearly visible HOLES      However our stay here in Holiday in express for   night and we felt like we are in heaven  We slept so well on SO COMFORTABLE AND CLEAN BEDs This place was so clean and had a nice heated pool outdoors and nice indoor whirlpool  bigger than most other places I have stayed  Staff was friendly and courteous   prompt It is abt    miles from the strip  If you prefer quite  clean place away from strip I would stay here They have free breakfast   Cinnamon Buns  Bagels creamcheese  Fresh cut Fruits  Banna  Orange Hard boiled eggs  Oange and Apple juice  Waffles   cold storage  Nestle Hot chocolate and Oat meal packets  coffee tea and flovaoured Creamers  Irish cream  Hazelnut etc      This is truely an undiscovered GEM   I WILL NOT STAY IN STRIP instea will stay here and drive to strip  
P =>   Interesting and quiet hotel Nice room  clean  nice bathroom  quiet and friendly staff  Hotel  hallway and room had a funny smell in it    weird awful smell  Breakfast and coffee were very good  
P =>  Quite Pleased  The only thing we were concerned about were the warnings about parking outside  That said  it didn t seem like the type of area that would attract a lot of unwanted attention  The room was very nice  loved the shower  and I don t see how the make anything you d make at home breakfast could reasonably have been better  I d readily stay there again  
P =>   Nice enough but further away than you might expect  The hotel itself is fine    clean and comfortable  There is a pretty strong emphasis on security  so I assume it s safe  Signs in the parking lot warn you against leaving anything of value in your car  The breakfast is great  typical bagels  cereal and yougurt but it s free and plentiful  This is hardly an  oasis  though  unless you like being really  really far from the strip  Forget staying here if you have morning business at the convention center   traffic is murder  There is a very well equipped business center with Internet access and a computer with common software and a functioning printer  Probably a great place for a soccer team  There is a small but clean looking swimming pool  The only restaurant nearby is the McDonalds across the street  You could do worse for the money  the rate was pretty reasonable considering that everything else was booked  
P => 
P =>   Pretty ent This hotel has a surprisingly good view of the strip if you are on the right side of the hall  The room was pretty clean  the staff was pretty nice  and the hotel seemed to always be packed with cars at night  which I find comforting knowing that I m not the only one there  However  the security probably needs to be improved a little  About     times a day  there would be a pizza flier slid under my door  probably from some kid the pizza business hired to improve sales    And on the door  going in the side of the hotel  it clearly states  quot no soliciting quot      So either the hotel doesn t care that these people are just coming in and soliciting  or they are really oblivious to who are their guests and who are not     I would never buy pizza from a company that does this by the way They have a shuttle that goes to Mandalay Bay and MGM which is good  I did not use that service  since it only goes till   AM    Which is odd  since most people in Vegas stay out till way past then  I d assume  The bad part of the hotel is that there was NO fridge        I hate that  I mean  you re in a desert and they have no fridge    like wtf  I paid like     plus     or     or so for taxes each night    I think that s probably just about the right price  although it d be better if it was lower    It s a good place to stay at if you re in Vegas for more than a few days  because it gives you a chance to get away from the rustle and bustle and hustle of the casinos  
P =>  clean and new Found the hotel to be worth the      for   nights  ent free breakfast  shuttle service to the strip was excellent too  Rooms were clean and the facilties were fine  The pool area was also well maintained apart from the plunge pool being out of order  If your on a short trip to LV and looking for a clean affordable hotel then i would go for this place  No complaints what so ever  P s try the bar at the top of  quot the hotel quot  for a great view of the strip  The shuttle drops you off there  Fab  
P =>  Fantastic Service Having driven from the Grand Canyon where we stayed at the Holiday Inn Express  we were delighted with the service at this one which was so different from the nights before  No criticisms at all  Really good time and a fantastic selection of in room dining too which was great with small children  
P =>   Fabulous  A very clean hotel  with friendly staff  Free internet access was brilliant  and we were grateful of the shuttle  Breakfast typical  but plenty of choice and ample to eat  Swimming pool was brilliant  we were often the only ones in it  Room excellent  we had a room overlooking the airport  no notable noise from this  in fact we enjoyed sitting on the end of the bed watching the planes take off I m glad we didn t stay on the strip  it was nice to get away from the hussle and bustle  Would definitely stay here again  oh and the price was extremely reasonable  
P =>  Top Notch The hotel  service  and most of all everybody is smiling Just gets you feel welcome and comfortable  
P =>   Great Location Clean Reasonable Price An absolute pleasure  I m so glad I didn t stay on the strip  I ve heard and read horror stories   The staff was friendly and helpful  check in was quick   The room and bathroom was clean and appropriately sized for the price  I was on the  rd floor facing the strip  so the view was amazing I appreciated the free parking  free internet  and free breakfast  The place was easy to find and there was plenty of parking available right in front of the hotel  Not only did I have free internet in my room  but they had a free printer in the lobby  I ve had minor issues with HIE in other cities  but this one was great and I have zero complaints  
P =>   Excellent for the money I was very pleased with my stay at the Holiday Inn Express  The staff was pleasant and helpful  the rooms were relatively spotless and the continental breakfast was above average  The location off the strip was great  especially since it was only a    minute shuttle ride away  It was also convenient that they had an airport shuttle  I would positively recommend this hotel for your next Las Vegas visit  
P =>   Want to go Off Strip  This is the place to stay  We stayed at the Holiday Inn Express for   nights including Christmas Day  The location  whilst off the strip was merely a    minute free shuttle journey to the Mandalay Bay or MGM Grand Hotel on the strip  It is very conveniently located for the airport and Eagle Riders  if you are into hiring motorcycles  The staff was very helpful and friendly  the room was clean and reasonably spacious  The bathroom was well equipped with a decent hairdryer  the only minor thing was that the bath was very shallow not good for wallowing in Breakfast was a rolling program hot cold buffet  perfectly adequate without being excessive  carry out bags were available for early starts or mid morning snacks We were very impressed with the level of customer service  we were waiting for the shuttle one very cold evening at the MGM Grand when it became apparent that it was never going to appear  One quick phone call to the Hotel Receptionist and we were in a taxi that they paid for  including the tip   
P => Clean Comfortable and A  C too  After a bad experience at a striip hotel   no A C    we checked out of that hotel  and into the Holiday Inn   we visited out friends the next day at the Westin  and they still had no A C in the lobby  the restaurants  casino and lounge  We never noticed any airplane noise  but we always carry several pair of earplugs  anyway  We rested so well after the HOT room at the Westin   the Westin employees said that it had been hot for about three days prior to our arrival  also  We had a lovely stay at the Holiday Inn and would now consider staying there next time  
P =>   I would stay here again  We  i e    adults and   teenagers from UK  wanted to stay somewhere that wasn t totally focussed on gambling and we achieved it with this HI Express  Stayed here   nights  and really pleased we didn t stay on the Strip  It was really convenient though because a complimentary shuttle bus runs every   mins to the nearby Mandalay Bay  and hourly to the MGM Grand Hotel  delivering you to the heart of the action  But the noise of the Casinos can drain your energy if you re not into gambling or if you re with kids  so it is really great to stay off the Strip as I said  We had a   Queen bed suite with sofa bed  and the sofa bed was all rusted and the springs were broken  Room      We told reception and they sent up a roll away bed  but this was all broken too and actually held together by a polythene bag  Anyway  the next day the staff moved us to a room with a safe and functioning sofa bed  room     for info   and from then on we had no problems at all  The breakfast was standard HI Express fare  and coffee was available most of the day in the lobby  Laundry facilities  powder was provided for us   ice  vending for cokes  etc no problem Reception staff were fairly friendly  but everything and everyone in Vegas is larger than life  somewhat brash and loud to the point of enjoyable  Hotel pool smallish  but adequate  and a welcome cool off in the heat  It was always quiet round the pool  Overall  excellent value  and as other reviewers say  the money you save by booking here lets you spend on Cirque de Soleil  Grand Canyon etc   By the way  saw  quot O quot  and it was fantastic  saw Blue Man and it was good  If I visited Vegas again   which I won t  I would stay here  
P =>  Excellent Stay at HI Express What a wonderful gem in las vegas  Peaceful  easy to find  and a great staff  The hotel is situated right off of the end of the strip  about a   minute drive from Mandalay Bay  It is great because you are so close to the strip  but you dont have to walk for miles through a casino to find your room  The rooms were nice  standard holiday inn express rooms but always very clean and comfortable  The pool and hot tub were very nice  and the times I used the pool there were hardly any other people ever there  They had outdoor showers and private bathrooms right by the pool which was very convenient  The hotel sits near many main roadways  but I never heard a single noise from the roads  If you get a room facing the front of the hotel  you will also get a wonderful view of the strip  Quite a view at night time The hotel does offer complimentary shuttles to Mandalay bay but they only happen every hour and stop around   PM  There also is a free shuttle to the airport that departs every hour which was very convenient  Breakfast was standard HI express fare  and they always had delicious cookies out for guests during the day and evening  The staff was extremely helpful as well with directions and advice  The one girl even remembered my name and always said hello to us  Overall  a clean  comfortable stay without all the craziness of being on the strip  I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it to anyone  
P =>   Yet another positive Holiday Inn stay As always I am very pleased with the Holiday Inn Express chain   Met my expectations  Free breakfast  close to the strip  easy check in  nice clean bathroom and short walk to room    The staff was also very friendly   The only problem I had was with the hide a bed   the linens that they gave us were WET     When I called in to get more linens they brought back more WET linens  So i sent those back   On the  rd try I finally got some sheets that were dry to put on the sofa bed   The room was very comfy and quiet when we went to bed   I did not notice the walls being thin at all    we also had the air on most of the time    The holiday inn breakfast was great as always  altho the new omeletes kind of suck     I love their cinnamon rolls   The pool and hot tub were very nice as well and each time I went to them I was the only person    which I love      The gym however was lacking  They had a treadmill  eliptical and a stepper  And a SMALL dumbell tree with dumbells only up to   lbs    the holiday inns usually have a universal weight machine  but this one doesnt     This place is a must if you rent a car as you can escape all the craziness of the strip when its time for bed   
P =>   Great Alternative to the Strip We usually go to Las Vegas each year for a business convention and have discovered the great deals of a few years ago no longer exist so we decided not to stay on the strip and opted for the Holiday Inn Express South Las Vegas  It was a good choice  just far enough away from the frenzy that is Vegas  but close enough to get to shows restaurants etc  The hotel proivdes a shuttle service to the Mandalay Bay Hotel  where the convention was being held  every    minutes  and to the MGM Grand on the hour  so both my husband and I made good use of both these services  The MGM Grand was a better destination for me as it put me closer to the monorail or the bus service  whereas  getting off at the Manadalbay still meant a good    minute walk to the strip or to the monorail to the Excalibar Hotel The hotel itself is standared Holiday Inn  rooms are functional but somewhat impersonal  but the beds are FANTASTIC  most comfortable bed I think I have ever slept in and the pillows are great too  They offer an express breakfast which is ok  cereal  yoghurt  toast etc  all on throwaway plates but it is included in the room rate  I would definitely stay here again  just for the simple fact there is no casino to have to walk through to get anywhere in the hotel is a bonus for me  
P =>   Not bad overall but some problems I think this is the third time I ve stayed here in three years and it has been relatively consistent  though I think it is a bit overpriced for what you get these days The Good  hotel property and the rooms well maintained and clean  Friendly  helpful staff The Bad  Thin walls   you can clearly hear conversations and the TV from the next door rooms  The breakfast leaves a lot to be desired  I didn t touch the hot food since it looked very unappetizing and I didn t want to risk getting sick on the plane home  The cold food was all on the cheap end of the scale  Not the worst  free  hotel breakfast I ve had  but nothing better than middle of the road   I expected more for the room price  Though the surrounding area seems relatively safe  it is mostly light industry and  if you are not spending time on the strip  it is a bit of a drive to find a decent restaurant  The wireless internet connection was decently fast  but was out in the morning which prevented me from printing my boarding pass and completing some last minute flight preparations Overall  I give it an average rating  More care given toward breakfast would put this hotel into the above average category  
P =>  Great budget option We split our stay in Vegas moving off strip for the expensive holiday weekend  We were pleasantly surprised with the hotel and would definitely recommend it as a budget option  The staff were really friendly and helpful  We had the hotel pool and hot tub to ourselves most days and it was lovely and peaceful after the chaos of the strip  The hotel was clean and the other services   free internet and buffet breakfast were great  The hotel also ran a shuttle to the MGM once an hour and Mandalay Bay every half hour which was really handy  
P =>   Great place for Race fans My sister and i were in town for the Nascar  really  and chose the Holiday Inn for our   night stay largely due to the reasonable price  Having spent the first part of our stay at the MGM we were not bothered about being off strip as most of our time would be spent at the racetrack We checked in mid afternoon and although we did not have to wait in line  the phones rang non stop so it did take a while to get checked in  To complicate matters our stay was split over two bookings  however the check in agent did a great job to keep us in the same room for the duration of our stay  This was much appreciated and only required us to get our key cards reactivated next morning Our room was on a non smoking floor and was a good size with plenty of counter space and featured a TV and coffee maker  The beds were very comfortable and came with a selection of firm and soft pillows  The bathroom was also a good size with a hairdryer and had plenty of space for two girls worth of toiletries  The Holiday Inn s free breakfast did not disappoint and contained a varied selection of cereals  bagels  muffins  cinnamon rolls  yoghurts  eggs  bacon as well as juices and tea and coffee  It did seem to take a while for items to be replenished though when they ran out  There were staff around so i m not sure what the cause of the delay was As i mentioned this hotel is not located on the strip and is a good       minute walk to the Mandalay Bay Convention Centre on the strip  This is when the free shuttle comes in to its own  Running twice an hour to the Convention centre at the southern end of the strip and hourly to the MGM Grand this gives easy strip access for all  We found the shuttle drivers to be friendly and accommodating of everyones needs  especially the guy who dropped us right at the bus stop on the strip at  am on Sunday morning to catch the bus to the track    The complimentary return shuttle ride to the airport leaves one less thing to worry about The Holiday Inn also has an outdoor pool  guest laundry and the free internet access in the lobby enabled us to get checked in for our flight home on our last day Overall we enjoyed our stay and the Holiday Inn and the hotel more than served its purpose  I would primarily recommend this hotel for those on a budget and or those with their own transport  The shuttle is good  dont get me wrong  but for first timers nothing quite beats direct access from hotel to strip  
P =>  Great Hotel says   Aussies  My husband and I and another couple stayed here for   nights in a shared room with   queen size beds  The   of us were all of the same opinion great hotel  friendly staff  location was great away from the strip  no problem with catching shuttle  Shared a taxi back in the wee hours so cheap between   of us  I had some queries before booking this hotel and emailed them direct  They were very prompt at replying and information regarding buses  weather  restaurants etc  also helpful when we hadn t visited Vegas before  Staff very friendly and helpful during stay  Returning to Vegas in tember      with my husband      year old mother   sister and will certainly stay here again  
P =>   Good hotel Stayed here for   nights at the end of our vacation We stayed at the Bellagio for the first   nights but preferred our stay here A good breakfast without having to queue or pay extra for  No lengthy walk through a smoky casino  Comfy beds and pillows  helpful friendly staff Although we had a car we used the excellent shuttle services to Mandalay Bay and found the restaurants there very good cheaper than the Bellagio and no queues even at Thanksgiving  
P =>  Love this hotel We stayed in this hotel from   rd  to           It is a friendly  clean  cosy hotel for a family of three    adults and a   year old boy   The bed and blanket are very comfortable and clean  The room is spacious  The carpark is convenient  Their breakfast contains a varity of choice and most important yummy and free  The self laundry service is cheap and convenient  It is located on the  nd floor of the hotel  Staff there are friendly and helpful  Though it is off from the Strip  the service of their shuttle buses are frequent  We did not find any problem to find easy and free parking in the Strip area  therefore did not worry about the transportation from Strip  Actually  we enjoyed the quiet and residential feeling of the neighbourhood than Strip area  The gasoline station is near and it is convenient for us to go any scenic and shopping areas  like the Red Rock Canyon  Lake Mead  Hoover Dam  Blouder City  There is a cafe pub called Pizza    in Blouder City where the pizza and pasta are very delicious and yummy    Premium Outlet  etc etc  The only complaint is that the wall of the rooms are a bit thin and the sewage of the bathtub did not work very well in our room  however acceptable  I will definitely go back to this hotel if I go to Las Vegas next time  
P =>   Loved It    My Husband and I  stayed at this location for   week the first week of ember  We absoutley loved it here  It was our  th trip to Vegas in   years and we have stayed at the Excalibur and MGM Grand previously  However we were very happy with this hotel  It is locoated about half a mile from the strip  They do offer free shuttle at the top and bottom of every hour to and from Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand  They also offer a free shuttle to the airport for departure only  The hotel room was large and very clean  Two large queen beds  which were very very nice  The was a large dresser and a desk and sofa area  The room also had a coffee maker  microwave and mini fridge  The washroom was very clean and pretty big as well  We were on the third floor and asked for a  quot strip quot  view at check in and were upgraded for free to a room which faced the strip  It was pretty nice The hotel does offer free breakfast every day which included  waffles  cereal  oatmeal  toast  yogurt  etc  There is no restaurant in this hotel  but there is a gas station next door where you can purchase snacks  etc  and the prices are pretty cheap  overall we loved this hotel  It was very quiet  non gaming hotel  The staff was very friendly and always smiled and said hello  We would diffently stay here again  
P =>   More than meets expectations If you just want a nice  quiet  non casino place to stay in Vegas  then this place IS IT  We have stayed on other occasions at on strip  off strip and non gaming hotels and this one comes up tops  previous stays at the Golden Nugget  MGM Grand  Aladin  Courtyard  Candlewood Suites   Parking area was brightly lit The front desk staff was friendly and professional  Check in out was a breeze  The hotel lobby area was brightly lit  The room was large and functional  Both the room and bathroom were EXTREMELY clean  The bed and bedspreads were great  Very good mattress which was of medium hardness softness depending on how you look at it  A big plus is the HIE touch to offer   of each kind of pillow  both firm and soft   The front desk mentioned that they are planning to upgrade their    quot  TVs to flat panels soon so do feel free to check with them if that is something important to you  wasn t a big deal to me since the TV worked very well   A reviewer earlier mentioned aircraft noise at this hotel  We didn t experience this at all  I really doubt that we would have missed the aircraft noise if they were  quot booming quot  overhead  try Hilton LAX for that one    The free wireless is always great   
P =>   good hotel rude guests We stopped here for one night on our way out of Vegas  We had come from the MGM Signature so expected the HIE to be a low quality  Surprisingly  the hotel was very pleasant  with a large  clean and comfortable room  and typical HIE facilities  The guy at the front desk was polite and helpful  Unfortunately  the hotel was hosting a group of K   Police officiers who were on a training exercise  We got to see rather more of them than we would have liked as they were spending the afternoon next to the pool just like we were  They dominated the entire pool hot tub area and were thoroughly obnoxious   swearing  drinking whisky from brown paper bags  shouting  fighting  and spilling alcohol in the pool  It s amazing that police officers could behave so appallingly  Although not a direct reflection on the quality of the hotel  it s a shame the staff didn t tone down their behaviour  However  what would they have done   call the police  We d stay here again   but would check they weren t hosting any cops first  
P =>  Nice hotel Good quality hotel  Superior beds and good breakfast  Excellent choice for those wanting a casino free hotel  One small improvement would be the inclusion of an airport shuttle pick up given the pricing position of the rooms  
P =>   plane spotters dream We found this hotel to be far noisier than staying on the strip  we stayed one night prior to flight back home and so wanted a quiet night  Planes were taking off almost overhead every    seconds or so till late at night and from early in the morning  Apart from the plane noise the air conditioning unit was very noisy and the walls are very thin good points rooms clean and tidy pool ok and free breakfast buffet There is a useful shuttle bus every half hour to and from the Mandalay Bay Hotel but too far from the strip if you want the  quot vegas experience quot The hotel is in the middle of a developing business park close to the I   on the other side of the strip  as for value for money can t complain at     per night but if wanting to get the best out of your stay pay more and stay on the strip 
P =>   Great location Our family stayed at this Hotel not having been to Las Vegas previously  The Hotel is   minutes from Mandalay Bay and is reached via the free shuttle running every    minutes until midnight  A taxi fare is approximately   USD The staff at the Hotel were amongst the best I have ever experienced in both attitude and service  Particulary Brian and Brett on the front desk and the two regular drivers another Brian and Pierre The free breakfast was basic but sufficent and free tea and coffee all day  There are additional vending machines for drinks and snacks  Note there is no restaurant at the Hotel but you can easily order food in  The pool is not special but very nice and is often empty and feels like your own pool  plenty of clean towels provided On the strip if you need transport take the Deuce bus but if you are in a hurry you better just walk as it was so slow  Recommend you visit the half price ticket booths for shows saving a fortune  Sky diving was fantastic with Sin city and worth the money as is the Dolphin habitat at the Mirage Would definately recommend the Hotel and is close to the strip for the action but also far enough away for a rest  When we go back we will stay at this Hotel which is child friendly  
P =>   Excellent   This hotel proved to be the perfect stop over hotel for us in Vegas before we started our tour of Utah and Arizona  The rooms were spotlessly clean and extremely spacious  The beds and pillows  in particular  were very comfortable after our long haul flight from the UK  The breakfast was more than adequate with a good selection of cereals  bagels  pastries  etc  The staff were very helpful and friendly  We did not use the pool so I cannot comment  We would definately stay here again and I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good value hotel which is near too  but not located directly on the Strip  
P =>  Great Hotel Great Value The location is excellent  Internet is free  Don t expect to walk to anything as it isn t on the strip  But they do have a free shuttle to Mandalay Bay  The rooms were clean  The maids very nice  This hotel is a good value at any price around     Dollars  Negotiate  The pool was is nice and uncrowded   The breakfast is good  I will use this property again  
P =>  Nice Clean Hotel We arrived on y    for   nights  We found the hotel to be just what a hotel should be  Clean and comfortable  The staff were fantastic especially Brian  who supplied us with bottled water when the vending machine was empty and even baked cookies and supplied a cold glass of milk for our daughter one night  I have to say  that was above and beyond what we expected The rooms are spotless  as said in other reviews and I am really fussy  The walls are really thin though  I heard in detail  through the wall  from some guys in the next room  all about their  quot show quot  experience  I am glad that they didn t wake my daughter up  However  someone must have complained about the noise  as the staff were up quite promptly to sort out the problem The pool is quite and clean and there is a safe relaxed atmosphere there I see this as being a hotel for families with younger kids staying in Vegas and people on business  Our family would definitely stay again  but if my husband and I were in Vegas without our daughter  we would stay on the strip  The shuttle bus they put on there is great  but if we were there to gamble  I enjoy being able to easily walk back up to our room without the hassle of buses and taxies  We all definitely give this place a big thumbs up  
P =>   liked this hotel enjoyed our stay here although we had some difficulty finding it as there are   roads called polaris avenue and we cruised up and down the wrong one  once we found it we were very happy with it  Nice room  good size  clean  We had a car so were happy with the location  Nice breakfast  not too busy  good price for Las Vegas  would stay again 
P =>  Very overrated taxi rides will cost you a fortune  Stayed at the Mandalay Bay mdiweek until it got to expensive and booked this on Hotwire at         after seeing it had the  th best customer satisfaction rating  First off  the person checking us in insisted on putting my    year old daughter and I in a king size bed with me because  quot that was what Hotwire had us down for  She did not seem to understand that there was something quite wrong with that  After going over her head and having the great vibe of our vacation taken away  we managed to get two double beds  This hotel is fine for someone resting their weary head on a business trip  however it is not suitable for a vacation style hotel  The pool lacks any charm and the area is  quot devegetated quot   For a few more bucks I would strongly suggest booking a better hotel  This hotel is in the middle of nowhere and any savings on the room will be eaten alive by taxi rides  I have been to Vegas over     times and this place is truly near the bottom  They do have free wireless which is nice and a small size workout room  
P =>  Just one negative I have to agree with most of the reviews  A nice property and the staff was just great  Especially keeping in mind that this is Las Vegas  I enjoyed not being in a casino hotel for this trip  The only negative for us was that the walls are thin  Noticable sound from the next room  Guest there seemed to think that you have to yell into a cell phone  Sound problems from other rooms is not typical for HIX 
P =>  Fantastic hotel Stayed at this property for two nights during our month long road trip of California and Nevada and we were not disappointed  Charming friendly and very helpful front desk staff  all of them   Fabulous room  large  extremely clean and with lovely new fresh white bedding  you can buy this online after you leave   Perfectly adequate free breakfast We asked for a room overlooking the strip on a high floor  about   mile away  as suggested by a previous reviewer  These are to the front of the hotel and we were surprised as to how close the strip seemed  great pictures taken at night  but without the incessant noise and hustle and bustle  Be warned however  there is a building plot directly in front of the hotel and once built on will obliterate this view completely  Building works next door but no noise heard at all  All in all a wonderful experience and we would not hesitate to highly recommend this property and it s location  
P =>   Good value off strip haven  Stayed here at the end of il after flying in to Vegas from the UK  I wanted somewhere off strip so that the noise and madness was optional  and that s exactly what we got  I d echo all the positive comments below about comfort  cleanliness  value etc and there s not much more i can add on that front  we stayed here two nights  then did a driving tour of California  then back to Vegas for two nights on the Strip  so can compare both options  In summary  i d suggest this place is perfect for independent minded people who want to experience Vegas without the inconveniences of the big Strip hotels   lines for everything  hit and miss service  etc  Oh  and who don t mind at least one person not drinking at dinner so they can drive back  tho a cab is only     or so from the near end of the strip  and the HI do provide a shuttle bus option too I heard no airplane noise either  Really don t know what s going on with that  unless the flight path changes based on wind direction or something A few particular positives about this hotel  and i guess being off strip in general   no long traffic queue to get to the hotel  no long walk from the car park  and no lines to check in  We could have been in our rooms within    minutes of picking up the rental car   it s quiet   no drunken groups in the hallways at night  or shrieking cleaners in the hallways in the morning   breakfast included   and by UK standards  a large and thorough breakfast  yes you might want to go pig out at a buffet afterwards  but it s nice to have the option of at least a quick coffee   snack first if you want a slower start to the day   POOL  amp  hot tub were a big plus because there was never anyone in them  You ll never get any part of the pool to yourself in one of the big hotels  And  it was open until midnight if you fancied a dip before bed  which i love  Strip hotels tend to close their pools quite early  i guess to stop drunk people falling in them or something  i don t know Only negative we found   aircon was pretty much on or off  and a bit noisy  
P =>  A great hotel for the money  I searched long and hard for an affordable but clean hotel for our three night Vegas stay  Trip Advisor reviews were very helpful   Our room at the Holiday Inn Express was squeaky clean  All amenities were as described  The beds were quite comfy despite my bad back  Staff was friendly and helpful  We enjoyed the varied continental breakfast each AM and what a timesaver   no long lines at a casino breakfast buffet  Some reviews spoke of airport noise but the a c fan drowned out any plane noise  which was sparse to begin with  We had the spa and pool to ourselves each evening  Parking was close and convenient and no lines at the front desk for check in  Sure  it s not on the strip  but only a short drive takes you there  We did not use the free shuttle to the Mandalay   Quiet  clean  and just         per night  AARP price    who could ask for anything more  A good birthday trip  
P =>   Great place  We are currently guests at the Holiday Inn Express On Polaris in Las Vegas  After having thoroughly read all the reviews for this hotel  I decided it sounded like a good deal to me  We were able to book this room with       Priority Club points per night  We found the hotel very easy to get to from the car rental station at the airport  The whole hotel smells clean and fresh  and the beds here among the finest I have ever had at any hotel  Although the hotel is very airport handy  and others have written here complaining of airplane noise hindering their sleep  I can say that I never heard a plane fly over the entire   days we have been here  The Air conditioning units have a fan setting that allows you keep the fan running constantly   heat or air  and that must act as white noise to cover the noise from the airport very well  The AC is a window type unit  but it is controlled by a thermostat on the wall  Always a plus staying at any HI Express is free continental breakfast and free in room wireless hi speed internet  Breakfast is identical of course to any HI Express  I am in room      and the view from my room includes several hotels on the strip   from the backside  including the Bellagio   My view also includes the interstate  so don t think I am saying it s just like staying on the strip  We are in an  quot executive quot  room  which does have a small refrigerator and microwave and coffee maker  along with a sofa sleeper and coffee table  This the last night of my   night stay here  and I have slept like a baby the last two nights  The front desk staff has been very helpful in offering information about the hotel and the area  the shuttle to Mandalay Bay  and back routes to strip hotels during rush hour It s just been a great place to stay  and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable and clean place to stay in Vegas  i you don t mind being a little bit away from the strip  
P =>  Great   If you want to live at the end of a runway   We booked this hotel because of all the great reviews on here about it   What a mistake   The hotel is nice  furnishings  clean etc   however WE COULD NOT SLEEP  The airport is about   blocks from the end of the Mccarran Airfield and there are planes taking off literally every minute all day and all night  less frequet at night but we counted    between midnight and  am  Because it is so close to the airport there is so much noise from airplane engines  The pool is not a relaxing space because of the noise from planes constantly droning  If you want a relaxing hotel and the use of a pool avoid this hotel at all costs  true  it is great inside but the noise from plans ruins the whole place  
P =>  Good  but   Having stayed at Holiday Inn Express in Detroit and Solvang  California  I knew that the one in Las Vegas would be a pretty safe bet  But I must say I m a bit surprised that Tripadvisor members rate this as the    best hotel value in Vegas  The rooms are perfectly fine  and the staff is friendly and efficent  I agree with most of the positive comments about the hotel  but here s why I can t give this hotel more than three points    Some advisors say that the noise from the airport isn t that loud  All I can say is that that depends on in whitch direction the planes are taking off  If they take off over the hotel the noise is quite bothersome    The AC   at least in my room   was very loud    In a time when many budget hotels in Vegas offer    quot  flat screen TVs  HIE still has old school TV s  And the reseption on mine was pretty bad on several channels     The location  I desided to stay at this hotel because I wanted to stay off the Strip  But the area is dull  you can t walk to the strip  so you do need a car  Unless you want to spend money on taxis  or wait around for the shutle that runs to Mandaly Bay every half hour until midnight that is     The price is good  but not great  compared to other great off strip deals like The Orleans or South Point  However there is one thing the others can t beat HIE on   the beds  I m a regular visitor to Las Vegas and have stayed at more than    different hotels  Only at Paris have I been as comfortable in bed as I was here  And a room at Paris cost twice as much The Holiday Inn Express is a safe bet for an off strip hotel  But be aware that everything is not as perfect as some advisors seems to think  Have a nice trip to Vegas   and good luck  
P =>   A great value What a surprise  This is a well run  nicely equipped with upscale furnishings establishment  Honestly expected this to be quite basic  but excellent service combined with no casino and lovely interiors will bring me back next time I m in Las Vegas  
P =>   Excellent hotel Stayed at this hotel              Was very clean and in very good condition  newer hotel   Staff at front desk very helpful  The breakfast was very good  Easy to get to the strip as the free shuttle left every half hour to the Mandalay Bay  You can also catch the shuttle back to the hotel from the Mandalay Bay but make sure you wait for it on the lower valet level where the shuttle sign is  Safe area to do your morning run if you are a runner as it is located in a nice commercial area  Booked this hotel by reading all the previous reviews and was not disappointed  The reviews are right on  Pool is very good and hot tub very nice  See pics in this review  Very good value for the money  
P =>   Good value close to the strip I was attending a conference in Las Vegas  I could not get the group rate for the Mandalay Bay and their best public rate was more than double the rate for the Holiday Inn  The Mandalay does not include HIE free breakfast or the free internet access  there is wireless in the rooms and a PC and free printer in the lobby   I have stayed at several Holiday Inn Express hotels and the formula is pretty similar  but this one was by far the nicest  The beds and pillows  choice of hard or soft  had been upgraded and were a dream to sleep on  The rooms look almost new and bathroom  shower etc were in great condition  The holiday inn continent breakfast is typically a bit limited  but here they had a better choice with Yogurt and fresh fruit  There was a free shuttle every    mins to the Mandalay bay  which is just the other side of the freeway     mins  and it you have plenty of time you can take the free shuttle train from Mandalay to Excalaber then walk from Excalaber to the MGM and then catch the monorail into town     single      all day   The location is really the only downside of this hotel if you want to be able to walk out of your hotel onto the strip then this isn t the place for you  If you have car or take the shuttle described above then just look at how much you will save  None of my friends were impressed with their rooms  mostly at the Mandalay bay    at the price they paid they all complained about taking    mins to walk through the casino to get from their room to the car park and rooms which were tired and even dirty  The other great feature of the holiday inn is the pool spa  Even in  it was warm enough for swimming the in outdoor heated pool and the spa was great  
P =>   Secret off the Strip  I stayed   nights at Luxor then   nights here  A free stay as I transferred Amex points to Holidays Inn s Priority Club Rewards Points   I would have paid the going rate here  This hotel is less than   minutes from the strip  NO Valet as parking is right outside the doors  NO long walks to rooms  I was in room     directly across from the elevators and heard nothing  I had an executive suite with a mini fridge  coffee pot and microwave  Bathroom was nice        extended shower curtain and and a  quot rain drop quot  showerhead  Beds were like sleeping on clouds  Very  very comfortable  Duvets with   pillows  Bedding was top notch  You can request soft or firm pillows  FREE internet access in lobby  Free continental breakfast and a newspaper    minutes after we checked in our room  the front desk called to see if we needed anything and if the room was up to our liking   Nice classy touch    Thank you management   Having done the strip hotels numerous times         we will definetly be back  They also have a free shuttle to Mandalay Bay twice an hour         And on the  nd floor is a laundry room  Nice touch considering I hate the smell of smoke and it was nice to wash everything before packing to go home  It was a nice switch from walking through chimney smelling casinos  Front desk always smiling and ask if you need anything                 Can t say enough about my stay here          except it was great      
P =>  A good stay This is a newish hotel  and the d cor is clean and bright  The staff are all very courteous and helpful  We had never been to Las Vegas and didn t really want to stay on the strip  This hotel is a good alternative   it s just on the other side of the interstate  but there is a shuttle to the Mandalay Bay resort which runs on the half hour and works well  from Mandalay Bay you can catch the free tram to the Excalibur  walk across the road to MGM Grand and the monorail and head up the strip  You can walk to most spots from the monorail stations  The noise from adjoining rooms was noticeable  but not bad  When the iron in our room didn t work  a new one was provided within minutes  It s probably time that hotels like HIE stopped using disposal plates and cutlery for their breakfast though  it s wasteful and probably irresponsible in this era of environmental awareness  
P =>   This place is awesome  I can t believe I would say that about a Holiday Inn  but this is the first time I ve stayed in a HI Express  and I was very impressed  I ve travelled quite a lot in the past year  and this was the newest  cleanest and most comfortable room that I ve had  no questions  This hotel is still new  only about   years old  and is in very good condition  My husband and I stayed here over the Thanksgiving holiday  and even at such a busy time the pool was empty and the breakfast room always had seats available  This seems like a small thing to be grateful for  but majority of the times I stay at a hotel with free breakfast the room is so crowded that there is no place to eat  and I often skip it altogether  My extended family stayed at the Flamingo  and for the same nightly rate I got free internet and free breakfast without having to walk through a smoky casino  so I think I got the better deal  
P =>   An oasis just off the strip My recent experiences at this place match those of many of the others who have commented about this place  It is a nice  quiet hotel off of the hustle and bustle that is the Strip  My stay was from           The good   ent location  Off of the strip  so it s actually quiet and a welcome retreat off the Strip  Easy to get to from the airport  and easy to catch I        to access the other parts of the city Free shuttle to Mandalay Bay  Ran roughly     and     past the hour most of the time I was there  Operated from  am to   pm  so late night excursions are limited  Taxi s are a better option for late night  but for morning and afternoon excursions  the shuttle works well  Helpful  curtious staff  They went out of their way to make sure I was being served well  No real complaints hereThe not so great  Did wish the breakfast bar was a little more robust  It s an okay way to start out the day and probably will tide most people over til they can hit the buffets at the casinos  but I m a little picky   One pc in the lobby  Did wish they had another  since it was busy most of the time I tried to use it  If you have a notebook PC with a wireless card  or even if you don t have a wireless card  they encourage you to use that option by giving you access infomation   checkin  Will be considering that option next time I stay there I would stay there again  when I do make it back to Vegas  It s definitely a great place to stay  
P =>   After a lot of searching we made the right choice   Demographic  Middle aged  middle class husband and wife  looking for a good  value  for our accommodation dollars I have a lengthy review below because I like to read indepth reviews  For those of you who are here to skim  here s the money shot    Book a room there  now  So  we were going to Vegas for the first time  We are simple Midwestern folk who live a normal  middle class life  Live in a modest home  couple of kids  dog and cat  We wanted to stay in a clean  nice place where we would feel safe I searched  literally  for over    hours before settling on this property  The reason I didn t find it sooner was because for some unknown  unfair reason it was rated as a   star property  users rated it     stars   In reality it is at least a   star in my opinion  Details follow below Firstly  we booked through the hotels web site about a month and a half in advance  We paid     a night for a Mon Friday stay After finding out the hard way that Polaris Street is not continuous and we were on the wrong side of the break  a call to the hotel yielded the needed directions to rescue us Upon arrival we were greeted with a nice  clean  orderly looking outside of the hotel  So far so good  Going inside we were welcomed by a very nice gal who was courteous and helpful  I requested a strip view room  but she already had us in one facing the strip  Things were going well Up to the second floor and opening the door revealed a nice clean smelling room   All rooms are NON smoking   They have a      charge for anyone who defiles the room with smoke  Good for them  I apologize if you smoke  but we who don t are sickened by stale cigarette smoke smell  ugh The bathroom was spotless and the rest of the room didn t show any appreciable wear and tear beyond a cracked wall socket plate  Holiday Inn Express  HIE  makes a big deal about the bedding setup  We chose a King bed and it was comfortable  has   pillows    soft and   firm  and some fancy sheets and stuff  Who knows  I m a guy so not real important to me The towels were kick a    Very nice and fluffy One of the primary reasons I chose this property was the FREE in room high speed Internet Access  I am a computer geek  but frankly  my dad could have set it up  it was that easy  The access speed was adequate at    Kbs  There is also a complimentary computer and laser printer in the lobby if one does not carry a laptop A FREE breakfast bar is available from              If I remember correctly   Cinnamon rolls were very good  They also had a ton of other eats and drinks  Cereal  bagels  toast  fruit  hard boiled eggs  OJ  milk  coffee  etc We interacted with the staff a few times and each time was outstanding  One word of warning  the wake up call service they use was running   minutes or so behind and the first morning did not call at all  There is an alarm clock in the rooms so it is not that big of deal  but since I have been gushing I thought I would mention the one little flaw I found The location of the hotel is off strip somewhat  You  could  walk it  but it would be a jaunt for sure  We rented a car from Alamo  very good experience there also  and just drove over since there are     locations to park for free once you get there The first night we took the hotel sponsored shuttle  It is free  but be advised it only runs until        so for most people that will be way too early  The other issue is it only drops off at the Mandalay Bay which is severe south strip  It is a  long  long  way to the other end  The first night we walked until we were about to fall over  The next day we found we had made it just about     of the way up the strip  I forget to mention they also provide a free USA Today for those who want it So  to close  we were extremely happy with this hotel and would absolutely stay here again  It may be rated by Expedia as   stars  but it is much nicer than that  Since it is a small property  the service the staff provides is more like the Midwest service we are used to back home One last thought  if you go to Vegas you  have  to eat at the Rio s seafood buffet  OMG  all you can eat lobster  I was such a pig  but my God it was great   Hint  Get a fun book from Harrah s  It has a     per person coupon for the buffet  Which is     a head normally  and they will shuttle you from the Harrah to the Rio for free Also  if you find this review helpful or just want to ask me a question  feel free to contact me at  tomrakers programmer netCheers  
P =>  Clean Convenient and Very Nice  We only spent one night in Vegas before we headed to the Grand Canyon and northern Arizona  It was a great hotel at a fantastic price  We got a huge discount by paying in advance through their website  There was a wonderful free breakfast  hard boiled eggs  cereal  bagels  waffles  yogurt  juice  coffee  hot chocolate  etc  The rooms were very modern and very clean  The bed was extremely comfortable  It reminded me of the  quot Heavenly Beds quot  that are advertised at Westins  The shower was wonderful  The view was a nice panorama of the strip  It was convenient to the strip without all of the hassles of the strip  Overall  the best hotel I ve stayed in for a few years  
P =>   Perfect spot This was the first hotel that we stayed in on our   week driving trip around the west coast  The room was clean and was big enough for the   of us  The location was great  we drove to the strip self parked for free without any problems and explored  We left the strip of an evening and went shopping and had dinner off the strip  We left the hotel for one night to go to the Grand Canyon and left our things in the room without any problems  The breakfast was self service and was a great light healthy start to the day  I am so glad that we didn t stay on the strip but stayed here  The children got to see Vegas but were away from the strip at night  
P =>  We ll be back  I took a gamble on this location  and it was the best bet I made in Vegas  My husband had a   day seminar at the Mandalay Bay in early tember  and after seeing all the good reviews on this site  I decided to take a chance and stay here  saving     per night off the  quot special seminar rate quot  at the Mandalay  WHAT A GREAT CHOICE  The rooms are spotless and comfortable  relatively quiet  especially being this close to the airport   and the bathrooms are hospital clean  Free continental breakfast  free wireless internet  huge for us   super helpful front desk staff  and a free shuttle every    minutes to the Mandalay  Great pool and hot tub  and unlike some of the trendier places on the strip  no fighting for chairs  A huge bonus for us is that you don t have to wander around in a smoke filled casino for    minutes to get out of the building  or down to the pool  It is away from the action  yet close enough to be in the middle of it within    minutes  If you aren t in Vegas for the gambling  or want to get away from it when you are finished   you won t regret the Holiday Inn Express  
P =>  Great one night stay We stayed at the Holiday Inn Express for one night the first part of tember  Check in was very smooth and the desk staff was very professional  When we got back to our room following some time at a local casino  they d left a message making sure that everything was meeting our needs The room was wonderful  Very comfortable beds and pillows  I couldn t decide which I liked more    the bed or the shower  which was also great  The breakfast bar met our expectations  Several different kinds of muffins bagels frozen waffles pastries  along with fruit  coffee  juices and cereal  We would definitely stay here again  and will also be looking for other Holiday Inn Express hotels for our future travel plans  
P =>  Nice Hotel   Would stay again Spent a three day weekend at the Holiday Inn Express  Very clean rooms and pleasent staff  Very quiet and the bed pillows rocked  A C was perfect  Holiday Inn Express is becoming my favorite place to stay everywhere  The shuttle to the Mandalay Bay saved a    cab fare  From the Bay  you can take tram to the Excalibur and then take the Monorail from the MGM all the way to the Stratosphere  Very easy and you save some dough for cab fares  Ask the shuttle driver the day you have to go to the airport to see if they can take you  Most likely they will and its free  Only bad thing was that a vending machine at the hotel took my money  Certainly not a big deal in Vegas compared to what the slots took  
P =>  Perfect After spending   nights on the Strip  we needed a cheaper hotel to spend our last night before our flight home  Having read the reviews on Trip Advisor I went ahead and booked a room for my family     adults  amp    teenagers  Very spacious  modern  clean and well equiped room  Complimentary continental breakfast  internet access and shuttle to the strip  The staff were very friendly and helpful  offering local info   even though we were only there for one night  The kids loved the pool and hot tub   again this area was spotlessly clean and tidy   nice shower area and toilet facilities  The only drawback was construction in the area   much like the rest of Vegas at the moment     but this didn t cause us any problems  I would highly recommend this hotel   if you aren t bothered about staying on the Strip  having done so for the first   nights   it s not all it is cracked up to be    this hotel is perfect   the complementary shuttle service gets you to the strip   about   mins drive away  You can then hop on the deuce bus at    for the day   you can just hop on and off where and when ever you chose   This hotel was also    mins from the airport   but plane noise was not a problem  
P =>   Good location good front desk butpoor housekeeping  Let s start saying that this hotel  even if not directly on the strip  has an optimal location  If you can move with your own  or rented  car  the strip is   minutes far The swimming pool is good and not very busy The breakfast is almost the same you can find in any other holiday express hotel  Talking about bad things  we ve been very unlucky with housekeeping service  during our four days stay we found our room undone after     pm for three consecutive days  The last day  our room was still undone at     pm Said that  we found our rooms always very clean Overall  the front desk service is good  but housekeeping organization needs strong improvements  
P =>  Good alternative to strip Stayed here for one night in ust  Nice  clean room with new bed linens and showerhead  This is a good alternative to staying on the strip  Less expensive and easy to drive to any casino on strip  All the casinos have free self parking so you can leave your car and walk up and down the strip then drive back to hotel when done  Free wireless internet and continental breakfast are plusses  Only negative was loud group in hallway in middle of night  but it is Las Vegas so I guess you have to expect that    minute drive to airport  They have a shuttle to Mandalay Bay but we had car so did not use that  No restaurants within walking distance at least none that I could see   
P =>  Great family holiday We stayed here for four nights on a trip to the USA  we are used to staying in five star accommodation and only stayed here after such great reccommendations on Trip Finder and we were not disappointed  The hotel is clean  quiet and comfortable and our family room comfortably accomidated our family of six  The staff were friendly and helpful and staying off strip was a great decision  We had a ball in Las Vegas and will stay here again in a heartbeat  
P => Always Very Nice We love this hotel  It is always extremely clean and fairly quiet  if you can deal with the sound of airplanes nearby  which is blocked pretty well when the air conditioner runs   The bathroom is large  with a massive granite counter inside and a hot shower with excellent pressure  The breakfast selection is great and convenient  as in the computer in the lobby with internet access  The shuttle is hit or miss and they re working on that problem by having it now only drop off and pick up at the Mandalay Bay  They also have brand new linens with a top sheet covered down comforter and a choice of either soft or firm pillows on every bed  We ll stay again  
P => Nice place Should you listen to me  I m someone who usually stays in a modest hotel   Hampton  Fairfield  Holiday Inn  Will do a Ramada or Hilton on occasion  A Lodge or resort spa is a treat for me  Mostly I want a CLEAN ROOM and I prefer a new hotel or a recently renovated one I didn t get to use this hotel like most might  Checked in at  pm and was gone by  am  Room was immaculant  Very clean  nicely decorated  Bed was a bit soft but they had option of pillows  firm and soft  and the bedding was first rate The staff was friendly and very capable  The provided great directions to eat dinner   something simple   Chillii s  The drive to the airport was very simple  about   turns and there you are The only negative thing I can say about it was that it doesn t have an airport shuttle  I wanted that and mistakenly thought they did   but that is my fault  Otherwise  very clean  nice lobby  quick elevators  helpful staff  no problems I d stay again  
P => Very clean My husband and I were on our way from Florida to the Grand Canyon via Las Vegas  We really just needed a room for the night before starting our drive to the Grand Canyon  I chose the Holiday Inn Express on Polaris because I had never been to Las Vegas before and I wasn t sure about staying right on the strip  Las Vegas honestly isn t really my idea of a vacation destination  Holiday Inn Express was very clean  Our room was nice and comfortable  Breakfast the next morning had all the basic necessities and was great  They kept the area well stocked and clean  The hotel is very close to the strip  which  yes we did go to for a few hours  It is a very easy drive  I think we only made two quick  easy turns to get there  I would definitely recommend this hotel  
P =>  Very nice hotel We were very pleased with our one night stay at this hotel  It s off the strip  just west of I     but within   minutes drive of the MGM  Mandalay Bay  etc  Price was much cheaper than the strip hotels and it included an excellent breakfast with everything you need to start the day off on the right foot  It was really nice not having to walk a mile to get to your room like you do with most of the big strip hotels The hotel offered shuttles to the strip  though we didn t use this service so I can t comment The only negative experience we had at this hotel was the construction going on next door on the freeway side of the hotel  They even worked on weekends which surprised us  But it wasn t that loud  just the occasional back up sounds from the tractors and cranes  A room on the western side of the hotel might alleviate this concern if absolute peace and quiet is required  Otherwise  it really wasn t that big a deal for us  
P =>  Great off strip hotel I agree with just about everything the last couple of reviewers have written  This is a great choice for your budget  especially on a weekend  The room was very clean and comfortable  and the staff was very friendly and helpful  Wireless internet connection in the room worked perfectly  and there is a computer in the lobby with a printer  I arrived at   am on a Saturday and was able to check in early with no trouble  The breakfast bar is great and they have lots of seating  including a sofa in front of a fireplace The one small complaint is about the free shuttle that goes to the Bellagio and Mandalay Bay  It s very popular and has to deal with traffic  so it s rarely on time and is sometimes full when it does come  Still no seating outdoors for waiting outside  but you can wait in the lobby and the driver will come in and announce that the shuttle is there  If you re not in a hurry  the shuttle is a nice convenience If you don t want to wait  the front desk is great about calling a cab for you  and we paid    to get to the strip  The cab to the airport was      Plan on the expense of a cab to and from the airport if you aren t driving  because none of the airport shuttles come to this hotel The value  quality and service this hotel provides more than make up for the transportation issues  I d definitely stay here again  
P =>  just the place at half the cost my husband and I stayed here in january      we had a great stay here  the hotel was very clean and the staff could not have been more helpful  however the only blot on the copy book was that the courtesy shuttle was nt very good at arriving on time anything from       mins late also they could have done with a seat seating outside for guests that were waiting  but despite this it was well worth its money and we would happily stay there again next time  
P =>  Great Value  Super clean rooms and tasty breakfast I picked this hotel after I read the raving reviews and wasn t exactly sure why a Holiday Inn Express was much to rave about except for the price  With exception to the distance to the block  which you would either drive or take a shuttle   this hotel is one of the best value in Las Vegas  The rooms look clean and new  and the breakfast offered large selection and was included in the hotel room price  This is a great hotel at a budget price  much better than some of the hotels on the strip  The parking is free  so this hotel is more enjoyable if you had a car to drive to the strip  
P => nice clean hotel  
P =>  Perfect for quick access  without immersion  to the Strip  
P =>  Isolated  
P =>  Great Hotel  
P => New friendly and well kept  Buffet breakfast is great   
P =>  Brand New Hotel   Just a little from the strip  
P => Genial  
P =>   tolle Adresse sich nach einem erlebnisreichen Tag auszuruhen  
P => 
P =>  quiet a bit off the Strip which makes it perfect enjoyable stay  nice restaurants  steak house  italian  right next door 
P =>   Good West Suiburbs Business Option   If Cleaned Up In the west suburbs  the location was perfect for my business meetings at that end of town  Nice to be away from the hussle bussle of the strip and feel like I was in normal suburbia   shopping   Do not consider staying here if you want to go to the strip     too far via too much traffic    lots of other options closer to the strip if you want a non casino hotel motel   Spacious room   mine larger than many   and on the top floor  the ceilings slope to    or     high at one end  adding to the feeling of spaciousness  Bed and bedding were really comfortable   slept like a log  Hallways never seemed to get vacuumed in the week I was there   little bits of stuff everywhere and carpets just looked like they needed a shampoo  My room was tidied nicely daily  but my white gym socks were black on the bottom after walking in the room stocking footed  Yuck  Internet worked well   high speed wireless G  Limited cable selection  Heard every sound coming from the adjacent room via the connecting door   even though both doors were closed and locked  Pretty basic continental breakfast  Have been at other HIExpresses that have some hot items   like toaster waffles  scrambled eggs and saussage or bacon  Pure continental here   carbos and liquids plus yoghurt  I can t eat dairy  and hardboiled eggs  pre shelled     like how fresh are these    Small  but useful gym  with bottled water  and small but OK indoor pool  but didn t use the spa since it didn t feel hot enough to bother  Grocery store and a couple of restaurants in walking distance  Better restaurants  Iincluding a Roy s  and Whole Foods ket about a mile away on Charleston  Movie theaters about a mile away  At      night  it was a good deal  but I m going to try the La Quinta   mile further west next time to see if its cleaner and has a better breakfast  
P =>  Nice Way Off Strip Property Holiday Inn Express   The Lakes   Las Vegas  Sahara Avenue just West of Durango  If you re in town to see the Strip  this is not at all close  If you re in town to visit family or friends  it s perfect in many ways  Clean rooms and public areas  Adequate breakfast buffet  Very nice indoor heated pool  amp  jacuzzi  I live in Las Vegas and escaped here one evening while my wife was hosting a  quot Girls night out quot  baby shower in our home  The rates on the Strip and downtown were cost prohibitive that evening  so I opted for the tried and true Holiday Inn Express chain  Easy access to the bus on Sahara Avenue  which can take you directly to the Strip  and deposit you adjacent to the Sahara Hotel on Las Vegas Boulevard  I would say it s a         minute ride Nice Restaurants nearby the hotel  walk across the street to Teddy s Greek Bistro for a great time including music  dancing and plate tossing OPA  Free parking and all that  Nice and clean and a great choice  
P =>  Excellent Value Clean Room The highlights of my stay were the cleanliness of the room and the free continental breakfast  I was very pleased with the condition of the room   very clean and fresh  at other     star hotels the decor  linens  and facilities can be dated or need refurbishing   There was a mini fridge  wet bar  and coffee maker in the room  The continental breakfast offered an excellent variety of coffee  juices  pastries  cereals  fruits  and eggs  The hotel also allows small pets and laundry facilities that are open      which is very convenient for families  I paid about      a night  Memorial weekend  and I definitely got more than I bargained for  On the Strip  I would have paid at least double  plus dealt with parking  crowds and lines  
P => 
P =>  You get what you pay for       This hotel was cheap  and on the Strip  northern Strip  right across from the Stratosphere        but boy  was it seedy  It had a    hour pool  but you couldn t have paid me to go in  I killed two roaches during a two day stay  If you re looking for a place that s on the strip and CHEAP  this place is it    and it does have free parking    but it s a pit  no two ways about it  My boyfriend wasn t as offended by the roaches and general seedy atmosphere  so perhaps if you re a group of guys going to Vegas and you re looking for nothing more than a cheap bed and shower so you can blow money at the tables  this might be your place  I do NOT recommend it for a romantic vacation  I felt a bit like a  quot working girl quot  after a couple nights in this place  
P =>   Das Motel etwas  lter jedoch sehr sauber und g nstig   
P => 
P =>   it s worth the value  The only thing is the room  especially the rug  wasn t clean enough for us who has a crawling baby  The room was cozy and fairly close to the Strip  Actually  it s very close by private car  but two bus shift is necessary by public transportation  
P =>   Great place to stay if looking for low price cleanliness and friendly staff i stayed at Homestead for second time in two months  due to relative in hospital  then in therapy facility   it was much more reasonable than Strip hotels  had complete kitchen so that I did not have to eat out every meal  It is quiet and clean and i have always been made to feel welcome  The maids do not come every single day  as it IS an exended stay hotel  but how many times do you change your sheets in a week  IF one would want to hit the casinos or see shows  they are mere minutes away  There is a Denny s next door and that is very handy  as well I am going back in two weeks and will stay there again  as it is perfect for someone one in Vegas for business or personal reasons  
P =>   They were Great     I had to stay at this hotel for a surrogacy we transferred next door with Sher Inst  this hotel was awesome and the people there were so sweet  I highly recommend this hotel  I will be there again and praying for same luck as we had before  When the couple I am working with asked about a Hotel I told them about this one and how great they were  They booked rooms with NO issue what so ever  
P =>   In Vegas  This is good for the money  With weekend prices on the strip of      per night or more  the Homestead Studios Suites hotel is a blessing  I stayed here last weekend for a price of only     plus tax  It is my second stay at this hotel  It s location is about five blocks from the strip in an area where there is a hospital across the street and the UNLV two blocks away  Mainly business around with a smaller of amount of residences  It is an extended stay hotel for business travelers  contractors  agents  etc  Therefore there is no luxury  fancy suites  puffy drapes or concierge downstairs to wait on your every wish  It is a simple  clean  studio hotel with a kitchen and a bathroom  A rental car or taxi is required to get to the strip  The travel area between the hotel and the strip is not something I d want to walk through at night  but perfectly cool in a car  On convention weekends this hotel can jump up pretty high  around      per day   but for regular weekends it is bargain  I do higly recommend it and will stay there again on my next visitThank you GT 
P =>  Homestead I stay in this hotel frequently for business and the management always is friendly  The location is convenient as it is near a mall and many restaurants  
P => 
P => Good choice off the strip Stayed in a two bedroom suit with four adults total  Each room had its own bathroom  There were nice     flat screen TV S in each bedroom and one in the living room  Room were clean and looked nice and modern  Hotel staff was helpful and friendly  The free continental breakfast was good  Hotels location was good if you have a car  It is only about a Mile to the strip and there are a lot of choices for dinning and shopping within a mile of the hotel  Would highly recommend staying at this hotel  
P =>   Near the airport but not near the strip If you want to be near the airport  this hotel works great  If you want to be near the strip and don t have a car  you ll be disappointed  For me  being near the airport was important  though as mentioned by someone else  Hidden Well Road is hidden well  Thank goodness for GPS  Once you know where it is  it s easy to get to and from  As with all Homewood Suites  the breakfast is good  
P =>   This is the spot ober in Las Vegas was great   although the sun was still a bit strong  the temperature was perfect  We participated in an outdoor sporting event but we didn t combust in to ashes like we almost did in ust  don t ask what we were thinking   When we checked in  there were two people working at the lobby hence processing two sets of guests at a time  I wasn t worried too much about the security issue since I was with two Chippendale types  ok  not exactly  but the staff who processed us  Brady  I think and I believe he is the manager  was alert cautious discreet enough not to read out and announce our room number when he gave us the room key there   I was very happy with the hotel from the get go because of that  It turned out Brady is a hardworking  and or overworking  guy   he was there when we checked in  during our stay  and when we checked out  I hope he is getting paid well  He was doing a great job  We booked a non smoking    bedrooms   baths suite for   adults and   children  In our room         bedrooms were joined by a small kitchen dining living room  There is a full size refrigerator in the kitchen that we packed it with snacks and drinks  The room was also equipped with a coffee maker  a microwave oven and even a toaster  stove and dishwasher  This hotel is not a smoke free hotel but we weren t bothered by any smoke smell at all  The room windows were at the freeway side and the traffic noise was a bit loud for me  but it was no issue for the rest of the group  The airport noise didn t bother us at all  The complimentary breakfast was great  it accommodated light to heavy eaters like fruit to burritos  The kitchen staff was efficient and they kept the food well stocked and countertops and tables clean  The swimming pool was heated and the children were very happy dipping in the early nippy morning  This hotel suited and satisfied our trip needs  price  amenity and location  If your Las Vegas stay is mainly non gaming  this is the spot  
P =>  Luxury at an affordable price The property was spotless and comfortable  The staff was friendly and helpful  The hotel was at the airport on Hidden Well Road  We got a laugh out of that because we had a time finding it at first  but it was near Walmart and other stores where basic necessities could be purchased  This hotel is the next best thing to home  
P =>  Great Value  This is a great airport hotel  It offer great value along with a super efficient free shuttle bus service to and from the airport along with Mandalay Bay  Our room was spacious and clean  The free breakfast in the morning was a pleasant suprise  There were eggs  bacon  waffles  cereal  fruit   amp  toast  not your usual continental breakfast affair  The staff was very friendly and helpful  I would recommend this airport hotel to anyone  
P =>   Fantastic Hotel Brand new hotel  off the strip but not so far  a plus that they have a shuttle that takes and picks you up from THE MANDALAY BAY  The room decor was really trendy and clean  and the bed was to die for  The kitchen was impressive for a room and had all that one needs Quiet and spacious room  A yummy breakfast in the morning with good variety  However u have to wake up sorta early to get the best of the layout  Regular pool but very clean  and even though it is   min from the airport I slept like a babe and could not hear anything  Will be booking again whenever I go to Vegas again hands down    
P =>   Poor service bad iron burned blouse and empty promises During a four night stay at Homewood Suites Las Vegas  my room was not cleaned    despite me asking on the third morning to have a thorough cleaning  There were crumbs on the floor  crumbs in the carpet  the toilet seat had the same spot on it for three days  the trash was not emptied  the shower had the same marks on them  I can understand not changing the sheets every day    but not cleaning the bathroom  when clearly in need  is ridiculous  Especially  when I went to the front desk on the third morning  asking why the room wasn t clean  I was told they only do a thorough cleaning on check out or if requested  I requested it    still not done  Then  the iron had something burned on it  and it burned a hole in my blouse that went to my favorite suit  The manager assured me herself that I would be reimbursed for the blouse  provided I send a receipt  I sent the receipt    six weeks later  still not reimsbursement for my blouse  For a     blouse  they officially lost a customer  Exactly what is the value that is placed on keeping clients  I guess it s less than        my worth is offically     or less in their eyes  I used to be their biggest fan  staying at Homewood Suites wherever I could    riott here I come  If you weren t going to reimburse me for my blouse  don t lie about it  Several calls and conversations later with Jennifer  the manager  with excuses of the check s in the mail  the check must ve gotten lost  and I have to stop payment on the first check    is all lies  
P =>   I ve Been Spoiled   OK   I loved this place     Here is my review   Short and Sweet   I was traveling alone   leary of many things    I looked and looked and found this hotel online and after reading the reviews I thought I d sleep on it and decide in the morning     Well    I m glad I did  This place had the most spotlessly clean and fresh smelling new rooms you could imagine   The bathroom was just like home   it was designed beautifully  The shower had a shower massage head that felt like a dream     FULL FORCED WATER     no little drips that you had to run under to catch and get aggravated with and when all was said and done it felt like you needed a shower      It was a pleasure to fall sleep on a new beautiful clean king size bed    just like home    No smoke smell anywhere   Not a drop of noise in the place   any where   Full kitchen   Coffee  or tea  in the morning without having to get dressed and go out    OMG  Fantastic   Secure building with a very friendly and helpfull staff     Just one phone call to the front desk and you have the shuttle to take you to the strip    there s so much more     I would recomend this hotel to ANYONE who appreciates a home away from home    
P =>   Great Value If you are traveling by car to Las Vegas  this hotel can not be beat  It is just south of the Airport  no noise though  and near to a Whole Food ket  The main problem with the Strip hotels is that there is always traffic jams  no matter the time of day and hotel parking is a fair distance from your room  usually meaning a trip via the casino to get to the guest elevators  At Homewood Suites  no traffic jams and parking is simple  right outside the door  The one bedroom suite has a kitchenette and living area  The breakfast is the usual fair  during the week they do provide evening meals  but we did not sample them  All in all  if you have transport  this hotel provides all that you need at a very reasonable cost  
P =>   Fabulous comfort and value  We stayed one night here in the middle of our trip and were pleasantly surprised  The suites were large  the furnishings excellent and the beds the most comfortable of our entire trip  OK  you don t get the service of the top hotels but for the price it s hard to beat  The complimentary breakfast was great  and they offer a shuttle service to the strip  which makes up for the location  Highly recommended  
P =>  Wonderful new hotel This is a new hotel near the airport  The noise from the planes is almost non existant and never did keep us awake or wake us up in the morning  The beds are super comfy  The shower is very nice  The bathroom amenities are  st rate   Didn t use the kitchen at all but every thing was there if needed  Big LCD flat screen TV  Ok sofa and chair  Free breakfast was this side of yucky and the coffee provided in the room wasn t much better  I saw many families with small kids eating like it was their final meal  so be forwarned  The breakfast room is very small and you have to walk through it to get out of the hotel if you re in the back building  If you re going there to  chow down  you ll be disappointed but if you want a good nights sleep you ll be in the right place  Close to the airport with a free shuttle  Great location if you need to catch an early flight or arrive very late at night  We arrived at  am and had no trouble checking in  Front desk is very helpful and friendly  
P =>   fantastic It is a great place for business trip and family  The internet is free  The complimentary breakfast is the best I had  The also provide free shuttle bus to the airport  This hotel is brand new  The bed is a real king size one  The prize is very reasonable  We all like it  
P =>   Home Home on the plain Homewood Suites by Hilton  Las Vegas  Hidden Wells Rd   To do Vegas right on a budget   what  you don t have       to drop on slots  me neither   I always get a car and do the casino crawl during the day  retreat to a quiet suite here for a swim  food and rest  then back out at night  In three days you will be broke and exhausted  Mission Accomplished  Homewood Suites near the airport is an excellent choice for smart travelers who want to avoid the noisy drunks at the casino resorts  I got a studio suite          with full kitchen for     by calling direct  You can avoid the crowds  avoid the smoke  cigar smells  avoid the hideous cologne soaked hillbillies and avoid the late night hallway shenanigans that keep you awake in casino rooms  This place has free shuttle from airport   but you get your rent a car right across the street in the new Mega Car Rental Universe  Free shuttle to Mandalay Bay  The buffett B fast is OK  The full kitchen will do just fine after a stop at Safeway and you can get local restaurant delivery  Fitness room to burn off the pizza tostados  Get a room away from noisy elevator  Two bedroom suites are great for families  or just for that  executive  lifestyle at a great price  Click on  hotel by name  in a package deal search  
P =>   Great for Large Families This hotel was a great bargain  Our family of six adults and three children stayed comfortably in the two bedroom suite for only         a night  There were two bedrooms  two bathrooms  a living room with pull out sofa  a kitchenette and three T V s  You can see the Strip but are away from the noise  The hotel offers an hourly shuttle to Mandalay Bay  There is a Whole Foods and an open air mall nearby  They offer a hearty free breakfast and have a small convenience store near reception  An extensive selection of take out food can be delivered to your room  I am glad to have found this place  It seems all other  quot suites quot  hotels are really one bedroom and a living room  This was actually two bedrooms and a living room  Everything still smelled new  I hope their prices stay reasonable  
P =>   Loved This Hotel      We loved the Homewood Suites   we checked out of the Tropicana   after staying for   hour because we were so disgusted and booked at the Homewood  The rooms were so clean and nice and with the two bedroom suite   we had everything we needed  We parked close to our room and had a full kitchen and everything else we would need  The breakfast was great  waffles  fruit  bacon  eggs  cereal  etc  We would definitely stay here again  It was very close to the rental car return so it was easy to get there in the morning when we were leaving Las Vegas  This hotel is one that we will definitely look at next time we travel  
P =>  Brand New  We stayed at this beautiful and new  opened   months ago  hotel in t  on a return trip from Utah  We booked a   bdrm   bath suite  It was gorgeous  One bedroom had a king size bed and the other bedroom had   double beds  There were sleeping pillows galore on the bed from which to choose from  The bathrooms had tub shower combinations and a toilet with a door separating it from the vanity area  Neutrogena soap and lotion products were provided along with hair dryers  the hair dryers also had nightlights under them so you could have a bit of light at night   There were tv s in both bedrooms The kitchen living area separated the   bedrooms  The kitchen had a   burner stove  full size refrigerator  coffee maker  toaster  dishwasher  dishes and microwave  They provided   pods of regular  amp  decaf coffee for the coffee maker  most hotels only give you     The kitchen also had a beautiful granite countertop  There was a small sofa  ottoman and tv in the living area The breakfast in the morning consisted of eggs  bacon  potatoes  cereal  waffles  fresh fruit  yogurt  toast  amp  bagels  along with several types of teas and coffees  Real plates  cups and silverware were provided  no plastic   The breakfast area was large and not overly crowded when we were there  and this was a Saturday   They provide shuttle service to the airport  but do not pick up from there  They also provide shuttle service at the bottom of the hour to Mandalay Bay hotel  I think you have to call them when you want to be picked up if you are the only ones going  The front desk personnel were very friendly and helpful  We would love to stay there again  
P =>   great new hotel but one problem    Greetings Stayed at this hotel right next to las vegas airport on y   nd Very nice hotel  this is obviously some brand new construction  the rooms are super clean  and all have full kitchen equipment and a small living room area with sofa and tv  It is really well located for people that need to catch an early flight from las vegas mccarran airport and this hotel provides a shuttle service to the airport for free So everything positive  except for one major problem  The noise  We had a room facing the hidden well street  The street itself is not noisy  the issue is that right next to hidden well street is a major highway     or      underpass and basically it was impossible for me to sleep during the whole night with this constant strong noise  The other members of the family apparently managed to sleep somehow decently  but if you are a traveller like myself that is sensitive to outside noise  than you may be in trouble So bring ear plugs and or make sure you get a room not facing the hidden well road and perhaps you will be ok  family from montreal  canada 
P =>  Great non gaming extended stay While I had reservations about staying someplace that just opened its doors  this place was ready for business  Located just south of the Mandalay Bay Hotel and east of Las Vegas Blvd  just a couple of blocks fromt the airport car rental center  this place great  The rooms were top notch  the breakfast and evening fare were great and the staff very helpful  A non gaming property with no casino nearby  this is a great place to stay if you are not a gambler or prefer not to stay in a gaming hotel  All rooms have a small kitchen  Although I didn t use the pool  it looked inviting  but it didin t appear that you could do much tanning during the day  except at high noon  as the pool is located in an area surrounded by the hotel building  As I said before  this place is new  very little noise from the traffic or airplaines  This place is very similar to the same property located in Henderson  NV  
P => 
P => Hidden Secret This was my  rd visit to Hooters The staff is freindly and helpful  beds and pillows are comfortable  They have cable television and complimentary bottles of water in the rooms  Dan inos has the      prime rib    hrs and the Hooters hot wings are great  The price is right   
P => Cheap weekend getaway Got a great deal from the slot club for Sat and Sun  Made for a nice quick and cheap getaway with wife  
P => Great views and Excellent Housekeeping My wife really liked the prime rib special  I enjoyed the breakfast buffet and the fresh fruit and with biscuits The housekeeping service was very good and thoughtful  she brought my daughter extra sheets w o asking for them on the second night Hooters restaurant waitress were friendly and helpful  Although menu was different  prices and sauce choices were minimum  Food was very good and beer too Dixie bar did not have the great looking ladies that were pictured  only couple of bartender guys  be seasonal Casino girls were nice and nice looking  Machines need updating like the MGM across the street The room AC was VERY old and HARD to maintain a consistant temperature makeing sleeping difficult at times  It is VERY LOUD and either Very HOT or COLD no in between Although  we did not win the      we will likely return if price is good  
P => Good Value with a good location The room itself could use some attention in that there was peeling paint and a slightly damaged drain in the bathroom  The hallways were rather dingy and did not feel very welcoming  The casino itself was good  Sure  not as upscale as many of the other casinos but the service was excellent and the staff were very helpful and welcoming  The gem of the hotel casino was the gym  though I couldn t figure out how to turn on all the lights  
P => You get what you pay for I was suckered in by the Internet special  The casino itself is small but relatively clean  the rooms however were dirty and dated  I do not reccomend  
P => Great place to stay for the price      I have not one complaint  My family and I always stay at hooters   They are always accomodating our every need   In this day n age   with the economics the way they are u just can t beat the prices of the rooms at hooters   
P => Stay anywhere but here  The young man at check in wasn t at all helpful  never mentioned a kids area which is listed on the survey card  The hallway on the  th floor had an offensive odor  the rooms and carpet are tired but adequate   certainly nothing to write home about  Elevators  garage  amp  room  were frightful   they did not always work  The slot machines were dirty  Security  housekeeping  and maintenance were helpful and pleasant  They do have a heated pool  The bed was comfortable  
P => Not too bad for the price We were expecting a total dump based on the price we paid  but were pleasantly surpirsed  It is a small casino with a lot of penny and nickle slots  There was a restraunt  club  and show on site  The food was pretty good  so were the drinks  just don t buy a drink  they are very expensive considering you can sit at a machine and get them for free  The gym had pretty good equipment for such a small hotel  The pool area was cozy with fire pits and different seating areas for visiting  The rooms were typical of a Howard Johnson or equivalent  The beds were comfortable and the rooms were clean  However  there were food trays sitting outside someones door by the eleveator for   days which was anoying  We were in walking distance to many of the bigger hotels which was nice  All in all I would stay here again if I didn t want to spend the money at a bigger hotel  
P => Great Hotel with Mates Stayed here for five nights on a trip with mates from the UK  Overall this is a smaller and more friendly hotel which means it doesn t take    minutes to get back to your room if you forget your camera Yes it is not as plush as other hotels  yes the fascilities are not as up to date but if you need a hotel as a place to crash with mates then this is the place The staff were all really friendly and helpful  there was a party going on all day  the pool and bars were excellent  and last but the not least the hooters bar is top class Other reviews say this is off strip  it is but only     yards off strip  It is located next to the MGM and in a real good spot for getting about Vegas Would I go back  hell yeah  would I go with my Wife  Hell NO  butu saying that her and her friends are staying there next year  
P =>   Quick easy and the stay was clean I enjoy staying at the hotelThe service and food was pleasant 
P =>   great hotel for the price good value for being right off the strip good service perfect size not too big and over the top Like the other hotel s on the strip perfect walking distance to the mgm and others  
P =>   Seemed like best price but        I searched the web for a good price on a single night stay in Las Vegas  Hooters was offering a low price and what seemed to be a good location  So I booked the room  When we got there I learned that there was an extra  quot cleaning quot  charge of     per night  This increased the cost of the room by nearly      The drinks were very expensive     for a cocktail      for a double shot of name brand rum  Internet service is     a day The hotel is located across the street from the MGM but you have to walk down the street a     mile to cross over on a pedestrian bridge  Then you have to walk the entire length of the MGM to get to the Monorail  The funny thing is I could see the monorail station straight across from Hooters  Finally  the rooms were functional but seemed to be converted from another hotel chain  There were no bedside lamps  only floor lamps in the corners  Wood  quot patches quot  were applied where the bed lamps used to be attached to the wall  But the room was clean So beware of the price and be aware that the location is not as good as it seems  
P =>   Won t go again  I booked this hotel through Priceline com  Unfortunately I wasn t expecting to see Hooters as a result  The front desk though it was quick to check in  the service was bad  Also  the hotel charges an additional       as a reserve fee that is also added onto the price which I wasn t expecting  Therefore  it ended up costing more then what priceline promised  The housekeeping staff charged me for water that I did not drink  I will definitely think twice before booking Hooters  You mind as well pay a few more dollars for a descent hotel  
P =>   Great for the price We are frequent travelers to Las Vegas  The Golden Nugget is our favorite place to stay  however  we have stayed at many of the hotels on the strip in our     times to Vegas  Hooters was decent for the price  We paid     for sunday night which included a buy one get one free breakfast buffet at dan marinos    complimentary tickets to Todd Paul and      in promo slot play  The casino is small  however  Tropicana  MGM  Monte Carlo  New York New York casinos are close by  The rooms are clean  however  the entire hotel   elevators  carpet  rooms  bathrooms are in desperate need of updating  The pool and hot tubs are nice  If you are on a budget this is a great option in vegas  
P =>   Better than I expected from the reviews I read Some friends of mine were going to Vegas so I headed out as well at the last possible moment  Was looking for a room on the cheap decided to give Hooters a try glad I did  The rooms are pretty much like a motel   room with Hooters trim  My room was fine and very clean house keeping did a great job  The room service was great as well both the restaurants were excellent and thrift priced compared to a block away at the strip  I am a person that likes a luxury room as much as the next guy my wife and I stayed at Bellagio in  in a suite for      a nite and it was luxury this room averaged     and was well worth the price  The       prime rib was great as well as the steak and eggs For        
P =>   Would stay again Not luxury but comfortable economy  Hotel is older and well worn but clean  Don t expect excellent room service  Our hair dryer broke and it took    hrs to get a new one delivered  we left after an hour so I m not sure how long it took   Hotel atmosphere is fun and laid back  Nice music playing  Room was clean and bed surprisingly comfortable  Walking distance to several other hotels  If you have the time I recommend visiting the VooDoo Lounge  on top of The Rio  in the evening  You get a beautiful view of the city and great music  If you get there early  you might even get free entrance passes  
P =>   BED BUGS    I stayed in the Hooters hotel in LV  NV from oct         to oct          I started getting itchy bumps  and i didn t know what they were until i found one of the bedbugs  It was disgusting  when we checked out i told the manager at the front desk about it  and she offered me     off  The bites got worse  like i had an allergic reaction  Also  i am very scared i might have brought them back The work experience of my life  I have already called the hotel and left a message with the main manager  and am hoping to be re compensated for my stay  
P =>  budget hotel Good hotel for the money  However if I had to do it over again I would spend a little more and get a lot more  the people were really nice  The food in Dan ino s was horrible  The prime rib had more fat on it then meat hooters food was normal but of course you paid more for that No coffee maker in the room and no coffee in the hotel  The room was average but severely lacking in outlets  The rooms were called beach side so I thought I was going to see at least a view of the pool   nope a view of the parking lot The pool was very nice and the staff including security by the pool were awesome the hotel very quiet in the room areas so that was really nicesign up for the free chips just to get the coupon to see the comedian for       I laughed from the beginning to the end   hilarious 
P =>  Perfect for what we needed We stayed here for   nights on a quick cheap trip in        We got a dirt cheap bungalo room and it suited our needs just fine  The pool area was a nice place to relax at night  the staff was friendly and more importantly it was like     night  If you want something that just works well for quick trips or if you re not planing on spending much time in the room this hotel was perfect  We re staying one day here again in ember for nastalgia before moving on to the Bellagio for the remaining   nights  Cant wait  
P =>   A HOOTING TOOTING HOTEL we stayed at the hotel in        the hotel was nice  the down side was that the towels they provdided around the pool were very small to say the least  best take your own  the room was ok but it would be a lot better with fresh painted walls and a new carpet  the wardbrobe doors didnt work either  the breakfast buffee was ok but we found another hotel that was a lot better   the next one up  the location was ideal it didnt take you too long to be on the strip about a  minute walk  all in all the budget hotel gets my vote for the next trip  
P =>   Great location it was a hoot  Although off strip this hotel is in a great location  Check in was fast and easy  our room was standard but clean  Our window looked out on Tropicana and the strip  great views of NYNY and MGM at night  Our safe was faulty  i think the prveious guests left if locked but we called security and they were up in minutes to fix it  Weather was quite cool  even for us Scots  so we didn t spend much time by the pool  We did spend a wee while at the jacuizi next to the pool however  The pool area was clean and towels were available  The casino itself was very small compared to the others and got quite busy on the weekends when it filled up with guys  We ate a few times in Dan marinos which did a good breakfast  The beds were comfy and hotel noise was pretty minimal  Hooters is in walking distance of a lot of the major hotel casinos so taxi and bus journeys were kept to a minimum  If I return any time soon and hooters is still stnading i will definately consider it  
P =>   Great value for money After reading some negative reviews on this hotel before arriving i thought it only fair to say how i found this hotel Great location  clean rooms and exactly what i wanted for what was paid for the stay Next year am thinking of going for   weeks to hooters very satisfied  
P =>   great stay Was shocked to read other bad reviews for Hooter Las Vegas  We had a great stay and enjoyed our three nights here  We did have to queue for check in and it was through the Pokie Machines in the casino but it was resonably quick and nothing like the queues in the other hotel we had looked in Great room and decor  very clean and tidy  Very close to The Strip and gas station  convenience store and Coco s Resturant  Also used both Hooters Resturants and brought souvenirs from Hooters shops  Our room over looked the pool  which we didn t use but plenty of people were and we did have drinks by it  very nice We used the casino and enjoyed the free first drink when using a machine  not serious gamblers   had to say we had  Been there done that  in Vegas   I would say this hotel is more suitable for young people in party mode  although saying that we are in our    s and still enjoyed ourselves  
P =>   Great for the young crowd   We stayed one night here and loved the amosphere  it is not the highest paying casino on the strip but great to kick back and relax in  great for people in their   s and   s  Pool was cool  several seperated pools and hot tubs  one with a waterfall  didnt go in the hot tub  didnt look as clean as the pool  stayed in thr bungalow rooms off the pool  nice view  basic no frills room  bed was comfy  room was clean  a little outdated  but for our purposes it was great for     a night   
P =>   HOOTERIFIC  Came out with some friends for a softball tournament  had a blast at the pool party and the specials around the casino  Thanks for a great time  
P =>  Hooters        it was ok  As far as the rooms go  the rooms are actually quite nice  The beds are comfy  there is a nice atmosphere in the rooms as well   The casino is average and isn t nearly as big and glamorous as others on the strip but works well if you just want to play a couple of video machines and they have a few reasonably priced table games   The pool is just fair  if your looking for a nice pool there are a lot of other places to go for a great value ie   The Tropicana right next door has a fabulous pool for the money  location it is a little off the strip  so if you are looking for a lot of time on the strip it would be wise to get a hotel right on the strip    the flamingo  harrah s all for around the same price  Restaurants  Hooters restaurant is good of course  Dan ino s is just fair   Overall it is just a run of the mill hotel in vegas  Its not the best but isn t the worst especially for the price on near the strip  
P =>   Not that bad My fiance decided at the last minute to leave to vegas a day early so we booked Hooters for     and were on our way trecking the desert in the night  We arrived at  am and quickly checked in  We were upgraded from a bungalow room to a tower room on the  th floor of the bay view tower for free  we also got   free breakfast buffets at Dan inos but i suggest you skip that unless you are low on money and want a free meal  Not much selection and the food was bland but hey its free  The elevator from the parking garage into the casino is pretty old and dingy  Yes the casino is small but there is not much that Hooters could have done with it  San Remo was a tiny casino and Hooters looks like they have done the best they could have in making it over  We played craps after dropping our bags off in our room and the craps dealers were extremely nice and helpful  Easily the nicest dealers i have been around in vegas  Thanks for everything Vee and Andrew  You have to remember that Hooters doesnt make itself out to be amoungst the belagios and venetians of vegas  They are a mid level hotel were you can relax and have fun  if you are a picky person who finds flaws in many things then you should definitely not stay here  if you like to kick back and have fun  i would recommend staying at hooters 
P =>   Stay anywhere else This place is going downhill  The rooms are small with double beds  The casino is small  Hooters restaurant is not even open    hours  Dan ino restaurant has the worst food  The staff is very friendly and the location is fine  I just wouldn t stay here again  
P =>  Great deal  I booked   nights at Hooters during the winter for a really great deal  less than     for   nights   Originally  we booked for a bungalow  but the staff was kind enough to upgrade us to a room inside the hotel  the bungalow is separate from the hotel   I was easy and convenient to get from the elevator to the room and very comfortable as well  The room was very beachy themed and the bed was well cushioned  It was a quick walk to MGM and the people there are accommodating  
P =>  Good value We stayed   nights in y   we had stayed at this hotel before  in      and went back because of the relaxed atmosphere and cheap room prices  This time around it seemed the Hooters girls weren t quite as happy and chirpy however  Room was a good size  clean and comfortable  Staff at the reception desk gave us the bare minimum in terms of welcome and pleasantries  This is a smaller casino which we liked  as it doesn t take long to get from your hotel room to the Strip  The pool area had security guards which was good as there were a few that had had a bit too much to drink   they took care of any unsavoury characters quickly and discreetly  The only complaint I have about the pool is that there were no pool attendants to clear away used towels  empty drink containers  debris etc  Great value and a fun place to stay  If you don t want your boyfriend husband looking at girls in skimpy shorts and tight singlets  this is not for you  Great for a boys girls trip away and couples if your wife girlfirend is not the jealous psycho type  
P =>   Grea Place to Stay If you re not looking for a resort I have stayed at this hotel with my girlfriend many times  We are able to get many comps to shows and museums because of my girlfriends connections  so we don t like spending money on a hotel because we frequent the city so much  The rooms are nice and clean and keep with the same hooters style as the restaurants  The rooms and the casino aren t too fancy  but it s hooters  it s not suppose to be fancy   I would not stay here if I was planning a big trip  but for the Vegas regular or spur of the moment Vegas trip  this hotel should do nicely  My girlfriend likes the place  but I m sure its a much bigger hit with the guys than the ladies  Nothing can beat their    cent midnight chicken wing special also tip the drink girls in casino and the drinks come non stop   You can also get ridiculously good rates on this hotel if you look and even cheaper if you frequent the hotel  We stayed for three nights  which included new years eve and new years for less than       I booked a four night stay this summer for a total of      I have only stayed in the tower rooms  be careful about the bungalow rooms they are detached from the casino and seem a bit seedy   I missed the earlier special this year which was half the price  You also receive a coupon book if you sign up for their players card  many buy one get one free   They give you free show tickets with the purchase of one drink  just look for the special  Just remember don t expect an over the top Vegas hotel room here  this is not a mega resort  It s literally around the corner from strip  what more could you want  
P =>   average hotel good location We stayed here   days in        Hotel is average   Location is good behind MGM but in the point that nobody pops in accidentally  Probably that is why it wasnt that lively  there were only few people in the evenings    The pool area is nice  Also the small gym is somehow adequate for little working out  Food wasnt that special  normal junk  That time there was nothing special going on in the evenings  Rooms were okIt was pretty much what we ve expected for that price  Less lively though  
P =>   excellent dollar valueS Stayed e    to y  everything was perfect  A     ft  walk to the strip  a clean air contioned room  agreat atmosphere especially at the pool with excellent bartenders and lots of meals under        plus the usual wing promotions  Dave J Ottawa Canada 
P =>   the friendliest place in town I have stayed at Hooter s twice now and found it to be the most friendly staff around  The receptionist  the waiters and waitresses  the barmaids  etc  The atmosphere there is fun and exciting with attention to customers  My boyfriend and I always come back here  We will be coming a  rd time soon  The rooms are very comfy and make you feel like your in a tropical climate  We have gambled in many other casinos in town and the Hooter s is best because the atmosphere is so fun  We are not big gamblers so we don t get perks  Its just nice to be waited on so well  We have eaten at Dan ino s rest  The food is awesome  Location is clooose to the strip  Great value and service  
P =>  Avoid  went open minded after reading reviews on here before and seeing it was down as   star  I d give it   star  Casino and first impressions on arrival good  however after checking in noticed how seedy and grubby really is  the corridors to rooms dark and smelt of dope also stained grey carpets  The room no quilt covers on for say   out of   days  stained horrible brown carpet in room and cheap wooden furniture  Eating in Hooters  avoid buffet breakfast or any food at all in restaraunt  looked like it had been there days and not much choice  surprised me people eating in there  Round the pool area dirty never saw it cleaned round whilst there  chicken bones old straws etc   all over floor  Brown padded seats all stained no way would you sit in one in shorts  So all in all hotel to avoid there is better hotels cheaper  only thing going for it location opposite MGM  good for going over for breakfast  
P =>  Ticks every box and cheap I have stayed at Hooters   times now  I think it is brilliant as it is always very cheap  and is in a great location just across the road from the MGM  The rooms are very similar in size to the other hotels I have stayed at in Vegas   Paris  Luxor  MGM  I have never had a problem with my room  the beds are large  and I have never had a reason to complain about anything  The bathrooms are fine too  The pool area is decent  small  but there is a pool side bar  and although the pools are small  they are decent enough  and some of them are heated  The casino area is small  and the bar near the entrance of the hotel is tiny  but we only really use it as a meeting point  or for a quick drink before heading out elsewhere There is a restaurant called Dan ino s  I have eaten there a few times for breakfast  and it does good food and is handy late at night when you ve got the munchies  There is a    hour shop next door to Hooters too  so you can get drink and snacks to have in your room from there  as well as toiletries etc  so that s handy The gambling area is very small  and the only negative about Hooters is I don t view it as a hotel you d go to for a night out  as it is small and doesn t have a proper bar  I just like it because it is cheap  good value for money  and the rooms serve their purpose  I might go back to Vegas in ember and I will stay at Hooters again  I d always stay there in the future  unless I win the lottery or go with a girlfriend  
P =>  Nice Pool O K hotel for a quick night We pre booked a very cheap rate at Hooters because our plane was getting in at midnight and we needed a cheap place to crash  If you re looking for the same and you can get a really low rate then Hooters is fine for a quick night  It s on Tropicana Blvd across from the MGM hotel and monorail station   about a five minute or less walk to the strip  Check inThe Attached parkade didn t appear to have an elavator but there is parking out front  My wife and I checked in and they were out of the bungalow rooms we had booked so they  quot upgraded quot  us to a tower room for the same rate  Check in was quick and friendly but be aware they charge you    each night for a resort fee  It s not a resort     The casino area is all right  basically a hooters restaurant with slot machines and tables  RoomsWhen Hooters bought the hotel they threw down some new carpet  painted the walls and nailed up some surfboards in the halls  Be warned the halls are dim and and the dark paint doesn t help much  The rooms aren t anything to write home about  the beds and sheets were clean and comfortable  the linoleum was old and peeling in the bathroom  the fixtures were old and stained  the walls were thin and the sliding window to the false deck didn t lock  A typical budget motel room Public areasThe casino was fun with a party atmosphere  lots of good games  and access to cheap drinks if your not gambling  The free form pool was built when they bought the hotel and is the highlight of the property with a bar  a few hot tubs  a waterfall and sandy areas for lounging  Dan inos is a    hour restaurant with a late night wing special and a breakfast buffet   get the     coupon for signing up for the Owl Club players card   They also have a Hooters restaurant  comedy theatre  Dixies country bar and another casual bar  Overall  Hooters is O K for a night for the under    crowd  I would recommend it to a friend for a cheap place to stay close to the airport  it would be great for a bachelor party but I wouldn t recommend it to a single women because of the dark halls and laxed security  
P =>  Worth a look for those on a budget  The casino is fun  the pool is decent and the price is right  The rooms are very basic  but clean and a good value  The pool loses the sun around mid afternoon  so plan on getting your sun early  The casino is allot of fun  the brunch at Dan ino s is decent and the hooters restaurant is a hooters restaurant  Close to the monorail station and a      minute walk to most of the south end strip casinos  this is a good option for those on a budget The parking garage is brutal and needs to be cleaned up  it is by far the worst part of the property  
P =>   Fun Place to Stay  My boyfriend and I stayed here during the week of Memorial Day       We were upgrade to a suite on the top floor when we checked in  It was beautiful with a great view  There was no line at all at check in  The line to get their players club card was long and moved slow  The hooters on site is on par with any other Hooters  It a fun place to stay on a budget  My only complaint at all is the parking garage  It stinks and it s a little scary at night  
P =>   Dirty Dirty Dirty Ok went there with my family  Wife and   kids    and       The elevators from the parking garage down to the hotel stunk of vomit and were covered in obscene grafiti  The staff was less than enthusiastic about helping you and seemed to make you feel as though you were bothersome for asking questions or requiring assistance  The rooms were dirty  Over an inch of years worth of  quot Dust bunny quot  dust built up completely around the entire floorboard and corners of the rooms  The carpets were covered in Cigarette burns   quot on a non smoking floor quot   and the other guests would be sitting in the hallway  smoking and drinking and blasting music as though this was their freshman dorm in college  The kids liked the pool  as long as the smell of sewage doesn t bother you  Overall I have been to better in third world countries  but as with all the reviews    WE GOT WHAT WE PAID FOR    
P =>   Great value better than expected I chose Hooters for our   night stay due to the value      per might  and the location  just off the strip caddy corner from MGM Grand   I had read the reviews and was prepared for a mediocre place  thinking we d be spending most of our time outside the hotel anyway  so the hotel itself didn t matter much But I was pleasantly surprised   the room was fine  plenty of pillows  no waits at the registration counters  no extra charges  a great view of the mountains  extremely polite housecleaning staff  Great value if you ask me  Here s the rundown Casino  Very loud sports bar ish  nothing upscale or elegant about it  But considering it s Hooters  what do you expect  One drawback    the elevators to our room were at the far end of the casino  so you had to walk the entire casino every time you wanted to go to your room  Luckily it wasn t a huge casino like some others  but would have been nice to have the elevators a bit more convenient Restaurants Bars  Ate at the Hooters restaurant the first night  Felt like a Hooters  Went to the Dixie s Dam Bar the first night also  Somewhat strange experience  Lots of blaring hip hop music with a few gorgeous dancers clearly employed by the bar  surrounded by a bunch of middle aged men just standing and staring  We didn t stay long Location  Was fine    had hoped for an easier trip from the airport  given that it s IMMEDIATELY next to it  but the cab ride from the airport is still      and the airport shuttle bus  at       per person  drops off at Hooters last  making it a long trip  But walking to the strip wasn t hard    Just go through the Tropicana parking lot and you re on the strip  with elevated walkways taking you to New York New York and MGM Grand Pool  Looked nice and seemed fairly popular during the day    only one of the two hot tubs worked  but it was pleasant enough the one night we used it Parking  Had a small parking lot right in front  and we never had any problem finding a spot  It was easily the most convenient parking of any hotel we visited Cleanliness  A little mildew around the tub  and the window was little dirty making the view not quite as nice as it could have been  but otherwise no complaints    and certainly clean enough given the low price Service  We had no bad service experiences    I was actually blown away by the friendliness of the maid in the morning  When we accidentally locked ourselves out of the room bathroom they sent up someone to unlock it within about    minutes Loudness  There were a couple times when people from the pool were pretty loud  even from our room on the   th floor   but it didn t bother us  We were in Vegas for a good time  with no kids  so a little bit of drunk singing wasn t an issue  It didn t go on too long or too late  and the other rooms around us were perfectly quiet Overall  Giving this hotel a   star rating based on the value of what you get for the money    if it were more expensive  the rating would probably be a three  If I were coming to Vegas for a fun trip and needed something cheap  I d stay here again  
P =>  The only good part was the beds and Brandon who checked our bags and car  The front desk was not able to help without constantly going and asking the manager for help  The casino area was tiny and the music way too loud  The Hooters restaurant was overpriced and the food was not nearly as good as the regular restaurants food  Dan inos restaurant was a better deal and had mush better food  The best employee there was Brandon who checked in and delivered our luggage to our room and also did double duty as the valet for our car  
P =>  The beds are so comfy    Don t expect too much  The place was just slightly improved from what it was  But the beds are super comfy  If you re in Vegas and just need a bed to crash on   this is the place for you  
P =>   Do not stay here  This place is the worst of the worst  Dirty and run down  Lots of drunks and just a terrible place  I had paid for   nights here thru a package deal but I left after the first night and got a real room at the MGM  Trust me    do not stay at Hooters unless you are a scum and love rubbing elbows with other scumbads and dirty walls  fllors and furniture  I want to throw up thinking about the place  
P =>   who can complain for      We stayed for   nights with our  mo baby  We paid     per night for the room  plus a    resort fee  and we got a fantastic room with a view towards the strip Hooters is located just off the strip  opposite the MGM  so all the tourist buses are just across the road  We ve stayed here before  when it was the San Remo and you seriously can t complain for the price  The room was clean  the portacrib was provided free of charge  My only complaint was no fridge  but we could have upgraded for     if we really wanted one  Oh  and you have to pay for WiFi  but that s about it  
P =>   Too dumpy to pass muster I ve stayed at    hotels in Las Vegas  and I think this is the worst one I ve stayed at This is a very old hotel that was purchased by Hooters  They put a Hooters restaurant on the first floor  put some surfboards in the elevator lobbys  and that s pretty much it  When I stayed there  I got free breakfast every morning  free show tickets to see the Mentalist and Bobby Slayton  both of which are no longer performing there   all that for      and that made it tolerable  
P =>   Pleasantly Surprised   It was a lot minue booking for my bday celebration weekend  I already did a lot of online hotel bookings but was not fully satified  I am usually a budget traveller and not to gaga with Big hotels  I usually just want a hotel with nice location and clean rooms to stay after a long day of strip stroll I was pleasantly surprised with Hooters For     nite for the weekend its a good value What i really like if the nice touch in our room we stayed in  NIce queen bed with summer decor  They also grant our request for view of the strip  I usually look for nice bedding and restrooms in the places i stayed  They meet my expectations  Im planning to stay there again due to its location  value and service  
P =>  Certainly Good Value   Well Happy Me and my adult son stayed in a room here when we went over for a boxing match and we were well happy with it  Ok  if I took my wife to Vegas she d want to go to somewhere a bit more  swanky  but I was well impressed with Hooters for the price  We paid for the cheapest of rooms  bungalow  and then tipped the reception guy well for an upgrade and ended up with a tower room with Strip view  A couple of small marks on the carpet is the only fault I could find with the room and otherwise it was ideal for us  A   night stay cost us under      and so less than     a night      per person  That s value in my book  The casino is only small by Vegas standards but one advantage was the waitresses on the casino floor soon get to recognise you and know you re a resident  in which case they re well free and easy with the drinks  You don t even have to be actually playing a table or a machine and they ll bring you whatever you ask for  Dan Morhino s Restaurant was a bit of a disappointment frankly   nothing more than average  However  it was my first introduction to the Hooters Restaurant and their variety of hot chicken wings  fries with chilli con carne and cheese etc  Delicious  I d definitely go back here and all the staff were perfectly helpful  albeit we didn t have any specific problems  Great location too   right end of the Strip for all the action and directly opposite the main entrance to MGM Grand  which is where our Boxing match was  I give Hooters      overall  provided you always know it s pretty damn cheap and you re not expecting to be treated like royalty for that price  
P =>   HOOTERS HOTEL is     Its very hard to find a hotel that is so inexpensive in the strip or near the strip  I did some serious research and found out that the Hooters Hotel is next to the MGM Grand Hotel  right across from each other  I was sick of paying for taxi cabs in Vegas  I decided to walk from Hooters to anywhere in the strip which was fun because you walk through hotel to hotel which isn t bad at all  The price is super cheap  the rooms are comfortable  The rooms are always clean  you can ask for queen beds which they give you two of them  There is    cent wings from    midnight to   a m  at Dan ino s  The wings are big and breaded which is a plus and taste awesome  So why pick Hooters  if your a person that is all about not being complicated by your hotel and walking a lot you should come to Hooters  In Vegas your goal is not to spend a lot of time in your hotel but to go to clubs or check out the nice hotels and use the money you saved on the clubs you want to go to  The poker room is amazing being a      table  The sports room is small but you can place sporting bets which is nice meaning they have that  The girls that work there look great  they really stand out  Hooters is a great headquarters to where you can eat and sleep there but then go out and party in the big hotels and clubs and come back to a relaxing quiet hotel  You will not find any hotels on the strip that come close to price and hospitality as to the Hooters Hotel  Just remember the hotel is small but that make you their primary focus  They have fun card games  they offer comps if you earn them  Hooters Rewards have a coupon sheet given to new Owl Rewards members which is awesome  You can hang out and talk to the pretty girls dealing cards at the hotel  build up your coinfidence and meet other nice ladies throughout the city  its a win win situation  There are plenty of free drinks if you gamble so you have nothing to lose  All these reasons make the Hooters Hotel      Be realistic  stay within your budget  your not going to spend a lot of time in a   or   star hotel and spend     to     dollars a night  realize that your playing for what check in at   at most   or   star hotels to leave at    or    am  thats    hours by     dollars means your losing    dollars a hour or go to Hooters and pay    to    dollars a night and that works out to   to   dollars a hour so do the math  I rate Hooters a     out of   stars  Hooters is a hotel that constantly rewards its customers with coupons  comps  and inexpensive food and inexpensive room rates  
P =>   Nice beddings A little bit off the strip  I once went to this casino to walk around and thought it was overrated  Second time around  still think the casino  and the girls   are overrated  But spending a night in one of their regular rooms   oh my  I loved the bed room so much  The room we got had great views of Luxor  It had fresh interiors  lighting was nice  and the colors were cheery  The newly renovated pool area looked pretty cool too  Bathroom was a little cramped  The part I loved the most were the sheets    my  oh  my   sheets to sleep in for Cons  incovenient parking  off stripPros  Bed sheets to die for  Reasonable prices  got our room at a special rate of     a night on a weekday   Close enough to the stripWould definitely consider staying again in the future  if only for the price and the sheets  
P =>   Absolutely fantastic  I d never been to Hooters before  I d normally stayed at the Luxor or the Venetian but we decided to stay here as we d heard it was very good  and it was brilliant Having stayed at whats seen as the  posher  hotels  I d say Hooters surpasses them all  the rooms were brilliant and the comfort was fantastic  only   minute walk from the main Vegas  situated right outside MGM  The pool was brilliant  we went in ember when it wasn t so busy so a late night swim or sit in the Jacuzzi was bliss  Loved every minute of the hotel  well worth the money and will definitely be booking there again  
P =>   Awful dirty disgusting Ugh     Where do I start  We stayed in a bungalow room that faced the pool  instead of the parking lot  which you think would be nice  Well  think again  If you love music at a level    from morning until after midnight  amp  the sound of children screaming this is the room for you  I called the front desk manager  Frank  who told me that the music was only played from    noon until   pm  Well  the next night  the music was on way past   pm and the manager  some woman  told me   quot Oh no  it can go on after midnight  especially on the weekends  I had to leave a note to housekeeping what to clean every day because somehow they missed the mold in the tub  the light bulbs that needed replaced  which never got done  and to unclog the tub  And God forbid they leave you more than one roll of toilet paper in the room  One on the spinner  that is all you get  We had to let the shower run about   minutes before the hot water ever came on and if anyone in the surrounding rooms is using their shower  forget it you aren t getting any hot water    of my   days  I had to take a shower in the gym locker room to get hot water  There was NEVER any hot water out of the bathroom sink  The site claims that all bungalows come with safes  hair dryers  and coffee makers    No they don t  I had to call for a hair dryer and it s curcuit clicker on it was a hassle  I had to keep clicking it like a lighter to get it to work  The carpets are filthy  I walked from my room at one end of the hall to the ice machine in my socks  When I got back to the room  they were black  I accidently locked myself out of my room  When security showed up  they didn t have me listed as being in the room at all  The gym is good but there is nothing to clean the equipment with after you are done    gross  The location is the only good part about that place  It s a quick walk to the strip  
P =>  Crappy room The rooms  hallways  and elevators are filthy and run down  The room smelled and was dirty  The hotel does have a nice pool and is in a convenient location near MGM  New York New York and Tropicana  
P =>   Great Value  Very Good pool area  great location  non typical Vegas rooms The bungalows are going for        a night      resort fee  Rooms are small and more like a motel than your typical Vegas strip room  Location is great    right across from MGM and   min from monorail Casino is very small   but fun  Outside Pools and area are great If you want to get to Vegas  have fun  not worry about all the amenities of a      room    and find a great value on our room  so you can spend your money on shows  casinos  et al    this is the place for you My wife and I have been here     times over that past couple decades    and stayed in the top end places and now Hooters     we had a blast in all of them  Just know what you want and what you re paying for and everything will be great have fun they have hi speed internet  but charge        a day for use 
P =>   Small fun close to the strip   great place to stay Let me begin by saying that if you want to stay in a ritzy  ultra classy hotel then this is not the place for you  On the other hand  if you are looking for an inexpensive room in a fun hotel casino that you are not likely to get lost in  this is your place  It is a small  fun hotel and casino with brightly colored lights  fun music and a party atmosphere all around  The whole hotel is a bit reminiscent of a beachy surfer atmosphere down to the surfboards hanging on the walls and the  quot sandy footprints quot  in the hallways My trip was a   day stay from Wednesday through Monday during Spring Break ch Madness so the city was hopping  I went with three college friends and even with being four    something girls staying at Hooters  we had a blast and really enjoyed the hotel  We also felt extremely safe  as we had difficulty with an obnoxious drunk guy harassing one of our friends one night  The security  casino  and hotel staff were wonderful and took care of it immediately  The room cost us      Wednesday  Thursday  and Sunday nights  to     per night  Friday and Saturday nights  The rooms were nothing terribly special  similar to a Holiday Inn or any other basic hotel chain you might stay at  also similar to your average room at Excalibur  Tropicana  etc  but the room was clean  the beds were comfortable  in room safe was provided  and our view was of the south end of the strip   NYNY  Exalibur  Mandalay Bay  the Luxor  the MGM  and the Tropicana and was stunning at night  Some people say this hotel is off strip and technically it is  but it is basically like being on the strip  It is next door to the Tropicana and across the street from the MGM grand   it is about the same walking distance to the strip as from either of those places once you account for the fact that both of those casinos are much larger and it takes a long time to get to your room once inside  We had friends staying at Excalibur and the Tropicana  and it didn t take us any longer to get back to our room from an activity than it did for them  The pool was warm   a bit small  but fun and PACKED when we were there  It was definitely a party atmosphere in the pool area  lots of people in our age range and high energy music playing  The pool bar  nippers  served great frozen drinks and there was towel service  In the casino  all of the dealers  a mix of Hooters girls and regular dealers  were friendly and helpful  The casino is small  but laidback and fun and a good place to wind down the evening  Everything is decorated in bright lights and light pine and the music is always jamming  The only real complaint we had was about the restaurant  not the Hooters one    we went for brunch our second day and the service was slow and the food overpriced  I like to stay in a new place everytime I go to Vegas  but if I got a good deal here I would go back  
P =>   Loved it Loved it Loved it   My husband and I decided to make a quick trip to Las Vegas kind of spur of the moment  Got a FABULOUS rate at Hooters and thought why not  We appreciated the smallness of it all  We could make it from our bungalow room to the front door in two minutes  Some of the bigger hotels in Vegas take you    minutes to do so  Our bed was very comfortable and the room was clean and spiffy  It is a quick walk to the strip  Staff was friendly and helpful  The pool was unintimidating and relaxing  Having stayed at   other hotels on the strip  I would definitely consider staying at Hooters again  
P =>   Don t stay here if you have breathing problems The hotel and staff were all great  lots of sexy beautiful women  Room really nice  A little noisy from some ignorant guests one of the three nights  they need some signs up asking for guests to be quite at certain hours  Everywhere on the first floor stunk of cigarettes  even inside of restaurant  If hotel was non smoking would go back in a second but no where in Vegas is  will never go back to Vegas because of this reason  couldn t enjoy ourselves still choking a week later   Paid a high rate for first   nights due to Nascar but on the return got an incredible deal  
P =>   Hooters is not for party poopers Hooters is indeed a busy hotel  it was fun staying there as we got to meet new people  also have a friend who works their who tells me that once clocked in they are on the go from the start time  Hooters prices were reasonable so could not complain about that  the only thing that got my goat was the room was a bit muffy as though the sheets had not been changed in over a week apart from that I would recommend the hotel    the staff were superb  very friendly   I felt as though I d known some of them for years  
P =>   Great location and great chicken wings    This is my  th visit to Vegas and everytime i go I try stay at a different hotel  Although the building it has gone thru some serious changes I can honestly say i was not impressed  It all depends on what you are looking for  in my honest opinion and in comparison to the other hotels it looks tired and run down  As all my other reviews  as long as the bed is clean and an hot water is available I am happy and since i got a great deal thru expedia I cannot complaint  However if you are used to more formal and structured hotels and resorts I do not recommend it  Having worked in the Hotel industry it can be a bit of a shocker as there is no formal lobby  The reception area is flushed to the left and not visible as the casino floor is immediately in front of it  I figured that the check in agents would have been HOOTER girls  sadly it wasnt  far from being hooter girls  there is plenty of then in the casino but none behind the front desk   guess it would be too sexist None the less like i said the room was good size  the beds were very comfortable and the bathroom spacious   safe in the room and iron and ironing board  Never took advantage of the pool since it was too cold to enjoy outdoor activities but looked good from my bedroom window  Only complaint i have is that the housekeeper forgot to take out the trash on the first day  and the hostess of the restaurant was miserable  we got there at       pm to go for breakfast on Sun morning and she did not even look up  all she said was that the buffet was cleared and when we pointed out the info in the elevator all she said was that they were old and have not been updated  but apart her everyone else was pleasant I will recommend this place as long as you are not looking for fancy decor  fine dinning  if you are in the mood for a good burger w  fries  chicken wings and a cold beer its awesome  as long as you are willing to share the room with    yr old frat boys out to play    lol 
P =>   Good Beer  You deserve better The wings are good  the waitresses are sweet  But the owner managers should get out of the business because this place is dirty and falling appart The scoop    of the   Jacuzzis are ice cold   The third has no bubbles and a broken timer switch  Not only an electrical hazzard  but a slap in the face ALL of the pool area lounge chairs are filthy dirty with large black stains like something that came out of a dumpster  Dirty used pool towels laying all over the place  no pool attendent or anyone on site to clean up the place  Looks like a frat party took place two days earlier and no one cleaned up My advice  Don t stay here  Call in for the wings  pick em  up and run back to Motel    its cleaner M  
P =>  Bed Bug Bites at Hootters Get another hotel if you can   This Hooter hotel is dirty  Beds are over used  un sanitized  rooms are smelly  elevators don t work most of the time  I paid      a night that supposedly in the tower   they book me to this room     that has the ceiling and wall joints cracked open you can hear the room next door like without walls    days stay I got Bed Bug Bites all over my neck  arms and back  Managers employee are rude  And by the way  READ THOSE FINE PRINTS THEY ASK YOU TO SIGN  
P =>   Perfect for bachlors not for bachlorettes For my friends   th birthday we selected Hooters for the cheap price  and relaxed yet different atmosphere it advertised  However after   nights there  I was happy to return home  I selected the tower room hearing it was nicer than the free room  and it reminded me of a cheap Motel   room from the   s  The furniture mimics the Hooters resturant  with the orange lamps and official Hooters magazine on the desk with suggestively posed Hooters girls throughout it  Although advertised as Floridan style  the fake palm tree and bedspread were probably the nicest attractions in the rooms  The artwork is guy related with Hooters bar paintings and boats  Stains litter the hallway and bedroom rugs  One of my plug outlets didn t work  and although Hooters website says coffee makers are included in the room you have to request it  I requested mine   times over the course of   days    times by phone and   time at the main desk  You can hear everyone s conversations as you walk by their rooms  The ultimate kicker was that the website states the tower rooms have a view of the strip  Well mine   was the view of the airport landing strip  The plus is that Dan ino s resturant is excellent and if you want some  quot Coyete Ugly quot  dancing and drinking try out Dixie s which you will be sure to get a free admission card from the guys advertising the bar outfront in the lobby  In retrospect I can see where the hotel is a great idea for bachlor events or a guy outing  however for the girls I suggest avoiding this one  
P =>   We actually had a great time here  I was pretty skeptical of this hotel at first  partly because of the bad reviews I had seen other people write and partly because I am a    year old female who was traveling with her boyfriend and friends  BUT    This hotel is a GREAT value  I loved the atmosphere here  which is beachy  tropical and laid back  Yes  the casino is small  but I actually kind of liked that  The cocktail waitresses paid attention to me  even at the   dollar blackjack table  It s within walking distance of the MGM Grand  Excalibur and New York New York  The Owl Rewards Club we signed up for was pretty decent on the comps  We got a little orange book full of comps  but only used the   for   breakfast buffet       in free slot play  and free tickets to see The Mentalist  Not a bad place  despite it s bad rap  I d reccommend this place  
P =>   Clean and Close   Good Value The hotel is located just off the strip near MGM Grand  The room was about average  It was clean  however  it took them till    pm to get my room cleaned on Monday and they acted like this always happens  The walls are paper thin and if you get noisy neighboors it will be a problem  If you complain to the staff they will take care of it as they did with my friends that were staying on another floor  Would strongly recommend joining there rewards program  It is free and the coupons alone are worth it  We saw both shows they offer for free with the coupons and both are very good  
P =>  Disgusting   This  quot remodel quot  is       This is the most disgusting hotel i ve ever stayed at  everything was dirty the bathroom floor was really sticky  the bathtub had nasty hair in it  Also the toilet was like six inches off the floor it was made for kids  The walls are paper thin you can hear EVERYTHING your neighbor is talking about or doing  I m very disappointed  If you plan on drinking expect cheap alcohol for a expensive price  The girls also look cheap  
P =>   Pleasently Surprised Very clean  We have stayed at Hooters on         The hotels is located just a little bit on the side from the strip  It was very easy to access the strip and we walked many times during the day and night  At times when we got tired we took the bus that runs on the strip  and it stops at the Excaliber hotel which is practically across the street from Hooters  The hotel itself was great  The rooms were clean and comfortable  Our room was on the   th floor and faced the pool    very nice view compared to the views that hooters can offer  The service staff was very friendly  We arrived around     am  and a room was already ready for us  Check in didnt take more than   min  The breakfast buffet is alright  It is located in another restaurant not the Hooters one  If you get the coupon book with your  quot  hooters rewards quot  card  you pay     for   people   so you cant really expect   star meal for   dollars a person On our third morning  we didnt have a coupon to use for the buffet  but the waiter was kind enough to  quot find quot  an extra coupon in his pocket  We didn t try the restaurant for any other meals so i can not comment on that  The food at Hooters restaurant is your average american food  We went to the Mentalist show that the hotel gives you a free ticket to   well you technically pay       per drink per person  so we paid about     for the two of us for the show  The show is entertaining and we actually had a good laugh out of it too  Would recommend The casino is very small compare to other hotels  bets are low and it was enjoyable for us  We spent a lot of time there and the dealers are friendly  Overall i would stay at the hotel again  BTW  when you check out they will charge you an additional     fee for the pool  gym  and something else  So be prepared to see that on your credit card even if you book this hotel from a website  
P =>   Bugs on my face yes BUGS A now ex boyfriend took me here over the last summer  I saw multiple cockroaches crawling around outside the restaurants and rooms on property  I found multiple crickets in my room  even one crawling across my face in the morning  Two calls to room service on two different days ended in wrong information  no delivery  and wrong food  The massages were ok  as expected but the  quot spa quot  is pretty lame  The location is at least close to the strip  The rooms are very old  so do not expect much  I tell everyone I know to avoid this place  I suggest you do too unless you like lounging by the pool with the stereotypical  quot trailer trash quot  and their rude children  
P =>   Exactly What We Wanted I am still staying here at the hotel  but would like to add my   cents  We checked in on a weekday and there was no line at check in  The agent was friendly and effecient  The casino is a bit small  but we had great luck at the tables and the dealers were very friendly and helpful  Our package included two free breakfast coupons which we used at Dan inos  The menu looks like it has changed a bit from the last time we stayed  but our rib favorite was on there  Our favorite part of our trip so far has been the two massages we received at the Salon  It s small  but full service and the girls in there really make you feel welcome  We will definitely be coming back here on our next Vegas trip  The value for our dollar was exactly what we were looking for  
P =>   Great time   great price   great location We really liked Hooters  It was in a great location  pools were nice  nice atmosphere  and great breakfast  Dan ino s restaurant   
P =>  Best Sevice and Views in Vegas Wow Great hotel      we had the best service out of any hotel in vegas  the breakfast buffet is okay for the price  if you go to guest services you apply for a club card  it s free  you get a coupon book with some really good deals in it one is   for   breakfast buffet  it s okay but i wouldnt brag about it  BUT the all you can eat ribs for       is totally worth it DON T EAT THE MUFFIN THEY START YOU WITH OR YOU WONT HAVE ROOM FOR RIBS       the wings after midnight are also incredible and the hooters bar is also incredible food    the rooms are VERY clean  and all the staff are VERY friendly  the show with Jerry that plays at night is a must see and if you get that card you also get to take the show in for free yeah that s right free but go early if you want a good seat like      as the line forms early  he messed big time with my mind and we still talk about it everyday  this hotel is a great deal and it s right across the street from MGM and next to Tropicana  enjoy your stay  
P => Truly a Dump  I booked   rooms for       and   st  and I was thankful the MGM was right across the street  The place is a daycare center  nothing but early    somethings  I d been here a few years ago when it first opened and they actually were trying  now it s quite clear the management has no interest  The table games suck  most of the players have no idea how to play  so if you like at least somewhat of a semblance of a blackjack game go elsewhere     to     minimums   The maid worked hard and the waiter in ino s was friendly and efficient  Walk fast through the casino after your shower so you don t have the lingering scent of chicken wings  I m not a snob  but there are so many other places in Vegas to stay  Don t waste your time here  Delightfully tacky  yet unrefined is an understatement  this is not the cure for the common casino     the common casino is much better  The hookers don t even work this place     
P =>   You get what you pay for  I guess you get what you pay for with Hooters  I paid    dollars a night  plus a   dollar  resort fee  for parking which I didn t use becuase I used Public Transportation  and a pool that wasn t even open  But coming from New England that is penuts compared to what Hotels cost around here   so I m not complaining about that  My complaint is with the whole  quot Vegas Strip quot  in general  much prefer the Downtown Area over the  quot Strip quot   and will be staying downtown next time at either Binions  Golden Gate  Fitzeralds  Golden Nugget  Four Queens Etc  all which were excellent  But do stay stay away from El Cortez  it is as shady as the reviews say  Downtown is much more friendly to people who are on some type of budgets  I was able to find decent Poker and Craps games in comfortable atmosphere s at the above mentioned Casinos on Fremont St  Also the people are more friendly all around  and there is a great cigar shop  souviener shops  and plenty of excitement in a safe atmosphere on Fremont St   As for Hooters  I will not be staying there again  it was just too mediocre for all the great places in Vegas  there are much better places than Hooters even for the budget minded traveler  
P =>   Cheesier Than Cheez Its I was within a hundred yards of this hotel  Hooters  Las Vegas  and knew I had made a huge mistake by booking two nights here on a business trip  The place is run down  poorly maintained and filthy  They must have layed off there maintenance and housekeeping staff  The place looked like it hdn t been painted in    years  cheesy orange chipped paint all over the place with a drab gray paint on the building  Rotting wood and elevators that had graffiti and smelled awful  All of this before I ever got in the place  The check in staff are all kids with major attitudes  Going to my non smoking room I found black grease in the sink and tub  The shower still had pubic hair in there from the previous guests  I found out why  it was because of the poor drainage in the tub itself  A    minute shower left me with water up over my ankles  The towels all smelled like cigarette smoke and the blanket under the comforter had dried blood on it  My room had a locked connecting door to a second room in it and I spent my first night listening to a couple getting it on through paper thin walls  I ordered a Philly Cheese steak sandwich at the Hooters Bar and it gave me food poisioning  Need I say more    Oh  their      free play money was also a joke   you can only use your      on pre selected    slot machines and you cant win money unless you earn       points  then you get     bucks  Save yourself some anguish  dont stay at this place   there s only so far you can rest on a trademark of girls in skimpy low class outfits  
P =>   Good location and good price I had read a lot of bad reviews so I was a little afraid but went there with an open heart  We had booked the cheapest category but got upgraded directly to Ocean view which I guess is the best category We got a quite large double room with a great view of some of the large hotels at the strip  The beds were comfortable and especially the pillows  The room and the hallways are a little worn down but not that much that I thought about it The casino is small but okay for just hanging out a bit before hitting the strip  The location is really super  very close to the airport   a cab takes   min and costs like    dollars  Walking from the hotel you are on the strip in   minutes  inside MGM in   minutes and it is also located just by a small supermarket if you need to buy sodas or stuff We paid    dollars a night and for that price it is a supergood value  
P =>   Sedsy s Hooters Review We had been discussing going to Vegas for a while and I somehow managed to find a cracking return flight and hotel package To keep costs down we decided to stay at hooters hotel as they gave us the  th night for free I waited all year to go on the trip to Vegas and in terms of my expectations to be honest I was expecting to simply sleep at Hooters and not really do anything else there  I didnt expect anything from this place at all  maybe it was unfair to jugde before I got there  After a Long and mingin flight  when the plane finally landed at the airport you could see the hotel which certainly didnt look to impressive due to the fact you have the monster of the MGM Grand directly behind it  But the look form the outside should not be taken into account as it is inside where the Hotel really impressed me and was well beyond my expectations when I booked The Main floor has a decent sized Casino complete with Roulette  craps  Blackjack  poker and good selection of Slots to gamble    months worth of savings away  GET IN The rooms are clean i d probly compare them to a Travel Inn or Travelodge or similar back in the UK  The rooms are themed in a tropical style with a good selection of TV channels  a good sized bathroom with powerful shower  a electronic safe  crucial so you dont take your full wedge out with you and blow it on Black on the roulette  The only downside was our view as we got the airport  but to be honest it wasnt load enough to wake you as the airport seems busier in the day anyway  but if you are a plane spotter this room would be great for you But again I didnt go Vegas to look out me room and admire the view  i went up the stratosphere for that The hotel has a good sized pool area with an outdoor pool bar  The food and drink facilities were also better than expected here with A Dan inos Restaurant  a hooters and a couple of bars including the notorious dixies country bar with its    Bud light drafts and free for birds between     pm wednesday and thursday If you are going to vegas on budget I would certainly recommend this Hotel  it offers a good room in a good location to access the Strip and others hotels  I certainly would stay here again in the future  If you are going with a group of lads or a younger crowd of people this would be a great place to stay  I ve stayed in plenty of hotels in different places in america and Europe and I have certainly stayed in worse places and paid more for the pleasure  
P =>   Loved Hooters I recently stayed at the Hooters Hotel and Casino the first week in ember  I was with my spouse and   other couples  We have stayed there in the past when the property was the San Remo  and found it to be convenient and nice place to stay and we like the location  so we thought we d give Hooters a try  We were very impressed with the  quot makeover quot  to the casino  lobby  and bar and restaurant and pool areas  The place was filled with  quot regular quot  people like us  in Vegas for the National Finals Rodeo and enjoying this small casino and hotel on a  quot budget  All of the staff and dealers that we met were extremely friendly and the whole place was very comfortable  late at night the casino was busy  but not too crowded  and they played great music  and you could also see great live bands in the Dixie Bar without paying a cover  The rooms were clean and refurbished  and the beds were extremely comfortable   everyone in our group commented on that  We all had rooms in the Tower areas  There were only a few things which I would consider needing improvement  The carpet in the halls and rooms was not  quot new quot  but had been cleaned  but showed it s age  The doorways had some paint chipping and general scuffs here and there in the rooms  but nothing bad where we stayed  The prices have gone up some for food and drinks  since the San Remo days  but so has every place in Vegas  Hooters is still a VERY economical and convenient place to stay  It doesn t take you an hour to get to and from your room  or to make your rounds through the casino to find your friends  The drinks were very good  actually WITH alcohol in them   unlike some  quot big quot  casinos serve  and the pool area was nice and cozy with a hot tub and a fire pit with benches around it  This place is NOT the MGM or the Bellagio  but it s comfortable  and fun  We all said that we would definitely stay there again  it fit the bill for us perfectly  
P =>  Great Low Budget Experience Once again  my girl and I pack up the car  leave the kid at grandma s house  drop the top on the Eclipse and head for Sin City  This was a pure mental health trip as we both needed a break from work and kids and you name it  Las Vegas has a good way of balancing things out for us  This trip however  presented a new challenge for us Vegas on a budget  Cash was a little tight for this trip  so we split gas with some friends and found a killer deal on a hotel  Hooters Hotel and casino presented the perfect opportunity  As travel professionals  we managed to get the room at half the usual weekend rate  That brought the price down to         for the weekend  can t argue with that  The d cor at the hotel can most readily be described as a type of  Spring Break  atmosphere  Amidst the gambling tables and machines is a very welcoming beach atmosphere complete with decorative surfboards  grass skirt style paneling on the walls  palm trees and a beach concert style stage with dance floor  Not particularly incredible to look at  as compared to neighboring hotels  but not bad at all  For the money we paid as well as the money they asked for  I d say it was well worth it  Of course there were the  Hooters girls  walking around in their tank tops and short shorts  but all done very tastefully  nothing scandalous  That surprised me a bit  I though Hooters in Las Vegas would be way over the top on the T  amp  A scale  but it was very low key and subtle  There s still plenty of flesh to feast your eyes on if that s what you re after  The rooms were really interesting  The presentation itself follows the rest on the hotel in that Spring Break feel  They re very warm and basic  giving the feel of a beach house with bamboo trim on the walls and a hardened wicker cabinet for the TV  The bathroom was standard size  nothing special  however they do provide perhaps the best hotel soap I ve ever used  It didn t leave your skin felling strange at all  very soft  Everything else about the room was great  No bad smells  everything was clean as a whistle  plenty of toiletry items and not a bad view of the pool area   The elevators may be a little scary for you claustrophobics out there  They were very tight and a little shaky  no big deal though  My girl got a little worried   We re not going to fall are we   She s a crack up  The restaurants were pretty good  Nothing fancy  just what you might expect from a building with the Hooters logo all over it  nice bar and grill atmosphere  The food was really good and moderately priced  The thing that sticks out most in my mind was the fact that their restaurant was open all night  This was perfect after it was too late to venture out and things were closing up  It would have been a long walk from where Hooters is to get to our favorite eateries  Having a    hour spot at the hotel that didn t cost and arm and a leg came in handy more than once  This may have been the perfect place to have a low budget Vegas trip without sacrificing the action of being on the strip  Hooters still boasted an on strip location making things accessible  We had a lovely time without breaking the bank and we didn t have to stay in a dump either  I d certainly recommend Hooters for anyone looking to do Vegas on a modest budget and still be close enough to the action to not have to drive everywhere  
P =>  Great Location and Inexpensive Stayed for four weeknights at the Hooters Casino Hotel in Las Vegas in the bungalows which is what we asked for  The location is great  one block from the strip  MGM and the walkovers to NY NY and Excaliber  The rooms are small but clean  housekeeping staff is very nice  Had one small maintenance issue and they came in    minutes to fix it  Parking there is easier than most of the very large hotels  Pools are very nice too  If you want luxury like Bellagio or Wynn  this is not the place for you  We get up around    or    and stay out till midnight or later so as long as the room is clean and fairly comfortable we are fine with it  Would have liked another chair beside the one in the room and maybe a small table  but not complaining  We had a king size bed and it was very comfortable  Had the breakfast in Dan inos one morning that came with our package  It wasn t the greatest but for comp  it was just fine  We ate the    cent wings after midnight one night in Dan ino s and that was just fine too  There was never any line at the front desk if we needed anything  Heard horror stories at some of the others just about trying to check in at the huge places  I work at a hotel in a resort area and a     room place would be considered large but for Vegas  it is small  Makes it more intimate They charge for wireless internet  but we were on vacation and didn t use it  but most of the other more expensive places charge for this too  It would have been nice and some hotels do this even though they charge for internet access  they let you print up your boarding passes free  Hooters didn t so I paid the       and the girl in their gift shop was very nice in helping me with the computer to print it out  
P =>  My last time staying here Stayed in this hotel over Thanksgiving and I took advantage of some of the freebies they had offered  ie free breakfast buffet for   and          free slot play  Me and my wife ate at the buffet the first morning using the free coupon  it was ok but we could not see going back the next day and spending       a person on that buffet  It was a combination of ready to serve quick heat food and dry danishes  I have stayed at a rott hotel and the  quot free quot  breakfast there was much better  The elevators going to the garages were filthy  We didnt even try to eat in the Hooters Restaurant there becouse the last time we were there earlier this summer the service was extremely poor  The second morning we were there the maids were out in the hall in the early morning cleaning the rooms  We left and got back around  pm and discovered our room wasnt even cleaned  I had to go to the desk  wait in line    mins and complain about it  An hour later   maids showed up to clean the room  Bottom line        this is a dated hotel that the Hooters Corp has bought  threw some surfboards in the hall and decorated in wood  Ive been here twice and the service has been poor  My advice is take your money and for about the same price     usually less   stay down the road in the Orleans  I will never go back to the Hooters Hotel in Las Vegas and will recommend the same to my family and friends  
P =>  Hooters      Dixies draught   Can t complain So  a group of us booked a trip to Hooters in uary     months down  and we hit Vegas  Hooters of all places  I thought all a long this deal is too good to be true  and Hooters is going to be a let down  I read some pretty poor reviews  and expectations where certainly not high  But all I wanted was a roof over my head  a clean room  and some reasonable food and service Firstly the location  I knew it was near to the MGM grand  which is huge  but right on the strip  You are literally   minutes walk away from the main strip and have good access to New York New York  MGM  Excalibur and many more hotels  It cost us just     from the Airport to the Hotel  and you can see it as you land Secondly  the staff      of the time great  Everyone was very friendly  and more so with it being Thanks Giving  I find some of the reviews people left saying the staff where moody and bad is probably a reflection on the reviewers personality  The staff where great with me and my friends  always a good morning  and always offering assistance  There was the odd one who was a bit moody  but you get that everywhere  Also on the staff  the Hooters girls got progressively better as the week went on  The girls in Dixies where just phenomenal to look at  and again  very friendly  Food and Drink was very well placed  like it was in most of Vegas     for American beers  and    draught at night in Dixies is great value  Even with the weak pound to dollar  We ate in the Hooters restaurant one night  and again  service was great  and the food very good The room was much more than I expected  We had clean towels every day  a reasonable selection of TV  and it was clean and tidy  Some people must have got a dodgey room  because mine was spot on the mark  If I had one complaint is that you get a       of what your view is  One side is the strip  one side is Motel   and the Airfield  Shame that  but did you come to Vegas to look out your window  No  the real reason we went to Vegas was to gamble  And while you want to big it up in the big casino s  Hooters is a great place to start and end the night  And as said earlier  the location is spot on near the strip  and near the monorail stations into the middle of the strip also Overall  did I expect a lot  No  Did it go beyond the expectations  Yes I would have no problem recommending Hooters to friends  and I would have no problem staying myself their again  The only reason I wouldn t is so that I could see the rest of the fine hotels in Vegas  but when I return if I don t stay at Hooters  I will certainly pay a visit  
P =>   I just can t reccomend this place We usually stay at some simple place to save money for other things on our trip  My motto is safe and clean and I am happy  I want to say this was the case here  but can t  The room was smoking even though we asked for nonsmoking  The tub faucets fell off all the time and the room was at best tiddied up like a    year old tidy s his room when forced  The hallways weres simply dirty and the elevaters worked only slowly and sometimes  The pluses were it was super close to the strip and other than not being RIGHT ON the strip was super convenient  Being smaller  parking was a breeze and getting to our room took under   minutes comparesd to a half hour at some of the big places  Staff were polite and our room for the most part was quiet  In the end though i just can t reccomend it  With all the choices there  you can either stay a bit off the strip and save money for nicer rooms  no big deal if you have a car  or pay maybe    to    dolllars more a night  things are very competitive now with the market in Vegas  and stay at nicer place on the strip  We dresssed up to go out and felt a bit like freaks going through the casino to the car  It is a very simple casion with casual people  A suit and cocktail dress couple walking through here really stand out  
P =>   Good hotel we had a nice stay here  We stayed here   nights at the end of ober  Room was big and clean  They gave us clean towels every day and changed the sheets once  The hotel and casino is layed back and there is a lot to do  On certain days ladies drink for free from about     pm in the Dixie bar  You have to take the      gameplay you receive with a grain of salt  of course you re not going to win on those machines in the roped off area but hey  just have fun with it for    minutes right Unlike the comment further below  the girls were curvy enough for us and they were all dressed up during halloween  We did not run into any rude staff members at all  everyone was friendly  
P =>   Not Too Shabby    Ladies and i went to HOOTERS hotel for a quick cheap Vegas getaway  The Hotel was okay  Obviously an older hotal that was re vamped with tropical decor If you are looking for Clean  Neat and fancy  this isn t the place for you  Bar stools were broken  bathroom counters were stained  the drian in the shower backed up  Other than the above it was pretty decent  After all  it s just a place to sleep after a long day on the strip We had a Bungalo which is the way to go if you are there in the warmer months  It backs up directly to the pool  Music at the pool turns on around       which can be annoying If you are looking for CHEAP  and EASY   Go for HOOTERS  
P =>   Thought Hooters was supposed to have women  I stayed at the Hooters Hotel and Casino for the Hooters experience that I get at my neighborhood Hooters  The majority of the Hooters girl here are frail thin with no curves at all except for the ones that have obviously gone under the knife  Not sure but most of the girls don t look old enough to be working in the casino or serving drinks  No curves at this Hooters  Very disappointing  
P =>   Hooters was truly Fantastic My wife and I stayed for    nights recently on our first visit to Vegas from the UK  We were amazed after reading some bad reviews at how fantastic the hotel was  The room was very clean and spacious and the bed was enormous  It was ideally placed both near the airport      in a taxi  and also in walking distance of the strip  While the      free slot play is limited to the promotional machines  only a jackpot win pays  we took advantage of the free show and saw the  Mentalist  Gerry McCambridge  What a fantastic show and completely free  no catches  The pool area was extremely clean and very relaxing  my wife especially enjoyed the hot tubs  The staff were very friendly and we ate in the Hooters restaurant a number of times  on each visit the food and service were excellent  On our last night we paid for a picture with the Hooters girls from the restaurant photographer and she very generously gave us two pictures for the price of one  A tip for others  the Excalibour Hotel offers time share tours with some excellant prizes just for going  We spent   hours  yes I know  but as we were there for    days it didn t matter really  listening to a woman talk with no intention of buying  At the end we got free Lance Burton tickets  tax had to be paid on them  and   x     vouchers for food gambling at the Mandalay Bay  The Luxor  The Excalibour  The MGM Grand or The Mirage  If you can afford to lose a morning and know how to just say  quot no thank you quot  then I would highly recommend it  we had three excellent meals and made a profit on our gambling   
P =>   Great room great staff and great surroundings I stayed at the Hooters and being a travel agent  I hear a lot of positives and negatives about many hotels  I personally stayed in the Hooters and would recommend it to anyone  The staff are super nice and friendly  The beds were comfy and the room was spacious  The best thing and a lot of people notice this  it dosen t take    minutes to walk from the front door to the rooms  the casino isn t huge so there isn t a lot to walk through I look forward to my next stay at the Hooters  
P =>   very good got a       per night rate  It really was a good room  I thought it was clean and the bed was very comfortable  The place was very quiet at night  it is close to the airport so there was take off and landing noise during the day but no airport noise at night  The casino is fun  The pool area is nice  We would stay here again  
P =>   Pleasant stay Not awful Not Excellent I recently stayed at the Hooters casino hotel  Was a bit apprehensive at first after reading all the negative reviews bu booked through priceline so it was take it or lose out Thankfully I was suprised when I got to my room in the tower was a spacious twin room plenty of room and most importantly clean  didnt see any of the dirt othes mentioned The pool was great but did tend to get crowded sometimes and I wouldn t like to be in the bungalows with the music on from dawn till dusk  could only slightly hear it in the towers Found th staff friendly enough but didnt really have loads of dealings with them so cant say how they would have handled any complaints Oh and the shampoo and conditioner smells really lovely Its in a good location only a short walk from the tropicana and MGM  the walks prob less than getting out of some casinos from your roomFor the money they charge you get what you pay so dont go in expecting some swanky hotel  
P =>   Brilliant time at Hooters We decided to stop at Hooters as last year some of the party that we went Vegas with stopped there and really enjoyed it I can honestly say that i didn t have a problem with the hotel at all The location was great the room was large and spacious and had the most comfortable bed I ve ever slept in  The pool was also great Its location at the southern end of the strip was really handy and considering the price of some of the hotels in the vicinity it was really good value for money The main benefit though was the size of the hotel it was not too big I ve been to other hotels in Vegas and it takes ages to get to the room We had a brilliant time and would definately stop again next time we re in Sin City The only compliants i can make are the dirty carpets in the corridors and Dan inos wasn t the best but who cares Vegas is full of restaurants  
P =>   You get what you pay for We stayed at Hooters in tember       Had booked the bungalow category by the poolside which had some downsides but then  on the other hand  was really cheap  I guess you get what you pay for  The room was clean  however  the carpets in the bungalow part of Hooters were horrible   both on the corridors and in the room  Dirty and smelly  Another downside was that there was no fridge in our room  We did  however  really like the pool are  Had great fun at the casino  too and enjoyed the restaurant  Service was good  It is very close to the strip but a real budget alternative if you do not want to pay the prices for the big hotels on the strip  Overall  I can recommend this place  You might not want to chose the bungalow category though     
P =>   Three Nights at Hooters Las Vegas I arrived at Hooters at  am  but was not allowed to check in until  pm  This is a somewhat small hotel in Vegas standards  so do not plan for an early check in The casino is rather small  but the hotel is in a nice location being near to MGM Grand  New York New York  Tropicana and Excaliber The hallways are dark with old stains on the carpeting  But the rooms are decent  clean and lively with the Hooter s orange decorated interior  Not too many outlets for portable radios and charging for cell phones  The bed was very very comfortable  The floor was very quiet  Housekeeping service efficient Hooter s restaurant was great with the best chicken wings Cocktail servers were great and Hooters has the best spicy Bloody ys  The S A S S  spa was great  I highly recommend either massese  Danielle or Lora  They both have different techniques but Lora was rather rough with the shoulder massage  I would recommend Danielle There s no TV checkout  so plan on going to the front desk to handle that Hooters is near McCarran  so I would suggest that visitors cab it instead of using an airport shuttle  
P =>   Fun place to Play but not to Stay I was comped   nights based on some play I had done earlier in the month  I played for     hours or so and only earned about     points yet they still sent an offer  which is nice I was given room     in Bay View tower  which is the older tower  I was walking down the hallway realizing my room was at the very end  I thought  quot hey  they must have given me a suite   quot   No such luck  In fact  I m sure I had one of the worst rooms in the hotel  I enjoyed a lovely view of a large AC unit  parking lot and the Motel   across the street  in that order   lol It s true the bungalow rooms are run down  more like a basic motel but the beds are very comfy pillowtops and they do have    hour a day room service B          L         D         per item   There is a small balconey too which is nice  I watched planes land at McCarran for awhile while enjoying a drink  Oh  the sheets and towels were stained with what looked like coffee  A nicer hotel wouldn t put out stained linens To be fair  the hotel isn t part of Hooters  it is run by another company  I think it is the same one that runs Sam s Town as they use the same toiletries  They also run Saddle West in Pahrump  NV  which I have stayed at several times Also  the walls are very thin  I was woken at  am by the couple next door having an argument  I would usually enjoy hearing a couple fight but not at that time of day night  Hooters restaurant serves good grub at OK prices  It s nothing fancy but the portions are large and tasty  and they bring you drink refills without you even having to ask The casino was fun  I didn t make money but hit enough good bonus rounds to play for a few hours and drink the free Michelobs  Drink service is very good here I got a comp ticket to see Gerry McCambridge  The Mentalist  What a joke  I left after    mins  Don t waste your money  Wait til  pm and see Bobby Slayton instead  You know you re in trouble when the guy has to ask for applause  Funny  most of the audience was really into it  be they ve never seen a real Vegas show before  This wasn t it Bottom Line  I ve stayed at The Orleans  Bally s and Main Street Station in the past year  I would recommend any of them waaay before I would rec Hooters  even if it cost a little more  Hooters is fine if you re counting every dollar my type room goes for as low as     sometimes but for a little extra  you get a much nicer room at one of those properties  Stay in the Ocean View rooms  which is the new tower if you can  It costs more but I m sure it s worth it  
P =>  We had a great time  Read some of the reviews and I was frightened at first but after staying there  I would definitely stay there again  We stayed at the Ocean View  the room was clean and spacious  The beds were super comfy  had the best sleep after a long night  For the price I got it for  it was a great steal Not on the strip  but close enough  Didn t mind the walk at all plus the monorail is just across the street which was very convenient  Sure  you can stay at a better hotel for a higher price like the MGM  but hooters is perfect for the laid back mid     to     s who don t mind a fun crowd  Plus  when you are in Vegas  don t waste your time in your hotel  get up  use the pool  walk around the strip and have fun at the other casinos which are everywhere Overall a two thumbs up    
P =>   Great for some but not everyone  Overall my stay at hooters was what I expected Don t think of this hotel and casino as part of the strip  Because its not  Don t think of this hotel and casino as luxury  or high end  because its not However  its not all bad  The hotel has very friendly service  The casino games were easier to win at oppose to others on the strip  and the hotel rooms were spacious and clean  Not to mention  the beds were phenominal   The location and price can t be beat either The pool was great  the entertainment was good  and the hooter girls are dressed just as approriately as most of the other casinos  The hotel is showing its age  and is in need of another renovation  In summary  If you are the traveller who doesn t mind staying at a motel   or the type who won t be spending any time at the hotel    Hooters is perfect for you If you are the traveller who has high expectations  wants to be impressed  and or pampered  don t be fooled by Hooters marketing  its not for you  Stay at one of the major players across the street  
P =>   Fantasic I was a little worried about staying due to the odd review and the price I payed to stay here  on the hooters website it averaged     for both of us a night      but from the moment i arrived it was just fantastic   We stayed here and later on at the Luxor and ok the room wasn t as fancy  we had a suite at the luxor   but it was clean and right next to the pool  Only one bad point no fridge and ok there was a chipped tile in the bathroom and the hall carpet has seen its best   but who the hell cares about a chipped tile   the luxor had them too    and I wasn t sleeping in the hall   The pool was great fun   but not       s    and i liked the fact there wasnt      kids annoying you all the time  to be honest i prefered the pool to the one at the Luxor   The food was brilliant and a sensible price  as were the drinks The hooters girls service was great and there are increadibly friendly  It just had a friendly  personal feel that the other casinos didnt have  Its right next to the strip and is      better value for money   We stayed at both as we wanted to experience more than one hotel   and it was broken up by a night at the canyon  but when we go back to vegas I d pick Hooters over the Luxor every time   the value was brilliant and I d rather spend my money on other things than a room I spend no time in at all really  Overall Fab     
P =>  Hooters   give them a chance   A quick review of our   nights at Hooters  We stayed   nights in late y in a total of   rooms     people  Everyone had a great time  We were upgraded from the bungalo room we d booked to a tower room at no charge   just for asking  The front desk folks were friendly and fast to check us in  The casino hotel itself is a remodeled older place  but clean enough  To make a fair comparison to other places to stay  you must factor in price  We paid about     a night and expedia gave us a     gas card for staying   nights  The rooms were spacious and clean  Beds and restroom were perfectly acceptable  The pool was large and had a fun atmosphere going on  We did join the players club and   of the   of us actually won     for the free slot play  People complaining about some free gambling crack me up  Do you think everybody wins     of the   of us that used the  nd offer of     in match play for table games won also  If you are a Bud Light drinker like me they provide the tall aluminum bottles when you are gambling   And when I arrived home  there was an email offering a free   night stay to come back  I d recommend avoiding the midnight      wings they were not good at all  You won t get the level of luxury at a lot of hotel   casinos in Vegas  but if you want to spend your money sightseeing and gambling instead of paying          a night for a hotel room   stay at Hooters 
P =>  A good deal A great hotel for the price  We paid just     per night and got a     gas card from Expedia com making the total cost for   nights just      When we arrived we were given a room upgrade without asking   which I figure happens often because there are only about a dozen of these rooms and once they fill they start upgrading  My advice is to book the cheapest room and roll the dice and test your luck to see if you get the upgrade  The room is better than you would expect for the price  but not necessarily the best  Those that don t spend much time in their room or have relatively low expectations will LOVE this steal of a hotel  Hotel snobs should look elsewhere  Also  skip the breakfast buffet which was sub par  You can get much better food elsewhere for the same cost  Play the    cent video poker blackjack at the bar at the back of the casino  You ll get constant complementary drinks while you play and the beer there is kept at a chill    degrees  Delicious  
P =>  Weekend in Vegas I was heading to Vegas to meet up with friends and see a couple concerts over the weekend  I had been in this hotel previously when it was called the San Remo  The Hooters is located across the street from the MGM Grand where my concert was that weekend  The hotel is a typical one  has the pool scene  band playing and of course gambling  I was in a room poolside that from first guess you d think would be too loud but there is a barrier between the rooms and pool so it wasn t that bad  The room was fine  nothing special and was clean enough  I chose it mainly for price as it was under a      a night and it wasn t a rundown out of the way location  
P =>  Great Time at Hooters I was a little reluctant to stay at Hooters but we could not pass up the good rates  It is in a good location and is close to the strip  It takes less than five minutes to walk The rooms are decent for the price and are clean  The hallways look like they could use some remodeling  We loved the casino and had a great time  The staff were friendly and service was great  There were only   or   that acted as though you were bothering them  The tables are cheap and during the day you will find       tables  We did not go swimming but we did walk out to the pool  It looks nice and has a tiki bar Besides sight seeing we stayed mostly at this casino to gamble  And we are definitely going to stay here again  If this helps at all we are a married couple  I am    and my husband is     My husband loved Hooters as well  Especially the Hooters Girls  lol 
P =>   Best suite in Vegas Period    We stayed at Hooters because they were only     night during the week  We were put in a standard room overlooking the dumpster and the strip   All night the A C was rattling and the people picking up trash were very disturbing  We complained in the morning and were upgraded for the rest of our stay to the most amazing suite I have ever seen   It was two rooms  two full massive bathrooms  a fridge  kitchen couch in the living room  two seperate balconies  excessively clean and massive flat screen tv  I can not say enough about how impressive the suite was  I have seen lots of suites in vegas and this is by FAR the nicest  The comedian Bobby Slayton is absolutely hilarious and a great deal since we got free tickets thrown in with our room rate  although if you are sensitive about race  sex  creed  etc  you will hate him  The pool area is very nice and comfortable  Although they charge for the weight room  it was very nice and after asking nicely we got them to let us use it without charge  it is amazing what these people will do for you if you just say please and smile  All people who worked here were very friendly and accomodating  I highly recomend this resort for anyone who is willing to walk take cab for food and entertainment  
P =>  A Good Choice Readers  the Hooters Hotel amp Casino is a good  inexpensive alternative to the overpriced Strip properties  My visit was the weekend of       e        I traveled alone  for a reunion and retirement ceremonies for my military unit The price was      per night for the two weekend nights  For the location  this was a very good price  Hooters is about     yards from the busiest intersection in Las Vegas  where the Strip intersects Tropicana Blvd  Walking was easy from one property to another  there are pedestrian walkways above the street  for all four possible street crossings  I did not use the     bill trick  because the room did not matter   Remember  when you do tip the desk clerk at check in  be ready to ask for what you want   quot Pool View quot    quot Quiet Room quot    quot Strip View quot  or  quot Upgrade quot  are the common requests  here My room was in the taller  Ocean Tower    th floor  The window faced the Strip Tropicana intersection  This made for a fabulous view  I left the drapes open all night  so that I could see the Strip at any time  The view was clear enough to read the signs and watch the Manhattan Express roller coaster at the New York  New York Hotel The room was fine  It was a major upgrade from similar rooms when the hotel was the San Remo  It had a tropical  Florida   motif  and solid wood accents were throughout the room  The AC was fine  the bed was king sized  and the bathroom was fine The small casino was always active  and there were always plenty of orange shorts around  The table games are tighter than you can get elsewhere  WARNING  think twice before accepting the  quot Free      in Slot Play quot   You may have to stand in a long line to play a specific machine  The people in line looked like they were suffering  and those at the machines seemed to be just  quot getting it over with quot  There were constant elevator problems  Only one lift was available for the entire Ocean Tower  When this is the case  the hotel should open the stairs doors  so the more fit patrons can move quickly  Don t lose your precious Vegas time waiting for a lift The parking garage is nice  and Valet was quick only used once   I was confused about breakfast options  it wasn t until I got home that I found out that ino s had a breakfast buffet  I m sure I missed it somewhere in the Services booklet  but it needs to be posted prominently  ino s is a steakhouse  a guest will not immediately assume that there is breakfast there  I always left in the mornings There is a naughty girl vibe about the Hooters  Surprisingly  a large percentage of the clientele is young females  who seem to enjoy the  quot I am allowed to dress like this  here quot  idea  This is not for me  To me  it is about table games Personally  I prefer the downtown hotels  They are all adjacent  and the canopy protects walkers from the heat  The  Q is larger and cleaner  at about     of the price  I invite readers to read my reviews of Golden Gate and ElCortez  which are two of my favorites  I wouldn t mind returning to the Hooters  but there are other choices Contact me at      with  quot Las Vegas quot  in the subject line  if you want to ask questions about Hooters or Las Vegas Gene Padgett Starkville  MS 
P =>  You get what you paty for This is a great place to go   if its you and the boys    and you are happy with staying in a howard johnson days inn type property  The hotel is NOTHING fancy and neither are the rooms  The place is not the cleanest   but it was disgusting either  If your the type of person who sees a drink stains on the carpet  in the corridors of the hotel and get grossed out   this isnt the place for you  Not the kind of place I would bring my girlfriend too   but for a guys bachelor party its was ok  The best thing about this property is the location  You cant beat it for the price  Theres a nice breakfest place next door thats good and cheap   coco s  and the MgM grand is across the street  Vegas has a way of getting lots of money out of your pocket   whether it be gambling  partying  or just doing the different tours and shows   So If i was going back with a few guys   I would come back here   with my girl   the Mgm grand is nice and I hear the price is reasonable As most people in vegas   we spent very little time in the room sleeping  So for the     hours a night your gonna spend in the room its fine  If you want something really nice    try the Ceasars palace   but dont complain about paying        per night Remember    you get what you pay for  
P =>   Tattoo City   My husband and I were the only ones in the property without tattoos for sure  The clients were a little low rent but there were plenty of great things about the place   Quick walk to MGM  Excalibur etc  Great rate  we paid around     a night and I have paid more  a lot more for less value The room was spacious and the bed VERY comfortable and the pillows soft and not the usual hotel rock hard  Our floor was very quiet  maybe because we were in the non smoking section The air conditioner was a little noisy but actually helped put me to sleep as it runs       The casino was small enough that I could find me husband without too much trouble  and I liked that   The cocktail waitresses were very pretty and came around all of the time not like a lot of places  Overall a great deal and a nice room  
P =>   Enjoyed staying at Hooters This was my third trip to Las Vegas and my first time staying a bit off the strip  previous stays were at Flamingo and Ballys   We booked a Sat Mon stay on Memorial Day weekend for around       For this price  we found Hooters was a very good value for the money  If you are looking for a   star hotel with fancy rooms  this is not your place  However  if you are looking a no frills hotel with a laid back  casual atmosphere  then this is your place  
P =>   loved the place    The Hooters Las vegas is great  I saw some of the reviews   amp  I don t know what people are looking for in a vegas hotel for this price  the venetian      The front desk crew was professional  checked me early  gave me a free upgread without even asking the room was big  clean  very comfortable  everything worked  when I needed helf with my internet connction  the man showed up after few minutes and did a great job the atmosphere in the hotel is young  relexed  even cozy comparing to the big hotels in vegas no miles to walk  and   different towers loved it I was planing to stay   night I stayed    
P =>   Couldn t ask for anything more  Finally arrived at Hooter s after an horrendous    hour journey from the UK with Delta  will not use them again   totally exhausted  I was travelling with my cousin for a friends wedding the following day  Before arriving I was slightly concerned reading some of the previous reviews but there was no need to be worried  We checked in about  am with no problems whatsoever  The elevator hall ways were clean and had a very clean smell about them  I was dreading getting a terrible room as this would have just put the icing on the cake for us after an horrific journey but the room was way above our expectations  A huge room with   queen beds two tables separate dressing table with well lit mirror  very large closet and tv  The bathroom was a very good size too  Everywhere appeared spotlessly clean  The best part was actually getting into the most comfiest bed I have slept in  We were on the second floor of the Ocean Tower which had a pool view  this was blocked partially as we were on a low floor but that didn t matter one bit as we were hardly in the room during the day anyway  We had no problems with hearing noise from adjoining rooms Once we had caught up on a couple of hours sleep we ventured downstairs for a look around  there was a small but cozy pool area with a pool bar  A  Bait  shop selling souvenirs  drinks and snacks etc  there was two bars in the casino and three restaurants  obviously one was a Hooters    we tried out the Dan ino s Restaurant for breakfast which was delicious  good selection for a good price  especially the buffet for just under      unfortunately I never got to go to Hooters as the queue was always so long All of the staff were EXTREMELY helpful and friendly  we wanted to spend a day shopping and enquired about buses and taxis to various places  after chatting with two of the bell hops  I didn t get there names unfortunately  we ended up hiring a car for the day which prob saved us a fortune in fares and a lot of time so meant we could do more shopping   We were picked up right outside the front entrance by the car hire company and taken to their depot where our  economy car  was waiting for us  I was expecting a very small car but it was a huge Chrysler Sebring so I guess we were upgraded  We also booked tickets to see  an evening at Le Cage  a show at the riviera  we were able to do this throught the hotel and again the guy  an oldish gentleman  was very helpful and advised us of timings and stuff to make sure we got the best seats The location of hooters is perfect  it s literally a   min walk from the strip  it s right opposite the MGM which also has a monorail stop so handy for that as well The only fault I could find was that the ice machine wasn t working on our floor so we had to use the one upstairs but I would hardly say that s a problem or inconvenience  People have complained on here about not getting towels or bedding changed  there are little cards in the room explaining about helping save the environment and only having the bed changed if you really needed it  if you did all you had to do was place the card on the bed and they would do this  as quite a  green  person myself I was quite happy with this  The pool area got very very busy with the younger crowd on a weekend with a live DJ playing very live music so not ideal if you are wanting a relaxing sunbathe This was my fifth visit to vegas and i ve stayed in different places each time  this is definitely one of the best values for money  Some friends were staying at the bellagio and we went to see there room and to be honest it wasn t all that it s cracked up to be  for what they paid I would have expected a lot more  and there was a really bad smell in the corridors  I would definitely stay at Hooters again  it s not a huge hotel and only has a small casino  but this makes it a lot more enjoyable and friendly  
P =>   Awesome Price for such a Good Location  I believe this is one of the best properties for the price and location in las vegas it is directly accross from The MGM Grand   Although it is not directly on the strip it might as well be you can be at the MGM grand in less than a   minute walk  From there you can catch the monorail all the way up and down the strip  Pete s Poker is also not a bad little place to play some cards there is usually only about   or   tables running but the dealers are great and the company is better  
P =>  no frills hotel great value very close to Strip Stayed at this hotel at the start of e  Weather was very hot  the airconditioning  if a little loud  kept the room cool  Hooters is within  mins walk of the Strip  just past Tropicana Swift taxi ride from airport  about      Checkin efficent  No problems  Stayed in one of the rooms in the  Bungelow  section  Arrived Saturday afternoon  and the pool party was in full swing  Plenty of    somethings around the pool with the music at full volume  that was the only day  to be fair  it was like that  the rest of the week was ok  the room was large and comfortable  sure  it wasn t the  wynn   but i wasn t paying top dollar  the only major problem    not the hotel s fault    was a very loud  cricket  that seem to share my room at night  i eventually found it on the final night and dealt with it  room was cleaned daily  with fresh towels etc  good range of tv channels  but you won t need them while in vegas  i would suggest using hotel as base  and spend time elsewhere  i would recommend this hotel  and may stay there again  enjoy  
P =>   Very good value a great find for     a night  We arrived at the hotel fairly late in the evening  at around     pm  Luckily we had no trouble checking in the staff were friendly and helpful  Our room was located in the bungalows by the pool  on the second floor  Going into the property I was slightly worried by the worn look of the corridors  the room was a pleasant suprise though  and brightly decorated  Our room contained a bed  two bedside tables  a bigger table  a TV  and bathroom with shampoo  conditioner  soap and body lotion  The bed wasn t too comfortable  but it was more than big enough  Since we were in Vegas we didn t spend too much time sleeping  so it wasn t a big deal  I was slightly worried about the hotel location  but I need not have worried  The hotel is so near the Strip it wasn t a big deal not to be staying there  It s actually nearer to the action than hotels at either end of the stip  such a Circus Circus  All in all this was great value and I would consider staying here again  However  due to the uncomfortable beds  I would probably check prices elsewhere before looking at Hooters again  
P =>  Worst Hotel In Las Vegas  Unbelievably poor hotel stay folks  I am a long time Vegas resident and I have been staying in Las Vegas casinos since the mid     s  Since it was Memorial Day and the prices were high  my aunt had three free nights at Hooter s Saturday through Tuesday and I accepted  Oh my God  Stick to the food  and girls in orange shorts  business Hooters     You know nothing about casino and hotel management  This place is so poorly laid out it looks like slot machines were dropped from the sky into a barn  The main floor is small  crowded  unorganized  ugly  dirty and there is no place to walk  Hooters is a place for people who have lost the will to live or have NEVER EVER been to Las Vegas before and think it s the happening place The hotel was crowded due to the holiday  Yes they have young girls in tight orange shorts selling chicken  but as we all know not every girl is a beauty queen   OK  I am not Denzel Washington or Brad Pitt either   Anyway  my aunt checks me in Saturday night and we get into the rickety elevator defaced by graffiti   HInt  If there is no security guard checking your room key card before you get on the elevator  you are in the wrong Vegas hotel   Once we got off the Bayview elevator  as distinguished from their Oceanview  section   we immediately noticed the filthy  horribly stained and frayed carpet as trays of food set out for the roaches to commit suicide on  Plus this hotel stinks too  I cannot understand how this hotel allows its carpet to stay so dirty on a daily basis  We walked into the room and it was barebones of course with more filthy carpet and yes there were cigarette burns on the carpet  I did not want to touch anything in this room and all I could think about was the room was FREE   I told myself to just try to make it through one night and then I would find another room  The rest of my family was staying at the Palazzo Venetian and I spent most of the first night with them  I stayed out drinking there until     am and drove back to this dump of dumps  I slept til  pm and got the ultimate wake up call  a guy from the room next door came through the connecting door  I jumped up and he ran out as he apologized  Had I been a woman instead of a   foot      pound guy  who knows how crazy and dangerous this situation could have been  I got packed up immediately and got the heck out of there  Please read the negative reviews and believe them  This hotel is AWFUL  If you can help it  avoid this crap hotel  This is NOT Las Vegas  
P =>   Pleasant surprise  quot Hooters has a hotel  quot  was the usual comment to my response to   quot Where are you staying in Las Vegas  quot  Yes  they do and it pleasantly fulfilled all my needs for my short stay in Vegas  I arrived late in the evening and was promptly checked in  I was told my non smoking king wasn t available  but I could have a non smoking dbl and change to a king the next night if I wished  It didn t really matter to me so I stayed in the dbl  The room was clean and nicely appointed in the knotty pine beach look  There were nice toiletries in the bathroom  not the generic hotel soap and shampoo  and two luggage racks   How many times have you been in a hotel where one person gets the luggage rack and the other one ends up putting their stuff on the floor   Pluses   Concierge type guy was helpful with info about transportation  On site restaurant open    hrs Players Club has all kinds of offers and promos  take advantage of it  It s only a block off The Strip and has bloody reasonable rates  Being at the end of The Strip  there weren t any construction noises as there are further up  Minuses   No airport shuttle p u stop  I walked next door to the Tropicana and picked it up there   Room service didn t come through  I ordered a hamburger at   am and waited    minutes for the    minute delivery  It never showed  Bad customer service  OK for me in the long run  Reeaally needed to sleep off the tequila and beer I drank celebrating the concert I d seen with my buds       Overall a nice stay  I d recommend Hooters to anyone who s looking for a hotel with reasonable rates and doesn t need fountains and a light show out front  It was clean  quiet and had everything I needed  
P =>   We had a Blast  Went to Vegas in feb  while we were there on the strip we sighned up for the Hooters Rewards Program  When we came home we recieved mail from Hooters inviting us to stay   free nights  so I booked the the trip for   The staff was super friendly  we arrived early and they had an available room ready for us  The room was very clean with a super cozy King sized bed  Hooters also gave my husband and I free tickets to Bobby Slayton  Not for the weak   We really enjoyed the show and would see him again  The BlackJack Tables were allot of fun and the Hooters girls were very friendly The only down side to Hooters in Dan inos  Eat else whare  
P =>   Ok for the Price My boyfriend and I stayed at Hooters and we were basically willing to accept anything for the awesome price  The price was good and we figured it was just a room that we slept in while we aere there  The problems seem to outweight the good and I am a pretty easy going person  The AC in Hooters was sooo loud and clanky  It kept both of us up all night  Secondly  no one is ever winning at the slots  Thirdly  the carpet is absolutely horrible in the rooms and the hallways  At times there was even the smell of vomit  YuckService at Dan inos and Hooters sucks  The food was great  but  each time we waited at least    minutes at our table before we even got acknowledged  The Owl Card  Wow    what a joke  For some reason they are never really able to tell you what you can get for comps as far as points go  Their was an earn    points and get    in cash reward  We did this and they cashed us out without telling us that we loose all our accumulated points to get an owl and other perks  They even have a        slot play that they advertise all over the place  The problem is that they have an area roped off and you are restricted to playing there with the         Their are about   machines and not a one ever paid out while we were there  We did see comidian Bobby Slaton which was awesome and our Owl cards paid for the show  Watch out for the drink prices though  We ordered   captain and diet and a second one as a double  The price              Needless to say  we spent a lot of time at the MGM which is right across the street and very fun  I would say this hotel really needs to work on customer satisfaction  I most likely will not be back  
P =>   hooters is awesome   me and my husband stayed here and loved it  yes its an older property in need of a bit of TLC but for the price its awesome  the property was clean  and the staff friendly  we loved the hooters theme and the restaurant was great  shame its gonna go  loved it   
P => The things to know this place is cool and when you go there make sure you get a owl card  it s free  here is a list of free goodies i got from hooters   six pack of beer   two for one dinner coupon          in free slot play      free show tickets   free stay at the hotel    nights dec      free stay   nights memorial day weekend     not bad don t you think  
P =>   Like a disgusting college dormatory Being right accross from the MGM you d expect at least average accomodations  When I checked in I was told I was in a  quot bungalow quot  room  This actually meant that I was stuck in the run down seperate wing along side the pool area  The first thing I noticed was security guards everywhere  Then when I entered the building I noticed the disgusting stained carpet all throughout the hallways  The walls are dingy and dirty  I got into my room and saw that my door didn t really fit the doorframe  The deadbolt had to be strenuously manipulated  I had a humble view of a loud parking lot and my  nd floor patio door was bolted shut  Its obvious that Hooter s is not concerned about the appearance or condition of these accomodations  If you re looking for clean comfort and a feeling of security stay away   
P =>  Not impressed This was a less than comfortable experience  The hotel is OK however is obviously a remodel of an older hotel  as can be seen from the old air condtioning units  The carpets in the rooms are dirty as are the hallways with cigarette burns and stains  This was the one thing that annnoyed me as the overalll experience would have beeen a   star otherwise  I would have expected a higher degree of cleanliness for what we paid The restaurants are sub standard  with the breakfast at Dan inos s cheap and less than you would expect  Although if you go for the fruit option that is ok  Service is slow Also the hooters restaurant is substandard with long delays and inaccurate orders being delivered I would not recommed this hotel other than if you really want   star service for a   star price  Location is good just off the strip but that is about it  Be warned  
P =>  Family Stay   nice heated pool and comfy beds I was upset to have won this property thru my bid on Priceline        fees  for one night prior to our morning flight out of LAS  worrying that it would not be appropriate for our family  However  at least on the Monday night we stayed  the property was quiet  The downsides     smoky registration area in the casino itself    have to walk through the casino with luggage to get to elevators   could hear other guests opening and closing their doors  making my children awake and fear that someone was entering our room   sinks in bathroom made getting ready a chore with four people  altho there is a vanity area with a light and wall mounted mirror that can be used for grooming    lumpy pillows   stained carpets  a bit of mildew in showerThe plusses    nicely decorated pool area with waterfall and large hot tub    soft sheets and soft mattresses 
P =>  So much fun   make a point to find Manny the Bartender  To all fellow Vegas lovers  After reading some of the reviews we were somewhat skeptical  but found Hooters to be a knock down drag out BLAST  This was our   th trip to LV and we ll definately stay here again  We both travel a ton  so if you re looking for THE Hotel or Bellagio Lite  this isn t for you  However  if you want a mix of the islands   LV   this is the place Our first room was too near the dumpster which was emptied at about  am   what a wake up call   haha   so we asked for a room change and received one without too much hassle  though it wasn t ready until later in the day  the desk staff when I did change rooms was fantastic and really funny  The entire staff was friendly  fun  and unlike other places actually seemed to be enjoying what they were doing and making a sincere effort to make the guests feel welcome    Sorry  Harrah s   you re  quot scripting quot  of employees falls short  we d rather get at  quot HEY  You re Back  quot  at the end of a fun day than some fake scripted  quot Hello Mrs  ker  how was your day  Mrs  ker  can I assist you  Mrs  ker quot  any day   We both have backgrounds in hospitality and I worked in Casino gaming for   years    Two musts  One   find Manny    he s one of the few male bartenders   and worth a visit in his own right  If you re tired of LV bartenders who don t know how to actually tend bar  i e  scan their bar  remember your drink  and make you feel like you re a regular at some local watering hole    he s your guy  While I m sure he could do the dog and pony show of tossing bottles and flaming drinks  he s more interested in making sure you feel welcome and swapping a good story or two  So go say hey to Manny  leave him a nice tip  and chill out for a bit between gambling rounds Second Must  Hang with the day time dice crew   some of these folks have been with the property for over a decade  They are real dealers who not only know the game  but have all the funny lingo down  and run a perfect pace at the table  You won t feel hurried or feel like a nap between rolls  Also unlike other houses that sweat the money   the crew and the box congratulated winners  with real enthusiasm and cheers and also gave newer players good betting information and were overly gracious when they were tipped or were put on the line with odds  don t cheap out folks  if you re going to put the crew on the line  play the odds for them  They regularly engaged players in fun conversation  talk of ch Madness  and inquired whether people were having fun  Huh  They seem to  quot get it quot   don t they    We had a blackjack dealer that  quot couldn t lose quot    but his personality and repeated yelling to the floor  quot get me out of here quot  was hilarious  You know the place is running well when the floor came over and started yelling  quot Bust  come on dealer  bust quot   Too funny  Overall the service was fantastic  the beverage service is probably the best in Vegas   it was very personal  speedy  and tips were received with real gratitude  Note  too that each bartender we encountered made a great bloody mary   which is a big deal for us  If you re a rated player somewhere else and tired of feeling like a number or that your play isn t appreciated  call Faye  one of the hosts  and consider giving Hooters your business  As a woman  I can honestly attest to the fact that the  quot Rack Pack quot  is brilliant marketing   and funny   and while they ladies are  I m sure  lovely to look at  they also have great attitudes and treat all players   regardless of gender or tipping level like kings and queens  And yes  they do have    tables and all the games  Their  quot light up quot  roulette tables are very cool  and all the dealers on that game we encoutered were teriffic  I think overall the best thing about Hooters was that people were having fun and there was great energy in the casino just about all the time  There were people in their    s sitting next to college kids and everyone was having fun  Even though it was  quot spring break quot  season we didn t feel as though it was a  quot frat quot  atmosphere  and the extremely personable and interactive Security Staff   especially by the pool   made a huge effort to interact with everyone and develop a relationship so that if one of the guests did go a little  quot over the line quot  he or she was humored and teased back into good behavior  So  in summary  give it a try  If you re looking for a fun place that doesn t take itself too seriously and understands that it s the overall experience as much as the win lose statement this may be what you ve been looking for  
P =>   Great for  Okies  and most others Just got back from Hooters yesterday and had a great time  As for the review a couple days ago  this Okie had the beautiful Kari  mentioned here often because she is great  compliment his smile right away  no need to stereotype people from Oklahoma    If you see her  tell her hi from the Oklahoma guy with  quot nice teeth quot  The Casino is small but BY FAR the most fun  I ve been to Vegas   times and stayed up and down the strip and this place is alive most of the day  The Hooters dealers were awesome  David and Lito at the craps table  and the girls were great too      of the ritzy casinos have dealers that seem to try to kill the mood and force you to unhappily lose your money  Not Hooters  we threw dice for   hours on Friday and Saturday  and it was a blast  Also nice is the fact that they will help you out if you aren t too experienced or get too drunk   Sports Book   Really fun and really easy to get a drink for free   just play some video poker here and there  It is small and closes early  so remember that if you have an early flight  You may not get to cash your ticket The rooms are OK  compare them to a Hampton Inn type place  I was in my room for about   hours a night  so that isn t why I went  They smelled fine  had a good pool view  Bay Tower  and were kept clean Pool area was alway happening and the bar  and scenery behind the bar  was great I probably would ve gone   Stars on this had the food been better and more available  Hooters restaurant is Always packed  I don t know if people don t eat at their local Hooters  but they all had to eat at this one  The only other choice was Dan ino s and it was decent for breakfast  but for a     dinner you ll be disappointed  unless you love unlimited baby back ribs  then you re in luck for         Once again  if you need Bellagio or Venetian glitz  stay there  If you want to have a good time with down to earth people  Hooters is great  PLUS  they will still actually comp you a meal or something for playing     hours in their casinos  I hear it will be changing ownership and themes soon  so pay attention to that  Hope this helps    Book it and Have Fun  
P =>   It is what it is Was in Las Vegas for ch Madness so knew I would not be spending a lot of time at the Hotel  Hooter s met my needs perfectly and then some    I was traveling alone with various friends coming in for the games  I had buddies staying at the Luxor  MGM  and NY NY so we were all close by  I have stayed at each of the other   plus the Rio and Bally s on past Vegas excursions I can honestly say that the stay at Hooter s was probably my most pleasant stay in Las Vegas  Since I was by myself  my needs were minimal but they were surpassed  I probably wouldn t have stayed here if traveling with my wife  but after this experience I would  The location is great     minute walk and you re at the Tropicana Las Vegas BLVD intersection  You are   minutes from the MGM monorail station  The price I paid was insane to be so close to all of this action As for the property itself  again I was presently surprised  The check in process was a snap and extremely friendly staff  I had a  th floor room in the Bay View tower that had a good view of MGM Monte Carlo   a little balcony that you could stand on and let in some fresh air   something that is rare in Vegas  Past complaints of old bathrooms are accurate   if you want a posh bathroom   look elsewhere and be willing to double your price  If you are using the bathroom to shower  dispose of waste and brush your teeth   this place will suffice  The room was comfortable and the bed was very nice  The place was clean and maid service was prompt and thorough As for the rest of the place  I didn t spend a lot of time in the casino  I like craps and they had only one table going and makes it hard to get hot  I spent most of my time in the MGM and Mandalay Bay gambling but that is what my plan was coming in  I thought the dealers were friendly when I did gamble and it was pretty lively  The pool area was pleasant and there were quite a few spring breakers partying in that area  but everybody seemed to be getting along and having a good time  I ate lunch at Hooters twice and dinner at ino s twice and had no issues at either place  The filet I had at ino s rivaled those at Austin s  The Palm and other places that would cost twice as much Bottom line   my experience was great  I d definitely recommend it to those of you that know what you re getting in to  It is not Ceasar s  Mandalay Bay or the Bellagio  However  it is as nice and cheaper than plenty of the other older properties on the Strip  My only regret is that it looks like it might not be a Hooters come next ch when we re back out for the basketball tournament  
P =>   I loved it  Hooters is a great place to stay while you re in Vegas  A buddy and I were there for spring break  and we saw fellow spring breakers staying there  but there we also met families  older couples  and business people who were staying there  We stayed in one of the tower rooms and it was very CLEAN and COMFORTABLE  The entire staff at Hooters  from the hosts at check in  the dealers and wait staff  to the cleaning ladies  were all very friendly to us  The price is great  and unlike other Vegas hotels  Hooters does not charge resort fees on top of your regular room rate The location is ideal  as its only one block off the strip and right across the street from MGM Grand  which also serves as a Monorail stop  We ate at Dan ino s and also the Hooters restaurant and both had good food at a reasonable price  The pool area was nice  nothing like Mandalay Bay  but we also didn t have to pay Mandalay Bay prices for our stay at Hooters I ve been to Vegas a few times before and what I noticed the most about Hooters was the fun I had in their casinos  The dealers  some are Hooters girls   are all friendly and talkative  They make your time at the table fun and entertaining  no matter whether you re winning or losing  I ve played at other casinos and the dealers are very impersonal  Plus  Hooters is not as big as the other casino hotels  so you don t need to walk a mile to your room  and while playing  cocktail servers make their way around much faster This was a very positive stay for me  I will definitely go there again  
P =>   Perfect for Okies  If you have no teeth and are from the Ozarks this is your home away from home This place reminded me of truck stops you drive by hoping you don t break down At the very least  Hooters should have good hot chicken wings right  WRONG  They were cold and bad tasting The girls were not friendly and seemed in a bad mood  Also  sorry to say  not very good looking for working at Hooters The room was dirty and poorly decorated  There was mildew on the shower curtain Thank goodness I only had to stay here one night  
P =>   Great for the price The hotel is in very close walking distance to one of the popular strip intersections  The room was nicely laid out and a very nice size  The bed and pillows were very comfortable  The decor was fun and beachy with lots of pine wood accents  The room was very clean  We were put in a smoking room because the non smoking were full and we aren t smokers  but the room didn t smell like smoke at all  The bathroom could use a little updating but wasn t bad  just old  The casino was kind of small but a fun atmosphere  All in all I would stay there again for the price  
P =>   It works I stayed at Hooters for a bachelor party from        th  We got a rate of     night average and booked knowing that we would be spending very little time in our room  With that in mind I ll try to include little tips and tricks we found while there Our room was fantastically hideous with the orange and greens  The beds were advertised as queen  I was told this never confirmed it  and they were at best full size  We used the beds for probably   hours the entire trip so again not a big deal to us but if you enjoy soft  big  comfortable beds this place is not for you  We had a view of the pools which would have been great if they were in use  The hot tubs were going strong      The casino itself is small in comparison to those nearby  However during our stay we always found it easy to find a table to jump on  and the minimums varied from       for BJ  Roulette  and Craps  The dealers were very friendly and attractive  We all agreed that the casino topped all of the ones we went to in terms of attractive  nice  flirtatious dealers  They definitely made the experience more enjoyable  If you go make sure to sit down if Kari or Kellie are dealing  they are extremely fun to play the game with We only ate at the hotel once  and we chose Dan ino s for breakfast  The buffet was only        and did the trick of getting a decent meal in us  The buffet includes eggs  bacon  sausage  hash browns  fruits  and cereal  No biscuits and gravy which was disappointing  We did attempt an extremely late night early morning visit back to DM but was told there was a wait  funny b c there was noone in the place  Overall the hotel met our needs  and we did gamble quite a bit in the casino  Most of us found the slots to be pretty loose and more than half came out ahead while in the casino  One last note I had been to Vegas a couple years ago and used the  quot Tickets   Tonite quot  service  Basically it just offered show tickets for half price the day of showing  What I found this time was that dinner and golf greens fees are now also available  If you plan to play golf definitely check this place out  We didn t bring our clubs and we were sorely disappointed as we could ve gotten a fantastic rate Also note that we did a Treasures package that included dinner  What it entailed was for    each  yes     we got a complimentary limo  no cover charge  and half priced dinner  We were told there was no catch  and there wasn t  The dinner was below average  go somewhere else for a good steak dinner Look for the Fat Tuesdays around the strip  There are   locations  one in Planet Hollywood  one in MGM  and they offer several different sizes and flavored frozen drinks  margaritas  etc  for reasonable prices  For example I chose the    oz  margarita and paid     for one  then refilled it for    the rest of the time  Compare that to one drink at      unless you re gambling of course  and that paid for itself easily Slots   played quite a few and found the wheel of fortunes in the round with the gigantic wheel in the center to be by far the loosest  We played in NYNY  PH  Monte Carlo  Flamingo  and Palms and every time hit for at least      It is well worth it  note find the machines that have the max  bet set at    credits not      Played Wizard of Oz and Top Gun and was extremely disappointed in the pay out  Lasted   minutes max on each Hooters Hotel Casino is what we thought it would be  and if you book knowing what you re going to get how can you be disappointed  Close to the strip    min  walk through MGM or to the tram   good casino environment  and cheap prices  Can t beat it for a guys trip or budget stay  If you want more than   stars shell out the money and stay at one of the many different options    
P =>   Just what I wanted This place was just what I wanted  I didnt want to spend the money that I would have to to stay on the strip itself  NY NY  Luxor  TI etc  and didnt need to have a room full or works of art  Wynn Bellagio etc   The price was great  booked direct with the hotel and the location was excellent  The bathroom wasnt the best Ive had   they were old  but by no means small or unclean   the shower could have been better but so what The two restaurants were good  just as expected  and the drinks prices were cheap as chips  Beds were very comfortable and the rooms were a good size   anyway  if your in Vegas  why you wanting to spend so much time in your room    The location was ideal   across the road from MGM grand  next to Tropicana   walk out the hotel door  walk two minutes and your on the strip   excellent Would definatly use again   oh and the hooters girls were a bonus as well    
P =>   Close to Mandalay Bay Luxor end of strip Got a great price on accommodation so for the budget this hotel has all you need  They overbook so could not get the non smoking bungalows  although booked on line for this   They moved me the next day  Internet access ended up costing about     of the room rate  The ribs at the restaurant are good  And the Mentalist show at Hooters will blow your mind away  Worth seeing  
P =>   You Get What You Pay For Buyer Beware  Hooters casino and Hotel isn t what it s cracked up to be  It s really nothing more than a glorified Motel     The old San Remo got just a small make over and now they call it Hooters  They really have a long way to go to match their competition  There was a real party atmosphere all day and all night here  If this is what you are looking for  then Hooters is the place  The carpeting in the hallways was patched in repairs that didn t match   we also had problems with the bathroom drains  The restaurants here weren t that great and were expensive  All in all  spend a few more bucks and stay elsewhere if you are looking for the real vegas experience  I know we will the next time we visit vegas  
P =>   Much better than expected I stayed for a week just after the Superbowl so the place was quiet for the seven days I stayed  Compared to the other strip hotels the casino was brightly lit but a little small and cramped  When it was really quiet few tables were in operation so I had to go elsewhere for some action  I was in a non smoking room with a King sized bed  It was clean  the bed wonderfully comfortable with a great view of the strip in the distance  There are only two restaurants  Hooters  yuck  and Dan ino s    hour diner  ok   The service in both was pretty good  The Dam restaurant shut a while ago and Porch Dogs is part of Hooters in the winter The strip itself was only   minutes walk  the MGM grand lobby directly across Tropicana Av  The hotel feels a little out of the way but the monorail and deuce bus allow for easy access to the whole strip For     a day during weekdays and     a day at the weekend I have to say it was excellent value for money  For the south end of the strip I saved nearly      by staying there  Not the full LV strip experience but for the price I m not complaining  
P =>   Great Value We had a great experience at the Hooters hotel  It s not luxurious  but the rooms are clean  nicely decorated  and a great value for the location  I thought the Hooters decor of light wood and orange was a refreshing change after staying in too many drab  dark casino hotels  The Hooters attitude comes across as fun  not sleazy  One tiny gripe though  the sheets seemed to be made of polyester or something and were not all that comfortable Check in was a breeze  the staff was friendly  the other guests were courteous  and I really liked staying in a smaller place where you don t have to walk a mile to get anywhere location is its best feature  right next to the Tropicana and MGM Grand  and within walking distance of the middle of the strip  Being right on Tropicana also makes for a very quick trip to the airport and easy driving if you have a car  I also liked that we could park right near the casino in a lot instead of having to navigate a parking garage The pool area is small but nicely done  definitely geared more toward sitting around than swimming I will say though that I was not impressed with the Hooters casino  It s very small  and what few tables they have start at     and are mostly novelty poker games and the horrible     Blackjack  Cocktail service is almost nonexistant  But  it s not really an issue since the much better casinos of the Tropicana and MGM Grand are right next door All in all a great place for the price  I d definitely go back  
P =>  pleasant surprise                 We travel on the cheapo and love walking  so taking a break from the cold and walking miles a day is a bonus not a hassle  I m a middle aged woman and have never been to a Hooters restaurant  I imagined the hotel to be full of drunk guys roaming the hallways  in the elevators  and at the pool  I thought it would be very uncomfortable like staying at a big frat house  But I m a gambler and decided to take a chance  We were there during super bowl and there was no need to worry  the other guests and staff were respectful and pleasant  I ve had worse experiences at Imperial palace with college guys screaming and throwing objects off balconies  Front desk  coffee shop  promotions  everyone was helpful and friendly  We had a problem with a lamp in the room  Staff arrived and fixed within    minutes  We were on the   th floor pool view  I m very sensitive to noise at night  The pool sounds and airport were not bothersome from that floor  I travel for work  we have vacationed many places and yearly for    years to Vegas  Hooters has the best beds by far of anyplace I ve stayed  If you are out of shape   this place is not for you   the beds are on a high platform and you have to hop in  there are bar stools rather than chairs  One thing I did hate was the large fake potted plants in every corner and in the room  It took up too much space it was in the way  Hooters is no frills  no waiting in line  great location  good nights sleep  We found our new place to stay on our yearly trip  
P =>  Not my favorite    We stayed at Hooters for Superbowl weekend  Thursday through Monday We had a Bungalow room  and the front desk wasn t especially helpful with directing us on how to get there  You actually have to go outside  around the pool  and through a side door to get to your room What was bad   Hallway and room carpet was disgusting and stained Pool view bungalows are loud  as they blast music from  am to midnight  One day housekeeping forgot to give us towels  The next day the towels we recieved were dotted with brown streaks   yuck  Tahiti Village timeshare desk within the casino means no shortage of people bothering you if you re a young couple  Players club line was always a mile long What was good      night for our first two nights Fun casino   minute walk to the front of the MGM Watching the Superbowl in Hooters with Sheila as our waitressI won t stay here again  but if you re looking for somewhere cheap to stay  and aren t looking for any frills  Hooters works  
P =>  The Good The Bad and The Ugly First impression was great  Then    Heat   AC   worse than an old Motel    I had to get up all night to turn the heat on and off Food   Dan ino should be ashamed of putting his name on this dump  Service   What service Price   GoodCasino   One of the best small casinos I ve spent    on  I hope OSI wakes up  They need the training staff from Bonefish Grill to shape up this place  Call me when you get your sh   together  Garry 
P =>   What a Surprise   We went to Las Vegas for a work related convention and needed an affordable room near the host hotel   Mandalay Bay  for the week  Hooters Hotel had rooms for     night which we reserved due to its proximity to the convention  I had reservations about the quality of our stay as we drove into town since this was a themed property and a re furbished older hotel    What a surprise  The hotel staff that greeted us on arrival were friendly and courteous and promptly directed us to the elevators to our room  which were at the opposite end of the property through their small and tidy casino  The room itself was HUGE and well appointed  The hotel was recently remodeled when acquired by Hooters and all the rooms have new furniture  including a large work desk that accommodated two of us using laptops  easy to use Internet access  a high bar table and stools for taking a snack break  easy chair for lounging and a large  comfortable bed  We were on the Ocean View side of the hotel and had a nice view of the Strip from our  th floor room  The bathroom was large and clean and had the usual features  toiletries  hair dryer  The room was well ventilated  quiet and was well cleaned our entire stay  The property also feature a  beach  area with pools and   restaurants  including a  Hooters What I expected to be a no frills budget stay turned out to be relaxing  comfortable AND budget friendly  I will stay here again and again while traveling for work to Las Vegas  
P =>   Great Atomsphere I ve been to Las Vegas dozens of times  including about    trips in the past year  I m a Diamond Total Rewards member and usually stay at Caesars  Paris or one of the other Harrahs establishments  but I ve also stayed at Circus  Circus  one night       NEVER again   Stratosphere  Sahara  Venetian  Monte Carlo  Golden Nugget  and a few of the non casino hotels A year or so ago I went to Hooters to play blackjack  Although I left with a lot more money than I brought  I left with a bad impression  The parking lot was old and creepy  the casino seemed to be dark and smokey  the tables were packed too close together  and with a couple of exceptions  the dealers seemed unfriendly I recently received an offer that I decided to use to add onto a trip I had planned at Paris for last week  I m glad that I did  I had a great experience First  the room was exceptional for a budget casino  My room was a suite  and althought it obviously wasn t as big or as nice as a suite at Caesars or Paris  it was nicely decorated  exceptionally clean  and the quality was much better than I expected  I wouldn t decorate my house the same way  but it had a casual and comforable warmth that was a uniqe change  I would easily choose that room over many of the rooms I ve gotten at other hotels  I also had a strip view from the   th floor  which was nicer than the view I ve had at most Las Vegas hotels But the most pleasant surprise was that the casino seemed to be warmer and friendlier than I experienced on my first trip  Either my first experience was exaggerated negatively  or they ve made improvements that result in less crowded space  brighter lights  and less stuffiness  Most importantly  the dealers were a lot of fun  After playing blackjack at the stuffy Bally s and Paris casinos  the Hooters atmosphere was a refreshing change The hotel check in was a breeze  The staff was efficient and there were no lines  I also never had a wait at the cashier s window Although Hooters is at the end of the strip  it s an easy walk to the monorail and a reasonable walk to the middle of the strip One of the nicest features is the proximity to the airport  I ve had cab rides from Ceasar s and Paris that run as high as     and take a half hour due to long waits in traffic  From Hooters the fare was        or     with a tip  and took aboaut   minutes We ate hamburgers at the Hooters restaurant and had ribs at Dan inos  Both experiences were great  both in terms of the quality of the food and the service There were a couple of negatives  As pointed out in other reviews  the hallways need to be upgraded  The carpet is dull and worn  and the walls need help  They caused me to worry as I walked to my room I also had to wait too long in the player s club line  The first wait was between    minutes and an hour  and the second was about a half hour Overall  my stay at Hooters was one of the best experiences that I ve had in Las Vegas  or in any other casino  for that matter  If you factor in the reasonable rates and the more casual  relaxed  fun atmosphere  you can t beat it  
P => ent for the price  Stayed at Hooters for   nights in ember  This review is based on the fact that I paid                for each night  If I had paid a little bit more per night I would probably have an awful review to write  as it isn t worth much more than what we paid The rooms were clean  You could tell that they did MINIMAL investing in the renovation  Covered things up rather than fixing them up  The HVAC was loud and rattling but it didn t bother us as we like a little white noise as we slept  The beds were definitely very comfortable and clean which was nice  We were given double beds instead of a king  but we didn t mind much  The hallways were definitely gross  the carpets were stained and they were dim and dank  The elevators were fine  We didn t eat at the hotel  but found the little gift shops to be ridiculously overpriced  go up the block to stock up on bottled water  gatorade  etc The location is GREAT  Whoever is saying its a       minute walk to the strip is ridiculously slow  We clocked it at   minutes The casino is fun  A completely different atmosphere than other Vegas casinos but we enjoyed it  I love that everything smells like sunscreen the beach and that they play fun music Again  if you can get a ridiculously cheap deal on this hotel  go for it  If you are looking at paying anything more than     a night  definitely not worth it in my opinion  
P =>  Nice for the price I booked Hooters Casino Hotel as a birthday present for my husband  It was a great deal       night  The location is fine   just slightly off the strip  The beds were very comfortable  but we booked a king and didn t get it until the last of our three nights  The hotel is still undergoing renovation  The rooms at this old San Remo Hotel look pretty good  but don t always have the right furniture  The first room we had didn t have any chairs  just the three barstools  The second room was better wth a desk chair and a nice bedside chair  There s also no coffeemaker meaning you have to go downstairs to the little bait shop to get a cup  That shop also has Krispy Kremes  The carpet needs replacing badly in the hallway  We got an odd set of towels     large    hand  and   wash clothes  There are few plugs  There is Internet  but we didn t try the connection because we didn t bring a laptop on vacation Food  Donuts and coffee juice are available at the bait shop at a reasonable price  We had breakfast at Dan ino s restaurant because the hotel gave us a   for   deal  It was pretty good  Good service  We ate at the Hooters restaurant and I wasn t impressed with the food  but the service was good Casino  Don t bother  The slots are really tight day and night  The promotion of      in free spins is an indication of how the casino isn t serious about keeping people playing  The money is used on    slots and gone in about a minute We probably won t stay here again  I think paying an extra few bucks to be on the strip in a more central location or downtown would be worthwhile  
P =>   have stayed   times Great hotel my wife and I always stay here  We travel to Vegas     times a year and search for the best rate and hooters always comes out on top  To be honest  this is my favorite hotel in vegas  The last time we were there  the hotel has declined a bit  nothing noticeable to the first time visitors  Beds are most comfortable in vegas based of apporx    beds i have stayed in  in vegas easy accesses to the strip through trop or mgm  the dam restaurent is the absolute best   am food in the world cant wait to go back 
P =>   Reasonable inexpensive accommodations I admit it  I stayed here only because of the price  I couldn t believe that I could get a reasonable room in Las Vegas for only     per night  but that s what I paid  What I got in return was a clean room with a comfortable bed  They have internet access in the room  but it s not free and it wasn t working most of the times that I tried to use it The location is next to Tropicana  about a      minute walk to the Strip  MGM Grand is directly across the street I visited many casinos during my stay in LV and the one at Hooters had more smoke and more noise than any other  There would occasionally be someone screaming out loud for no apparent reason  be it happens elsewhere  but here the sound travels throughout the casino I m not dissatisfied with the hotel becuase I got what I paid for  a clean and quiet room  However  I doubt that I will stay here again  
P =>   Not worth the savings    My girlfriend and I travel to Vegas     times a year and have stayed at many many hotels  both on and off the strip  I am definately not one to complain  the hotel for me is only a place to sleep   especially in Las Vegas  but our five nights here were a bit ridiculous  Despite my reservation they put us in a room with two beds  didn t make much sense  but having spent alot of time traveling  this was not my first experience with the matter  They were holding a package for me  which took about    minutes to find  but again  I understand these things happen  What bothered me was the staff  As a whole they were unfriendly and rude  and I m not talking about the dealers in the skimpy outfits  It was the front desk  the waitresses  the bartenders that really had an opportunity to make or break the stay for me and they failed miserably  My girlfriend was so taken aback by the general lack of courtesy and kindness that she asked to speak with a manager  only to be given a VIP host  Polite as he was  he merely directed her to fill out a comment card about the matter  The Dan ino restaurant was nice enough  though I had to interupt the waitress and the hostess from side conversations with their boyfriends to get them to seat us and take our order  The food took about    minutes to bring out  strange because we ordered    hot wings and celery sticks  and we waited so long for a check we ended up guessing on the bill and left cash on the table  The clientele was slummy and for the most part belligernatly drunk after about        For the women reading this review  my girfriend wouldn t walk the casino floor or bar without me  For the men traveling with women  if drunk guys hitting on your significant other over and over and over again bother you   find another hotel  And for you gamblers out there  yes the reviews are true  the casino floor is about the size of a basement  All in all  the service is not worth the savings  pony out a few more bucks and don t let the hotel and casino ruin the vacation   
P =>  Of ribs and chicks Stayed here on the Saturday after Thanksgiving for a night  and having been there the night before feasting on the all you can eat ribs at Dan ino s and almost lost some money trying to pay for the meal  I decided to stay at the property  I just came in at    am and asked the front desk guy if there s any rooms available  He said yes and gave me a good rate       for it without me having to show my AAA card or saying anything for it  Made the cash deposit  and he gave me the keys to one of the bay view rooms  The location wasnt that great  next to the stairs and view of Airport   but the beds were the best i ve stayed in a hotel in a loong time  and the decor is pretty hilarious  orange everywhere  a mini bar stool and table  and a mini tree  Service was great  the krispy kreme bought at the hotel store was awesome  and the girls there were great to talk to  especially the one at the store  Would return here if i want something no frills to stay in vegas  and definitely recommend it to everyone  Try Dan ino s restaurant too while you re there    good food for a decent price  
P =>  Had a blast a Hooters  My bestfriend and I just met up last weekend in Hooters for my   th birthday and we had an absolute blast  The room was nice and very clean  The casino was excellent and you could actually get a drink when you gambled  We arrived several hours early for check in and they still let us check into our room  The room service was excellent as well as our   o clock in the morning dinner in the resturant  Being girls we had read some of the reviews and were a little afraid we might get bombarded with midlife crisis perverts but this wasn t the case at all  I would and will stay here again  
P =>   A Hoot at Hooters Hooters is a nice hotel   rated as mid standard  there are good and bad points i will list below but overall the stay represented excellent value for money and would recommend this as a great hotel Hooters is just off the strip   about    minutes walk past the Tropicana  to get to the nice part of the strip with New York and Excalibur and MGM  It is over the road from the MGM and it has a monorail to get you around the whole strip The location isnt brilliant and you can feel a little isolated in the hotel The hotel has good facilities  it has an amazing restaurant  lovely pool and spa area  it has a good range of slots  but the main tables are closed more often than not The rooms are nice and spacious  big TV  large bathroom  was clean and comfortable The carpet does the hotel no favours there are drinks stains everywhere and the negative reviews on here mirror this  however this was the only issue I found that could be something to moan about Reception were friendly and informal  Room Service was nice and the staff were always helpful and approachable I would recommend this hotel for anybody   the girls are stunning and friendly so guys will love staying and eating here  It isnt too formal and isnt too enormous  I found there was a real range of guests from families  youngsters to older people The location isnt bad but another    minutes away and it would be an issue OVERALL a thumbs up to a very enjoyable stay 
P =>  great place I went out there for a my bachelor party with    of my buddies  We went out for   nights  it was     total for each person for   nights which was awesome  If your looking to gamble and drink  this is the place because the drink girls were so quick to bring back your beverage and the tables were not expensive  People have said that the casino is small which it is but not once did it get too crowded at a table  there were always seats at the blackjack tables  The hotel was right off of the strip  right across from mgm and tropicana  I would recommend this hotel and plan on going again  and the hooter girls were too bad to look at either 
P =>   Just OK Stayed at Hooters for   nights in one of the  quot bungalow quot  rooms outside the main building overlooking the swimming pool  Very good king bed and one chair but almost no other furniture  Loud music from poolside from   am to    pm or so  The rate      night  made it hard to resist for   nights in midweek  I might stay again in the off season  but not on weekends  when the price jumps to       per night  
P =>   FUN PLACE     We stayed five nights at Hooters returning last night i had to come on here and defend all the horrible reviews i have read that place is GREAT    well that is if u are not prententious or snobby u will have a great time  we had an  quot ocean view quot  room which was overlooking the pool  our room was very clean   spacious  cable tv  our beds were made and towels restocked the ONLY downfall to the whole hotel was the noisy a c unit and the dim lighting in the bathroom  but who really cares   the casino was alot of fun  although kind of dead at times  it was alot more personal and faster service than the other large casinos on the strip it was right across from MGM  in a safe convienent location  cab rides are    bucks to the airport  Palms hotel etc    dont take the monorail it is a waste of time  and take forever to get to the station at MGM  spend the extra money and take cabs  the staff was very nice and the pool was really enjoyable i layed out everyday  on the weekends the pool bar was open  the pool was pretty warm  with a warterfall and hot tub also we would watch the people laying out from our window overlooking the pool  lots of ppl seem to stay at the pool until late the check in and out was very fast  if i do go back to Las Vegas  which i will      i would stay there again    it is alot of fun  and i love the orange hooters lighting everywhere     we stayed at the Wynn one night which was beautiful  but i dont like staying in the mega hotels  too many ppl  takes to long to walk anywhere   Hooters is def recommended by me  
P =>   Dirty Rooms Hooters is dirty and yes there are bugs  I saw cockroaches and dead bug smears on the wall  This place should be shut down  The service is horrible  over   hour to get your bags delivered to your room  When I called the front desk I was told I couldn t expect speedy service  Rooms full of dust  they need a major cleaning  
P =>  no Party at all paid     USD plus tax for midweek stay Mon thru Wed Hotel is ok but cant compte with the newer ones is Las Vegas Stayed at the pool in the afternoon but it was quiet  no action at all   Hooters Waitresses behind the pool bar   dressed in pullovers since it was pretty cold in the shadow Lots of Hooters Girls in the Restaurant  but the ones in Santa Monica were friendlier Would stay again only at a lower rate Greetings from Switzerland 
P =>  Affordable and clean place to sleep while you see Vegas My husband and I stayed at the hotel for an extended weekend over  th of y  We booked our rooms       for   nights  on the hotel website  They included Bobby Slayton tickets our first night in town  The check in was quick and friendly  The hotel has a fun theme and the rooms carry the tropical concept into them  They were clean and basic  Food at The Dam was okay and seemed to be many of the same offers as in the Hooters restaurant  The onsite steakhouse was okay  I wouldn t recommend it for a great steak lover but alright for the money The pool area was very nice and a fun atmosphere  Try the  quot Hooter Juice quot  which was a frozen blended drink with a nice taste and quite a kick I would recommend Hooters based on our experience for a clean  cheap and conviently located hotel  If you want a reasonable place to stay while you enjoy Vegas  this could work for you  
P =>   Bed Bugs                      My brother and I stayed at Hooters Casino and Resort on t    th  I woke up at   a m  with bugs crawling on me and in my bed                       I went to the front desk to complain and all they would say is how do you want to pay for the room  They did nt offer us a ride to another hotel or anything they did tell me the Orleans had rooms but this was all the way out by the RIO not close to the convention center at Mandalay Bay We walked down the side street toward the strip and there were some people out who were following us and tried to get in an elevator with us by the Tropicana  I had to call a friend back home to help me find a room  What a HUGE HUGE problem for us  In Vegas and no hotel room at   a m  not a situation I would ever recommend I called the health department  CCH  on Hooters since I could nt get anyone on the phone  They came out and several rooms were shut down due to the infestation of bed bugs                            I have left several messages for the managers of the hotel and they must not of felt that this was that big of an issue because it took   weeks to get them on the phone  And the only reason I got anyone on the phone is I called the corporate office  Still no resolution   I don t know about you but I don t like to have to wear bug infested clothes for the whole week I am in Las Vegas working a trade show and attending a wedding  I would only reccomend this hotel if you want to take some bed bugs home and be told this is not their fault                     
P =>  Celebrating my daughters   st b day at Hooters We arrived the evening of her   st b day   Check in was quick and we made our way to the room to drop off luggage  We booked a standard two bed smoking room  Our room overlooked the pool area and at night it was pretty with the lights sparkling over the water Our room was very clean  the decor is average  the beds were very comfortable and more importantly it was very quiet  My only complaint was when we showered as the drains were plugged and it became half shower and half bath  Our room was serviced every day by   pm The Casino is quite small and that s a bonus as you could never get lost  We found the dealers to be very friendly and helpful  My daughter was forever getting carded and security helped out by giving her a bracelet to wear so everyone would know she was of legal age The food was average but the coffee at the Dam restaurant was very good All in all it was exactly what I expected and I would stay there again because of the affordability  
P =>   Fastest drinks in Vegas Baby  We ve stayed at the Luxor  and granted it s a whole different crowd  the service here was much faster and more personal  After visiting all the  quot Big quot  casinos for a little gambling we always came back to little ol  Hooters for the largest winnings and fastest drink service  By the way  I didn t find a better Cosmo anywhere in Vegas  The rooms are comfortably appointed and quiet  The view from our room on the  th floor tower was non existent  We booked directly because a family member is an employee of Hooter s in Tennessee and the casino gives employees a hefty discount  Even if we had paid full price it was a bargain  The Dam Restuarant is killer for all the food and service  But don t even bother with the wings at Hooter s restuarant  they suck big time  no flavor and ice cold  But do enjoy the Peanut Butter Pie  While the casino is much smaller than most  it s a  quot hoot quot  to visit  
P =>   Dirty and old but cheap and good location   you make the call  My husband and I decided to go on a last minute trip to Las Vegas for the first weekend in ust  I had a few hours to find a place to stay for that same night and the next one  Cost and location were both factors  so we ended up with the Hooters hotel because it was the cheapest we could find the closest to the strip  For those two factors  this hotel was great  We booked directly with the hotel and paid only     for the Friday and     for the Saturday  Also  the location wasn t much different from the time we stayed at the MGM Grand  The other nice thing was that after walking through all the huge monstrosity places  it was nice to come back to a place where it was easy to find everything and you could get to your room without a three mile hike  For most everything else  though  my reaction is   eh  Though this has nothing to do with the hotel itself  I have to say that if anyone ever tells you they go to Hooters for the wings  it is a lie  lie  lie  I know that s kind of a joke to begin with  but I found out it really is true  their wings are terrible  Greasy and flavorless  both at the Dam Restaurant and the actual Hooters   If you want wings  stick with Buffalo Wild Wings   I know it s convenient  but don t bother eating at the hotel   I have to say  though  we didn t try the Dan ino s steakhouse place  so I can t comment on that  Anyhow  back to the hotel  The outside and public areas seem to have been dressed up since it was the San Remo Hotel  and I think the rooms are a tad nicer  but the hallways and elevators are like something from the Bates Motel  I d read other reviews that mentioned how depressing the hallways were and thought   Who gives a crap about the hallways   Well  as it turns out  I do  They were that gross  The carpet is threadbare and stained badly  When I woke up early desperate for non alcoholic liquid  too much salt from all those margaritas  I guess    I walked down the hall to the soda machine with my two bucks  The machine s dollar reader was broken  So I took the elevator down to the next floor  That soda machine would only take exact change  Finally I went down another floor and got my drink  Then when I went to go back up  the elevator wouldn t work correctly  The door would start to shut and then would open again only to start to shut and then stop and open again  This started to make me nervous  so I hopped out and tried to find stairs  I couldn t find a way to get from one floor to another  So I went back to the elevators and prayed that this time  a different one would come  which it did   We were later in the same elevator and another couple said it was acting really screwy every time they used it  too  I know it s an old building  but elevators that don t work right make me nervous Something else that I wasn t impressed with was the fact that there were hairs in the shower  Not just one that I can understand  it happens  But numerous hairs that appear to be from different parts of the body  Yuck  Also  the in room safe was broken  we didn t bother to ask anyone to fix it  though  Something that is part good part bad is the fact that upon checkout  we were billed for a meal we didn t eat   I am SO GLAD I checked every item on the printout   It turns out that while we were eating breakfast at the Luxor  someone else was eating breakfast at one of the hotel restaurants and charging it to our room  The good part was that the guy at the front desk immediately credited us back for it and was very nice I know this review has a lot of complaints  I m not normally a very picky person when it comes to hotels  I swear   What bothered me here is that it seems like they just tried to slap a coat of paint on everything and present it as way nicer than it was  A lot of the problems I saw would be easily remedied with just some time and attention  maintain the pop machines and safes  make sure the rooms are cleaned well  wash the windows every once and awhile  etc  Overall  I understand that I got what I paid for  and that s o k  We had a good location and a bed to crash in for cheap  It s just that next time  I ll spring for something a little nicer  
P =>   Shouldn t have read the reviews here first    We booked the final two nights of our week long vacation at Hooters          as the price was very good compared to most of the strip properties  as there was a large convention in town  I always read the reviews on here prior to staying at any property and given the majority of favorable reviews I went in thinking quite positive about this property   with an air of aprehension  Well  I should have known better  My wife and I are fun  outgoing people and we had a terrible time at this property  First the pool area which is made out to be lavish is really a snooze fest  this may have been due to it being a weekday  but the worst part was they stop cocktail service almost as soon as the sun disappears around   pm  We like to go out for late afternoon swims  and as such if we wanted to enjoy a beverage we had to walk inside the Hooters restaurant to get a drink  where the service was incredibly slow  although the girls were very friendly  albeit not as attractive as we expected  The casino itself is small  with limited table game options  and lacking of the energy atmosphere of most of the strip properties  We found the two pit bosses and non Hooters girl dealers we came in contact with to be cold  thus we didn t spend much time at the tables here   the Hooters Dealers were much friendlier  and easier on the eyes  The rooms themselves  we upgraded to a suite  were ok  there was a    plasma in the living room  with a small bar area with a fridge  which kept drinks very cold   The beds were actually quite comfortable  That is where the good parts of the room ended  The windows looked as though they hadn t been cleaned since the San Remo days  they were like that scene from My Cousin Vinny  very  very dirty for those who can t recall   the carpets and couch were stained extensively  the soundproofing was non existent  However all of these items could have potentially been overlooked if not for the showers  The room had two showers  which may have been nice  however there is something seriously wrong with their water tank pressure system  In the course of a    minute shower  my wife and I would be routinely scalded and frozen in numerous intervals  we took   showers and this occured every time  to both of us  All in all  I guess given the price if we need a place to sleep  and they fixed the showers we may stay there again  The  quot off strip quot  location is no problem  you spend very little time getting out of the hotel as it is so small  and MGM and the monorail is right across the street  Also you don t have the outrageous taxi lines you do at other strip hotels  However we will most likely pony up the additional     and stay center strip next time as we did at the start of our trip at Planet Hollywood  
P =>   Can t go wrong at Hooters We stayed at Hooters for   nights and had a great time  The room was booked online at their website a months or so before arrival and we managed to get them for     a night Upon arrival we were not sure what to expect for that price but we were very pleasantly surprised  the room was big  had a great King Size bed  big TV  our own safe and a great and clean bathroom Sure  it s not flashy  but it must be the best deal in Las Vegas  it s only  min away from the Strip and casinos such as the MGM and New York New York  The room was cleaned daily and the pool looked really nice as well  never used it though  We will definately stay at Hooters again if we return to Las Vegas   
P =>  good place to stay on a budget I stayed here for   nights   a friday and Sat night  and while it s not an MGM Grand it is a great place to stay for under      night  I booked a week in advance and couldn t expect much on a budget  It s in a good location yet you don t have to pay for being right on the Strip  It s   blocks from the strip  I could have paid less for the stratosphere which is supposedly right on the strip but in my opinion the strat is in a bad location far away from the major casinos  There is a friendly atmosphere at hooters and I was definately hesitent after reading the reviews  The casino is smaller but that was ok with me  The elevators were normal with the exception of one time where we had to wait   minutes or so   big deal  We even ate at the hooters restaraunt  defying the negative reviews  and it was ok  It is hooters people  have you ever had a fancy meal at a hooters  It was decent food  no wait  friendly girls and good service  I would stay here again  
P =>  Loved it at Hooters My wife and I just spent y   nd thru the    at Hooters What can we say other then this place is incrediable If you are looking to relax and have a very down to earth stay this is the place for you  No snobs expecting something for free The rooms are very comfortable  Beds are so soft   The only thing I would say is the water pressure was not that great  I do not know if staying on the   th floor had something to do with this  It was not a big deal though So in closing if you like down to earth and you just want to relax this is the place for you  If you want upper class and people to kiss your butt around every corner go to the Belliago or Ceasers  
P =>  Great Hoot  Okay  Hooters isn t the Mirage  They live up to their motto of  quot Delightfully tacky  yet unrefined quot  but I would encourage you to take it for what it intends to be  The price was terrific for        on a weeknight I had a very nice room  everything was clean  and beautiful ladies everywhere I looked  This is a great place for guys and fun couples who don t want to have to remain casual and have a good time  The pool area was very nice and staffed by some incredibly beautiful and attentive ladies  Food was good at every price and prices for everything were reasonable by Vegas standards  It s an easy two block walk to the strip and I never felt concerned at night  It s impossible to beat for the price and I intend to return  Did I mention the beautiful ladies everywhere  
P =>   will stay only here from the moment we got to hooters  we loved it  we received excellent service from all the friendly staff   bradley you re the best  we arrived at         checkin time is       i asked for a quiet area i can t sleep    we werre given room       immediately  NO WAIT    the rooms are nice  clean  and the beds are so comfy  there was a safe  coffeemaker  table and chairs  huge towels and great water pressure there are   pools and   jacuzzis  plenty of chairs  the only downside is the building blocks the sun around      but by then you have had enough sun we ate ate the dam restaurant once  got   cents shrimp cocktail by signing up for a players card  we ate at hooters twice  enjoyed meals and service  the talapia was excellent the casino is small   didn t bother us   the girls brought drinks before we could even finish  figured the crown royal i drank made up for the money i lost in the machines which wasn t much   had fun playing our last day they were taping the tv show  quot the best damn sports show period quot   we did not have to get out of the pool  but the manager Kim asked us to give up our chairs for awhile   he gave us drinks and made sure we got our chairs when they were through  nipper juice is awesome we had a      flight so i asked for a room extension  would have gotten one till   but only took it till   because a friend was taking us to lunch  no chargethis was our  th trip to vegas  you can keep those monstrosities on the strip  it took us less time to get to the strip and our pool than if we would have been staying on the strip  we have stayed at tropicana  flamingo  harrahs  new frontier  monte carlo  aladdins  and ballys  this  by far  was the best  it is not a   star hotel   but we got   star service  i wonder if those   star places with the   star prices really give you what you pay for  hooters will see us again  
P =>   perfect Booked a bungalow room         and was upgraded to ocean view room  Room was clean and everything worked fine Casino was small  but I was always able to get on blackjack table  The dealers were very nice and better looking than your normal dealers  The dam restaurant was good for a late night breakfeast and the other restaurants were also nice  Just a short walk to the strip and the monorail is close by  MGM  NY NY and Excaliburs are all near by and offer a wide variety of entertainment and restaurants  We ate at Excalibur  Dicks last resort and roundtable buffets  both were excellent I am planning a return to Vegas in   months and will stay at Hooters again then  
P =>   Good Time at Hooters Went there for a men s weekend with some friends  True to form it is delightfully tacky  Hit      on the first slot machine I played so that helped set the tone  donated it back through the course of the weekend   The rooms were very clean and had no complaints with them  I would have to say that for a hotel just off the strip it is a great place to stay for those on a budget  The pool area was lively if you try to remember you are staying at HOOTERS and not the Four Season s  By that I mean the people are fun but shall we say adventuresome  So if that is what you like this is where you will find it  The casino was much smaller than I anticitpated with not enough tables for my taste  but there were plenty of slots  The bar toward the back of the property is a greatplace to kick off an evening and if you are looking to drink all day  make sure you look like a tourist and by the yard at the bar      for a gigantic Jack and Coke with refills for      One hell of a deal  The breakfast buffet was OK but not spectacular  They have omelettes made to order and the potatoes are great  Could not find one person working tere that was having a bad day and everyone seemed friendly and helpful  One nice thing about the location is right across the street is the MGM  We all got day passes for the tram and took it to the far north end of the stip and worked our way back on foot  Well worth the price compared to how long it would take for you to get there by cab  
P =>   Great atmosphere at Hooters  I stayed at the Hooters Casino Hotel in mid e and loved it  or in the casino and the room was typical of a Hooters restaurant with lots of orange vinyl and natural wood  A little jarring to look at compared to other luxurious hotels in Vegas  but it grows on you  If you are driving  the parking ramp is immediately adjacent to the hotel and access is very convenient  Driving in and out on Tropicana is a snap  Although technically off the strip  it is a   minute walk to Las Vegas Blvd from your hotel room  I have stayed at Bally s  Luxor  Harrahs  and other strip properties where it took longer just to get the elevator down My room was in the  quot Oceanview quot  tower  used to be the silver tower when it was San Remo  and it was large  comfortable  clean  and exactly what I requested  The hallways and elevators are a little beaten and dreary  but the room itself was great  I arrived   hours early for Sunday check in and they were able to give me the King no smoking room I requested  In contrast to older reviews I read here  all the staff I met seemed quite friendly and knowledgeable Pool area was very lively and had a live reggae type band playing on Sunday  I didn t see much cocktail service walking around  but service was fast at the pool bar  I thing large drafts were    and frozen drinks were           There were a lot of lounge chairs and benches surrounding the pools  and it seemed some were always open  The hooters restaurant has a porched area overlooking the pool where you can get food  Crowd was mostly couples in their late    s   early    s and not the drunken bachelor party group I was expecting  but it was a Sunday Casino is a little small  but they have all the table games and a good variety of slots  I found     JOB video poker and decent pay tables on Dueces Wild  BJ was mainly     minimum       I never saw lower  There were a lot of     tables and the placards stating that are small  so look carefully before you sit down  Cocktail service was speedy wherever I was sitting To summarize  This is a   star place with a really fun atmosphere and decent rooms  food  and gaming  It is a great place for the price  close enough to be considered on the Strip  and I plan on returning with my wife for our next vacation  
P =>   What a great deal  My girlfriend      and I      stayed   days   nights y     in a  quot Poolside Bungalow Room quot  for     nt and really loved it  We were in room     overlooking the center of the pool area  No complaints on cleanliness  Room decor resembles a Hooters restaurant right down to the orange barstool seats   there was a sitting chair as well   Bed was fine  a little soft   Room was large  It had a small balcony overlooking the pool area  The pool was busy  but never too crowded  get a spot under the waterfall for a  quot cool quot  spot in the shade   The food was so  so  The breakfasts were good in the Dam Restuaurant  didn t try Dan ino s   Always room at the craps table      min during the week  The Nipper Juice at the Pool Bar was very good  a slurpy with a kick   Such an incredible price for the location   behind the Tropicana across from the MGM  and monorail stop   I bet our walk to the Strip was faster than many of the rooms inside the MGM    nights for     bucks was a steal Plus  ya get Hooter s girls everywhere for no extra charge See the Vegas Forum for additional info on our Hooters experience and our trip  
P =>   Happy Birthday at Hooters  My friends and I had a great time at the Hooters Hotel  The atmosphere was laid back and lots of fun  The rooms are comfortable and staff was wonderful  Loved the pool party  It was definitely a Happy Birthday  
P =>  Great Place to Stay After reading the prior reviews  I also thought that I might have made a mistake in booking at Hooters  However  that was not the case at all  I have stayed at many casinos on the Strip and Hooters has delivered the best service yet  The Hooters girls were always helpful and friendly  as were the front desk and bell hops  The restaurants  especially Hooters and Dan ion s steakhouse were excellent  The rooms were nice  clean and comfortable  loved the beds   The casino floor was smaller than those on the strip  but in this way it was no overwhelming  and in some ways  more fun  The table games were very relaxed with the Hooter girl dealers offering advice and adding to the fun of the game  The pool was great and the drinks served while gambling were much larger than those served at the Strip casinos  An added bonus was that there were    Blackjack tables next door at the Tropicana  in case you did not particularly want to  quot lose your shirt quot  that day  All in all  a wonderful experience  I would absolutely stay there again  If i were to mention any negatives  I would say that the elevators were slower than I m used to and that the Sports Book was tiny  
P =>  Fun  I stayed at Hooters hotel a couple weeks ago and was very pleased  The rooms were very nice w  big soft beds  The casino size was just perfect and you didnt have to worry about getting lost like you did at the other big casinos  It had a very nice pool  but be there before  pm or the sun gets blocked by the hotel and it gets chilly  It also had a great location  just a block off the strip  one negative thing i would say is DONT eat at the hooters restaurant  The service is terrible and rude  We ate there twice and realized it was the biggest mistake we could have made  It was very spendy for the food you got  and the waitreses were anything but friendly  Overall i would def  stay here again  but avoid the Hooters restaurant  
P => Terrible Hotel Stayed between y   and    Called to confirmed non smoking room the day before and were not available when we got there  Stayed at room     where the carpet was dirty and got stains  The bathroom got peeling paint and cheap fixtures and rusted out valve behind the toliet with broken tiles  Only one elevator was working the whole time while   others were out of order  No AC in the hallway or elevator  Noisy AC in the wall  Lack of Management  
P =>  Hooterific Time After looking at some of the reviews on this page I was expecting a real dump  That was not the case  The hotel is not the Wynn or Bellagio  but it also doesn t come with the attitude either  It was clean  and the staff were very helpful  When we checked in there was a bit of a line  so the cocktail waitresses offered us free drinks  Way to pass the short time  The Hooters restaurant and the Dam Restaurant are both delicious  especially after a heavy night of partying   The concierge was very helpful  and gave us good advice on where to go on a Tuesday night  The rooms were very very comfortable and equally clean  The beds are better than in any hotel I ve stayed at in Vegas  The pool is a decent size and has a small waterfall  On our last day I asked for late check out and they had no problem  All this for only    bucks a night through the Hooterific Package  This hotel is not on the strip but if you just walk across to the MGM you can board the monorail anywhere on the main drag  I definitely recommend this place  
P =>   Great Value  My wife and I stayed at Hooter s Hotel and Casino from e          through e          in room      We took my father to Las Vegas as a Father s Day present and he stayed in room      Having never even dined at a Hooter s Restaurant and with my wife s apprehension about staying at a Hooter s establishment  we were both very pleasantly surprised and pleased with our accommodations As I needed to purchase two rooms  price was a major factor in selecting Hooter s  I found a great deal on Expedia for only     a night  This was for a   star hotel that had a good ranking on TripAdvisor  no     out of       The total price for two rooms for   nights plus fees and taxes was only          This was an extremely great value  To have stayed elsewhere on the strip at any decent hotel would have doubled the cost of the entire trip  I liked the location of the hotel as it was right across from a monorail stop at MGM Grand and down the street from a mini mart  The elevators were all working and I usually did not have to wait long for one We checked in at      pm and were able to secure rooms before the official check in time of      pm  We only had to wait about      minutes to be checked in  We were given smoking rooms  but as a nonsmoker I could not detect the slightest odor of cigarette smoke in my room  Our room was very clean  spacious  and did not show any signs of age  I liked the nice touch of putting large plants in the room  but felt the wooden d cor was a little tacky  The rooms had a nice view of the hotels on the southern part of the strip  Luxor  MGM Grand  Excalibur  and Tropicana   The television had a large selection of channels and was nicely positioned right in front of the bed  The bathroom was very clean and was of average size that came with all the usual amenities including a hair dryer and vanity mirror  The bed was very comfortable  but the air conditioner was a little noisy  I did not hear any noises from the adjoining rooms  The rooms were serviced every day  but some maids were a little too quick to open the door after knocking  The staff of the hotel was very polite and friendly  The drink service at the gaming tables and pool area was very good  I very much enjoyed the pool area  which had a lively atmosphere  There were two pools and two hot tubs  However  one of the hot tubs was cold all four days we stayed there  There were plenty of towels and security was always on guard  We ate at the Dam Restaurant for lunch  The food was good  but service poor  I heard some of the staff members state that the restaurant was reduced to a  skeleton staff  to save money  which has had a proportional impact on customer service  The prices were very affordable  I appreciated the fact that the casino table limits were as low as         I walked across the parking lot to play Blackjack at the Tropicana where table limits were as low as        Overall I very much enjoyed my stay and believe I got an excellent value for only     a night  I had stayed at the Hilton Hotel for my only other trip to Las Vegas and if given a choice between staying at one hotel or the other for the same price  I would choose Hooter s  c T  Hardekopf 
P =>  Spot on for the cash Check in was easy  room comfortable and clean  The staff were generally happy and had more personality than at a lot of the casinos we played  Cant knock the location  short walk to MGM an New York New York  Dont really know why most people moan on here    what do you expect for    bucks a night      As long as you dont mind the smell of greasy chicken wings all the time and dont eat there  food was crap   you cant go wrong 
P =>  Could Have Been Better We stayed here cheap because we were going to one of those timeshare things  so i can t complain about the price  I would have never paid what they were asking for that night       This hotel is worth no more than         a night  Only stay here if you have a really really good deal  Pros  Right on the strip across from the MGM  behind Tropicana  Comfortable beds and pillows Casino has a laid back feeling Rooms have new furniture SafeCons  Small casino  Small simple pool Parking lot elevators sounded like they were going to break Only one hotel elevator was working  the other was out of order  Elevators were hot with no air conditioning You can see where parts of the rooms were remodeled  with paint peeling behind wood molding and bathroom floor damaged  Several large carpet stains in the hallwayI believe this would have been a much nicer hotel if they just would have knocked down the old hotel and built a new one  It just seemed like the cheap way to make a hotel  
P =>  Never again    I looked over other reviews and my experience was very similar to another one posted here  We reserved a king size bed far in advance and when we arrived to the hotel we did not learn of the two twin beds until we walked into the room  Dealing with the front desk and management become a common theme on this trip because they made no effort to make the stay enjoyable  We actually received better customer service walking through other hotels on the strip and we were not even staying there  When I asked about the bed set up in our room I was also told they do not guarantee bed preference  only the room it self and that no hotel on the strip guaranteed it  So I called around to test this statement and my first two calls proved them wrong  If it were not for the convention in town and every other hotel booked we would have cancelled our reservations and moved to another hotel  Hooters hotel is also less then spectacular  the paint was peeling of the ceiling  the rooms were very small  and all of the little things you would come to expect from a hotel on the strip were no where to be found  Its as if they expect to thrive on name alone  If it came down to staying there again or canceling the trip I would cancel and look for another vacation spot  Pretty frustrating after coming home from serving my country in the middle east  expecting a relaxing vacation and having what should have been a wonderful time ruined by the horrible customer service of the hotel you are staying at  Never again will I return to this hotel and I tell everyone I know to avoid it  you should do the same  
P =>  Hooters   Just OK    Hooters has hit the strip  However several improvements need to happen soon Casino   Small but unique  I really liked the music going and the atmosphere  However game limits were high and most of the people staying there are on a budget  The budget players would walk to Tropicana to play     I m not sure why they have the poker room but mostly play on   tables outside the poker room    You come in from the parking garage right next to these tables  Very distracting     Always people trying to get through   etc    Room   Well     I thought the room was ok    We had a view of the pool and airport  However the window was so dirty that if you wanted any pictures you had to slide it open and stick you arm out the window  We called   times to get the window clean but management never called back    They just DO NOT CARE    Parking   Well that is quick and easy but the elevators   Honestly they sounded like they were literally coming apart  A must fix  Parking is abundant  A bit hard to get through the garage as they are tight corners   Same way up is the same way down   Watch out for the other guy      I was expecting a cleaner place since it was recently redone  But that is far from True  A quick paint job  new beds and coverings and that is it    They even still used the same ole door hinges from the San Remo that have years worth of paint splatter on them   Only good thing going is the hooter girls    Poker room is a joke   Management is very weak there too   I will say I thought the RIBS at ino s were good  All you can eat for        Nice waiter   Good food    
P =>  service below expectations Let me preface this by saying that this is not a reflection of the above average service at the Hooters restaurant that is located in the Hotel  We booked a non smoking room with a king sized bed  Upon check in  the clerks behind the desk told us that they were completely booked solid  and only had smoking room with   beds  I asked for our money back  and were told that this was not possible  Several minutes of arguing later  a non smoking room with a kingsized bed  quot suddenly quot  became available We thought that this might have been an isolated event  but according to several other guests we spoke with  they were greated with an equally difficult time    men who had booked a room with   beds were told that only a room with a kingsized bed was available until they argued a bit with the staff Coming back from the pool in our towels and bathingsuits  our room key did not work  and even with ID the housekeeping staff refused to let us into the room  and one of us had to walk through the whole lobby and casino area  dripping wet in a towel to fix our key Besides these complaints  the hotel was very clean  the beds were very comfy  and the casino  restaurants and pool fostered a fun and exciting atmosphere  Not too far off the strip  and I would consider staying here again if I could get a good deal  
P =>  Awesome Time date          From WisconsinI recently stayed at the Hooter s Hotel  amp  Casino in il of     I was very surprised at how clean the casino area was  Check in went very smooth and fast  We did have trouble finding the elevators  but a friendly staff member named Michael showed us the way  The room was nice and clean  only problem was the noise coming from the pool area  Had excellent food and service at Dan nio s   We also won some money at the Casino    The price was right I will be staying here again  
P =>   A hotel that doesn t take itself too seriously Stayed at Hooters LV for   nights during early ober    Firstly lets get a couple of ground rules set  If you wish to stay in a mega resort with an abundance of shops  attractions and restaurants  then don t waste your time and money by coming here  However if you wish to stay in a good quality mid range hotel where you can get typical Hooters style food  ie wings  burgers and beer  whilst kicking back by a beach style pool area  then Hooters is definately for you  Located on the site of the old San Remo  next to the Tropicana just off the South end of the strip and across the road from the MGM Grand s hotel entrance  Hooters was hosting families  elderly couples and a large array of single women  as well as the ubiquitous single men  when we stayed there  It possesses the  quot Dan ino Steakhouse quot  which targets those who want a higher end feed as well as a generous buffet and snacks at the bar  A convenience store souvenir shop is located at one end of the casino floor and another souvenir shop is located at the other end of the casino floor as well  Check in was quick and efficient and friendly The rooms are what you d expect from a mid range hotel Vegas hotel  Neat  tidy two double beds and a more than adequate bathroom  Our room overlooked the pool area which was a good location  We had no problems with noise either in the hallways or from outside  A very well appointed gymnasium is located off the pool and was cheap by Vegas standards at only    USD per day  Overall I was more than happy with my stay at Hooters  One word of warning though  If you can t stand the sight of wood panelling then run a mile  You ll understand what I mean when you stay there   
P =>  Great Stay A group of   people from work who happen to be all men stayed at the Hooters Las Vegas because it was a great deal  I admit being the one who booked the trip that I was a bit nervous booking rooms at Hooters Hotel  The stay turned out to be much above expectation  The rooms were all new and very clean  They were all well decorated and the beds were very comfortable  Now I don t know if my wife could get over all the Hooters girls in the casino and lobby however for a group of guys this place was fantastic  I would have no problem staying at this property again and would rate it as a  star for the great price we payed of only     a night and the quality of the premises  
P =>   Hooters was great  We had a great stay at Hooters  The room was neat  clean and the bed was very  very comfortable  We had a nice view of that end of the strip  Room service was prompt  courtious and the food was excellent  The hamburgers we had at Pete and Shorty s were awesome The staff seems very happy and the service is excellent  We will definately stay there again  
P =>   Fun place no problems at all  I was leery about booking Hooters and was close to booking Imperial Palace or The Tropicana  we were on a budget  instead but ended up being really glad we went with Hooters  especially after seeing Imperial Palace  eek    We had no problems whatsoever at Hooters  we booked a guaranteed bungalow room through the website but were upgraded to a tower room on arrival  I d been hoping that would happen  The room was fine  very clean  the bed comfortable  the bathroom was good  cute basic toiletries etc  No issues with noise  no issues with anything actually  We ate at The Dam the first night  had a good pizza and some drinks  we liked it and prices were really reasonable  Played the slots and a little on the tables  it was more of a place where we d play for a little while on our way out and back in than where we d hang out for hours  It had a fun and homely feel though and it was a nice place to come back to at the end of a long day and night out  We found the location to be really good for us  especially for hanging out at New York New York  MGM  Aladdin Dessert Passage shopping centre  the Bellagio etc  If you want to be near Wynns  TI s or The Venetian  Hooters is up the wrong end for you and you d be better off staying closer to the middle of the strip  Don t worry about being just off the strip if you stay here   some of the hotels are so huge  ie  MGM  your room could literally be as far back off the strip as Hooters is situated  It took about   or   minutes to walk onto the strip so it didn t worry us at all  Overall  if you re not on a Bellagio budget  Hooters is a decent choice  
P =>   Above expectations The hotel is older but you can tell that they have kept it up  The room was great  We booked the bungalow with two queens  The room was large and the decor was perfect  The room even had a bar table with orange top chairs just like in the Hooter s Restaurant  The bathroom even included a sewing kit and Q tips  How thoughtful  The beds were comfortable and the room was quiet  Oh  and did I mention that they are located less than a block from the strip  The casino was smoky  and the elevators are old and slow  Free internet in the rooms  but no business center  
P =>   Not bad for the price We stayed there for my husband s   th birthday   his choice  I was leery at first because I had seen photos from when they first opened  Obviously they have remodeled since then  I was impressed with the cleanliness and comfort of the room  We were there for   nights and enjoyed it  The bed was super comfortable and the bathroom was very clean  We had a discrepancy with our bill  but a phone call to the accounting department had that solved within an hour  The casino is small compared to the super casinos on the strip  but all the games are there  My only complaint would be the poor ventilation within the casino  The smoke was heavy and almost unbearable for a non smoker on the weekend  Overall  I was impressed with the quality and am happy we chose this hotel for the price instead of a more expensive hotel with rooms that are just as decent  
P =>   Hooters Rocks What can I say  Hooters is FANTASTIC  The casino is small and felt personal  The cocktail waitresses were polite and prompt  and easy on the eye  but the Hooter girl dealers were distracting Rooms  fantastic  Heaps of room and had everything you need  I do not know what previous reviewers were on about as I had no issues with noise from neighbours  The pool area was good and the fire pit burning of a night meant I could sit outside and socialise over a beer or   Restaurants  Hooters was always busy but had no trouble getting a spot at the Dam Restaurant  Try the Nachos        and between   of us we could not finish them  HUGE  Will stay at Hooters again  no problems there  
P =>   Loved Hooters I have just returned after staying a week at hooters hotel in las vegas  This was my first trip to the area and wasnt sure what to expect  After reading the reviews i was very nervous  but got a great deal so took a chance  And I am very glad i did  The room was nice size and comfortable  The bed was amazing  We only had very nice and quick service  Upon getting to my room our safe was not working  i called the front desk and they had it fixed within   mins  We had no trouble with having hot water  but we never got up before noon  The casino is smaller compared to the others on the strip  but you dont have to wait for your comp  drinks like you do at the bigger ones  I would stay here again  it has a nice relaxed feeling to it  Travel tip  See the shark reef  ride the monorail or take the public buss or bye some really comfortable shoes youll be doing alot of walking  
P =>   Good value Stayed two nights  very busy week in Las Vegas and prices for last minute stays were OUTRAGEOUS at nearly every other resort  so I figured for    bucks a night  how can you go wrong  Check in was efficient and I was in my room in no time  Overall the room was clean   there were a couple of issues  stepped on a pretzel   but nothing terribly serious  Bed was fabulous  Great quality mattress  Roomy bathroom with nicer than average toiletries and good water pressure  Towels were nicer than average for a hotel in this price range  Pretty cool heated pool area  very nice lounge chairsMy friends all teased me for staying at Hooters   the rest of my group were at MGM  but I would stay here again  for a budget hotel it was very nice  
P => Great time at Hooters Everything was excellent My husband and i went with his hockey team and some players wifes   Really the only problem was the distance from everything on the strip    it was a ways a way from everything and the pool closed WAY to early  we went with a hockey team and we all wanted to go swimming one night and it wasn t open which really sucked  Everyone was very friendly and food was good The beds were very comfortable and the water nice and hot for showers  it also has a firepit out by the pools which was really nice All in all it was a very good stay and i d stay again at hooters 
P =>  I have seen better I stayed at Hooters with a group of girls at the end of ruary  The casino and rooms look exactly like the restaurant  nothing spectacular  It was cheap which was great but you really get what you paid for  The rooms were really cheesy looking but I didn t stay there for the decor  Our toilet overflowed and they only wiped it down with towels  My biggest complaint is how much the entire Casino smelled like cigarette smoke  It was a relief to walk out of there and go to the other nice smelling casinos on the strip  There isn t any place worth going to in the casino and the food at The Dam wasn t very good  How do you mess up a milkshake  I think this Hotel is good for a group of guys  gamblers and cigarette smokers  If you don t want to spend a lot of money and you don t mind smelling like an ashtray then this is a good place to stay  
P => enjoyed my one nite here    booked here last minute because jetblue canceled our flight   got a room for   bucks  but when i got to the hotel  they put us in a tower room   awesome  everything was clean  didn t smell of smoke   was very happy with the room for what we paid   plus it s quick walk to see some hotties dealing cards downstairs   this place is full of guys though  so u wont see many female customers    great job hooters  for providing a laid back hotel for a great price  i would stay here again    check out time here is noon  compared to   am or   am at other hotels on the strip 
P =>   A work in progress My wife  amp  I stayed at this property for one night in early   We were in town to see a concert at the MGM  We choose this property because of the close proximity to the MGM and the price  It s an older property in need of updating  but you can see where they are trying  The rooms were nicely decorated  The beds were super comfy and the bathroom was good sized  However  our room was in need of a new door and new sliding patio door  ours were old and rickety   The wall are thin  so you do hear a lot of noise  Being that it is a smaller older property  the corridors are narrow  which probably contributes to the noise factor The front desk staff was indifferent upon arrival and checkout  they were neither welcoming nor rude   We had one meal at the cafe  The waiter was nice and the food was good  but a bit pricey  Overall  for a night s stay it was fine  but we wouldn t consider a longer stay  
P =>  Ah     the smell of wings in the morning It was our  st time in Vegas  and we had a blast  We stayed at Hooter s for the obvious reason  cheap  We were under the impression that it was a brand new hotel  We thought  well you can t go wrong with new  This hotel is not new  It is old and barley refurbished  There were alot of great things about Hooters        tables which are hard to find elsewhere  Comfy beds  Resonable drink prices  Lots of cocktails while gambling bacause casino is small  Close to MGM NYNY  Hotwings are good when you are drunk  Chicken Squak on the phoneWith the price come quite a few of those  quot you get what you pay for quot  negatives   The shower was hot  amp  cold the whole time I showered  This sucks when you are hungover and want a long warm shower  The carpets are stained and gross  The elevators are stinky  small  and tempermental  You can t get away from the smell of wings and cigarettes  It is quite a walk to most of the strip  amp  cabs get expensiveOverall  I enjoyed the experience  I will probably stay at one of the larger hotel casinos next time  
P =>   Really enjoyed ourselves We vist Las vegas every year on our way to family and also stop there on the way back  We have tried other hotels but so far Hooters has been the one we return to and have told others its so central for what ever you need to get around L V The strip is only a walk away also getting the metro link plus the bus stop is right outside what more can you ask  No i am not a     but a     and i really enjoy staying here most people have been helpful and the rooms were clean and plesant as well  
P =>   Had a Blast    Had a one night stay at Hooters this past week and had a ball  Stayed there once before during the transformation from the old Sam Remo  All I can say is wow    The rooms are very nice and the Beds are as comfortable as they come  The Dam resturaunt breakfast was outstanding and the portions are huge  Hooters resturaunt was a great meal as well  The renovation of the pool area came out great  Gambling was good and the cocktail waitresses brought em as quick as you could put them down  Wish I had been able to stay a few more nights but it is what it is  I ll definately be back at a later date Fast pace Fun    Massachusetts Mike 
P =>   st Time at Hooters was Four Stars     Our Trip was Fri ember      Sunday      This was a superise trip for my husband as I told him at the airport we were going to Vegas  Was nervous after reading some reviews and after visiting hooters to gamble twice before the place just did not impress me  My husband was delighted to find we were staying at Hooters as any husband would  We rented a car and parked in the Parking Garage reluctlantly  There are some cameras in the garage try to park your car in a view of the camera that is what we did and never had a problem  There is no Valet here and the only other option is to park in the lot in between here and tropicana  Okay Beware of the Parking Garage Elevators one of them creaks and makes the most horrid noises it sounds as thought the box you are in is just going to pop  However we never got stuck and instead had a few laughs about it  Check in was a Breeze  the girl was friendly enough and I told her we were celebrating a special occasion and asked if there were any upgrades  She went and talked to her manager and offered me a Presidential Suite for     per night Upgrade or a International Suite for Free  We took the freebee  What a great room  We were in the Bayview tower which I think is the most accessable tower  Room     it was literrally right next door to the elevator which was a hoot  but seriously we never heard the elevator once or noise in the hallways which are very cute with surfboards and other cute decor  We entered the room to a huge entry way with a full bathroom  then a Bar with sink and fridge  palm trees Orange and Brown or  A huge plazma flat screen tv  little table to have cocktails at  a full size couch L shaped  the Bedroom was seperate and was very tropical themed I thought very cute  there was another TV  Desk  closet  and another Full Bathroom  We paid     a night what a deal  We went downstairs and sat at the    martini bar and enjoyed the live band that played yor requests  they rocked and we had a great time  We ate at the Damn Restrant a couple of times and the service was excellent and the food was too at a great price  Cute Diner   Also ate at Pete and shortys  had some wings and slider burgers they were good too  The people at the club orange werevery friendly and helpful  Sportbook guy was nice too  Cocktail service is Non existant here I once ordered a drink and never saw her again  We hung out by the pool at night they had nice fires in pits that you could sit or stand around  Really enjoyed how easy the property was to get around  Yes it is small but we enjoyed that  Spent a lot money in the Bait Shoppe on goodies to bring home and was diappointed I didnt get a chance to try the hidden sushi bar in the back  We enjoyed our stay and safely walked from Hooters into the tropicana where we won some   fast  also walked the four corners  went to Coyote Ugly was kinda fun  checked out the ceterfuge bar at MGM  All in all it was a great time  We are heading back to Hooters in ch and I am hoping the second time will be as awesome as the first  If it is we are going back in  and y and we will stay here again  Check out all my pictures of the room and view  etc  Enjoy Cheers friends 
P =>  We ll go back to Hooters  My husband and I     ish  stayed at Hooters uary        This was our first trip to Las Vegas  we are planning to return and will stay at Hooters again We arrived just before noon and got right into a room  The young lady at the front desk was very efficient and friendly  We requested to switch rooms because the sliding door would not lock and within       minutes we were in another room  The room was clean and comfortable  very Hootersesque with orange lampshades and bar stools and table  The bed may be the most comfortable we ve ever slept on We enjoyed breakfast   mornings at the Dam Restaurant and highly recommend this restaurant  We ate   times at Pete  amp  Shorties  the sports betting bar   which had a basic bar menu with appetizers  sandwiches and salads  we particularly liked the mini burgers and side salad  We had dinner one evening at the Hooters restaurant  your basic Hooters  and one evening at the Back Portch which is on the back side of Hooters and has the same menu  We spent most of our evenings at the Lobby Bar The atmosphere in the casino and the entire hotel is very casual  fun and laid back  we LOVED it  The casino is much smaller than the others we saw on the strip The only negative was on the last evening at the Lobby Bar when we were told our drinks would not be comped unless we had a minimum of     in the machine and playing max bets  new rules all of a sudden    We left and went to Pete  amp  Shorties where we were told the same thing  again  we had been here   days and had not heard this  Other than these    all servers were very friendly and efficient If you enjoy your local Hooters restaurant and the atmosphere  you will like the Hooters Casino Hotel in Vegas  
P =>  Low down at the Ho down      My boyfriend and I  in our early    s  stayed at Hooter s Casino and Hotel on Sat           to celebrate his birthday  We frequent the Vegas strip and stayed at the Mandalay  Imperial Palace  Rio  Bally s Harrah s  Paris  Bellagio    to name a few but since we were only there for    one  night and this was the Superbowl weekend  the prices of any hotels on the strip were astrinomical  Out of all the cheaper hotels we could have stayed at  my reason for choosing Hooter s was that it s new and the location   I knew their grand opening was just about a year ago and that it was very near the South Strip  next to Tropicana and accross from MGM    Booked reservation through tripres com for about        and was quoted a  quot Bungalow quot  style room  We ended up on the  nd floor on the Bay View tower next to the elevator   I asked why I was given a regular tower room and front desk said I need to pay     to reserve your request   Check in arrived at  p m   was quick and easy and rooms were ready and clean and a little bigger than what was pictured on the website  Cosmetic wise  the room was comfortable new  and inviting  furniture  sheets  bedding comfy    towels etc  all new and plush  The building structure needs repair  shower needs temp  control streams of hot water would jet out while showering walls are a bit thin  you could hear the neigbors opening closet doors and murmuring but we were surprised we didn t hear the elevators   and the elevators very tempermental  so please know your fire escape  Staff wise  everyone was average  they don t go out of the way to please you but just there to do their job and to answer questions  They might need to staff more cocktail waitresses cause it was very rare to have a comp  drink while playing the slots  If you ladies are worried about the taboo  only the cocktail waitresses are dressed the same as the girls at your local hooter s not the dealer s  the front desk  the Dam restauant workers etc    there s no girls gone wild here     Other than the  a m  fire emergency drill and a short direct t v  cable outtage at  a m   all was great  I would go back to the Hooter s hotel if the only purpose was just to rest  your in a city where there is something to do           It s better than the IP  Harrah s  the downtown Vegas hotels or any other OLDER hotels on the strip  But if you are looking for the Las Vegas experience  pay more and stay at the bigger hotels with more amenities  Other tips from other ta s  get the club orange card for store discounts      off   the Dam restaurant is like a old school Diner and prices are reasonable   had the prime rib for       and the burger   big  w  seasoned fries for           Casino has     blackjack and    war  Walk next to the Tropicana for    blackjack and go to the MGM for Sports Booking  Location is great just bring comfortable shoes  Only when we stayed at Hooter s  we noticed a tram at the MGM  don t know where it goes but we ll find out the next time we stay there  Have fun  
P =>  ent Place Stayed here for a night in ember and was pleasantly surprised  The rooms have a pseudo tropical feel   much different and nicer than I expected The mattress was comfortable and had decent bedding  including full length body pillows  However  I should note that the beds are pretty high off the floor  People with mobility problems may have some difficulty getting in and out of bed  No problems with the bathroom   everything was clean and functioned properly The sports book is a Leroy s so it s tiny and doesn t have drink service  You can sit at the VP bar and watch the games on the plasma TVs but you either have to milk the VP for free drinks or just pay  On the plus side  their parlay payouts are the best you ll find in LV and you can cash tickets under        think this is the max   at any of the other locations The casino is pretty small but the employees were friendly and the drink service was very good Overall  they have done a good job refurbishing this property  Just don t expect the wow factor  
P =>   Good value but beware if you park there A college friend and I met in Vegas for a bachelor party and we decided we needed a relatively inexpensive option since we would only use the room to sleep  We shared a room at Hooter s with two double beds  This hotel allowed Saturday night check in  which is rare in Vegas  and the price        was cheap in comparison to some of the bigger hotels on the strip  It was only a short cab ride to where we needed to be on the strip anyways Check in was smooth and easy and there were no mix ups with my pre paid reservation  The room was clean and nice  Nothing spectacular  but adequate in every way for a shower and a bed to sleep on  The casino is small but busy and patrons all seemed to be enjoying themselves  There is a small sports bar  an old school diner  a regular Hooter s restaurant  and Dan marino s  finer dining  on site  We opted for the Hooter s restaurant for lunch and the service was quick and friendly  The waitresses all wear the standard t shirt and orange shorts  both regular and cocktail waitresses on the casino floor   The only real negatives were one minor and one major complaint  The minor complaint is that the average patron was a little bit on the lower class side  This is to be expected at one of the chaper hotels near the strip  If they were high rollers that could afoord      night at Bellagio  they wouldn t be at Hooter s  This was of no consequence to us  but for those of you who feel uneasy around lower socio economic people you might consider spending more money elsewhere  We were stared down by two imposing ex con looking guys near the diner  for no apparent reason  but we just laughed it off The major complaint is that my friend s truck that was parked overnight in the Hooter s parking garage was broken into and several items were taken  resulting in a      deductible   I would not recommend parking here  Other than that  it is a decent value for the     I can highly recommend Tao restaurant  at Venetian  for dinner and Pure nightclub  in Caesar s  for clubbing  if you have the     Our group of friends were high rollers from the East Coast and we were able to enjoy top notch VIP service at both of these locales  
P =>   Excellent hotel I stayed here for   nights in     th and   th   I arrived at       and was given a twin Ocean View room  The room was very nice  it actually seemed quite new  I was staying on the   th floor and I had a view of McCarran Airport  which was quite cool  The floor I was on was very quiet and I didn t hear my neighbours at all during my stay  I recieved a     voucher for Dan inos on arrival and I ate here one of the nights  The food was very good and the service was very good The overall atmosphere of the hotel is very casual  which suits me fine as I don t really like the formality of most of the other hotels I would defintely stay here again  just make sure that you avoid the bungalow rooms 
P =>   sweet suite After reading the bad reviews about cabanna rooms  I upgraded to a suite  Good move  because we had the  quot presidential suite quot  for the entire stay  for the price of the  quot regular suite quot    Hooters overbooked the reg  suites   The suite was large    full bath    half baths  pool table  bar with mini fridge and coffee maker  Living room with    quot  HD plasma tv and sectional sofa  which can be converted to a bed   Between the pool table and living area is a dining table for six  The master bedroom had another TV  not HD or flat screen   and a jacuzzi tub  with an ajoining marble bath with a shower and double bowl sink  Hooters overall is a LITTLE casino  Not many choices in table games  only   craps tables  only   of which was running during our stay  Slots are from penny up to a dollar or more  Drink service is hit or miss  mostly miss  Table players get better service than slot players  unless Alana is working the slot area  A BIG TY to Alana for awesome service while playing penny slots  The pool area is small in comparison to other nearby hotels  but is heated  and has   separate hot tubs  I did see people in both the pool and hot tub  even though the outside temp  was below freezing at night and only in the    s to    s during the day  We only ate at the Dam and had room service  both are equal to a Denny s or Cracker Barrel  I would stay here again  Clean rooms  easy walk to other casinos  great price  
P =>   Don t give a hoot for Hooter s I arrived on Saturday morning and was allowed to check in right away  The room seemed okay at first  but my opinion changed when it was time to go to bed  This property caters to a    something crowd  and with the low room rates  that s what it attracts  At      am  both nights of my stay  I was awakened by loud  partying neighbors  The walls are thin and noise from everywhere including the street comes right in  The heating unit was loud  but fortunately it drowned out some of the noise from the room next door  The casino is small and cramped  The blackjack tables are all single deck     games  or tables with side bets  Not a place for serious players  The sports book is tiny and along the back wall of a restaurant  The Hooter s girls were attractive  but most cocktail waitresses in Vegas casino s are attractive  I dined in ino s  The Dam  and ordered room service  The food quality and service was quite well for each  I also needed a fresh towel brought to my room  and housekeeping brought it in a matter of minutes  All of the staff I dealt with were very polite and customer oriented  Personally  I won t stay at Hooter s again  The concept is good and I feel if they had built a hotel casino from the ground up  rather than renovating a property that should have seen the wrecking ball years ago   it would have made for a better experience  
P => Better than expected It was going to be New Year s weekend and I had a daughter turning    on ember   th  I needed something within walking distance of the strip at a reasonable price because I needed three rooms  It was actually a friend who spotted this bargain on line after she heard about our plans and decided to join us  Our price was         night and even at that price I don t think they were full by New Year s eve  Check in was a breeze and despite one room not being immediately ready  it was    minutes later  They put our    yr old  and her boyfriend  next to us and my other daughter directly across the hall  Very convenient for our meeting during our three nights there  Rooms were comfortable  linens upgraded  bathrooms only average to less than average  There is no desk  Walls were thin but we never had any real problems with that  We dined in the Dam Restaurant a number of times  for lunch  breakfast and a late night snack  Service there was great  a rarity in Las Vegas  I ate in Hooters on two different occassions  in each instance service was excellent  This despite the second time it being five of us and being during the lunch hour on Sunday  in the middle of NFL football  Lines were    people long but we were in within ten minutes The staff was well trained consistent with all of their locations I was told   But I save my biggest compliments for  quot    tini quot   the lounge where my daughter had her first official drink  The waitress  Brittany  took note of the occassion  asked her what she wanted for her first drink and delivered that drink on the house at the witching hour of midnight  In a crowded bar with a rock n  roll band playing in the background she didn t have to pay that much attention  She did  the band acknowledged the event    it was all good  In summary  we could have stayed next door at the Tropicana for twice the price  but didn t  We could have searched for good food with good service and more price at the MGM across the street  but wouldnt  We could have been considered just another cow following the herd but Hooters couldn t  They cut us from the pack on a couple of occasions and made us feel special  I will be back in Las Vegas in three weeks for a convention and I will be staying at Caesars  It will be nice and I will like it  But I will miss the homey feel of the     room Hooters as compared to one of these mega hotels  Hooters was the perfect location for our Birthday New Year s trip 
P =>   Clean and a great value The first thing to keep in mind is that the tower rooms are new  while  I think  the bungalow rooms are not  I think this explains the disparities in the reviews  We got there REALLY early        am   My husband went to ask if they could call us on our cell when our room was ready  and when I got to the desk  we were checked in already with no extra charge  I ve never had that happen anywhere else  It probably isn t common here  either  but it made our day  We got in a tower room and it was the cleanest hotel room I ve been in in a while  We had a non smoking room that had really never been smoked in  unlike most non smoking rooms and it was bigger than it looked online  It looked over the pool  not the Strip  but it was only    bucks a night over Christmas  The restaurant had a nice little breakfast buffet and ridiculously huge plates of nachos along with friendly service  The casino is nice  with fairly loose slots and better than average cocktail servcie from Hooters girls  Frankly  the Hooters girl uniform is one of the most modest cocktail waitress uniforms on the strip  so don t let the Hooters thing throw you if the restaurant isn t your thing  
P =>   Great value enjoyable stay We stayed at Hooters     th      nd with another couple  My husband and I booked a  quot free quot  Second Honeymoon package with Condolidated resorts  We had to listen to a   hr  timeshare presentation on a new property called  quot Tahiti Village quot  and our stay was basically free  Hooters is the hotel they put us up at  We were pleasantly surprised  Our room was clean  and spacious  Definitely not luxurious by any means  but certainly comfortable and we had a great view of the strip  We requested a non smoking King and got it  although the entire hotel  and all of Las Vegas for that matter  smelled like an ashtray  I guess there s only so much you can do about it when everyone on the casino floor is smoking  The Dam Restaurant had an awesome breakfast buffet with the best bacon we ve ever had   you have to try it  They also made a great milkshake  The Hooters restaurant had the typically great wings  but we didn t eat at any of the other restaurants We really didn t do a lot of gambling  but found the casino at the hotel to be a welcomed respite from all of the other over the top  in your face casinos that we were in The fitness center looked really well equipped  and the pool area was very nice  although with the weather rarely reaching above    degrees while we were there  it was closed  They did have fire pits out there if you felt like sitting out campfire style All in all  if we ever do go back to Vegas  we would definitely stay at Hooters again  
P =>   super   full of drunken rednecks we lucked into the last parking spot in front of the building and walked up to the front desk  After several clerks got done chatting amongst themselves one went out of there way to help us and we were checked in then  we got to drag our luggage all the way through the casino to the elevators in back We got into our room and it was about average for hotels in the area  about what one would expect from a holiday inn except the colors were a bit more orange  and there were bar stools instead of chairs  Taking a quick nap being venturing forth into vegas we were woke up my the people next door shooting at each other coming back that night there were numerous piles of garbage from room service left in the hallway which were still there the next morning  Coming back late the next evening  our room wasn t cleaned  I don t think our room was cleaned once over a   day stay And don t be fooled about it being a  quot new quot  hotel  it was an old hotel with the casino remodeled and the rooms look like they got new furniture and maybe carpet  
P =>   Comfortable at Hooters My wife and I stayed at Hooters for   nights in ember and loved it  The rooms were clean and comfortable  the staff were very friendly  there is a nice pool and hot tub that were open and they have plenty of places to eat  The breakfast buffet at Dam s restaurant was good  There were even fresh strawberries  raspberries  blueberries and blackberries  which is unusual  Hooters was only a short walk to MGM Grand and Tropicana  Excaliber  etc  The casino is small enough that I could always find my wife and the payback at the slots were just as good as anywhere else The only negative comment would be they were only offering        blackjack tables during our stay while other casino s on the strip had       tables  Also  we were facing the airport which was loud sometimes but at least the windows open and the fan would block out the planes taking off We would definitely stay at Hooters again  
P =>   Great hotel great experience I am   yo who travelled with my best friend  Room cost     after tax  checkin was early and very easy at       am and room was very clean with no smell  Got  th room overlooking the beautiful pool  I saw all of   people total at the pool  but it was there and looked great and warm  Booked though hotels com and recieved a few credits including     at inos  Ate there and it was decent  nothing to write home about  except the    coronas  Bill was still cheap after the credit  Check out the       prime rib and get fries with it  not very classy but tastes great  although my Mid rare  was mid well  oh well  Strip is a three minute walk  From the airport you can take a shuttle for    each  a cab for reportedly       or the public bus for      all day pass  or       each way  I opted for the public bus which you can pickup on level zero  Take     or     to the     conector  very easy and quick  just about    minutes  Check out low limits at Barbary Coast  Slots a fun outside Circus Circus  nearby Tropicana  
P =>   Better than expected Stayed at Hooters Hotel on Sunday night      after staying overnight at Arizona Charlies atur  see other review   Paid     with credits towards dining at inos I was pleasantly surprised with the location  Walking distance to the  quot strip quot  and hotels on the south side  across MGM  next to Tropicana  near New York  New York  Excalibur  etc   The service was average  but the rooms were definitely better than expected  I stayed in the Ocean View section and the rooms seemed to be upgraded and did not show signs of wear tear  The casino on the other hand  was small  about    craps  blackjack  pai gow tables  and the Poker Room  dubbed Pete s Poker Room  was very cramped with only   or   tables  I missed the Sunday poker tournament  but I think it would have been fun  for only     Didn t get a chance to use the     dining coupon  because Dan ino s restaurant is only open for dinner Overall  I like the hotel  I ve stayed at a worse r  ones  so this one wasn t too bad  I would definitely recommend this hotel for the budget conscious travelers who want to stay closer to the strip  
P =>   Will DEFINITELY return    Both my and my sister s families  kids included  stayed at Hooters over Thanksgiving week  We all loved it    It s super close to the airport and right off the Strip behind Tropicana  We were able to take the MGM tram which was directly across from the Hotel or cab it to the far end of the Strip using back roads and avoided the traffic for a few bucks The Casino is small enough to find the other members of your party without searching for hours but big enough to have some breathing room  The entire staff was very laid back and friendly and the dealers were great    Murphy and Rob kept my sister and I laughing for hours  Lastly  the cocktail waitress  who are all Hooters girls  were quick to come around with drinks and SUPER sweet  especially Toi The rooms were very clean  comfortable and big  we even had an awesome view of the Strip  The pool was still open and was heated so whole family was able to spend a day outsided swimming and playing    even had wings delivered poolside by a beautiful bikini clad Hooters girl  which our husbands enjoyed   As for entertainment  the house band at    was AWESOME  played everything from Train to Pat Benetar   Plus Wednesday nigths ladies drank free for       The Hooters Restaurant had all the games on so the guys got their football fix  And the Dam Restaurant served great food  the Prime Rib for    was the deal   All in all it was a great stay and we will definitely stay there our next trip to Vegas  
P =>  great I have recently returned from a stay here and I must say what a fantastic experience is was  The check in was smooth and quick although I was a little worried when the young lady at the desk started by saying  quot sorry about this but we are fully booked  wouldyou mind if I put you in a suite for the first night quot  phew what a relief  the suite was really nice and plenty of room  with a gigantic plasma screen tv in the living area  The next day when we were moved to a standard room I was again pleased with the room loads of space and the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in The staff here were all very pleasant and everyone had a smile on there face  All in all this is one of the best kept secrets in Vegas  and I will return on my next visit   
P =>   Enjoyed my stay I enjoyed my stay at the Hooters Hotel Casino  As soon as I entered I was smiling and laughing  The decor is just like being at your local Hooters  Only Hooters would have a tin ceiling with a chandelier in a casino My room was in the   story bungalow section  I liked being over there vs being in the main building  Had an excellent view of the pool area  and that is a big plus at Hooters  Bed was so comfortable  and everything was great with the facilities I especially enjoyed  quot The DAM Restaurant quot  for meals  Enjoyed seeing the Alan Kulwicki   Hooters NASCAR championship car in its permanent display  
P =>   Great Getaway Weekend We just got back from The Hooters Hotel was perfect for our group  We are all between the ages of       and the atmosphere was so relaxing and just fun  We got there at   in the morning on Thursday Morning and Left Sunday at Noon  From the moment we stepped into the hotel we all fell in love with it  Well the guys mostly fell in Love with the Hooter s girls  The rooms were VERY nice and oh gosh the beds are perfect   My boyfriend wants to buy that kind of bed now  The price was great  we booked at the perfect time  We got   rooms for   nights for       all together  The swimming pool was perfect  and it had a little like camp fire pits around the pool which was great at night  The pool was heated also  I heard a lot of bad reviews about this hotel but I am glad we went there  Everybody loved it there  Perfect place for those who want to have fun and be close to the action  
P =>   Fantastic Value for Money We only paid     a night to stay at Hooters and  because it was so cheap  only booked to stay for half our holiday in case it was a dive   we wished we d stayed the whole time  The rooms were big  clean and comfortable and the hotel is a five minute walk from MGM Grand and New York  New York  The staff were pleasant too  We ate at the Dam restaurant twice  once for breakfast and once for dinner         for a prime rib dinner  bargain  We heard some americans complaining about the standard of the hotel but  as a brit  I thought it was fantastic value for money and would definitely stay there again   half the price of a travel inn but double the room size and nicer to boot  
P =>   Hurray for Hooters   Just got back from a   day trip to Vegas stayed at Hooters on Saturday and Sunday nights  rates of     and       We loved the hotel  Great location directly across from MGM and next to Tropicana  We stayed on the  th floor at the end of the hallway so there was no noise at all  Our room was spotless and looked brand new  new carpet  new furniture  great fluffy towels in bathroom   For the price and location  Hooters was great  We did gamble here before going to the airport  We usually play at    blackjack tables but they only had     tables  go next door to the Trop for      The dealers were very friendly and we actually won some money before going home     Took a cab to the airport and the total only came to       so that was great also  I can t understand the bad reviews   although I would definitely not stay in the bungalow rooms  around the pool  separate buildings   Heard some complaints about those  Would definitely stay here again and would recommend  We didn t eat here but heard from some people that DAM restaurant was good  
P =>   Fantastic hotel You cant go wrong with this hotel perfect location opposite the mgm grand very clean very welcoming first class accomodation at a bargain price could not have wished for a better stay would go back tommorow if I couldn you wont be dissapointede thats for sure  
P =>   Dont Stay Here This hotel is horrible  I m a    year male who went with three other friends to Las Vegas for spring break last spring  My friends insisted on this hotel because it was Hooters  I resisted after reading reviews on this site  and knowing that you don t go to  quot Hooters quot  expecting to meet women  Apparently my friends don t realize this  probably why they remain single   Well  we arrived early and the desk clerk was nice enough to give us our room key and let us check and see if the room was ready or not  We go up and the room is filthy which  I expected because it hadn t been cleaned yet and  its Las Vegas  We booked a  quot suite quot   Tthis nothing more than an apartment room and an adjoining single room with a bathroom  its a joke  We go back down let the front desk know the room isn t ready and go back up   hours later  The room is  quot cleaned quot   but still smells of stale cigarette smoke and vomit  Not only this but we drop our bags and begin to walk around and the floor is soaking wet in the whole living room  We call mantinence and they do nothing so we complain and receive a new room not a  quot suite quot   along with the discounted price  This room is dirtier than the first one but at least the carpet s not wet  We also found roaches  the kind you step on  AND the kind you smoke  and on that note you have to deal with people offering you drugs on the elevator I really can t put into words how cheap and nasty this place is  I mean four guys in their twenties hated this place  thats how bad it is  Its important when in Vegas to decide where you will spend most of your time  If on the strip  spend the money and stay at a decent place like Mandalay Bay  New York  Bellagio  My favorite was the Venetian  If you are looking for a good time and cheap thrills  and some cool bars  stay downtown in Old Vegas  Hotels are more important in Vegas than anywhere else  because everything is centered around them on the strip  Heed my advice stay away from this hotel  
P =>  Laid back atmosphere After staying in Excalibur down the way from this hotal for the first   days of our trip we headed to Hooters to check in  Much smaller hotal then the others that are connected like Luxor and Excalibur  Waited a few minutes to check in and the guy at the desk seemed confused at what he was doing but no biggy we were given our room keys and away we go  The hotal is a little crowded being smaller then other hotals in the area  Its at the end of the strip near the motal    Everything is wood and orange like a Hooters restaurant The room was clean and bright whic is more then I can say for the Excalibur  Same amount of room with   double beds and room to lay out a air mattress we brought due to we are   guys  Good options to stay in your such as Directv sports that can be ordered  Being from Canada and wanting to catch the hockey game we tried to order through the remote but wasn t working  Called down to the desk and was hung up on by accident and then tried agian and spoke with Robert who said try again in a few minutes and he hung up Waited a few minutes and it worked and we enjoyed the live hockey from Montreal  Had some ice cold brews we bought at a gas station which was much cheaper then anything in the hotals  Ate and drank once at the on site hooters restaurant which I think is one of the worst restaurants out there in food quality which I still feel the same  Ate mosly at the   hr dinar called the Dam which had       prime rib which was the best deal in Vegas we found  Ate at Dan marinos and was the best meal we had all week but also costed the most at a cool     before tip for a steak  They do have other lower cost foods so don t get scared away Most people said there wern t that much hooter girls around but I saw plenty from working in the resaurant or dealing at a table in the casino there was no shortage of the eye candy  Not a whole lot going on in the hotal as in shows so we walked to the other hotals  Saw Howie Mandel at MGM and Fantasy a topless revue at Luxor which are only        mins away  
P =>   I Hate Hooters     Parking Elevators are on their last legs and smells bad  Was treated rudely by the front desk girl as soon as we checked in  The room smelled musty and the bathroom is a dump  Took forever for the water to get hot and drainage pipes smelled like sewage coming out of them  No fridge in the room  Very Thin Walls and you could hear your neighbors and housekeeping talking and gossiping  For the Price We paid We could have got better Hotel on the strip  Im pissed that I cancelled a room at the Stratosphere for this dump  I would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone  More like a Roach Motel than a Hotel  
P =>   Very nice hotel very pretty girls We stayed at the Hooters hotel for two nights and my husband and I agree that it was a good choice to stay there  The hotel is located close tot the strip  The staff was very friendly and the room was clean and cosy  We ate at the Hooters restaurant twice and the food is really good  try the chicken wings  The girls are sweet and pretty  The pool is clean and they provide towels  Overall we enjoyed our stay very much  
P => 
P =>  Nice surprise  I didn t know what to expect from Hotel   and was pleasantly surprise by this hotel  It delivered on the promises made in the marketing email I received  
P =>   Nice but way overpriced I have stayed in some nice penthouses on the strip including my favorite the skylofts at MGM  I stayed in a   bedroom penthouse at hotel    and even though it was nice it was average  The cost was       per night  The skylofts run from              per night for a   floor   bedroom penthouse  The only thing that was better in this room over the other penthouses were the bathrooms  They could of used a better TV in the bathrooms but that aside they were nice  Hotel    prides themselves on saying they are a sister to the Skylofts  Well in this comparrison the Skyloft is a bikini model and Hotel    is the pretty girl next door that just has that   weird thing about her that you just can t really put your finger on LOL  I would visit again if the room was more like           per  No extras like free beverages or snacks in your room  They do offer some free treats all day down the hall  I didn t find anything in there I was crazy about but they do go the extra mile in there for you  Very nice people  They cater to you but don t crowd you like the skylofts  One thing I disliked and find trashy is the bathroom is all glass even the entrance door to the bathroom  I don t and I repeat don t want to see someone going to the bathroom  The bathroom should have a wooden door  It s like this in a regular suite also I was told  No women is that pretty to be seen using a bathroom       now add    years of marriage to that and it gets sadder LOL  Didn t use the pool  They have a floating river and wave pool but its very small  Mandalay bay has the same type of pool area but the wave and river pools are much much larger then Monte carlo  hotel      The casino was fun but very low maximum bets      on   card poker and Let it ride  The tables had low minimun bets though    and      The slots were very loose  One other thing  The web site makes the penthouses seem better then they really are  They are nice but at a reasonable rate  Have fun  
P =>   Low key hotel with great location on the Vegas Strip I have stayed in Vegas many time but never at the Monte Carlo  It was a great value during the over priced Labor Day weekend  It was a low key hotel  You can t beat the location  
P =>  Great rooms and service I stayed at Hotel    in the      sqft Loft suite and it was fantastic  My stay was comped but these rooms normally go for      a night  All   nights of my stay were quiet and comfortable  If you book a room at Hotel     they will send a limo to pick you up from the airport and take you to the main Monte Carlo entrance  There a suite assistant will greet you and escort you to the   nd floor to check in  There is almost never any line up at the hotel    front desk  The assistants will take you for a tour of your room and teach you how to use the LCD control box to turn on the TV s  lights and drapes  Even the shower is electronic  I was impressed  The bed was extra comfy The Monte Carlo itself is a very quiet casino compared to the others on the strip  In the evenings  other hotels would be full of people gambling  walking around  drinking  etc  The Monte Carlo just didn t compare  especially in the category of having beautiful people around  Sigh  The gambling for this trip was fantastic for me and I was able to leave Las Vegas as a winner  Drink service at the tables were average and the dealers on the most part were friendly and wanted you to win  I ate at the    hour Cafe and the Pub once and the food was above average  Didn t try the buffet but I ve had it before in prior trips and it was ok  I saw Terry Fator and Love this trip and I liked Terry Fator the best  Love was kind of boring for me but I m not old enough to appreciate the Beatles Overall my stay at Hotel    was great  My room  food and beverage was all comped  I highly recommend Hotel    as a great floor to stay on but the casino itself could be a little more alive  
P =>  Hotel      A New Hotel and a good experience I have to be in Las Vegas for business and having stayed in most of the hotels I am keen to try the new ones  I heard about Hotel    on the top of the Monte Carlo a few weeks ago and it got me excitied In the last week I was able to experience it  the process is very cool  Once you book they called me to arrange the free limo trip from the airport   I love this as I hate the taxi line   When I arrived my suite assistant took me to the hotel on the    floor  They have a lounge where I was offered a drink and snacks etc Then Amber   the suite assistant  took me to my Studio     the room is decorated in a cool white colour scheme and it had a massive long blue sofa  They gave me a fruit arrival ammenity and free Voss water That night I got a turn down and a small chocolate plate was left for me in my room  Breakfast was great in the lounge and I could see them building City Centre I had a great stay in the hotel  the team are working hard to make this special and it was  I will return if only for the Limo ride 
P => 
P =>   It was a nice stay Our stay was nice  the roomwas spacious and clean  The staff was very friendly and helpfull  Everyone at this hotel was courteous  helpful and worked to make our stay fantastic  My room included fridge  microwave and coffee maker and the most important thing  i Had free wifi with strong signal  They have a good restaurant on site were you can order cuban food  Parking was free  i did expect less for the money i paid but the room was very nice  A grocery store is within walking distance and opened   hs  I did enjoy the three nights i stayed there  Will definitely stay again  
P =>   It was a good place After reading some reviews we stil decided to stay at this Howard Johnson  I didn t expect much   BUT I was surprised when I got to the hotel     I had originally booked this hotel for   day  I ended up staying for a week  Staff was very friendly and helpful specially the manager Omid  For the price this hotel was outstanding  they have a huge lobby and a very nice Cuban restaurant  My room was clean and was very spacious with a balcony and free internet  was very spacious with a balcony and free internet  internet  Location was ok  the hotel is conveniently located between Las Vegas Strip and Downtown  just   to    minutes away from the main casinos and parking is free everywhere  For what we paid we felt like it was a great deal  I would definitely consider staying here again  We were very pleased with our stay  
P =>   Pleasant Surprise After reading some reviews we still decided to stay at this Howard Johnson  I didn t expect much   BUT I was surprised when I got to the hotel    I had originally booked this hotel for   day  I ended up staying for a week  Staff was very friendly and helpful specially the manager Omid For the price this hotel was outstanding  they have a huge lobby and a very nice Cuban restaurant  My room was clean and was very spacious with a balcony and free internet Location was ok  the hotel is conveniently located between Las Vegas Strip and Downtown  just   to    minutes away from the main casinos and parking is free everywhere  For what we paid we felt like it was a great deal  I would definitely consider staying here again  We were very pleased with our stay  
P =>   Okay for a one shot deal wouldn t stay there again  The services were okay  did not like the room at all The location was too far from the strip Needs a lot of work  Was rather old and seedy   
P =>   Dirty This was the worst place I have ever stayed in Las Vegas  Parking is outback and you must walk around the building to enter  In the most dangerous place in town employees warn not to walk alone  Rooms are clean but the cock roaches will keep you busy trying to avoid them  Facilities close at   pm and doesn t open untill  am  Place is surrounded by strip clubs so it s not a good place for a family visit  Only good thing about the place was the Las Vegas police occupied the sidewalk in front of the building after dark  
P =>  Is this where cops is filmed    The room was old and needs updating  Some of the wall outlets did not work and some of the lamp cords were cut  
P =>   Fine if you are on a tight budget I stayed here for two nights in ch  The hotel is on the strip  about half way between the big casinos and downtown  Yes  the room was worn and the furnishings tired  but you get what you pay for and this place was a bargain  The sheets and towels were clean  the kingsize bed comfortable enough  and at     a night  through Venere com  I had no complaints  Las Vegas was heavily booked while I was there  The big casino hotels were charging over      a night  and closer to my arrival date the HoJo rate climbed to over       which I would not have been happy to pay  The hotel has a pool which looked fine  though I didn t use it  There is a large parking lot behind the hotel  and I got high speed internet for free  I wouldn t recommend this as a place for hanging out  but if you just want a bed  it s a reasonable choice  
P => Great deal good restaurant decent pool For only     per nite  we were able to sleep our family of    have a nice dip in a pool   amp  a great breakfast  It s on the strip  yes  but you need a car  It s an easy drive to the downtown casino area or the fancy casinos on the main part of the strip  But  none of the casinos charge for parking  so it s no problem to have to drive there I loved the cuban toast and cafe con leche for breakfast at the Florida cafe One downside  the ice machines could not keep up with the demand  
P =>   Short in cash    stay here  Just want to let everyone know that this hotel motel is at the far end of the strip  like   blocks the other side of the Stratosphere and Sahara  So its a hike to the strip  Close to Fremont though  We ended up getting   nights with tax for         Great Price  We checked in and were directed to our room  which was not in the main building where the lobby is located  There are   buildings    where the lobby is and then another building which doesn t attach the the hotel lobby  more of a MOTEL than a hotel  i d say  anyway  so they stuck us in the  quot motel quot  part  The room was     degrees  there was an a c unit  but it was more of a  quot in the wall ai conditioner quot  and boy was it LOUD  So the room is small  ran down and looks NOTHING like the pictures that we saw on the internet  I made up my mind I wasn t staying there  I went to the lobby and asked for the manager  I explained my complaints to him and he said   quot no worries  I will upgrade you quot   I feel that they advertised one room on the web in hopes of booking their rooms and then when you get there they stick you in the most run down rooms that they have  Only when I complained was I offered a better room  a room like the one that I saw on the web  So after we got our stuff moved to the new room  things were good  A little skimpy on the towels and the shower pressure wasn t the greatest  but what do you expect for    bucks a night  right  
P =>  Good option A good option if you don t find accomodation in the principal hotels  Near the strip  no noise  clean and gently people working on it  A nice place to stay for what you pay  We stay there the last weekend of april       My husband and I were very scare for what we read in the reviews  but everything was ok  
P =>   Adequate So my confirmed reservation at at Bally s didn t exist on their computer system when I tried to check in at the airport  So  I needed a hotel room on a Saturday night on what seemed to be the busiest Sat ever in Vegas  For example  riott had no rooms within    miles  Everywhere I called was sold out Finally I was grateful to get the room here Shuttle driver from the airport gently ribbed me regarding location   the  less desirable  end of the strip apparently although  quot I should be OK if I stick to the strip quot   Its far end of the strip   its really downtown   not a great location  little going on other than weddings  Certainly not  strip central   However  as my main concern was sleeping after a trans alantic flight it wasn t an issue First impressions  Not bad internally  Nice room overlooking pool  Bit basic but what do you expect  Free wifi worked well  The Cuban style cafe on site is relatively lively and is entirely adequate for a sandwich and beer The downside  Thin walls  hear people moving above and in corridor  Room could have been cleaner   the edges and under the bed weren t great Light switching system poor  Light by the bed is controlled by the master switch by the door   which also controls the entrance area light  No master light switch by the bed  Yes  the light by the bed can be turned off independently but this doesn t turn the entrance area light off  Turning the entrance area light off  using master switch by door  results in bedside light being turned off  Net effect is that you MUST turn light off by the door and thus make your way to the bed in darkness   madness So in summary  entirely adequate  I paid       for the night which was outrageous  its really a         per night place IMHO  but when every hotel room in the city is full  and as I checked in they were quoting      per night for their last   rooms which they sold judging by the  sold out  posters on the doors this morning  it was a bed for the night and could have been worse   a lot worse  
P =>  Great for the price  This is a great hotel for all the right reasons  It is clean  the staff goes out of its way to be helpful  it is reasonable  It s the kind of hotel Europeans love    they know what s important  It is AAA rated   diamonds  The one drawback is its location  You are a few blocks north of the Stratotower  so really not close to the action on the Strip or downtown   It is right next to the Little White Chapel where Britany Spears and a ton of celebrities got married   You ll have to taxi around  drive  or take the new Deuce bus service that goes up and down the Strip and lets out a few feet from the door  About a half year old  the Deuce  so called because it is a double decker  costs    a trip  or    unlimited trips over    hours  It s supposed to run every    minutes  and depending on the time of day  it is close  Busy times  the buses tend to bunch up  If you have a pet  this is the only place to go on the Strip except for the Four Seasons at  x the price  The Cuban restaurant on site is excellent  but not owned by the hotel  so you can t charge meals to your room  but take credit cards  There is an additional American menu for breakfast and kids  meals  The wedding chapel off the lobby is busy and a never ending entertainment as you watch couples with families and friends bustle around on the big day  
P =>  Don t look under your bed  We were already concerned when we read the reviews for this hotel after our friend had made reservations  The carpet in the room was obviously very dirty and felt crusty under the feet  My friend immediately noticed some type of stain on the wall  We were better off suspecting it was spit of some kind  I attempted to turn the television on and it did not work  I looked behind the dresser and found the TV wasn t plugged in  I also found several empty beer bottles and other trash behind the dresser  I decided to do some more investigating and found several more bottles under the bed including broken glass  The sheets were old and the entire room felt dirty  My friend described it as being   the only time he took a shower and still felt dirty  The next morning we were out waiting in the hotel parking lot to start the days events  I looked down and what do I find  A small dime bag containing methamphetamine  I complained of the condition of the room several times to the staff and got promises it would be taken care of  The bottles were never even picked up I would not recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a safe  clean  drug free place to stay  My group was mostly made up of police officers and we were even concerned for our own safety in this area  Be careful  
P =>  Overpriced and disappointing Highly overpriced for the quality of the room  We wanted to avoid the hassle of going all the way into town as we just needed a quick nights rest between two cities  However  the hassle would have been worth the lost sleep we suffered  You can stay at a bigger hotel such as the Stratoshere for a third of the price and at least have a decent room  Our room was very run down  the lights didn t work  no remote control and were visited by a local cockroach  Not to much that being a motel as opposed to a hotel  it is extremely noisy  The only nice thing was the shuttle service to and from the airport and the staff were pleasant enough  
P => Horrendous This hotel is beyond shabby  it is scary  The delicate pattern of moth holes and cigarette burns in the curtains let just enough light in from the parking lot for me to watch  with great enthusiasm for  AM  roaches playing what looked like polo on the ceiling  As if more than the overwhelming scent of chemicals was needed to confirm the installation of new carpet  trimmings  dirt  and plaster was left as evidence in the entry way  I found it difficult to shower  shave  and brush my teeth while attempting to hover in order to not touch anything in the bathroom  This hotel could be well worth the money if your idea of a great place to spend a night includes wondering if the people in the room next door could actually see you through the thin walls  you don t mind sleeping  in my case watching roaches  in roughly the same position as the meat in a taco  or you can actually hover  I  sadly cannot   There is no price at which I would stay there again

P =>   Different in a good way  I ve stayed at Hyatts before  but never at the business traveler oriented Hyatt Place  This one is kitty corner to the Hard Rock Casino amid a maze of streets that end abruptly and or are one way  which I don t think they were a few years ago   Keep in mind that the Hard Rock is close by because this property has no casino    it s here for business  baby If you re just looking for a nice place to stay  and don t necessarily need that  quot Vegas Experience quot  in your hotel  you should consider this place  It has no room service  but the rooms are spacious  clean and quiet  Parking is easy access  and when I was in my sixth floor room I could see my car safely in the lot below  It s relatively close to the airport  but I only heard occasional muffled engine noise from small jets  nothing bothersome Nice HD TV with a lot of channels  movies are         if that s your in room thing   working fridge was nice and free wi fi was very good  It took me awhile to figure out the giant mirror was actually the sliding closet door  There is a small cafe  from which I grabbed some fruit from the coninental breakfast selection  Sharing the parking lot with the hotel is a popular Bavarian restaurant  and across the street there s a CVS  a bar  amp  grill  a Johnny Rockets  burgers   sushi and Korean BBQ  On the other corner there s UNLV  in case you feel like enrolling Points off for the dirty drinking glasses Overall  I think this is a great value and a nice change of pace  If you need the hustle and bustle of the Strip  it s only a few blocks away  
P =>   Outside the Strip calm and convenient close to airport The Hyatt Place Las Vegas is close to the airport  Welcome starts with a free Shuttle Bus available upon upon arrival at the airport  though  make sure you book with the concierge in advance   The Shuttle service is also available on your return from the Hotel back to the airport Very good service from the personel  They will be able to suggest the best attractions and places to visit during your stay The rooms are specious  clean with free Wi Fi Internet access  that is a major plus Close to the airport  outside the Strip  quiet and calm location       minutes taxi ride to the heart of Las Vegas where you will be able to enjoy yourself  shows  concerts  bars  clubs  restaurants  casinos of course       If you fancy woalking and if it is not too hot or windy you can set off on foot arrive within       minutes in town be not the best choice for food  as I do not remember they offered a full restaurant service Would definietly recommend it  
P =>  Great stay This is a great place to stay if you have a car and want to be off the strip  We stayed   nights and I never heard a plain  we were on floor   facing the parking   Service was great  they had a very yummy free breakfast  also free wii fii and parking  and the same type of room and amenities of every Hyatt place     flat TV     hour room service with menu and ordering option on TV  nice bathroom with tub  coffee machine  fridge  big bed  sofa  working desk  nice bedding    I love the idea of the Hyatt place  it is a basic hotel with everything you need to feel comfortable during your stay  I just love the big flat TV Wherever I go and there is a Hyatt place  I stay there  The price is great for what you get  in our opinion 
P =>   Great airport UNLV hotel but in a somewhat sketchy area This is my second stay at a Hyatt Place property and I really like what they ve done with these  quot older quot  hotels  The decor is so modern and classy  I like the furniture  color choices  and overall  quot hipness quot  of these properties  Room was very clean and has everything you could want  refrigerator  huge plasma TV  free internet  separate bar area  couch  comfortable bed  and nice sink area  The bathroom area itself is a bit tight but not too bad  If you are a  quot large quot  person I could imagine you might struggle but it s fine for most  There is a free breakfast which is perfectly fine but it s not a hot breakfast that you d get at a place like Staybridge Suites  ent selection of breads  cereal  yogurt  and fruit  Check in was quick  easy  and friendly  All staff I encountered were very nice  The only thing I don t like about this hotel is the location  It s in a somewhat shady area across from UNLV and there are signs all over the parking lot warning you that they are not responsible for items left in cars  I rented a car  they do have a free airport shuttle though  and was scared the whole time I d find it broken into when I got out  Those signs don t set a good tone but I understand why they are there  Luckily I didn t have any problems and had a great stay  Would stay here again if I wasn t visiting the strip  
P =>   Great Airport hotel  I had an overnight layover and chose to stay in this Hyatt brand hotel  We frequent Hyatt hotels and this is a very smart  modern and clean hotel  It is a recent acquistion for Hyatt and newly remodeled  alhough I would have sworn it was a brand new hotel The room had a very comfortable king bed and a separate living room with a couch and table with a desk and kitchen area  sink  micro  frig   The staff were very friendly and helpful  There is a free airport shuttle and a free breakfast  although my flight left too early for me to take advantage of it  The breakfast area is large enough  well organized and clean  The hotel is close to the Hard Rock Cafe although traffic is rather busy in this area and the typical seedy Vegas billboards advertisements surround the area  I felt relatively safe walking across the street to the restaurant  I will definately stay here again should the need arise  
P =>  Pleasurable stay As a travel agent  got a great rate and didn t want to say on  quot the strip quot   so this Hyatt was the answer  Unfortunately  it took us     hour to find the place after coming into LV north on I     It is literally right across from UNLV  and with all the one way streets  and Paradise Rd stopping  then starting up again   confusing  it is also just minutes from the LV airport  and hotel has a shuttle Room had separate  quot living room quot   but vanity area was open wide into bedroom area Refrigerator and USA Today delivered on weekdays  No restaurant  BUT best feature for me    the POOL  Gorgeous landscaping  not too deep Very comfy beds and pillows  Also  no fee for parking  
P =>   If you value sleep stay elsewhere     The hotel is right under the flight plan of planes taking off from Las Vegas Airport and is very loud     The hotel staff at check in gave me my room card and did not explain the amenities of the hotel   I ve stayed at Hyatt Place before  so it wasn t a big deal for me  But it is unprofessional     Checkout took    minutes in line  And I was the  st person in line  Totally unacceptable for there to be one person at checkout desk at  AM  Granted  the woman being helped when I got the to desk had problems  but it could have been handled a lot better   like to call a co worker to help  asking the woman to wait while simple check outs can occur        The room had an iron  but no ironing board  Needless to say  I will not return  
P =>   Surprised Me  They Renovated The Amerisuites  I use to stay at the Hard Rock Hotel all the time  But sometimes when I couldn t get a room I would stay across the street at the Amerisuites  Mediocre at best and overpriced  BUT NOW  I booked through the Hyatt web site and they surprised me by booking me at the SAME PROPERTY UNDER A NEW NAME  It was WAY WAY WAY BETTER  Everything  Rooms  lobby  Wood paneled and huge flat screen TV  Great Hyatt beds  I read some other reviews about airplane noise  Totally wasn t an issue  Yes they are near McCarron but it s muffled  And I was on the  th floor  I know my comments sound so good I must be a shill  I m not  But I am very picky and was expecting another mediocre experience in Vegas hotel staying  I thought this place was perfect  Great service  There was a slow drain in my sink and the TV didn t get HD so they came up immediately and fixed it  There s free internet  Coffee in the room which I like  Huge fluffy pillows which I like  Kind of a suite layout  Living area and bedroom area Wish I could rag on something here  But can t  I d look here first before going to any of those crappy casino spa joints  
P =>  Clean Comfortable Handy Little Place I stayed here last weekend for one night on a Saturday and was familiar with the location as I frequent the Hard Rock Hotel and have also passed by the Hyatt Place on my way to the Vegas airport  Like almost all things in L V   this is a much larger Hyatt Place than normal and it was pretty full from sports groups booked there  I think the S D  State women s basketball team was one of the groups there   Seeing that  I was a bit nervous about room noise and the long lines for the complimentary breakfast but after requesting a quiet room  was surprised that it was a nice quiet corner room on the second floor  No noises from the other rooms around or above and the room was clean  well kept and comfortable  if you don t like firm beds then beware   As stated in some of the other posts  the only noise was from the airplanes overhead    having previously lived under a flight path  I think I was somewhat insulated from the noise but it is an issue to consider until they change the flight path The wait for the breakfast line was not too bad and while they had run out of a couple of things when I first got there  I was surprised at how quickly it was replenished  compared to some of the other Hyatt Places I ve stayed at   Did not take advantage of the pool  which was outdoors and looked nice  or the exercise room  which was on the second floor   They have   internet stations by the breakfast area in addition to the free wi fi throughout the hotel  Did not take advantage of the free airport shuttle as I had driven over  but this is a great feature for L V   nor the complimentary shuttle to Planet Hollywood as I was told you had to call for pickup  However  location across from the Hard Rock Hotel Cafe is great and if you re a walker  a great selection of restaurants on their  quot Restaurant Row quot  on Flamingo Rd  is about    min walk away Overall  I was impressed with this hotel as I m a frequent visitor to Vegas and I don t always stay or play on the Strip  If you re looking for Strip casinos or action or this is your first visit to L V  you might want to pay extra for a strip casino  Otherwise  this is a great place to stay  
P =>   Great Stay Booked a room through Hotwire for around     USD night  Hotel looks great  Rooms are big  with massive LCD TV   coffee maker and key operated safe  Bathroom a little small  Modern interior decoration  Very clean  Free wi fi with good signal    computers and a printer are also available for use in the lobby Included breakfast was good  Bagels  bread  english muffins  cereal  fruit  yoghurt and Starbucks coffee and teas  Location was ok  They provided a free shuttle to the strip  Planet Hollywood   which leaves at half past every hour  In order to return to the hotel  you need to call and book the shuttle  Definitely more fun to stay on the strip if you plan to have big days out  Also  there is a free airport shuttle  Plenty of restaurants around  as well as a laundromat and CVS pharmacy We weren t bothered at all by the noise of the aeroplanes as flights finish at midnight  Very friendly staff  
P =>  Hyatt Place in Vegas This Hyatt Place is nicely set up    location is actually pretty good  It s directly across corners from the Hard Rock Resort  We did the walk from the Hyatt Place to the strip  and it really wasn t all that bad  It s not all that close  but I work in downtown Chicago and have to walk from my train to my job daily  so it s just another walk  It was close enough that we decided to walk back as well  Our only big gripe with this Hyatt Place is that it seems located directly below the McCarran flight path  It can be somewhat noisy at times  This is sort of a beware type thing  and not something I d take out on the hotel management  The rooms were spacious and as other Hyatt Places we ve stayed at  has a wonderful TV with plenty of HD content available  
P =>  Warning   Its in the Flight path We are staying at the Hyatt as we speak  We came to Vegas for the New Year and chose the hotel after reading the reviews  but mainly because it was opposite the Hard Rock Hotel where we were spending New Years Eve For the money you can t really complain  The staff are fantastic  When we checked in we were told to use the free shuttle bus that they provide to travel to and from the strip   it operates from     am and finishes with the last pick up at      pm   They advised about walking anywhere because of the  quot area quot  so be warned  Our room  like the other reviews suggest  was the size of a suite  Reasonably clean but quite an unpleasant smell lingering in the corridors  We were absolutely gobsmacked to find that we were under the flight path   perhaps flight path are the wrong words  Flight path suggests the planes have actually taken off before they bounce over the roof of the hotel  We are on the top    th   floor  The planes are constant   the sound of one  not disappearing before the next  The room vibrates as they go over and car alarms in the parking lot below sing in unison as the jets set them off  We asked if we could be moved to a lower floor thinking that maybe a few storeys above us would kill the noise  but the room we were shown stunk of cigarettes   although this is a non smoking hotel   and there was no getting away from the planes  The local pharmacy sells ear plugs  What we couldn t understand is why no one else had mentioned this in their reviews  Well the answer is that for the next   months they are relaying a section of runway at the airport and during this time planes are taking off and landing on a different approach  So be warned         The comp breakfast is not bad  so if it wasn t for the planes the hotel would be fine for a base  
P =>   Great Rooms This is a very clean   comfortable hotel about   mile off the strip  It is near the airport and across the street from the Hard Rock Cafe  The rooms are great  like junior suites  with a great buffet breakfast  The pool id quite good  Overall I would recommend a stay there away from the craziness of the strip  
P =>   A normal business leisure hotel in Las Vegas  I had a pleasant stay at Hyatt Place  I found it pleasant because of several things it didn t have  no resort fee  no electricity fee  no internet usage fee and no outrageous mini bar fees  These fees are pretty standard at most  if not all the Vegas casino resorts  After a few days  they can really add up  The estimate given to me from their site was exactly the rate I paid to the penny  Also  Hyatt Place opened in ember      so it isn t beat up like most of the other places I ve stayed in Vegas  I doubt you can find a more comfortable bed in town Despite not having a restaurant  the amenities at Hyatt Place surpass most of the resorts too  The standard rooms are very large  The    quot  HDTV actually gets a ton of HDTV stations and pay per view movies  I m amazed how many other hotels invest in HDTVs and then don t subscribe to get the HD stations  Of course  in Vegas  most resorts have poor TVs so you spend more time in the casino  The free wireless Internet was fast and flawless  You can connect your ipod to the TV speakers  Just remember to bring a cord While some people here didn t like the location  I did  The strip mall across the street with the CVS has at least a half dozen good restaurants including a great New York Pizza place  The primary reason I stayed here was it was across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel where I ususally stay  It was sold out during this trip and Hyatt Place was a much less expensive option anyways  You can use the pool at HRH as long as you tell the security guy that you intend on playing at the gambling tables by the pool  This included the Sunday Rehab which is normally an expensive ticket  What incredible eye candy  The Hard Rock Hotel  skip the Hard Rock Cafe  is my absolute favorite place in Las Vegas and where I end my nights when I m there  Having a nice place to walk to instead of waiting in the huge cab line was great  
P =>   A Vegas gem  I LOVED this hotel  Exceptionally friendly and attentive staff  lovely rooms  great shuttle service to town and the airport as well as a generous morning breakfast and evening nibblies  Our rooms were spacious  beautifully appointed and equipped with Wifi  a wet bar and a gorgeous flatscreen  No casino noise and a perfect oasis of calm  I look forward to retruning next year  Great work Hyatt   
P =>   Great place at a great price It is a little bit off the strip  but that means you don t have to deal with the traffic and crowds  It was quiet  even though it is close to the airport   and there are plenty of places within walking distances to eat  They provide a free shuttle to the strip Our room was very nice  a living area and bedroom area  with a huge tv with inputs for the ipod  There was a LARGE comfy couch and free internet access  The bathroom sink had LOTS of counter space and overall it was a very nice place to stay at a great rate  
P =>   Best place to stay if you hate all the traffic We stayed here  th of y weekend  Have been to Vegas before and hate all the time it takes to get in and out of hotel  Hotel staff was very nice  has Starbucks at front desk and a    hour restaurant  We had a strip view and it was wonderful their was no charge you just have to request it beforehand  Always love Hyatt Place s rooms they have free wi fi and flat screen tv s    Free parking and just a block away from the strip and across the street from the Hard Rock  It was good because we have kids and hate to walk through casino area and smoke with them  
P =>   Good Quiet Vegas Location This Hyatt Place is close to Vegas airport  and about four long blocks away from the Strip  My room had a terrific view of the Strip  which was breathtaking both during the day and especially at night  The hotel s sound insulation is superb  Jets were passing right outside my window literally    seconds before touching down at the airport    and I could barely hear any noise  The large German restaurant next door was also noisy with a particularly bad oompah band  but none of the noise made it into the hotel My spacious room had a large flat screen TV  a large sofa  and a Queen size bed  The room was clean  but the carpet could have been a bit fresher  The bathroom fixtures looked new and functioned well  The wireless internet is free  and generally operated reliably but did slow down during afternoon peak periods The morning breakfast is included in the price and was well stocked  and included a healthy fruit bowl  The hotel is close to a    hour store that carries essential supplies  and the Hard Rock cafe is nearby  as are several small food places My main complaint at this hotel was the housekeeping  which was sloppy  On one day  I clearly left a used towel in the bath tub to be replaced  and it was still there after the room was cleaned  Disappointing Otherwise  if you want a quiet place away from the Strip  this is a very good choice  
P =>   Nice rooms but heed the location This HP shares the typical stylish decor with other HP locations  so expect nice  spacious rooms with an excellent    quot  flat panel TV displaying true HD content  The staff was friendly and competent The location is conveniently close to the airport  but you do get the occasional jet noise  depending on the wind direction   Also  it s sort of on an island between the two one way sections of Paradise  a major thoroughfare to from the airport   So on each side you have a high volume of one way traffic  and on a third side the HP shares a parking lot with a very large  popular beer hall  The immediate environment feels noisy and chaotic  and at night  perhaps a bit unsafe  The doors  even the main entry  require keys after dark  so I had to buzz to be let in when I checked in at  pm  Inside it does feel safer and quieter The general area is not known to be the safest  but it s convenient to the Hard Rock about     a block away  UNLV  Thomas amp Mack Center  and of course  the airport  The Strip is about a   minute drive  
P =>  best place to stay off the strip for bussiness travel We were very satisfied with the service at this location  the staff is extremely accommodating always with a smile  especially Ms Ayako and Gaby 
P =>  nice place off strip  myself and my girlfriend stayed here for one night after our flight was canceled delta airlines put us up free of charge so i am not sure what the prices are like the hotel is located approx a mile from the strip the hotel runs a free shuttle bus to and from planet hollywood on the strip the lobby are is nicely decorated staff are friendly our room was very large in size  it had a living room kind of area within the room there was also a very large flat screen very impressive the hotel is across the road from hard rock hotel and casino there also is a small shopping area across the road with alot of food options we ate in johnny rockets for lunch right beside there is also a german pub restaurant we did not eat in the hotel  we left very early in the morning so did not have breakfast there also seemed to be a nice swimming pool but we did not use overall i would recommend this hotel the location might seem an inconvenience but with the free shuttle bus things are made easy  
P =>  Good deal   Off Strip Good deal  close to the airport  their shuttle will take you anywhere you wish  Planes flying over every now and then  but it did not keep us awake  We are not into the hustle and bustle of Vegas  we were here for a convention  it was perfect for us  Continental breakfast  with option to buy other selections  Check out the      Mr  Luckys at the Hard Rock  get the Gamblers Special       for steak and three shrimp  good deal  Friendly folks  newly renovated rooms  Huge TV in the room that we watched the Superbowl on  We would stay here again if we were in town  The Hard Rock is right across the street if you want to gamble  but stay and sleep in a quieter environment  
P =>  Helped us in a Pinch Satyed here when our flight was canceled  It s less than a mile from the airport  so we picked it for closeness and the free shuttle service from the airport  and the cost  very reasonable   The shuttle arrived quickly and our driver was very nice and informative  Check in was quick  they have a kiosk and you don t even have to speak to anyone  There is a desk too  if you want a live person  The rooms were comfy  a little strange in the layout  Living room area with desk  pull out bed  mini bar area with free wi fi  Bedroom area next with flat screen TV in between that can be rotated to either side  Bed was suer comfy  bathroom was very small  The only down side is you can hear the planes literally flying over your head  Luckily they stopped around midnight  I wouldn t stay long term  but if you need a comfy cheap place to stay close to the airport I would recommend staying here  
P =>  Beware the jet noise When the wind shifts the hotel is directly under the departing flight pattern for way to close McCarran Airport  At midnight we decided to give it a count    flights taking off directly over our hotel in just    minutes  The rooms depicted on the hotel s website are a generic representation of an average room in the Hyatt Place chain  not an actual room at the Las Vegas hotel  The rooms in Las Vegas  rather than having a screen separate the two portions of the room had a   X    floor to ceiling divider that housed the in room air conditioner  loud  which also made the area around king bed much smaller This place does not deserve the Hyatt name and is no where up to the standards of riott s Residence Inn  Fairfield or Courtyard chains  Okay  the large LCD television rocks  but it did not makeup for the rest of the issues

P => Reviews here are pretty much right on The best reason to stay at the Imperial Palace is location   it is pretty much in the heart of the strip and the middle of everything  That and the price were my main reasons for staying  I would have preferred to stay somewhere nicer  but for the money  this hotel was a good deal  Not a whole lot to do   nightlife is pretty much non existent at the IP  but other hotels are close by so there is always something to do  Rooms were decent   nothing spectacular by any means  but the shower was hot and the water pressure was really good  Noise level was okay unless someone was being loud in the hallway  it s Vegas so that s going to happen   Our room was by the pop machine and I did get a little perturbed at someone filling it at   am  The saying    quot you get what you paid for quot  and that s what you ll get at IP  
P => loved the place   for the money it s great right in the middle of all the BIG casino s   it s worth it  Been in different kinds of rooms everytime we go   i can t decide which one i like the best  there s one w  a huge tub   this year we stayed at one w  a  quot living room quot   couch and tv  bedroom didnt  have a door tho  so can t have guests   lol 
P => Good value at the heart of the strip I had read mixed reviews and even was advised by a friend not to stay at the Imperial Palace  however I got a great flight hotel deal so I thought I would give it a go  We arrived on a Thursday  checked in took about   minutes  the walk to our room was about the same  On inspection of the room  I even checked for bed bugs  the only thing that was lacking was there was little bits of hairs on the bathroom floor  The next day the cleaning lady did clean the bathroom  The hotel is outdated  the restaurants are not worth eating at as you are minutes from much better restaurants such as garitaville  etc  The pool is decent but gets packed as it is small  When the weekend hit  the hotel was full and elevator lines did get alittle long  never longer than a     min wait and if you knew your way around the hotel you could find an alternate route to your room but it was tricky  we finally mastered a shortcut on day    The location is ideal  there is also a bus stop right outside the hotel  If you are not planning on spending in the hotel and instead outside enjoying the strip then this hotel will suit your needs  If you are looking for a hotel that you want to stay and play without having to leave  then upgrade to a different hotel  
P => Bed Bugs At Imperial Las Vegas Beware I stayed for   nights  the second night I was itching and about the third or fourth day I showed the cleaning lady and was told lady that I must have developed allergies as I showed her my back and legs  I was in agony for the week and asked for new sheets  blanket  bedspread  each day would ask for something new  Her and I looked for some sign and saw nothing  I came home saw my MD the very next day and he said it was bed bug bites  I called the hotel and they are looking into it  I wanted them to stop renting the room out and refund money  They have not responded as yet  They were shocked I did not let a manager know at the hotel    How many people are sabby to bed bugs and the cleaning lady said no  it is allergies that I must have just developed them  Besides I did not want any man to see me  I was so embarrased that I even complained to the cleaning lady and showed her all my bites and clawing I did to my self to try to get relief  Not to shy to post them as to help someone else  How do you tell your friends OH I GOT BED BUGS  
P => Cheap rate good location nothing more  Booked IP for a quick one night stay at a very low rate  Wasn t expecting much  but still disappointed  Probably the most uncomfortable bed I ve every experienced  The room  hallways  and casino were worn and dirty  Front desk staff and casino personnel all seemed fairly competent  But I would ve been miserable here for an extended stay  Tip  If you stay here  request a room far away from the Rockhouse Bar  otherwise you ll be hearing thumping bass until early morning  
P => Hey it s Vegas              gotta love it  Hey we just got back from Vegas and had a wonderful time  Six of us went and stayed at the Imperial Palace    of us had a regular room but friends who are repete customers had a comped penthouse  The staff are great  rooms are comfy and clean and they restaurants were good  You can t beat the location and the price  We were in town Sunday when the CFL was playing the West  amp  East finals for Grey Cup  GO RIDERS  The Wynn said they would play the game for us in the sports bar       NOT       The Mandalay Bay had a conference of      Canadians staying there and would not play the game either  We asked the RockHouse at the IP and they said you bet  They had   tvs going    for   drinks specials for us and treated us like royalty Thry are aslso going to play the Grey Cup this Sunday for anyone donwn there  Go see them they are a great bunch  Annie was out waitress and she even wore a Rider Jersey Go see Terry Fador at the Mirage  he is a great showman and lots of fun I would go back to the IP  I liked the sixe of the place  we are treated well and enjoyed being right in the middle of everything  
P =>   Nothing fancy but good price and location Clean  but very average rooms  Good water pressure in the shower  Best of all  it s very cheap  and is right in the middle of the Strip  near the Flamingo and across from Caesar s Palace  A good place to stay if you just want somewhere to sleep  There s also a Monorail stop One word of caution  get a room away from the Strip side of the building  There s live music outside until the wee hours  and it s as though the band is right there with you in the room  We checked in at  am  covered our ears  and immediately went back to the front desk  It was no problem getting a new room  
P =>  Worked out great  We were at the IP as part of a group and had     room nights  So we got a picture of the good  bad and evil of the IP  First you have to remember that everything in Vegas is priced upon LOCATION  Being at the center of the strip cost more than being well off strip  The buffet at the IP is     for the whole day  but yet go   miles to a Boulder Highway Casino and eat all day for less than    bucks  And neither are any more than some red meat and a lot of chicken products with a salad  So when it comes to food  get out and explore to find bargains and variety  This is an OLD hotel  Period  You can feed an old dog steak and it is still an old dog  Rooms will have the smells of the last    yrs  Carpets will be worn  Water flow will be strange  Elevators will stop working  These are just facts  so except them because of the location and price  I am sure some people were happier than others  But the only whine I heard from our group about the rooms was rough toilet paper   Duh  bring your own to ANY hotel  And bird poop on the balcony  Yes bird pop outside  what a surprise  I was impressed to even have a balcony for each room  I was not impressed by the size of the rooms  as I was at Harrah s or even Bally s  Tuscany wins that battle hands down on room size  but again location and cost are a factor  I twice called security about elevators being out of service and one was fixed quickly  one never did work in my    day visit  But I did locate all the hidden elevators and never had much of a wait  There will be noise inside and outside the hotel  This is Vegas  a town that never sleeps and gives away free drinks  Just deal with it as a fact  The desk clerks did a fine job as well as the group room sales office  Robert Coppola  You can always expect a few bumps when you deal with so many rooms and so many people  The maid service was great and responded quickly when asked for extra services  All the employees where nice and made us feel that our business was welcomed  Shaun Tracy the Midwest Regional Sales Manager for Las Vegas Meetings by Harrah s exceeded his duties and went beyond the call of duty to see that we had a great time and all at a decent price   Over all with price and location our group will be back soon  
P =>   you get what you pay for clearly  Las Vegas epitomizes  quot you get what you pay for quot   You pay a little for a cheap room  you get a cheap room  No bargains found in this town during our stay  Having said that  we wanted a decent room on the strip so we could walk around  day or night  After reading reviews of other hotel rooms in the     range  I have to say that the Imperial Palace wasn t too bad  Although the wallpaper was peeling and the furniture obviously had not been wiped down for years  it wasn t too filthy  The room was large enough for the two of us  The bed was a bit saggy but not uncomfortably so I think the property is a bit rundown   some of the elevators weren t working and it surprised me that we had to call the maintenance staff because they were unaware of the problem   You always get the impression that someone is watching all of the casino operations      but this didn t seem to be true  The best part of our stay was the   for   coupon to Matsuri for hotel guests  It was a good show for          then  on our way out  we found another coupon in the vegas to go book  so I guess it wasn t an exclusive saving   if you can get a room here for under      I think I would have to recommend it  Circus Circus is a bit far away         so the location of the Imperial Palace is what recommends it the most  If you pay more than that for a dumpy room  I d have to say you got ripped off  
P =>  Very tired Hotel I stayed at this hotel as part of a tour of the West Coast area USA  The exterior of the hotel is very off putting and quite seedy  having a large disco bar in front of the hotel  The rooms are very tired and although they were clean  the whole experience of staying there was not pleasant  The noise outside could be heard in a lot of the rooms allocated to our group  I did not eat in the hotel but used tthe buffet in the Caesars Palace Hotel which is across the road and  although not the cheapest  is very good   The only redeeming feature for this hotel is its location  which is right in the centre of the Las Vegas Strip  
P =>   Great value This was my second stay at the IP  If you re a person who needs frills in a hotel  this isn t the place for you  If you want a good basic room in a great location  then this is an excellent choice  You can t beat the price for a location like that The room was clean and comfortable  The shower was slow to drain but so s my one at home so that didn t bother me  I didn t have that problem during my previous stay so it might just be that particular room The main minus are the legendarily slow elevators  They re as bad as you may have heard  Otherwise  I really enjoyed my stay  The staff are friendly  The room was clean  Plenty of towels and good hot water  The bed was comfortable  The TV is the old bulky style but it worked well and has a pretty good selection of channels There s a good variety of slot machines and the dealertainers are fun to watch  The internet connection was great  cheaper than at the other hotel I stayed at and much more reliable  Another plus is that the IP is very generous with comps and rate reductions even for those of us who are low rollers  This is not a fancy hotel  If you want frills and such  this is not the hotel for you  If  on the other hand  you just want a basic room with friendly staff and clean  comfortable accomodations  then consider staying at the IP  It has a great location in easy walking distance of several other casinos and attractions and the bus line  
P =>   THIS PLACE IS GREAT    DONT WORRY    What Can I say but wow    I just got back from las vegas I have stayed at many places there  I found a great deal for this hotel  This hotel is Great    my room was very clean   Staff was great   Really dont worry about bad reviews these people are nutz    Check in was fast   We ate in the buffet it was       and you can eat all day go back and forth as much as you want all day    Food and service was great    At night had great seafood etc  the prime rib was great     You really cant beat this deal   Oh ya one vip thing to remember when you check in dont get a room by the night club the clerk at front desk told us that part of hotel was very loud  They gave us a pool view room on the   th floorgreat view   And do not get the capri rooms they are in very back of hotel those are the dumpy ones    Anyway I had a great stay I will be back I already booked for feb           
P =>    th time there but probably the last  Everything was the same there but maybe I am getting older and ready to pay more for a nicer place  I had a friend stay at the Mirage for not much more and that hotel is so much nicer and almost as good location  so after staying there   times over the last   years here are the negatives and positives negatives Pool  not really a Vegas pool more like an Apartment complex poolThe great value of the hotel brings rif raf that stays there  so much less eye candy than other hotels  but still great people watching  don t get me wrong still a safe placeElevators are minimal small and way too slowBuffett is awfulShows are awfulCasino is small  ceilings are low and its way too smokyTables are old and dirty and the other games are datedBurger palace and the pizza place are horriblePositives Service has always been goodValue is greatLocation cannot be beat you can get to a lot of hotels in   minutes   where if you stayed at the Wynn you could only get to their parking garage in   minutesDealertainers are funny and entertaining   i still miss Louis Armstrong   he was greatBetties little snack shack looks old but good little bagel and pastriesClose to Harrah s so you can steal their free WIFI so I think this is a pretty good desciption of the place that is fai  Like I said I came back   times   I stayed at the Excalibur once but preferred the location of the IP  I wouldn t object to going back based on the value but I just think I am ready to pay a little more for a little nicer place  I would like to enjoy my next hotel a little more than just a place to sleep so I can get up and go to another property  The IP will always be a part of me though 
P =>   not the best place on the strip but great location and good value for money Hi EveryoneI was dreading staying in this hotel after reading everyones review but this was third time in Vegas so I wasn t really bothered where I stayed after all its just a bed and roof over my head is all I was after  Im glad I stayed their    Its perfect location and CHEAP    Don t let others opinion worry you  Its not the best place but my room  and   other rooms where my friends was staying  were all clean and spacious  no roaches as others states  but for the price i paid   days for     dollars what do you expect     Venetian         You get what you pay for    Lift was slow but it never bothered me I never waited longer than   mins the only thing I would have like and this is personal choice is having a safe in the room   Honestly  Its not that bad and for what you pay its perfect     ITS CLEAN    Its like paying for easyjet flight and expecting BA service get real         Buffet was ok but Embers restaurant was fantastic      course meal for     dollars Hope this helps 
P =>   vegas baby we had an awsome time at the imperial palace  there was a dealer ther card dealer that is that never forgot a name and he aslo was from north dakota made our trip great 
P =>   good location but getting a bit run down This is the second time we have stayed in this hotel it is clean  and is in very good location in the centre of the strip  It is also a stop for the monorail which is handy   The hotel itself although clean is getting run down bathrooms could do with upgrading The whole place could do with a coat of paint  I also felt the buffet didn t have such a wide choice this year  There aren t enough lifts to cope at peak times  you can wait up to       mins sometimes  As my has walking difficulties we were forced to wait rather than use stairs   They are also now charging to use gym    dollars for    mins which is a rip off  They have outside cocktail bar which my wife and i were refused access as we didn t have id consdering i am fifty and paying guest i find that situation terrible so for these rasons i will not be back 
P =>   Good location Basically as you all know you get what you pay for The Imperial palace is cheap and cheerful but its location is amazing as it is central on the strip  This was my first trip to Vegas and although a bit unsure at first quickly got into the spirit of the place You are here to drink  gamble and enjoy yourself  The Rock Bar just at the front of the Imperial palace always has a great has a great atmosphere and is a bit more laid back than some of the other bigger clubs The best bit about this hotel is that you are not too far away from anything  The price is worth the location but if you are looking for something bang up to date you may want to try out some of the slightly more expensive hotels like TI or the Mirage  
P =>   Good Location and very reasonable We stayed at the IP from   th thru the   th  The hotel is nothing fancy  but for the location and cheap price  it cant be beat  If you are like us and just want a clean place to sleep  then the IP is for you  If you want more of a upscale hotel  then I would look else where  
P =>   my daughter s wedding the place is a joke they trea ted my daughter and her new husband with the most disrepect  From a maid going into their room when a do not enter sign is on the door  topeople going in and breaking their belongs  And being escorted out like criminal  Don tget me started on some one stealing money from one of guest  valet leaving the door toanother guest car ajar running down the battery and then threaitng them with having their car towed to bath tubs broke and other guest putting do not enter and staff going in any way if they can t read english send them back across the border  
P =>   Great Place I dont know what people want for the price I stayed here for    days and It is only a place to sleep when your in Vegas My husband and I were treated very good and for the price you cant go wrong especially the location  The food was good for the cost and Our room was clean 
P =>  What a dump   should be demolished Stayed   nights  NEVER AGAINCons    Open the door to the room and bad smell eminates   Room old and tired   Carpet badly stained  No fridge  no coffee making facilities  Pull back the covers and sheets have holes in them  happened again on third night  Took a shower and bath filled with water  plumbing blocked  Can t have window open as bus bay below window and constant beeping of reversing vehicles  Don t sleep well because of screeching of service lift nearby that needs servicing going up and down all night  Late catching coach because cannot get a lift at two seperate banks of lifts as all full and no room eventually gave up and walked down the stairs Coach tour departs    minutes late because luggage late   lifts broken down  again   Disgruntled patrons everywhere  Cigarette smoke permeates the building even on  quot no smoking quot  floors Pros    Cheap Location in centre of strip 
P =>   Great choce  but you kind of got to know how to work it     This was our   nd Las Vegas trip and our  th stay at the IP  We have stayed at many hotels there  and we keep coming back here  The location cannot be topped  head out the front door   and you are within walking distance to most of the great things this city offers We were comped a king suite   but we have stayed in a deluxe room  and they are ok as well  My recommendation is that you can pay for a king suite for about the same price as a standard room at Mirage  or TI   and have a much larger room with more amenities  Our room had a sitting room  king bed  oversized tub  wet bar with a refrigerator  and yes     a coffee maker  The biggest gripe you will read about staying there is that the IP is the home of the planets slowest elevators  This honor is well earned  but the knowlegable guest learns that there is a second bank of lifts around the back and to the loft of the main bank  Few people seem to know about these   and the wait is not as bad  Also the front elevators seem to not have as much traffic and you can walk back to your foom on you home floor after using them  This is particularly handy if you are toting luggage The restaurants there are not the best in town  The Embers steakhouse is ok  and the coffee shop is good for a breakfast  or a light lunch  Room service is great for breakfast    used it every day  although a little slow  The Burger Palace and the buffet are to be avoided at all costs  The staff there is great  and the casino hosts are among the best in the business  The front desk and the valet staff are friendly and helpful  I would not recommend this hotel for the first time Las Vegas visitor  but for the guest who knows his way around  it has got to be the best value on the strip  
P =>   Like sleeping in a parking garage Recently stayed from ober      th There are two very different sides to this hotel  the main part of the building which must be relatively ok and rooms in a separate building  The Capri Building  about a    minute walk away through the carpark which are like sleeping in the carpark  We heard televisions through the walls  EVERYBODY S conversations as though walls didn t exist  fights in the car park  car alarms here and there and twice had people trying to get into our room in the          am Had to call security twice to break up an argument of drunk college guys outside our room at      in the morning  they never turned up  Housekeeping also  forgot our room  twice in four days and no  the  do not disturb  wasn t on the door As regular business traveller I have stayed at literally thousands of hotels at all levels of luxury to economy  I understand people don t go to Vegas to sleep but we stayed for   days and reasonable expected to sleep at some stage We turned on the heater  during a particular cold front that came through  to have the whole room fill with an electric fire and burnt dust smell It s centrally located and they have celebraity look a likes dealing cards  That s the best I ve got  
P =>   This place is a DUMP We thought we had a great deal   airfare  amp    nights hotel for       Unfortunately  you get what you pay for  This place is an absolute DUMP  We had paid for   nights and left after    The only thing missing was cockroaches  Water backed up in the sink  amp  tub  hairdryer didn t work  nice to find out when you re standing there with a dripping head of hair   grimy room decor straight out of the    s  beds HARD AS ROCK  towels as soft as a wire loofah  air conditioning sounded like a     landing      and on and on and on  And the FOOD in the restaurants  Overpriced and disgusting  Yup  this place is a DUMP  We moved after   nights to the Tuscany Suites  amp  Casino about a half mile off the strip   FABULOUS  A suite that was   times the size of the dump at the Imperial Palace  brand new  beautiful  quiet grounds and staff that just could not do enough for us  Saturday night cost us     and Sunday night cost us         
P => GREAT Location and GREAT HOTEL We stayed at Imperial Palace from ober          ember          This was our first trip to Las Vegas and we couldn t have asked for a better location on the strip  It was close to everything  Turn right out of hotel and walk to the Venetian  Wynn  and Encore  Turn left and go to Flamingo  Planet Hollywood  and MGM Grand  Caesar s Palace is directly across the street and Bellagio is diagnal  The hotel staff was very friendly and always helpful  Yes the rooms are outdated  but who goes to Las Vegas to stay in their hotel room     I requested a room in the back of the hotel away from the strip so it would be quiet for bedtime and I asked for a balcony when we checked in  We were on the   th floor facing the Flamingo and it was great  You could get    pitchers of beer from the casino bar and the Dealertainers were OK  We didn t gamble very much at Imperial because we were always walking around the other hotels so we could see them  Bill s is next door with cheap food and drinks  as well as Casino Royale  Bill s has a discount ticket center which is where we bought tickets to Love by Cirque du Soleil  we paid     each for the tickets and had  th row  normal price I think is      each  so if you are looking to see a show definitely stop by there  We ate at garitaville which is super close to Imperial  but I wouldn t recommend it  The food is overpriced and wasn t that great  We had lunch at Noodles in the Bellagio  awesome  and dinner one night at BLT Burger in The Mirage  the best burger I have EVER had   The monorail stops at Imperial Harrah s so that was convenient for getting around  We NEVER had a problem with the elevators  Most of the time we walked right up to it  hit up or down  and it opened right up  Seriously  this is a great hotel for the price and in a fabulous location  When we do go back to Vegas  we ll be staying here again definitely  Hope you have a wonderful trip  
P =>  Cheap hotel  cheap clientele  Don t expect much  We stayed at the IP         nd        Now I read the reviews and kind of knew what to expect  I was expecting a crappy Motel   and that is more or less what we got  At least the room was more or less clean  We arrived at   am so I just checked the bed for clean sheets and bedbugs and crashed   There were no bugs by the way   In the morning I saw some of the issues with the room  The patio door was very hard to open and close  Stained curtains  Tiny tube TV  No safe  The bathroom was worn and pretty clean though the wallpaper was coming off and there was mold on the top edge of the tub and shower surround  Who knew mold could grow there   There was no lid on the toilet seat either  odd  The room is quite small and the bathroom is also very small  Everything about this place is cheap though  Even the ice buckets are not regular ice buckets  but a cheap plastic bucket printed with the logo  There is not even a pen in the room  you get a tiny golf pencil to write with  Even the toilet paper is the absolute cheapest stuff available  The Bellagio and every other hotel had better TP in their public restrooms  So if you want a cheap place in a good location mid strip the IP is going to be fine for you  I would not stay here again unless I absolutely had to  We had some noise issues with our neighbors on Fri and Sat nights  I was expecting it though when on Fri and Sat I saw lots of college students and    somethings checking in  Their main luggage seemed to consist of cases of beer and beer bongs  So I knew we d better stay up late cause it would be loud  And it was  We did not eat at the IP at all and I don t think any of the places are good  You can find better food at other nearby casinos that is better and similarly priced  I m not sure when this place will be torn down or remodeled but it won t be soon enough  Even the Flamingo next door is a lot nicer for only a few bucks more per night  
P => Very Loud The rooms are very ok at best  You can hear everyone walking in the hallway at all hours of the day and night  and you would think there are no walls in your room as loud as the music sounded  
P =>  A Good trip with a Reasonable and Good Hotel My husband and I  and his brother and sister in law drove down to Vegas at the end of tember for a   day getaway  It was her first trip to Vegas  his second and our   th  We hadn t stayed at the Imperial for close to    years and were concerned after reading some of the reviews  But I couldn t pass up a     a night deluxe room in the middle of the strip  And I am glad I didn t  Great location  excellent service  a drippy faucet fixed after just a quick mention to housekeeping  and a clean  large room at a wonderful price  Sure the Imperial doesn t have the grandeur of some of the other hotels  but we weren t looking for a place where we were afraid to leave a fingerprint  We wanted a good pool  a central location  clean rooms and a decent price  We ll be back  
P =>   This is a great hotel for the value and location  We stayed for   nights            and     Staff was very friendly at check in and the wait in line was not bad for a Friday night  Our room was very comfortable  everything was clean  the bed was comfortable  and the air conditioner worked great  The cleaning staff was very friendly and would always smile and talk to us in the halls  The casino was nice and it was an easy walk to other casinos on the strip   Location was perfect  When we plan our next trip we will definately consider staying at the Imperial Palace  
P =>   Think twice I would like to start off with the positives The staff was great  Dear lord  the buffet was fabulous  I would have to say that having   plates of crab legs alone suggests how much I enjoyed the buffet         is the correct price and not        as displayed all throughout the hotel   Being located in the strip was definitely a perk  We were only steps away from the club scene that way the walk back wasn t so bad   Yikes and now for the bad and the ugly   Immediately after arriving in a room it only took a few minutes to notice the bites on my feet and legs  Both my friend and I sat on the bed and felt a sudden rush if itching  We went into the light and saw tons of bug bites    We asked to have our sheets changed which they immediately were only to have the same thing happen with the new sheets  Ridiculous I tell you  Six torturous days until our return home  Whatever it was that was biting us came home with us  After further investigation our home has now been dianosed with a bed bug infestation  Look it up  They are blood feeding bugs that are easily harbored by clothes  suitcases  etc  I can only speculate where the infestation came from     I wouldn t suggest staying at this hotel  Definitely a place to eat at    
P =>   Best place in Vegas to stay bar none     I cannot believe some people s reviews of my favourite hotel casino in Vegas  OK the place is only a   star but it s a GREAT   star   The atmosphere in this casino is THEE best of ANY casino in Vegas  I have taken numerous friends to this place and they all love it  The Dealertainers  the poker room  the buffet  the music they play all the time  the bars  the cocktails   this place is absolutely brilliant  I will be there again in   weeks time for my  th visit in   years  I cannot recommend this place highly enough if you want to have a good time and not complain about the  quot chipped paintwork in your room quot    Jeez  how long do you spend in your room    minutes unless your some decrepit old fud  This place is THEE best casino in Vegas for havin  the crack    That s fun to you yanks   
P =>   Perfect for the price  If you are looking for somewhere that is cheap  not too basic but not shabby  this is the place  Rooms were fairly large  the only downside is the lifts take forever  but there are lifts at the back of the hotel that nobody uses if you dont mind a little walk  but for value for money  its probably the best place to stay  maybe not ideal for familys or couples  but for a group of lads out to have a good time and save money on sleeping  this is the place to go  
P =>   Showing its age A great location on the  quot Strip quot   Facility is aging but adequate and reasonably priced  Like all of Vegas  however  food prices are getting higher with poor service and miserable gaming odds  The cafe serves a great pastery the  quot Bearclaw quot   Don t miss it Seems like Vegas has become too big and too crowded with very little value for your money  Where is the next  quot Old Vegas quot   
P =>   Cheap but ent The Imperial Palace is definitely no place to write home about  but the rooms are incredibly inexpensive and you cannot beat the location  The staff was friendly and honest  We wouldn t recommend the buffet  however  If you re a  no frills  type and like to save some dough  this place is for you  
P =>   Great location and price but a little rundown Stayed here because the price was fantastic  Bed was very comfortable and clean  but the toilet was a little rundown and there were dubious stains in the bathtub  No problems with the lift  but yes  like the other reviewers we got lost looking for our room for the first   days  We got a room facing the pool  so no problems with noise from The Strip Location is absolutely fantastic  various types of food outlets  shopping and even a car rental stall all within      mins of walking  Monorail station right at the backdoor too  There was NO in room safe  so we had to lug our laptop with us to the Grand Canyon  Front Desk staff were all very helpful  
P =>   Jewel in the rough  True the rooms aren t that big but it has heart and soul  Had a wonderful time  Will be returning in        Great rates  great location  no problems  Most people when they come to Vegas  really  honestly  just how much time do you spend in your room  I have stayed at other casinos with higher star ratings and had worse rooms for more money  
P =>   Read for a true review   Stay away A request for a room close to the elevators for a handicapped guest who has difficulty walking leads to a room assignment of the LAST room at the end of the hallway  the furthest away from the bank of elevators  Wallpaper peeling off the wall Dirty carpets Worn furniture and bedding A bathroom sink so worn the enamel is almost none existent A bathroom tub that takes almost an hour to drain after a shower A bathroom tub that drains to well from the floor above into a guest room across the hallway at      A M    check your records on         creating a disturbance to all guest as shop vacs and workers endeavored to clean up the mess   The later explanation given by one of your supervisors  according to his name tag  was that the  Oriental  people use the bathtubs to do laundry and that they left the water running  Hence the name Imperial Palace I guess  Noise   Noise   Noise   Noise  Only   elevators that run about as fast as dirt   leading to guests waiting    to    abreast and    to    deep and pushing and shoving when a car finally arrives at the casino level  People wedging open fire doors to stairways with room towels rather than waiting for these elevatorsA blinking message light on the phone in the room leads to a message stating that there are no messages in your  Meridian  voicemail   There were however    long stem roses for an   th birthday celebration that were never delivered that this message was supposed to refer to  Only when the sender called and asked about his gift  were we made aware that your staff had tossed a package clearly marked FTD live flowers into the  back room  and they would send someone to look for it A parking garage that requires a GPS system to reach   up   down  elevators and escalators and a   minute hike   ridiculous  Being propositioned by hookers in your shopping areaWatching your security guards escort one of these  ladies  off the premises as another one  tossed out not    minutes before walks right past them and back into the hotel     Check your security log at   A M on       
P =>   If you need cheap it s a good clean one  older style hotel  clean rooms and casino is alright  nightlife is limited and it a little ways off the stip so you need to do some walking to get to anywhere good  you get what you pay for and at least this one is clean  
P =>   Great stay for the     The hotel was very nice  taking the cost into consideration  We were looking for a nice  clean place to rest at night  We got that and much more  The room  while small  served our needs very nicely  We heard no noise from the strip or the casino below and the A C functioned just fine  RE  Hotel Casino Staff  My wife dropped a small coin purse of some sentimental value with her TR card and a small amount of cash in it in the casino  While we had pretty much written off the hope of finding it again  especially w     in it  we were about to head out to the shuttle pick up area when we heard a page for my wife to return to the security booth  A staff member had located the purse and turned it in to security  Still had the card and the cash in it    A perfect end to a fantastic trip    
P =>   Rooms that are an incredible value that are located at the center of the Strip  My husband and I stayed at the Imperial Palace  IP  ober         It was our second stay at the IP within   months and we are very pleased with it and will certainly stay there again  Our room this time had been remodeled and was always very clean with a comfortable bed  The IP is located in the center of the strip which is close to the Venetian  Mirage  Caesars  the Flamingo  Harrahs  etc  The food choices at the IP are not great but just go out the door and you are just steps away from many wonderful restaurants and great shopping  We use the money that we save by staying at the IP to see the shows and eat at the better restaurants in Vegas  This is Vegas     we are always out on the town and are only in our hotel room to sleep  Believe me  it is an incredible value  
P =>   Underated Harrahs property Good central location to stay while you are in Vegas  The rooms are not that big but they were upkept quite well  I would stay here again if anything for the nice location near Caesars and the Mirage  
P =>   Needs to be updated  Imperial Palace is in a great location  but the rooms are totally out dated  the pool is nice too  but in ober the sun dont shine on the pool for very long  I dont think I would stay there again  
P =>   Fantastic    Don t let other reviews sway you  Booked this trip  trying to save a little money and still be in the middle of things on the strip  This hotel is quite a jewel      excellant location  great price  and very clean    Our room was on the   th floor of the tower and it was just perfect  We never had a problem with the tub backing up  or the toilet not working as stated in some of the other reviews  The staff was very helpful and friendly I would definitely stay here again  Check in was also easy no lines at all  So dont let the bad reviews keep you away it is a good clean place to stay without spending a fortune    
P =>   Great Place Had read reviews and were not sure about staying at the IP  We loved the place  Its located in the middle of the strip and close to everything  Will stay again  
P =>   Great value on the strip The hotel is conveniently on the center of Las Vegas strip with monorail service and a shuttle bus service from the airport for only          This is a great hotel if you are on a budget with clean rooms and prompt service  I stayed on the   th floor         with double queen size beds  There was no view from this side  just to let you know  The non smoking room was great  They also have smoking rooms There is also a pool and jacuzzi open  am  pm and the jacuzzi i think is    hours  but the pool area is open for sun bathing all day  The weather there was an average of    degrees celsius  You go through the casino lobby to get through to your room  it s always smoky and loud  I checked out the show  Cirque du Soleil  La Reve at Wynn Hotel  Third row seat for      Great show  not to be missed  Check out the Caesar s Palace Hotel mall right across Imperial Palace  You must go through different hotels  even just to check it out  You can use the monorail to take you around quickly and it costs     for the whole day  The Grand Canyon is worth the trip to Vegas alone  Although  I went to a much smaller version of that in Red Rock  I think it s about    to get in  Really great if you have kids because the hike is not strenuous  I stayed at the hotel with my bro  and my cousin  We re in our mid    s  Las Vegas is great with the right people to go with  of course  But there s something in it for everyone alike  Have fun  
P =>   Better then we expected After reading other reviews we were a little uneasy about our decision to stay here  but for the price we decided to stay with it and we are so glad that we did  When we arrived and checked in we were offered an upgrade to a suite with a huge tub  We took it and could not have been happier  The staff was helpful and friendly  I have seen many complaints about the elevator but we had no trouble at all during our stay  The rooms were a little outdated however they were clean and the bed was comfortable  We were on the side of the building so the music from the stage was not a problem at all  The location is perfect and with the monorail station in the hotel you can get almost anywhere on the strip fast  The shopping in the hotel is some what limited but there are so many choices nearby  The casino was smaller and much less intimidating then some of the others we visited  We did visit the buffet once and were not very impressed but again with so many other choices it was not a huge drawback  We will be staying at the Imperial Palace the next time that we visit and we can t wait  We also had friends join us who were able to book a room at the last second and were also extremely pleased  If you are looking for a great deal and a very decent place to stay this is a good bet  if you are looking for one of the big resorts keep looking and be willing to pay for it  
P =>   Not the classiest of hotels but very central and great entertainment Stayed   th t to  th oct Although this is not the classiest of hotels in vegas  it is right in the middle of the strip so less walking for you to do dependent which side of the strip you want to go And the hotel does have a nice atmosphere with its Dealertainers   ie the croupiers will get up and sing   some mime  badly  but others are really quite good  Can be a bit loud at times especially in the morning when wake up after a few drinks Have to say the rooms although basic were kept very clean and no matter what time of day I left my room when I cam back it would have been cleaned and new towels etc been replaced  Try not to get a room outside the car park though as every now and again the car alarms would go off  not sure why that may be   Drinks in this hotel also seem to be a lot cheaper  For example   Vodka and Tonics would cost you     in the Imperial Palace but other hotels in excess of     Overall a good trip  If you want to go to Vegas on a budget then this is the place for you  but if you like a bit more of the creature comforts in life then perhaps try Ceasers palace of Mandalay Bay The Hotel   very very nice     Croupiers are very friendly and you can have a laugh and a joke with them while you 
P =>   OK for the price and location The Imperial is centrally located in the middle of the strip s action The price is reasonable It is dated and a little  quot frumpy and frayed quot  Definitely has a  quot funk quot  factor The layout is very confusing  you can t get there from here  and the staff doesn t really help  It seems that the staffers always leave out one crucial piece of information that just leads to more confusion  My room was a  quot deluxe  quot  that supposedly had a king bed  balcony and a hot tub The king was more like a queen  the balcony was a  quot juliet quot   you could stand  but no room for a chair and the hot tub was simply a big tub w  no jets The room was clean quiet  roomy lots of towels  and everything worked The pool was nice  but they blared music at top volume all the time If you can work out a good  price deal at one of the nicer hotels on the strip  than do so  but if you can t  the Imperial is a reasonably priced alternative  
P =>   Good for the money Outstanding Location   centrally located  If you re looking to do Vegas on the cheap  then this is a great spot  If you want the glitz and and outstanding service of some nicer hotels then don t come here  Great Value  the rooms are nothing special  the elevators aren t great  it s not very big  but the price is right  The rooms probably haven t updated in a long  long time  If room looks are important to you don t come here  We had a wall heater AC  If you re just dropping off your bags and you re gone then why not  
P =>   love that i can find the elevator  i like the intimacy of this hotel  it is easy to get to your room and back out onto the greatest part of the strip  great location  and we always seem to win at this little hotel  prefer it to larger and fancier places across the street  
P =>  Love it How can you go wrong  Center of the strip      rooms  clean room and bath  clean hallways etc   good maid service  clean towels  large room with balcony  fun casino with    tables  entertainment day and night  dealer tainers  pool with barbecue and drinks  My  rd time here  wont be my last  Their coupon book at check in is one of the best  coupons for all the harrah properties  
P =>  Fun exciting time Location is great for a fun  exciting time  Helpful staff and great time for us  Would go again  
P => Perfectly pleasant hotel and casino located in a great location The Imperial Palace has not been able to keep up with the grand hotels on the strip in regards to opulance  However  we found the hotel to be very clean  the rooms spacious  and the staff extremely friendly and accomodating  In addition  the location is perfect  surrounded by the likes of the Mirage  Caesars  Bellagio  Bally s   Paris   and Planet Hollywood all within an easy walk  The price for the location was a deal  
P =>  Great value in a great location While the Imperial Palace is far from the fanciest hotel on the Strip  it cannot be beat for price or location  If all you need is a clean hotel room  How much time are you really spending in your room on a trip to Vegas anyway    the Imperial Palace is a great option  It s located near the center of the Strip right across from Caesar s Palace  The Forum Shops are a five minute walk away  Also  the hotel has several restaurants  including a buffet and a    hour diner  as well as celebrity impersonator  quot Dealer tainers quot  that make a walk through the casino enjoyable I have stayed at the Imperial Palace twice now  and I would do so again  Between the location and the price  it makes for a great home base during a trip to Las Vegas  
P => Worth the money We stayed at Imperial Palace and got married in their chapel and we were pleased with everything  The rooms were clean and the hotel was centrally located  
P =>  Cheap  We stayed at the Imperial Palace because it was  by far  the least expensive hotel on the strip that we could find  It was a relatively no frills hotel but it was right in the heart of all the action on the Vegas strip  The rooms were clean and nice  though a little on the plain side  In general the hotel is a bit outdated and the crowd is on the older side  We went to the buffet but were not at all impressed  However  the location just could not be beat  So while I wouldn t hang out there  or eat there  I would absolutely stay there again  
P =>  Nice Inexpensive Place To Stay This hotel is in a perfect location right in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip  It s older than most of the Strip hotels and lacks the glitz of most of the other hotels  However  the rooms are very inexpensive  I ve stayed there a couple of times and the room was clean and reasonably comfortable  For the budget minded traveler this is definitely a great deal  
P =>  Perfect location The IP is located right in the middle of the Las Vegas strip    the location could not be better  The check in line was a bit long  but worth the wait for the price  The room was about average  nothing fancy and the room service was great  The pool area was nice and there was a waitress walking around taking drink orders  This was the perfect location for us to walk to the shows and other bars  Bill s Bar and Saloon is right down the road and has      margaritas     Coors light cans and    minimum black jack tables  We will definitely stay here again  
P =>  Great Location and Price just got back from Vegas for my   st birthday and stayed at the Imperial Palace  I read the reviews before I left and was a little worried  Well I must say that I would recommend this hotel to others and will stay here again  We stayed in a king deluxe room that over looked the strip  I was told at check in that there might be noise because it overlooked the strip  The noise did not bother me at all  The room was nice and clean  A few things I missed were a microwave and in room coffee and refrigerator but for the most part the room was a great bargin for the two nights I was there  Remember folks you get what you pay for          
P =>  Not bad not great If you want somewhere in the middle of the strip for a reasonable price  this is probably the place  It s not fancy  far from it actually  The people at the front desk were very kind and helpful  The room was dated  and not the cleanest  The water backed up in the tub when I took a shower  It took about    minutes for it to drain  I was in Vegas for a wedding  it was a really quick trip  over and back in less tan    hours  So this hotel served it s purpose  I was only in the room a total of   hours  If I were going to stay longer  this isn t the hotel I would probably choose  
P =>  It seemed like a good idea at the time  I was travelling alone to a wedding in Las Vegas  decided on the Imperial Palace as it was central and reasonably priced  but thankfully didn t book a really really cheap room in the annex  On arrival  after a    hour journey and expecting a haven I encountered bedlam  The noise at reception is unbelievable   slot machines and drunks competing as to who can be loudest  After being herded  a la Disney  I had to communicate in sign language with a bored receptionist  was sent to the wrong lift and had to return to the ground floor still with bags as no porters were in evidence and start again  The room was clean  ish  but dingy although it did have everything I needed  If you like being a patient sardine this is the hotel for you  the lifts are slow  small and infrequent  If I had not been so worn out I would have looked elsewhere  The wifi is expensive and unreliable  room service slow and not cheap  the shops are tatty and not cheap and Bettys Diner i e the place where you will eventually be able to buy a sad overpriced sandwich is erm  interesting  If you want a bed to crash out on  fine  If you want peace and to feel vaguely safe  avoid  It was still worth it though to be at my nieces wedding at the Bellagio  Now  there is a hotel and a half          I described the hotel in an e mail tomy husband as  chav central attends a trailer trash convention   Nuff said  
P => customer service is supreme at the IP Our group of    stayed at the Imperial Palace from         thru          We had no trouble with check in  the elevator s  or cleanliness of the room s  Everyone was sofriendly and willing to go the extra mile to make our stay a pleasure  Will return for another stay in the spring  
P =>  Average and Tough to Contrast The most important thing you need to keep in mind  there s a reason the Imperial Palace is usually the best most affordable deal in Las Vegas  It s one of the older hotels on the strip and not really all that old when you think about it  it s just that hotels on the strip have an average lifespan of between    and    years First of all  no one goes to Las Vegas to spend a significant amount of time in their room unless they re passed out or drunk  If you are you re going for the wrong reasons  Is it nice to have a luxurious hotel room waiting for you to get out of the scorching hot desert atmosphere  Of course  but all you really need is a reliable base of opperations and you re set  The Imperial is perfect for this  Now its pointless to compare the Imperial to all the glamorous hotels surrounding it  It s obviously not going to stack up  but you get what you pay for  In this case its a sensible room with reliable air conditioning and the perfect location   dead center of the strip  The lobby is dingy  the decor out dated and the rooms are par at best but enjoy it  That is unless you feel like paying double the price for a room you ll hardly spend any time in  
P =>  Great Stay  Like most reviews I have read about the Imperial Palace  I do agree that some updating is needed   carpet in particular  Our room was quite nice overlooking the pool  The carpet was a bit stained  but overall  the room was neat and clean and we found everything in working order  The hotel staff was very accommodating and room service  which we had twice  was very prompt and the food was quite good  We ate at several of the restaurants in the hotel and all were equally as good  We had also read about problems with the elevators  but we found no problem with them at all  The location  to say the least  is fabulous  I have stayed at this hotel several times in the past and have always had a positive experience  This time was no exception  A great value   great service   great location   we couldn t have asked for more  
P =>  The most average hotel on the strip I would describe the IP as the most average of hotels   its not the Bellagio and at the other extreme its not Circus Circus Room had dated decor but the linen towels were changed regularly  the carper wasn t always vacuumed when the room was cleaned  The hotel corridors were very noisy at night  but then again this is Vegas and people come and go      The casino offered lower   minimum stakes than some casinos  the restaurants were pretty average  Nothing bad to say about it  likewise nothing that good either except its very central     dollar trick didn t work  
P =>   Im a fan of Imperial Palace Considering the location and price of Imperial Palace  Im not bothered with the mould in the bathroom or the stains on the floor  the staff were friendly and helped us out on finding cheap attractions in and around las vegas  Shot Imperial Palace  
P =>   Worst experience in my many stays in Las Vegas We have stayed in at least Ten      Casinos in Las Vegas  at least twice at the Imperial Palace since       and this was our worst experience  Made complimentary room reservations months in advance requesting two Queen size beds  At check in I again requested Queen size beds  Was informed at check in of a     processing fee on the FREE rooms  Assigned a room and found two double beds in room  Complained by phone  and was told Queen beds would be an additional     per night  Went down and complained in person about no notification in advance of any additional charges or room bed size costs   amp  after desk clerk talked to a supervisor was give a room with queen beds at no additional charge for this visit  My wife and daughter were trapped in an elevator because the doors would not open  Other elevators broke down at least twice during our three day stay  and the elevators were very slow  On every trip in the elevators the conversations included comments about the elevators  and at least three     times I heard persons say that they would never stay at the Imperial Palace again  and my wife said she did not ever want to stay there again either  We have stayed at other Harrahs Casinos   amp  other hotels on the strip  amp  Fremont st   amp  were always informed in advance of any additional charges for requested services or items  And we have never had to pay a Processing Fee for Complimentary rooms or an additional charge for queen beds  My brother checked in at the Imperial Palace the same day I did for his Complimentary room  amp  was not charged a processing fee  
P =>   Good deal   if you re on the move Location was great  right in the middle of the strip  I was in for my brother s wedding which was across the street at Caesar s  The room wasn t the best but didn t spend too much time there and didn t spend too much money on the room  There are little decks in the rooms lookings out to the pool which was nice  The pool was ok but you start losing the sun around    People were friendly  
P =>   Vegas on the cheap I was prepared for the worst when I booked the rooms for my latest Vegas trip at the Imperial  The Imperial didn t disappoint  Let s just say that if you are looking for a really cheap place to stay and don t mind grime  rust  stink and a bad view   the Imperial is for you  You can tell that they haven t done much with this place in the last few decades  The lobby is decent but decency ends there  The rooms were cramped  dank and really showed their age  I would place the Imperial a few pegs down from a Motel    All that being said  I would still recommend this hotel  It s a great option if you want to go to Vegas  be located in a great spot and save some money on lodging for the tables and booze  There is a decent dance club between the hotel entrance and street that is small but fun  Overall a good place to stay on the cheap  
P =>   Quit yer gripin   You get what you pay for  always have always will  IP was a great location and nothing close to the bad reviews seen here  It is what it is  a convenient location and what I liken to mildly lower grade LaQuinta  The elevators were no problem  And we were told it was one of their busiest days  It took a grand total of    minutes to check in  Since they were completely booked  we received breakfast for free  Our room was nice except we were directly over the bar  It was loud  but not that loud  We had played so much during the day that we fell right asleep and never noticed the crappy DJ  The rooms were adequate  clean  and the beds were very comfortable  Pillows were the only draw back  I called for extras and   hours later called again  We had not received enough for each bed  They immediately brought   pillows and   bath towels and apologized profusely  Hey  good enough for me If you want a little more  quot swank quot  to your hotel  spend the extra     a night and go to Monte Carlo  It s nicer  the rooms are bigger  but it s still the same room ran by the same group of people and that includes Bellagio and MGM One thing to the IP General Manager   your Entertainment Dealers look nothing like who their impersonating and putting them on a stage in the middle of the poker room with a sound track to lip synch is old and tired  There was one girl who was supposed to be Celine Dion  but she was black and had short hair  Really  spend the extra    per hour and get better side show folks One caveat   the luau dinner  It was WONDERFUL  We had the best time and met the dancers after the show  Talked with the girls in the ladies  room and they were so sweet  The food was adequate  but the crab legs  mussels  and crawfish were abundant  The Mai Tai s were cute and sweet  The creme  brulee  sucked  but it came in a cupcake wrapper so what should I have expected  The show was fun  though Stay here if you re ok with middle class travel  If you like higher middle class  don t  I ve stayed at many places and this is second time at IP  I ll stay again     They didn t have a spa opening  so they sent us to Harrah s for the same price  Harrah s spa is MUCH nicer  
P =>   Perfect Location  Imperial Palace may not be the fanciest of hotels on the Las Vegas strip  but it scores top marks for value  We stayed here for   nights  in a room located on the   th floor  Yes  it s very basic  but what do you expect for     a night   We were very pleased with the standard of our room   clean  spacious and comfortable  The TV and ironing facilities were a bonus too  The hotel itself had little to complain about  The pool area was clean and there were plenty of sun loungers and towels available for the guests  The staff were very friendly and helpful  The lifts were a pain  they take forever   take the stairs if you re only a few floors up     but I m sure many of the big hotels have this problem  Other than that  I really can t think of anything bad to say about it  I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting good value for money  It s the perfect place for budget travelers  or for those who just want to save their money to spend on the good things in Vegas  like cocktails and fancy meals  
P =>   Probably the cheapest on the strip but i d still go elsewhere First off  the rooms were fine  Pretty standard  but it was clean and nice enough  When we checked in  we were told they didn t have a double bed room for us  so we stayed in a king size for one day  The view was great  and one night sharing a bed with a friend wasn t a big deal  We then moved to a lower floor  where the rooms faced the  quot ugly quot  side  If i had thought of it  i would have asked about keeping the good view  and a smoking room  Anyway  it took me a few days to figure out the layout of the hotel  Depending on your room number  if you get on the wrong elevator you ll be walking for a long time  Certain elevators only go to rooms and others only go to the salon and stuff  The restaurants are beside the front desk  up an escalator  The wait times for the elevator are crazy long  I ve read alot of reviews about staying in the tower as opposed to the older rooms  and that s absolutely true  They are new and much nicer  The pool was nothing special  i would have liked it to have been more  I did like how the hotel was in the middle of the strip however Onto the salon  I would recomend you not wasting your time or money with this place  I called to make an appointment a few weeks before my stay  and was told i could have a triple barrel curling iron style  When i got to the appointment however  i was told that they do not have the iron for that and  quot we re the only two here  so no one would have told you that quot  I don t think calling your customer a liar is a good way to start off  But since i already booked the appointment  i would have had to pay even if i cancelled  It was also quite expensive  She didn t wash my hair  and it was    dollars to dry style it  Needless to say  the style didn t stay and i could have done a much better job by myself  Walking through the other hotels  i saw their casinos seemed more spacious  and most seemed more updated  I didn t think the breakfast place was very good  as all they had were basics  The flamingo just down the street had many more options  or there s a denny s and mcdonalds also down the road  The whole trip was very cheap  and for the money it was a good deal  Next time i go  i will be staying elsewhere  just because it seems for a little more money i get alot more bang  Some things i noticed about vegas itself were the deuce  It was    bucks for a   days pass  and i found it to be very worthwhile  This bus will take you up and down the strip  freemont street and to this wicked outlet mall with a transfer  You get on the     after to go to the mall  I would definitely reccomend the outlet mall  i found some really awesome deals  Freemont street is the best place for souvenirs  They have shot glasses  ashtrays  cups  pretty much anything you want for a dollar  There are people on the street that sell club passes  and they usually want a    dollar tip  I didn t end up using mine  but i found a great place i loved with no cover  They are part of harrah s  when you walk down a windy road with little kiosks and it s a circle bar  They do need your passport if your not from the states though  I got a showtime shuttle pass from the airport  although i found this specific company to be sub par  I would wait until i got off the plane and buy a ticket from one of the other companies  Overall  i had a fabulous time in vegas  You really can t go wrong with drinking  shopping and seeing the sights  
P =>   Brilliant location  We stayed at the Imperial Palace for a week and although we were a little disappointed when we arrived  after looking up all the big hotels before we went   for the price we paid it was well worth it  The hotel is in need of a refit but its clean and tidy and the staff were very good  The room was large and of course it had air con  It could have done with a fridge to keep our bottled water chilled but we managed OK with the ice bucket provided  The bathroom was small and you had to shut the door and stride over the toilet to get into the shower but once in the shower was hot and very powerful  They also provided shampoo  conditioner and soap  The pool was nice  a real sun trap in the morning and early afternoon but as the sun moved around it did end up in the shade  The casino was always packed and full of the usual games you would expect The location was perfect  right across the road from Caesars Palace  amp  Bellagio and about a   min walk from Venetian so we didn t actually spend much time at the hotel We tried the Burger Palace one afternoon and it was OK  We also tried to get a Pizza  Pizza Palace   but it was closed  The Chinese Korean Japanese place was open    hours but we didn t try it  The monorail was right outside too  so we used that to get to the Stratosphere at the other end of the strip There was also a car museum but we didn t get a chance to visit it All in all  the hotel interior could be better but its so cheap and if you using it like we did  simply for a bed for the night then its great value  
P =>   Imperial Palace is always my choice I stayed at Imperial Palace for   nights in ch and   nights again in tember  The location is the greatest  my room was extremely clean  I was treated great by the staff and I will stay here again on my next trip which will be soon OK so the sink and shower drained slowly  I can live with that  The water didn t stand after you turned it off  it simply drained slowly  The commode flushed normally  I don t like the buffet there and think it is overpriced even with the    off coupon  but most all Vegas buffets are pretty terrible I got an unbelievable deal there by using my Harrah s Total Reward card number and booking it at the Harrah s web site I can t get over the negative things that are said about Imperial Palace in the reviews  I think that a lot of people just look for the smallest thing to complain about and others are pure and simple snobs  It doesn t really matter  I can truthfully say that after several stays there I don t have any complaints  maybe because I didn t go to Vegas to stay in a hotel room Another thing I enjoy is that right next door at Oshea s there s a Burger King  which is great for breakfast and very good cheap coffee  and a Subway I give Imperial Palace two thumbs up  
P =>   VALUE AND LOCATION ARE GREAT this spot has the best location right in the middle of the strip  room was clean and good size and casino was pumping all week  sure its not the bellagio but for what i paid i would stay there anytime  staff were helpful and friendly  definately a good spot for any  seeking the heart of the action  
P =>   The Imperial Whatever I stayed at the imperial Palace for business and the hotel was more like a motel  It was Imperial alright but NO palace  The rooms were bare and dirty  The carpets were stained  Paints peeling and stinky rooms  The hotel is like a maze and it took forever to get to places  I ate at the Ginseng restaurant at the food was horrible  My room was pre paid for   nights    I stayed the night my flight came in and transferred to another hotel  I don t mind loosing the       dollars    it was worth every penny checking out of the hotel  
P =>  Location Location Location The Imperial Palace may be one of the more run down hotels on the Strip but its prices do reflex this and it absolutely cannot be beaten on location  The rooms were fine for what we needed  a place to sleep and to get changed etc   and were clean  I was really surprised at the shower pressure  it was amazing for being in a big hotel in the middle of the desert  The staff were great and helped quickly and efficiently with any queries we had  Never had to wait long for the elevators  the casino and pool were both fine but with the rest of the strip being so accessible I would recommend this for people using their hotel simply as somewhere to sleep  
P =>  Nice hotel for a great price When i started reading reviews on this hotel it had me a little worried that it wouldnt be nice  I stayed there for   nights and loved the hotel  We had a pretty fast checkin and the lady gave us directions to the room  When we checked out the room we were throughly impressed it was a pretty nice room especially for the price it was a deluxe room on the  th floor  We had no problems at all the room was clean the shower drained fast the maid always did a nice job  The elevators were pretty slow on the weekend but the rest of the time wasnt too bad  We were on a non smoking floor and it didnt smell at all of smoke and it was quiet too  I also love the location of the hotel too right in the middle of everything  We also ate at the burger bar restraunt that the hotel has it has nice food and great pizza ate there a few times because of the convenience and good food  I would love to stay here again if i ever came back  
P =>  You get what you pay for great location  but as most people should understand  you get what you pay for  I stayed here during my second visit to Vegas  the first time was with a friend living here   The rooms are decent  but being an older hotel  you can still smell the smoke that has saturated most of the room C mon  you re in Vegas    you shouldn t be spending time in your room anyways I probably wouldn t stay here again  but I would recommend it to people who are very cost conscious and still want to be where the action is  it is smack dab in the middle of the strip   
P =>  I would stay again but would try other Harrah s properties first I was able to get this room complimentary as I am a Total Rewards member  I was leery at first as I read many of the comments here  but I decided to take a chance The Imperial Palace is good for someone who is on a budget or is looking for no frills  The hotel is older and you can tell no improvements have been made recently I arrived at the hotel around    am  The check in process was a little time consuming  as the line was long and there were only four Guest Services Representatives  When I had the opportunity to check in  the representative confirmed my complimentary room as well as gave me discounts for sister properties  Harrah s  Bally s  Cesaers Palace  Flamingo  Rio Suites  and Paris  As everyone else has mentioned  elevators are SLOW  After a day  I became accustomed to calling my direction at both sets of elevators and then going with the one that came first The Deluxe Room was big  but could have used more furniture  maybe a sofa bed instead of table and chairs   My room had an indirect view of Cesaers Palace  but a direct view of the parking lot  If possible  ask for a room with a poool view  good for people watching  The bathroom was clean  although the drain did not flow as fast as I would  In addition  the shower would start even before you pulled the gauge to start it Housekeeping left enough towels not to have to replenish as it was just me  I do have one complaint  I came back to my room one day to see my bed unmade  The first time was okay because I had left my laptop on the bed  Housekeeping cannot touch your personal property  therefore the bed was unmade  I removed my laptop  called Housekeeping  and informed the telephone representative that I would like to have my bed made  They never came that night While at the hotel  I ate at Burger Palace  Ginseng    and the Emperor s Buffet  Burger Palace offers a     pound cheeseburger combo  burger  fries  and drink  for    XX  While I know I should have not eaten eight ounces of beef  it did fill me up  especially since I had not eaten since   am EST  Ginseng   is the    hours restaurant serving Chinese  Japanese  and Korean food  The sushi was AMAZING  Spicy Tuna rolls   and I asked for a second order  I ate at the Emperor s Buffet for breakfast the day of my departure  The cost was about     and you can tell that the buffet catered to the late night partiers and the early risers  Some of the selections included eggs  pancakes  fried chicken  rice  and cake The casino is small in my opinion  although the hotel has dealers who are impersonators  Sometimes these impersonators would perform on a mini stage  I went during Michael Jackson s birthday  so there was an impersonator for him  as well as a J  Lo  Jennifer Lopez  impersonator Pool area is SMALL  The last time I came to Las Vegas I stayed at the Riviers Hotel and their pool is twice as big  to give some perspective   Get there early if you plan to go  It was nice to sit out there and get some sun I did like the fact that the Monorail that runs from the Sahara to the MGM Grand had a stop near Imperial Palace  The Monorail run    hours a day Location of Imperial Palace cannot be beat  It is across the street from Cesaers  so you are in the middle of the strip  I did express checkout since I did not have any charges to the room  so that was easy Overall  an okay stay  if I come back to Las Vegas  I will check other Harra s properties  but I will not turn my nose at the Imperial Palace  
P =>  Disappointed Great location  smack in the center of the strip  but let down by tired rooms and poor facilities  Tried the   hr Burger Bar  at  pm  which was dirty and unkempt  The food was poor and the coffee must have come from the sink We tried the Dinner Buffet once  That was enough Although the rooms were clean and tidy with maid service daily  the fixtures were showing signs of age  A lot of the silvering on the Bathroom mirror was missing  the balcony door refused to shut and the  quot Air Con quot  was the noisiest in LV They have a gimmick whereby certain dealers in the Casino are look alikes and will at random jump up onto a small podium and sing  Without doubt  quot Billy Idol quot  got the place rocking  but several of the others should stick to dealing Stayed at Circus Circus   years ago  and if we went again we d be happy to go back there  we holiday on a tight budget  At the end of the day  we only used the Hotel for somewhere to sleep  we ate  gambled and partied elsewhere in LV and had a great time  
P =>  Can t Beat the Location or the Service The hotel is an older one that could certainly use renovating but if you were like us  the room is basically a place to lay your head for a few hours  shower and get up and go all over again  We knew what to expect from recommendations from friends but were at first somewhat taken aback  Upon arrival  the room looked clean and sufficient to meet our needs  We did have a problem the first night with a backed up shower and slow flushing toilet  Front desk immediately sent someone over to take care of the problem and we were then good to go  As I am not a fan of air conditioning  we decided to open the balcony door but later learned that water bugs love humidity and found one in our room  Another call to the front desk and we were immediately moved  They were fantastic in their customer service and left us quite happy The location alone is by far the best along the strip  Convenient to everything without having to cross bridges or large intersections  Well worth the value and an enjoyable stay was had  
P =>  Great location great service great time  The location of this hotel is spot on  It s right in the middle of the strip  next to the flamingo  mirage and several other big casinos  The hotel and casino are fairly cheep and cheerful but that was fine with us  We found the staff very friendly  especially those at the bar  The  lookalike  dealers in the casino were hilarious and kept us entertained  The food at the hotel isn t great but with so many places to eat nearby  you don t need to stay there anyway  I would definitely recommend this place  We had a fantastic time  especially at the bar   and would certainly stay there again  
P =>  Good hotel great location My friend and I stayed at Imperial Palace ust        We had stayed there previously so we knew what to expect  Our check in process was no problem and Ben  at check in  was friendly and very accommodating  We asked for adjoining rooms and there was no problem  Our rooms were clean and our floor was quiet  We ate breakfast at the Emperor s Buffet   times with no complaints and the Tea Palace for one breakfast and everything was good  The  quot dealertainers quot  in the casino were fun and put on good shows  Our only  quot complaint quot  would be that the elevators were a little slow and one was not working our entire stay  If you re looking for a clean hotel with a fun casino and great location to other places  stay at the Imperial Palace  We would definitely stay there again  
P =>   This will do if you are on a Budget This is a vast hotel on the strip so cant be beaten for location  The rooms are large and clean but not fancy  We didn t gamble  teenagers  but everyone seemed happy enough on the floors  The pool is large but packed so avoid at all costs  The Emperors Buffet is simple and filling  Valet parking is cheap and efficient  A decent place at a reasonable rate  
P =>   Great Location Great People Below Average Facility For a hotel in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip  this is dissappointing Service was great  casino dealers good  except the one crap table  where one of the money guys kept hitting the die with his hand    Food choices were not good  Room was clean but basic  small TV  toilet ran a lot  shower didn t drain well   Location is the strength  it s right in the middle of the Strip  You can walk to a lot of great places like the Bellagio  Ceasar s  Harrahs     Dealertainers in casino were fun  Others  not so much  Overall you have to decide if the location and the really cheap rates are worth a crummy room    
P =>   Whats everyone complaining about  I cannot stand people who do not do research before hand then write bad reviews because it is not what they expected  This was my first time in Vegas  as long as I had a room to sleep and to put my belongings then I was happy  The hotel is awesome location  central strip and very cheap among other hotels on the strip  So why is it that people think they are staying in a   star hotel for that cheap of a price  I was very happy with the service  very happy with the location  and very satisfied for a bed and a bathroom for the price I paid  You do not come to Vegas to stay in your room and complain about the tv  get out and enjoy the city  
P =>   No frills   great location Firstly a great location   right opposite Caesars Palace on the strip  Much better placed than some of the other alternatives such as Circus Circus  Room was clean  but could have been much better  Shower tap not working properly and some cracks chips in the bathroom  Compared to one of my friends experience we had a good room  Some of the others in my group had rooms that overlooked a carpark or looked straight into a wall  whereas I got a room which overlooked the pool  Air conditioning is very noisy The biggest gripe i have about this place is the lifts  It often took up to ten fifteen minutes of waiting for the lifts and it became a joke with all the other guests staying there  So if you have any place to be to go make sure you allow for this  In summary  If you want somewhere central  thats cheap and are willing to forgo the extras then this is an okay place to stay  We spent so much time out and about that we hardly spent much time here so it worked for us  If you want some luxury and relaxation time  i would personally stay somewhere else  
P =>   Awesome Excellent customer service from front end staff  bar service quick  polite and friendly  Valet service quick and informative  Awesome room  simple and clean  Great view of the strip  Location is prime and the hotel has a simple feel to it  The size makes things easy and you can t get lost  Vegas can turn into a headache and this hotel puts your mind at ease  It was a grat place to stay and I am staying there again this year  
P =>   Great Location Great Casino Great Value  I stayed at the Imperial Palace in        and loved it  so of course when I went back this past week for the first time in   years  I decided to stay again at the Imperial Palace  After reading some less than stellar reviews  I got a bit worried  though  I m glad I went with my instinct and not with the lame reviews of the IP  This place is great  It s located in the center of the strip  the staff was great  the rooms were clean  AND CHEAP    and the casino was a blast  The Dealertainers were so much fun   play blackjack with Tony Orlando  you won t regret it  he dealt until my shuttle showed up  and if it weren t for his tips  I wouldn t walked out of there with more money than I started with   The rooms were clean  Of course they re dated  but what do I care about that  I just wanted a clean room  clean bed sheets  and clean shower  All of which were available to me  Do not believe the garbage people are saying about the Imperial Palace  Sure  there was a slight wait for elevators during peak hours  but I waited no more than   minutes for the elevator at any time  All seemed to be working to me  so I m not sure why people are still there are many out of order  My opinion  if you re young  and all you want is a clean cheap room  the Imperial Palace is the place for you  I will stay here again when I go back to Vegas   hopefully it ll be much sooner rather than later  
P =>   Hotel badly in need of renovation  I don t quite know how to describe this place  It s the trailer park of the Las Vegas Strip First of all  the positive of this place is LOCATION  You couldn t pick a better location period  But I have stayed here twice and each time has had its different miseries The entire hotel and casino in general is extremely dated and dirty  It was probably a nice place back in the    s or    s    and it honestly looks and feels as if it has had absolutely maintenance since then  You have to wait in LINES  long lines   literally  to access the main elevators  I waited once for twenty or thirty minutes  Entire place is congested period  Just checking in can instantly put you in a bad mood Bar and restaurant staff are not friendly at all  Security  card dealers and other staff members equally unhelpful and most act as if they hate their jobs  Each of IP s restaurants that I have tried have not simply been BAD  but VERY NASTY period  I sincerely hope that some day soon a better chain will purchase this place and do a floor to ceiling renovation  It sucks that the best location on the LV Strip is occupied by such a Hellhole  People say   quot it s good for a tight budget quot  or  quot it s a good     quot  hotel  I completely disagree  I have stayed cheaper at both Riviera and Treasure Island  As far as being a good  quot Sin City quot  adult establishment  it s just a judgment call  You can get anything you want anywhere on the Strip as long as you feel like walking or making a phone call I m not giving them a third chance  
P =>   Fun budget Hotel Fun and friendly  if your looking for class go elsewhere This Hotel is great if on a budget even though its allot older than others on the Strip  Central location is perfect for getting around  staff are fun and friendly  food was good  Not as stuffy as some of the bigger hotels with a relaxed atmosphere  Rooms adequate and clean but did feel a little old  Beware if your room is situated out the front of the building as we asked to be moved due to the loud music coming from a tent below which would go on all day until late at night  Once moved to the back of the hotel was lovely and quiet  also lifts can be annoying as they seem to stop on every floor  But for the price and location you couldn t ask for a cheaper hotel Also some of the surrounding Hotels are equally budget  but within a short distance of Caesars and other larger hotels  Check out Oshays    beer and the leprechaun  
P =>   Great for young people trying to save some     My boyfriend and I stayed at the Imperial Palace         The location could not better be  It is literally in the middle of the strip  An easy walk to every big casino  We arrived at the hotel at      pm and only waited      minutes to check in  It was very quick  The room was simple  but clean  I only waited twice for the elevator  but I found it quicker to walk down the stairs and only ride up the elevator to avoid the wait  We ate at two restaurants late night at the hotel  Both were ok for late night food  The casino floor was always full of a good crowd  but I never had trouble finding a seat to place a bet  I would definitely stay here again  It was very inexpensive and did not dissappoint me  
P =>   Not that bad I was VERY skeptical when we reserved this hotel in Vegas  I was sooo worried about the rooms and the things everyone was saying about it  It is true that you get what you pay for and if you want newer hotel then this is not it  It is not Caesars Palace or the Bellagio but it wasnt that bad  If somehow you end up in the back of the hotel  good luck finding the front  it is a good distance and depending on what time you come in there will be NO ONE to guide you  All in all  it wasn t that bad  We did not eat at any of the restuarants inside the hotel  simple because we were on the go the entire time  The casino was PACKED every night  It was unbearable  Im not sure if it was because of the low table limits or if it was because of the  quot dealtainers quot   they were great  They definitely keep you smiling and laughing  The check in process was a bit long but the second the line got long  there were   desk clerks that came from the back to make the check in speed up  We checked in on a Friday night around   pm and waited about    minutes  The elevators were NO problem  considering how crowded the hotel was and never once did I feel unsafe in them even when it was crowded  They came quickly when we called for them  The room was great  We had room         queens  and it was very clean and tidy  The housekeepers came and did an excellent job each day  I have only one complaint when it comes to the room  the television  It was like a    inch tube television with    channels  it          Then again  who goes to Vegas to watch television Overall this hotel wasn t that bad at all  I would definitely recommend it and I definitely would stay there again  If I ever go back there and I need an inexpensive  decent place to stay  this is it  
P =>   Don t eat there     If you are looking for the best value on the strip  than the Imperial Palace is great  It was very inexpensive for the great central location  The room had peeling wallpaper  and a constant running faucet  You definately get what you pay for the room  The elevators are definately not well planned  We averaged       minutes to get from the   th floor to the lobby  The stay was very cheap  so I suppose drawbacks are to be expected  DO NOT EAT AT THE TEAROOM             I went for a bachlorette party  and myself and the bachlorette spent most of our weekend in the drab room with what we think may be a parasite infection from the food at breakfast at the Tearoom  Aside from leaving breakfast with a racing heartbeat and shaking we spent most of the weekend sick to our stomaches in the hotel  It s   days later  and I am seeing a doctor in the morning  DO NOT EAT THERE  The hotel in general is a great value if you are on a budget  The location was perfect  so if that is what you are looking for  try a few extra bucks and make your vacation worth it at Caesars Palace across the street  And    if you do stay there      DO NOT EAT THE FOOD             and please request and extra roll of toliet paper  
P =>   Very clean great value brilliant location I stayed in the Imperial Palace for   nights a couple of weeks ago  ust      Apart from the fact that the elevators did take ages  everything else was perfect   There were   of us and each of the   rooms were extremely clean  quiet and very comfortable to stay in  Also  the hotel is in the perfect location  right in the middle of the strip  And as for the price  it was great value  What more could you ask for   I would definitely recommend this hotel  
P =>   should ve stayed at hooters room was dirty  Parking was a pain  No coffee pot in room  what s up with that  Had to have a pot sent to room       Elavators very slow  Hotel staff was great  Watch out for people selling timeshares  Met couple who s whole day was ruined dealing with timeshare company for just a free diner  Visited friend staying at Hooters  His room was clean and at a great location  
P =>   Hotel worked great for us I was hesitant to stay here after reading the reviews  but couldn t pass up the cheap rates combined with the mid strip location  This was my  th trip to Vegas so I knew location was everything  and also that I wasn t going to spend much time in my room  Our room wasn t impressive in any way  it was pretty standard but clean enough  Two beds and a  very small  balcony that overlooked the pool  We had no problems with our bathtub shower  We had an iron  as well  which worked fine  I can imagine  though  in this older  cheaper hotel the rooms vary quite a bit in cleanliness  smell  etc The best thing about the hotels is the location  right in the middle of the strip    across from Caesar s  near the Mirage  short walk to Venetian and all the others  O Shea s next door is lots of fun if you want to play beer pong or flip cup The drawbacks to the hotel  I will echo others here  are the elevators  They were extremely slow  We snuck up the stairs on more than one occasion  but the other reviewer s are right  the stairs are usually locked  The parking lot is weird but I flew in so this wasn t a problem  I would highly recommend the airport shuttle if you are arriving alone  it is cheaper than a taxi and stops at most major hotels  though it takes longer  Another thing I like is since the hotel isn t as huge as some of the others  it is easy to quickly pop back up to your room if you re walking up and down the Strip  assuming the elevators cooperate   Plus  you have impersonators at the tables and although they aren t the best  it is entertaining to see who s there  The hotel doesn t have as many amenities as the larger ones  the casino is quite basic  not a lot of dining options  the rock bar  quot club quot  in the front wasn t great  etc    but all the larger ones are close by And finally  for your night owls  our favorite thing about the Imperial Palace was the    late night breakfast special   We had this almost every night we were there       for a full breakfast  pancakes  eggs  bacon  hash browns     and it is served late at night  I can t remember the exact hours  probably     a m  or something  Great for drunk people coming back to their hotel hungry   I hope they still have it when I go back this fall  Oh  and the hotel allowed me to check my bags after checkout in a storage room  as I had a late afternoon flight  This is nice for those in my same situation  And it was free In short  if you are looking for no frills  cheap and convenient    and don t plan on spending too much time in your room or your own hotel  the Imperial Palace is a good deal  
P =>   OK but not really my kinda place I checked into the IP on friday august  th to attend a poker tourney at RIO  Check in was quick and was in my room by    am  Check in staff were polite and courteous  The room was in need of a refurb but it was clean and spacious  I noticed some things like cracks in the counter and rust stains around the drain but I am not put off by that as some people are  The room is cheap and for center of the strip no one should complain  If you require better accomadations pay better money  I found I was a little out of my element cause I am older and a bit of an early bird and I got up at   am one morning to go down to the casino and it was like a college party downstairs with more drunk    somethings and numerous fights in the casino     Oh I remember those days problem is if I did that now I d be hung over for a week   LOL and I hope I was never as embarrassing as those kids were LOL  If you only knew      I really enjoyed the casino staff   they helped make my time on the tables fun even if I was losing  The drink service was super   never once did I have to ask for a server  The one big complaint I do have is being an early bird myself I couldn t find a restaurant open in the hotel other than an all night burger joint which wasn t what I was looking for at     in the morning  The hotel is definately better suited for       year olds looking for a fun loose and cheap place to party on the strip  I don t begrudge them     maybe I am just a little jealous    LOL  Would I stay here again   probably not   but I do recommend it   for like I said   that         year old college crowd or group looking to party cheap on the strip  Rock on dude        
P =>   Their slogan says it perfectly  I am a Total Rewards member and was able to book a mid week stay at Imperial Palace through the TR site for an unbelievably low price  I knew what to expect going in   nothing fancy  and that was true  But my experience overall was very good considering the price I paid  No major problems and only a couple minor annoyances I stayed in a king bed room with a balcony and pool view  Again  nothing fancy  but everything that you need is there  The bed is fairly comfortable  there is a small    inch TV  the lighting is decent  There is a hair dryer and iron and ironing board provided in the room  Best of all  the room was quiet  Besides the room  the casino is decent but not one of my favorites on the Strip  What I ve seen other people write about the elevators is very true   an extremely long wait if you try to take the ones next to the casino  I suggest walking further down the hall toward the parking lot  I found the wait to be much shorter there  The parking garage is also a little sketchy  with dim lighting and some foul smells  Last minor complaint   the pool is only open from         I thought these were extremely limited hours  For what I paid  I would have been happy with less than what the hotel offered  I got a clean room for cheap  and the location can t be beaten  Right across from Caesar s Palace in the center of the Strip  The hotel s slogan says it perfectly    quot Good fun  Great Value  Perfect Location  quot  They know how to market themselves  It s nothing fancy  but it s a fine place to stay without spending much or having to worry about driving home  or paying a lot for a taxi ride  after a night on the Strip  
P =>   Perfect for anyone on a budget We were not expecting great things from the Imperial Palace as we paid very little for   nights here  however what a surprise to have such an awesome room  which had a balcony  two double beds  cable tv  a great bath shower  huge sink area with massive mirror  and much more  Apart from the decor being a little dated it was very clean and had everything we needed  When you walk outside you are literally opposite Caesars Palace  and so close to everything else  I am still shocked at how cheap it really was  We had a fantastic time staying here  the swimming pool is quite simple but fine for what a pool can be  They had to handle a bit of drama when I was at the pool one of the days when a guy threw some stuff from his balcony at the top as he was locked out  which actually could have caused major harm to anyone below  the security staff and pool staff dealt with this very well and quickly  The only thing they could actually improve on is the speed of the lifts  there are generally queues to go up in them Make sure you check out the impersonators in the casino  they are hilariously awful    
P =>   Not the best place to stay Centrally located on the Las Vegas Strip between Harrahs and the Flamingo  This hotel s entrance is set back from the strip and not well marked  I pulled into the parking garage which was also a bit of a maze  After completing this little habitrail experience I then had to make my way back to the hotel and casino area to find the front desk for check in  There was a massive line at check in and it seemed the entire south central LA scene was there  After     minutes I was finally able to check in  The hotel staff was friendly and accommodated my room upgrade request without any hassle whatsoever  I stayed in the King Suite  Back through the hotel again to the elevators  The elevators here are dire need of upgrading  They are old and slow and there are regularly lines of up to     mins just to wait on an elevator which would show up full  The stairs are useless  As they only let you in at any floor but you can only get out on the first floor  The room was nice and moderately appointed  The TV was a    quot  tube TV and the remote had no batteries in it which made it useless as well  The rooms spa tub was massive and could easily accommodate   of your closest friends  The sofa in the living room also pulls out into a queen sleeper  As mentioned in other reviews the water drains extremely slowly in the shower tub so even though you are in a   X   tub you re gonna end up with water around your ankles  The room service menu was missing from the rooms notebook so I had no chance to test it out  The maids here pretty much sucked  They did not clean the room even though I put the sign out  They did come in and exchange the towels but did not do ANYTHING else including make the bed  Internet service is an extra        per day that is completely unacceptable in this day and age  The pool area was nice as far as being a large rectangle surrounded by concrete  The concrete coating however was very HOT and slippery  bring sandals  The bar area at the pool had lots of drink specials and the waitresses were very nice  The club at the Imperial is called Rock Band but it certainly did not play ANY rock music  The ladies I talked with here said that the guys in the club were overly aggressive and they did not have a good time  Overall not the best and not the worst  The best part about it was the central location  
P =>  Imperial Palace We first arrived at the Imperial Palace around      pm  We had to wait about    minutes in line before being properly checked in  I thought that this was fine being that it was a Saturday and everyone was trying to get their room  We got to our non smoking room and it reeked of smoke  I dismissed the smell because the young lady at the desk said that we could do an upgrade tomorrow for free  After getting settled  my husband checked the  th    th and   th floor for ice and all the machines were out of order  I didn t want to get irritated  so I called down stairs to ask where I could get some ice  After getting the run around  the manager finally pulled some strings and had room service bring up   buckets of ice  for free  Otherwise  they were going to charge me   bucks  As far as the room  it was old but despite the smell  it looked clean  The Imperial Palace is just an old hotel all together The next day  we got our upgrade as promised and found the room was old but very nice  We had a mirror over our bed as well as a mirror over the huge Jacuzzi looking garden tube  It had a couple other nice things about the room as well  One thing that I liked about the hotel was the entertainment  They had several celebrity impersonators working as dealers at the casino and they would also do performances  My favorite was the Michael Jackson one whom really put on an excellent show  In the back of the casino area  they had a couple fast food restaurants  like Burger King or Subway  if you wanted to eat on a lower budget  Also  they had room for Beer Pong and other games  It kind of gave you a variety inside the hotel  As far as the restaurants  we didn t really get to eat inside because most of the time it was unappealing  closed or about to close  I think that the Imperial Palace is a good place to stay if you are not hung up on luxury accommodations  If you would like a nice clean place to stay and somewhere that people are having fun  try them  It s in the middle of the strip and not far from a good time  
P =>  Good price and    on the Strip  Good prices during the weekend considering you will be on the Strip in front of the Ceasar Palace  Friday Saturday prices become very high in all famous hotel nearby  It is not a recent renovated hotel  but it is clean and staff is very helpful to satisfy your needs  I ve been in Capri buildings   night  little motel inside the Imperial palace  and the room was very spacious and clean  but outside the door you have the garage and you have to walk through it to arrive inside the main hotel  btw this was not a big issue for me   nd night I ve been in a suite of the Imperial palace  very spacious  with a big round dirty bath inside the room    So if you just want a clean hotel on the Strip with an affordable price this is for you  
P =>  Good    women from Iowa traveled to the hottest place in the US for   days   nites thru Allegiant Airlines  None of us knew what to expect  all that mattered was memories were to be had and a great time doing so  We arrived very late in the evening  with no shuttle or check in problems  Our   th floor room was located near the elevator and was clean and cool  and surprisingly  very quiet  The bed was comfortable and we always had clean towels  The Impersonators on the casino floor were a hoot and access to the rooms is easily loacted from the Casino front entrance  Yes  we had issues with ice  the entire place is outdated  and the elavators worked     the time  but if your plans are to actually enjoy LV  then none of this should matter  There is no better location than HERE  unless you are at the hotels across from or beside the Imperial  Shops  eateries  casinos  all easily accessible  I would highly suggest to first get a        day pass on the Deuce double decker bus and you can get on and off the strip and downtown  it runs   hrs  OR walk  I would probably stay here again knowing that I would be just as busy as I was this trip  The beds were very comfortable  the room was cool  the price was right  and that s all I required on this trip  We had a lot of fun even in the      temps  A trip is what you make it     
P =>  Loved it    i stayed in room tr     from july   th to june   rd  my room looked like the online pics and had all necessities the most i waited for the elevator was   minutes great location staff and price waited in check out line less than    minutes which is great if you have    people in front of you  
P =>  Pleasantly surprised After much reluctance in booking a stay at the IP  I had heard a LOT of bad reviews about this place   my boyfriend and I were set to experience what the IP had to offer  We had booked a Luv Tub room for   nights at     night for the end of y  and after waiting    minutes to check in and tipping the front desk clerk     bucks  we were given a KING SUITE  Sweet   The line to check in was  granted  long  but the check in process took no more than    minutes  So that was pretty good  After a walk that seemed to take forever  we finally reached the elevators  Just as I expected  only   were working  I found it rather entertaining to see a group of people waiting for      minutes for the elevator to come  only to have    people making a mad rush into the elevator before the doors close We finally got to our room  and I was pretty impressed with the condition of the room  Sure  it may not be furnished beautifully like the rooms at Wynn or the Bellagio  but it was adequate  The Luv Tub was ginormous  My     quot  boyfriend could almost lie down without bending his knees on the bottom of the tub  There was also a separate living room with a sofa bed  which I found pretty nifty  We even had our own balcony  too  Not much of a view  though  unless you like some old half naked man watching you from across  We were way up on the   th floor so the noise level was very minimal  No complaints there  The casino was all right  I greatly disliked the amount of cigarette smoke in it  but then again  cigarette smoke is found in every Vegas casino  ha   it just felt like there was   x more smoke at the IP  Anyway  there were a lot of low limit tables and games about which we found to be ideal since we re poor college students trying to find a game that won t make us any poorer The Dealertainers were super friendly and some of them were very talented  even though a few looked NOTHING like who they were supposed to impersonate  Props to them for being awesome singers  though  I was quite entertained  Didn t try their buffet  It looked pretty empty  so I kinda took the hint that it was something I didn t want to invest my stomach in Overall  it s a pretty decent hotel  It s old and in desperate need of a face lift  but hey  you do get what you pay for  The location of the hotel is so so convenient  Caesar s Palace  Bellagio  and other   star resorts are a   minute walk away  Now  how awesome is that  If you don t mind a little normal wear and tear  ridiculously slow elevators  and that old  corny Vegas charm  then the IP is the place for you  Plus  the IP is super cheap considering most visitors spend an average   hours in the room each day  It was definitely a good value  
P =>  You could do better  It was cheap         for   days  but you get what you paid for  It is Las Vegas of course and you will be paying for everything  I was surprise to have to pay for shuttle pick up  fitness facilities  and internet access  You have no plans of staying in the hotel while you there anyway so if your looking for something very inexpensive and don t need all the simple things to make your life easier  This is the hotel for you  I have to do more research anyway  this was just a quick vacation  Next time I return to Vegas I will splurge a little  
P =>  Still a good value Wife and I got the  quot luv tub quot  room and liked it very much  The room was very comfortable and the air conditioning worked well even with the    degree weather  The room was clean and we had no problems with the service The best features of this hotel were the center strip location  and the low price One down side was the really long wait to check in  We checked in about      pm on a Friday and the line was REALLY long  They had a security guard to keep people under control and plenty of desk workers  so the actual wait was about    minutes   much shorter that it first appeared Another down side is the slow and overcrowded elevators  At certain times it seemed impossible to get an elevator  We finally found another bank of lesser used elevators that were a longer walk away  but still a shorter wait The casino is not really very big  but very popular  and crowded   Michael Jackson may have something to do with it s popularity Parking was convenient  only because we rented a small car that could get into tight spaces  The parking garage is not well suited to large vehicles because of the tight turns and narrow parking spaces  
P =>  If you are looking for Price and Place I stayed   days in this hotel  I seems it is one of the oldest hotels of las vegas  Old fashion  Old style  if you are looking for price and you want to be close to everything this should be your choice  But you get what you pay  Low Price  low service and low luxury  The room was clean  I was all day out of the hotel and I never used any of the ammenities  like the swimming pool  I only went back every day to sleep  
P =>  great service great value great location This hotel is ideally situated for everything on the strip The service is terrific especially the waitreses Watch the dealertainers they are very good This hotel is not big by Vegas standards but is very homely The staff are very helpful and polite Lots of Penny slots to keep any one happy Overall a brilliant holiday  
P =>  Wouldn t stay here again There s a reason that the Imperial Palace is one of the cheapest hotels on the strip and that is because it s one of the oldest hotels on the strip  and it shows  Lets get the bad stuff out of the way first  First thing is the decor  I swear this place hasn t been re modeled  repainted  re carpeted  re tiled or re anything since it was built  Only half of the elevators work and are very slow  The carpeting throughout the entire hotel is dirty  torn and tattered  The paint on the walls is yellow due to all the nicotine and cigarette smoke which tells me that the ventilation system is out of whack  The rooms are clean however our air con unit was very noisy  our shower didn t drain until    minutes after showering  the balcony door didn t lock  there is no mini fridge in the room  that s a tough one to figure out  and again the decor is ancient  We had a room facing the strip on the   th floor and I have to warn you that if you turn in before  am don t count on any sleep before then because there is a bar right below the hotel that plays live music turned up to infinity until that time  Thank God we only retired to our room   night at around  am  We also took notice of room service trays dishes sitting in the hallway for   days before being picked up  can you say cockroaches  yikes  The pool is way to small for the size of the hotel and most of the deck chairs are broken  The restaurants are overpriced for what you get and they re tricky to find  We only ate at the hotel twice  once for breakfast and once for lunch  Now on to the good points    Location is excellent  Center strip  but then so are a lot of other hotels  Ceasars is right across the road and so is the Mirage    The monorail is right out the back door of the hotel and this connects you to other hotels along the strip from the Sahara at one end to the Luxor at the other     The staff are all very courteous and helpful  Check in only took about    minutes and the maids always had a good morning for us     The dealertainers are a blast especially the Britney Spears one that made my time at the blackjack table well worth while In all honesty what the owner s  of this hotel need to do is spend some of that cash they re raking in and level this place and build a new Imperial Palace  seriously  The place really is a dinosaur  They could build a new hotel that would rival any place on the strip  If your looking for a throwback to the early seventies then stay here but if you want something a whole lot better for not a whole lot more stay somewhere else  When we return to Vegas we will be staying at Treasure Island  Mirage  the Wynn  the Encore  the Venetian or Ceasars  anywhere but the Imperial Palace I hope this review helps you in your decision  
P =>  Do you expect any better for the price  We have stayed at the Imperial Palace   times now  We really enjoy the atmosphere  Yes  it s smokey  Yes  it s older  But what do you expect when you pay so little  Imperial Palace is right in the middle of the strip  you are so close to other Casinos  shopping  and dining  We were not happy  with the view  so they changed our room   times  Now that s service  We like this hotel for affordability and location  How often do you actually stay in your room anyway  
P =>   NEVER AGAIN   Our first time to Las Vegas   Expecting something wonderful from the reviews that had been previously read on this site   Couldn t have been more wrong The whole Casino Hotel needs a facelift   Lifts slow and often out of order   Ice machines aways empty as with no mini fridge s in room  unless you pay an extra     a nite  ppl bring their eskies and fill them up with the ice  leaving no more ice     Food avail in the Hotel limited  No buffet breakfast   Staff tired and overworked  Wallpaper comming off the walls  skirting boards kicked in with no attention to repair   Pool area small and over crowded no cover from the intense heat of y   Perfect for young ppl who don t care about a little comfort   As for us  and everyone I spoke to while staying there   We will never stay here again  and I would never recommend this Hotel to anyone    
P =>   This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in  When I first arrived  I waited for about a half an hour to check in  The line at the front desk is always long  no matter what time you walk by  Finally checked in and went to the elevators  and called the elevators  it took about    minutes for an elevator to come down  Went to my room and the iron was missing  So I called front desk and they asked if they may send someone up  quot now quot  with a new one   quot Now quot  meant half an hour  before somebody came  The iron was ancient and the ironing board was so dirty that I had to put a towel over it  to iron my clothes  The iron was basically lukewarm  couldn t iron my clothes with it and opted for the old school steamy shower method  That was the only time front desk picked up the phone when I called for the rest of the trip  In the evening we tried getting ice  the ice machine was broken  We tried the ice machines on the   and  th floor as well  with no luck  Upon reaching front desk  my friend was told to try the  th floor  The funny part was  that in the evening you would see people running around the hotel with ice buckets  We were there for   days and every day we had to use the ice machine on a different floor  We asked for extended check out on our last day and yet they still proceeded to lock us out after    o clock  Called front desk to send somebody up with a key  and    mins later  no one showed up  My friend flipped out because she needed to catch a flight and decided to go downstairs and  quot raise hell quot   Well  as she was going down on the elevator  it got stuck     I talked to a few locals  one of them did some electrical work for Harrah s  which owns the Imperial Palace  and said he would never eat anything at these hotels ever again  Another local told me that it is and I quote  quot The most ghetto hotel in Vegas  You re better off staying at a motel quot  Take my advise and stay at Excalibur if money is an issue  although it s a little bit further down the strip  it ll save you lots of headaches  
P =>   You get what you pay for Although the IP is a great location  and a great deal  my husband and I are willing to pay more in the future for a better hotel  When we got there  we waited for about    minutes to check in  The elevators took forever and were crowded the entire   days we stayed there  Elderly people were also waiting with their walkers in hand  to go down on the elevators  since they couldnt go down the stairs  What if there was a fire  These people wouldnt make it out alive  All of the elevators didnt even work  The ones that did  the doors kept getting stuck or they couldnt move  EVERYONE was complaining  Anyhow  our  quot deluxe quot  room this year was way worse than our standard room last year  None of the ice machines worked  A man came down from the penthouse because his didnt even work  The rooms were as clean as they could be i guess  Beds were uncomfortable  you could feel the springs all night long  The bathroom looked outdated  but the water pressure in the shower was great  We could have changed rooms  but to noisy ones facing the stip  We declined  All I can say is  you get what you pay for  It is very affordable and a great location  but thats about it  We wont be back  
P =>   Could have been a lot worse After reading the past reviews of this hotel  I was a bit concerned with what I would find upon my arrival  I was traveling with my daughter and meeting some friends who were staying at another hotel  I booked my reservations in il and had a  quot non cancellation quot  clause attached to my reservation      so some of the reviews scared me because we were staying for   nights  I mentioned this to the receptionist at check in and she gave us a nice room  My biggest concern was the cleanliness of the room  and I would like to start by saying that I was pleasantly surprised to find myself on a non  smoking floor that didn t have that lingering smoke smell that is often found in hotels  plus the room was very clean  The hotel is older  so the bathroom needed a little repair  sink crack   but it was still clean   and the maid came in daily to check on our supplies and make the beds  Our room had a little balcony that overlooked the pool and provided some free entertainment   the music from the pool was upbeat  as were the poolside games  In the evenings  the room and hallway were both quiet  The free entertainment in the casino was excellent  We thoroughly enjoyed the impersonation shows and attended Human Nature  a motown review show that was awesome The concierge  Ryan  got us tickets in the front row  and we had a blast during the high energy show  The hotel is centrally located near all of the big attractions  We did find the buffet here to be lacking compared to others we have eaten at  but again  the price was lower  We had dinner at Toby Keith s bar and grille right next door and walked the block to garitaville and to watch the Bellagio water show  Caesars Palace and Forum are right across the street as well  The monorail runs from this hotel  so there is access to any hotel on the strip     excellent location for the price   Okay  now for the downfalls     only   out of the   elevators worked and they were always packed or very slow in coming  luckily we were on the  th floor and used the stairs quite a bit  The same thing goes for the ice machine     there was NO ice on our floor  and I had to trek the different floors to find ice  I actually believe only   floors had ice at any given time      kind of a necessity during the month of y  If you don t mind the inconvenience of ice hunting and using stairs  then I would say go for this hotel Overall I would give this hotel a good rating for the price     basically  you get what you pay for  If you want fancy pay the bigger dollar and head to one of the newer  bigger hotels  I think asking for a nice room at the beginning helped     get the pool view  
P =>   Don t be misled by negative reviews My wife and i spent a week here after getting a cheap deal despite reading some negative reviews What we found was a Hotel with a fantastic location right in the middle of the strip rooms are clean and well serviced staff are friendly and helpful  OK it s not Caesars or the Bellagio or the MGM but more than good enough  Bettys Diner Burger Palace and The Tearooms have good food at reasonable prices but in our opinion stay clear of the Pizza Palace all you can eat pasta as it was absolutely rank   You really need to get out and about and prepare for some serious walking as Vegas is HUGE  Take advantage of the Deuce bus service which runs every      minutes and will take you all along the strip and further a field for    for a day ticket but make sure you visit Fremont which is on the bus route and is an absolute must for all your Vegas souvenier tack        but a great light show and all the original Vegas hangouts we can highly recommend the Bay Street Diner located in the Golden Nugget Hotel and Casino Have fun 
P =>   Great value I stayed at the Imperial Palace with my partner for five nights the week of y  th and was a little leary after reading some not so good reviews  However  I know you have to take the best ones and the worst ones and just disregard them and go with those in the middle  You certainly can t please everyone  So I was pleasantly suprised  The hotel was a little gaudy  but nice and clean  And I found the staff there nicer and more pleasant than at any other hotel we visited during our stay  The rooms were clean  of average size and competely adequate  I was led to believe by Travelocity that our room would have a    quot  plasma television  which it did not  And when I called the front desk  they said they didn t have any rooms with    quot  tv s  And of course  it wasn t printed in my Travelocity itinerary  so beware of that  We went to the Luau that they have at the pool every Tuesday and Saturday and it was relaxing and fun  Not the greatest show  but worth the low cost  We got the VIP seating for this and were right up front  It included open bar  but they didn t allow you to order any top shelf booze in your drinks  I thought the pool was just fine  though it is ranked as one of the worse in Vegas  It of course is just a square pool  but I don t require anything fancy  Just some water  a bartender  towels and a lounge chair  I also had my lunch at the pool one day and it was very good and very reasonable  They offer   for   drinks at the poolside bar every day  each day is a different special  We ate at the Burger Palace and wasn t too impressed with that  We also had a few meals at the Teahouse which I thought was very good  We didn t try the buffet here because of the bad reviews  The dealertainers were just wonderful  it was quite entertaining even if you weren t playing cards at the time  Regarding the elevators  we were in a section of the hotel that uses the room elevators closest to the front desk  which aren t as busy as the main ones  We never waited more than two minutes for the elevators  So I would recommend this hotel to anyone that is looking for a bargain hotel in Vegas  That is pretty much what it is  nothing fancy  but a clean room with a comfortable bed with adequate space for two people  
P =>   Always a good time I have never had a bad experience at this hotel  They have always been friendly and nice to me  The hotel is a little confusing but once you have been there a time or two you know whats going on  The dealertainers are always a good time  The elevators do take a little bit longer then I would like  But the location is amazing  You coudlnt ask for a better spot  Every room i have stayed in has been clean and people talk about how cheap it is    well you dont pay very much for a room are you thinking you are going to get a   star room  I love the IP they have always treated me very well and give me GREAT comps  
P =>   Great Location even better Price  I have stayed at the Imperial Palace on three occasions and was happy with our rooms  For the amount of time we spend in our rooms it was comfortable and clean We have stayed in the upgraded suites which we throughly enjoyed  Two Tv s couches and clean bathroom  The hotel and casino staff were awesome and extremly helpful  The only negative was the Timeshare vultures near the elevators      too pushy  I recommend this to all first time visitors as you cannot beat the price and location of The Imperial Palace  
P =>   Imperial Palace  Try  Imperial Prison   Seriously  I thought perhaps I had committed some terrible atrocity and was being punished  Okay  not really  but this hotel is awful  I had stayed here previously in       and I honestly remembered the hotel as being no frills but certainly not horrible  Alas  this time  I can safely say that no matter what a  quot good value quot  it might be  I am never staying there again It s y in the desert  for one thing  but you d never know it in the hotel  All the common areas were stuffy and hot  including the corridors  the elevators  and the stairwell  Why were you in the stairwell  you might ask  That would be because the elevators  all sixteen of them  were either slow or out of service  were there any signs indicated this service problem  No    and while taking the stairs down isn t a problem  let s just talk about how much fun dragging four pieces of luggage down eleven flights of stairs is  It s not fun at all     Also  there was puke in the hallways from the night before  which added to the ambiance in a way I could do without  When I emerged from my journey down the stairwell with all my luggage  it was in a back alley outside the hotel  which meant dragging my luggage all the way round and going back inside the hot  stuffy lobby  I was never as happy as I was when the cab took us to Caesar s Palace  we booked IP because it was a cheap room on the strip on a Saturday night  before our much better deal at Caesar s started on Sunday   Additionally  the rooms are boring and beige  I m not sure what is  quot Imperial quot  about this in the slightest  The pillows were ridiculous  too  They were more like a sack of hair than a pillow  Save yourself the trouble and either pay a little more for a better hotel  or book somewhere farther away and stay at the Motel    This place is seriously not worth the money  also  the pool closes at    wtf   unless you think dragging your luggage down the stairwell is a fun time     
P =>   friendly not over the top  have stayed   times and would not go anywhere else  Geisha bar very friendly and hasnt changed   still same staff which says a lot  Betty s coffe shop   scrummy cakes  all floor staff very helpful and pleasant  maybe because we are Scottish  Don t go for expensive casinos   you pay for the glitz and VERY small drinks   
P =>   i would stay here again I have stayed here for bout six year and have stood in other hotels sure no hotel is perfect but location is great rooms great for the stay clean and stocked ya elivators are slow but those are the ones by the shops there are other ones that are lot faster just need to look on the maps gambling is good low limit tables and the bar out side is fun casino at night is fun there is entertainment that make it fun i walk in to other casinos at night and not as fun compared to IP and the price is great for us non high rollers i have stayed at luxor and excaliber and mgm and other but i would rather stay were its right in the middle of the strip and not were half my money is tied up in a   star hotel were here to have fun and get away from everyday life and no one is really in there room but to shower and sleep and that only for a few hour if your here just to sleep and stay in just one hotel you should just stay at home  Ill be back at IP on the july   for sure here i come 
P =>   Only reason to stay is location price We kinda knew what to expect when we booked a room at the IP for one night in y  However  we wanted to stay right off the strip without spending all our money on the hotel  We got our room two hours after the check in time and were downgraded to an older room which had not been renovated for quite some time  At least we were compensated with a voucher that almost covered entry to the great dinner buffet at the IP  Be prepared for hour long check in lines and poor service from tired staff  The location is spot on perfect  though  Stay only if you want good location at low price and don t care much about the hotel standard  
P =>   rotten check out attitude i have stayed a number of times at the Imperial Palace because it is centrally located on the strip  However this last time  i could not believe when i checked out of the hotel  how rude and discourteous the hotel clerk was  I do not know what her problem was but she was so rude that i have decided that with the economy the way it is  i dont have to tolerate such ill mannered and rude behavior from a hotel employee As a result   i will never stay at the Imperial Palace again 
P =>   Excellant value for money and great location  We stayed for    nights in the Imperial Palace   a long time for Vegas but never a dull moment  We got a taxi from the airport cost    dollars it would be difficult to find the hotel otherwise   on the strip the front of the hotel is the Rockhouse Club which is part of the hotel  You drive by the side of this to the hotel lobby  A wait of about    minutes to check in and we were upgraded without asking to the main building  The hotel is a little tired but excellant value and the staff very helpful and cheerful  The place was clean and tidy and gets a little rowdier over the weekends but all good fun  You can get into the Rockhouse nightclub free before midnight if you show a hotel room key and ladies drink free on Thursdays from   pm  The pool are is also good fun   DJ plays on some days but doesnt start until after      am   good idea when having so many late nights   even though we had view of the pool from our room the room seems very well sound proofed  The layout of the hotel is a little confusing but again added to the fun   everyone was in the same position   the lifts can also result in a wait but this was worse on the morning of our checkout   everyone wanting to use them at the same time  The location was incredible   walking distance to everywhere and the monorail is closeby if needed  All in all good value not the plushest hotel in the world but who spends all their time in the hotel room  
P =>   Imperial Palace   No I mean Imperial DUMP   There can be no worse  ugly  dirty  old  disgusting hotel in the US  than the Imperial Palace in Vegas  If there is  I pitty the people staying there  This place is across the street from Caesar s  so it has a great location  but what a DUMP This place needs to be blown up and I mean soon  Bad rooms  bad casino  bad food  it s HORRIBLE  Do not stay here unless you are a bum or hobo   
P =>   I WILL NEVER STAY OR PLAY THERE AGAIN    NICKLED AND DIMED ME    We went to vegas for my girlriend s   st birthday  she wanted to stay at IMPERIAL PALACE  IP  because she stayed there before and thought it was a good affordable place to stay  well she was wrong  it was cheap  here is what I didn t like      room smelled like mildew  I think it was from the a c but it went away after turning on the a c brought in fresh air  so that was okay but not pleasant   the elevators take a very long time to pick anyone up  I would say about the longest we waited was at least      min every time  wasn t that busy of a weekend  sometimes when the elevators came quickly they were packed with people to the point that the overweight buzzer was always coming on   when I would talk to front desk or concierge  they were helpful but not nice or friendly  not a talkative group of people  now here is where I really got upset and annoyed      THE POOL CLOSES AT   PM EVERYDAY  who the hell closes their dinky little pool and spa area so early  when I called and asked about the pool  they said that it was closed at  pm   this was around      and when I asked if there was a reason why   thinking maybe there was some kind of show or party or luau or something   the lady said no  then I asked why and she said because thats how they do things at the IMPERIAL PALACE  very upsetting when someone answers you like that    at just about   am the fire alarm starts sounding off  its very loud and annoying  thats a good thing when theres a freaking fire  but when there isn t a fire and everyone is getting woken up  they need some kind of control over the alarm  so I call the front desk and ask about whats going on and the guy said that its a false alarm and they are investigating  please disregard  so then I asked if its some kind of test or alarm checking and then he very rudely tells me to relax and its not their fault its going off  they didn t do it  I was very upset and very offended so I just called him an    hole and then hung up  so the alarm continues to sound on and off for an hour  between     am  woke up late because of that  so I called the front desk and asked for a late check out til    they said only til    or they would charge me       for an hour         ME OFF  AND I WAS VERY TIRED FROM THE WHOLE ALARM SOUINDING OFF FOR AN HOUR      I thought that when you are playing video poker games at the bar tops the drinks were free  well i guess not at the IP  had to pay for all of them while I was playing and spending money  mind you the drinks are small and weak and exspensive  HATED IT  a  I had bought one of those big plastic cups from the stirp  so I decided that I would fill it up with my own alcohol and needed just a little bit more soda  so I asked the bartender for a just a little bit and he said that he can only give me a cup of soda for     are you kidding me  you can t spare soda without charging me up the       NICKEL AND DIMING     I m not being a cheap guy  I just figure there is a small give when your taking all my money at a high rate  heres the most upsetting and most important fact      when checking out I told the check out clerk about my stay and she said   quot that ll be      please  quot  she didn t apologize  discount or say anything  just acted like she didn t care and wasn t going to do anything about it so needless to say I m very upset and even more disappointed with the IP s costumer service  but I will say that the game floor and shows were good and very fun  I liked that part  from now on I m staying at the FLAMINGO and BILLS  perfect location and reasonable prices and the costumer service is fun  friendly  flexible  negotiable and very talkative people and I m very happy with them  
P =>   great centre strip location  We had purchased a   day Vegas Grand Canyon package that included the IP as accomodation  I was a bit worried that it would be a crap hotel  but it was perfect for our sight seeing  Right bang in the middle of the strip  Venturing out at all times of the day was so easy Check in did have a long queue  they had at least   customer service reps opened  maybe they should look at opening more if they queue is growing  Our room was located on the twelth floor right at the back  this was the part I probably didn t like the most  Getting in and out of the hotel took soooo long  factoring in waiting for the elevator  I guess this is where  budget  travellers are put  Apart from this  the hotel room was clean  serviced daily  a bit small but it s ok for sleeping  beds were comfortable  bathroom was old looking but everything still functioned well  We also ate once at the Teahouse restaurant inside the hotel because we were so hungry and tired  couldn t be bothered venturing out in the sweltering heat   Was quite expensive for   sandwich fries meals     soft drinks  so if you can  go outside to eat for better taste and value Since there is so much choice in Vegas  I probably would not stay here again purely just to experience something else  but it was a great budget hotel room for unbeatable location  
P =>   Great Location great value hotel  We stayed here in e      and had a brilliant time the hotel is perfectly situated in the middle of the strip  the hotel is very clean and there is a great atmoshere here that you don t get as much in the other hotels  Would reccomend to anyone wanting to go to vegas on a budget as the price for the rooms are very cheap  
P =>   Fantastic location great value   but not perfect So here s the thing  I keep coming back to this hotel for two simple reasons  There is no hotel at a better location on the Las Vegas Strip  Imperial Palace is the dead smack center of the Strip  and every single hotel and casino that s famous on the strip is an easy walk  You can be at any of these in    seconds  O Sheas  Bill s  Caesar s  Harrah s  Casino Royale  Flamingo  You can be Venetian in   minutes  It s really just the most prime location in all of Vegas  and for that  I will forgive much  And the price is right  If you re a member of the Harrah s Club  you can get rooms for practically nothing during the week  perfectly serviceable but not very fancy of course Unfortunately  this hotel is really showing its age  Many of the fixtures throughout the hotel and casino are    years old  the elevators are on their last legs  it seems to me   and being such a good value  it is quite busy at check in and check out  Some of the fixtures in the room are really in bad need of replacement   the GFCI outlet in my bathroom was actually melted  and that looked like OLD damage  not new damage   Definitely  the upkeep and maintenance of this hotel is   how shall we say   not a priority for Harrah s The restaurants in my opinion have gone from  quot decent quot  to  quot horrifying quot  in the past two years  The guys in my group  who were certainly not complainers     were mortified  But that s no big deal  there are somewhere around one hundred restaurants within a   minute walk from IP The casino is interesting  Lower limit games     craps  e g   are available       and the poker room is decent  Both the craps and poker areas were well maintained  and staffed by very strong dealers  Unfortunately  there is an extremely loud and schlocky  quot Dealertainers quot  blackjack area  which has  generally  very poor celebrity impersonators    times out of     everyone in the casino asked  quot and who is he supposed to be  quot   dealing cards  and every so often  they pause to do an absurd karaoke impersonation  It was actually horrifyingly declasse   Fortunately  the dealertainers mostly deal blackjack  and there is only the occasional idiocy with the karaoke The wireless internet  which will run you     per day  is actually superior  I got good solid up and down bandwidth of around   Mbps  and the configuration was professional and permitted all sorts of protocols to pass unimpeded  A business traveler looking to connect to a corporate VPN will have absolutely no problem The pool area is well maintained and busy  Again  since the hotel is such a good value  it is generally packed with beer drinking party people and or younger people  and so the pool area has gigantic speakers set up with music blasting   it s kind of like a frat house  You can forget about taking a nap during the day if your room is adjacent to the pool I like this hotel  There is no hotel with a better location in Vegas  this is the very best plot of land  The price is definitely right  It s not going to titillate anyone with more refined sensibilities  however  and it has its weak points in terms of eyesores and service annoyances  after a   hour flight  waiting    minutes to check in made me furious   But  I guess  you re here to gamble and do things  so the unbelievable value that the hotel represents more than offsets my complaints  I do recommend it  
P =>   Value for money Bargain price  I agree with others    waiting for lift is a pain   apart from that cheap cheerful  great location  Bearing in mind that the only time you are in the room is when you are asleep why pay the high prices of some of the other hotels   You can go in any of them anytime you wnat to eat drink or gamble   I would much rather have the extra cash to spend Our room was clean and thats all that I was interested in   i too lopve the dealertainers   Michael Jackson was on one table   even though he had died  Or maybe he hasnt      
P =>  Outdated and Dingy by Great Location Stayed at the Imperial Palace for a reunion this weekend  I will not stay there again  They should tear it down and start over  as it s in a GREAT location on the strip  The Imperial is NOT a   star hotel as advertised various sites online  More like       Star   We stayed in a  renovated  room  I did not feel safe in the hotel  The hotel lobby  casino and rooms are outdated and a bit dingy  Wallpaper on the floors were torn or dirty  Check in took over an hour  and we checked in early  Crabby front desk people  Elevators were broken  and it took    minutes or longer each time to use the elevators  as two of   were broken and probably will not be fixed   They no longer sell the parts needed to fix the old elevators   Phew  Only thing going for the Imperial is it s location was fantastic and it has free parking  
P =>   still as good   we have just got back from a twelve night stay at the i p this is the second time we have stayed at this hotel and i have to say there are no complaints check in was a breeze a bit of a queue but nothing major  we got a free nugrade to a deluxe room without even asking    all i did ask for was a room over looking the pool  this was beacuse if you get a strip view you also get all the noise from the carnival court at harrahs til about   am    so if you like youre sleep dont go for a strip view  we could still see the strip from our room we had a great view of caesers palace  the hotel staff are great the hotel food is good  the casino drinks service is good  the pool is only small but it has a great atmosphere there is a b b q and a d j there are some inflatables dotted round the edge of the pool and the pool bar isnt that badly priced   the only thing that isnt that great are the lifts     they are soooo slow   and the ones to the deluxe rooms are even worse  but overall this hotel is a dated little gem  and when we go back to vegas we will be staying there again its right slap bang in the middle of the strip and its very reasonabley priced its not luxury but you get what you pay for and who goes to vegas to stay in their room all day    
P =>   Good Value for the Deal Myself and   others stayed at the Imperial Palace on Thursday  Friday  and Staurday night in e  We arrived on Thursday night at about        check in took about    minutes  which isn t knock against the hotel  it s Las Vegas  this happens everywhere   and we were upgraded to a nicer room since the bed arrangement we initially requested wasn t available  As other reviewers mentioned  the casino is definitely older  but stil clean  and the waitresses still bring drinks  The location on the strip is great  and we weren t upset at all with the price we paid for the room because we did get a great deal and we aren t the type to hang out in the room on vacation anyway  Minor annoyances  there is no coffee pot in the room  I am not human until I ve had coffee  so this annoys me  I called room service once and ordered a pot       which i ended up canceling since they told me it would be over    minutes  I walked down to the  quot burger shack quot  in the casino  where coffee was  again  ridiculously expensive and not good  That was the same burger shack where   of us had to pay over     for some late night burgers that weren t any good  again  this is Las Vegas   Finally  we found out that there is a Burger King in the casino   or   casinos down I think it s the casino with the Irish name  I just can t remember the name of it right now   They didn t have raised prices  and there was never really a wait  either in the a m  for coffee or at night for snacks  Just a helpful hint for those looking for ways to cut unnecessary expenses  So  overall  IP was just fine for what we paid  but goodness  give your guests a little coffeepot  That s not too much to ask for  
P =>   Average hotel with excellent location   I stayed in IP on    th to   th with my girl friend  Personally I think this hotel locates at the best intersection on the strip  There are many affordable dining options nearby and a beautiful forum shops across the street I stayed in the deluxe room with a small balcony  The balcony is nice with the view of the swimming pool  however the room is no better than average  but who will stay in a hotel room for a day in Vegas lol Overall I would recommand this hotel due to its excellent location and affordable rates  
P =>   We lucked out   but it s not the best for everyone  Here s the deal  many people have complanied about the long check in times and the extreme elevators and long walks to their rooms  Basically they are right  BUT  and I mean BUT  there are reasons why this happens so often After reading these reviews  I decided to see what would make my stay better  I got   free nights comp  So  I hoped for the best  I didn t even request a quite room  I just let them pick it  Here s how I got a the best stay I check in before the  pm time frame  Many people would have gotten there around  pm thinking that s early  I made sure my flight landed around        I got the casino around       No line  no wait  Checking in only took me   mins or so  and we got the nicest Luv Tub room  Very spacious  As for the walk  yes  it is a walk  but     since we checked in early  we only had to take one elevator to our room  As for the elevators  they are extrememly slow  but what s the hurry  your in vegas  Here is why they are slow    The current elevators are running on a old motherboard and software  It would require extensive upgrading to make them run smarter and faster  Harrah s corp  seems to want to put their money elsewhere at this time  The room was perfect  It was located on the   th floor away from the pool area and concert near Harrahs  We were shocked when walking up to it  it had a Double Door entrance  The only one on that floor  It was a huge room and everything inside for the most part was clean  and no funny odor  The hot water didn t seem to get hot  but it did improve over the course of the   days  Overall  I don t think I would stay here again  since other casinos are now offering me free weeks  but if you re on a budget and don t mind the classic old casino  this is your place  I would however book the luv tub room or higher     The classic capri and deluxe are not worth the money  If you really want to treat yourself  get the penthouse suite which I believe is on the   th or   th floor  It s HUGE  
P =>   Disappointed We ve stayed at the Imp Palace four times in the past but this time was a disaster A great location but the hotel is now a dump  The place needs blowing up  Service was rubbish  on two days we didn t get the room cleaned and when we asked why was told that the staff finish at       The casino with the mime artists is a joke  and the surly barmen serving the drinks have each had a personality byepass  Bed linen is old and frayed and the rooms stink  The Emporers buffet used to be good but not any more Much better food all round at the Mirage  Sadly we won t be going there again  
P =>   Worth the Stay   We stayed for five nights and had the best time of our lives  This hotel needs some renovation  but the staff  casino and surroundings were not bad at all  You cannot beat the location in the heart of Las Vegas Boulevard  Best place for the money     
P =>  Dated but clean and good slot machines   you get what you pay for When we arrived we were allocated a room on  th floor overlooking the swimming pool  When we got tot the room the noise was loud approx  pm and we were advised that this could contiune until  pm on show nights  With this in mind we moved to a mini suite on the   th floor with a balcony and views over the rear of the hotel and the mountains  Room a bit dated and cost     per night extra but well worth evrey penny  Massive round bath in bedroom as well as bath and really powerfull shower in bathroom Room was cleaned very well every day and we heard no noise at all  All the Americans were complaining about waiting for the lifts but the most we waited was   minutes throughout the whole stay  usually no more than a minute or two Access to car park from strip can be difficult when busy but we found we could both exit and enter around the rear of the hotel Staff were very friendly and we won quite a bit on the slot machines Next time will stay at Monte Carlo but this was a late booking and although hotel is dated we thoroughly enjoyed our holiday  
P =>  IDEAL LOCATION Stayed in this hotel for seven nights never found anything to complain about the whole time Reception is busy all day just like every other hotel in vegas so you just have to be patient roughly about   mins wait time to check in we found the staff cheerful and helpful at all times  We were put on the  th floor not much of a view but very quite if thats what you want its worth asking for this floor We had a maid in eve ry day no complaints at all well worth her     tip  The hotel may not be one of the new ones but for the right price who can complain The location is right bang in the middle of the strip where the other big and well know hotels are a short walk away  
P =>  cheap and cheerful great location just opposite the ceasar palace  in the middle of the strip the room are clean and the staff friendly the casino a bit old but you only need a bed to sleep ask for a room at the back of the hotel as the one at the front could be really noisy  
P =>  I have stayed here   Times   Don t listen to the reviews If your coming to Vegas to stay in luxury then stay at the Wynn  This hotel is one of my fav s as I m a canadian who has been to Vegas    times   Yes the hotel is dated   but if you want to stay where ALL the action is then stay here  it s central to everything you need  It s located in the middle of the strip and you can via footwalk to anywhere you like  If your an all night gamer this is the safest relaxed place to be at  am  Highly reccomended  lt   
P =>  Centre Strip good location  A really good hotel  clean with friendly staff  Only draw back is the queue for the lifts  Other than that  large rooms  most with   double beds  Food is good in the Embers Restaurant  Buffet breakfast and buffet dinner in the main restaurant is good value for money  Casino is fair size  A bit darker than some  but plenty to choose from  Good pool and outside bar  And  walking distance to Carnaval Court with live music most of the day  and night   If you like to keep fit  a small gym with a beauty room is also available  Biggest sports book on the strip alsoHave stayed there   times and plan on staying there again at least twice in       
P =>  Perfect Hotel if all you need is a base while enjoying Vegas    I have just returned from a   night stay in the IP  and have no problem with the hotel at all  Let s face it  you are not going to Vegas for the hotel facilities  you are going for the casinos  nightlife etc The hotel is dead in the middle of the strip  i had no problems checking in  ok  you could wait a few minutes for an elevator  but so what     the hotel is huge The casino is big  some cheap table limits  which is a nice start to your gambling antics  and the staff were friendly and helpful at all times I personally think  that if you look after them  they will look after you  i left a     tip first day to the maid  room was spotless every day afterwards  maybe most of the Americans i bumped into need to learn a few basic manners  The only thing i would say  is that if i was going back with the wife  i would probably spend the few extra quid to stay in the luxury at Ceasers  but hey  that s a different kind of holiday       
P =>  Excellent value for money cheap as chips  You cannot get a better location for a hotel on the strip  I would recommend this hotel for anyone who isn t posh or stuck up as it s very down to earth but the emphasis is on fun not luxory  The room we stayed in was spacious and comfortable and cost buttons  When we checked in they gave us a room with a pool view as we were  st timers and a book of vouchers which was a very nice touch  I think all the rooms come with a balcony which is rare for vegas and a big plus point The pool was nothing fancy but nice and you can go to any hotel pool in the Harrah s chain    in total  Flamingo  Harrah s Paris  Ballys  Caesar s Palace and Rio  We took the free shuttle bus to Rio from Harrah s and spent a day at their very lush pool The casino has a great atmosphere and there is a real buzz as you walk through  The dealertainers are great fun and I would recomend playing at their tables on the way back from a night out when your well into the Vegas Spirit  
P =>  VALUE Stayed here before  cheap clean perfect mid strip location  More money for fun elsewhere  
P =>   location location location best value  clean   and in the middle of the strip previously stayed at ti across the street that was more modern and nicer but more than twice the price  going back in november and have already booked ip  less than two hundred dollars for five nights  
P =>   Another Great Stay  We stayed   nights in a luv tub room and loved it  I had requested a smoking room when I made the reservation but when we arrived to check in on Sunday night I was told there weren t any available for that night but we could change our room the next day which is what we did  Our first room was on the  th floor and had no view at all except of the parking garage  our second room was on the   th floor and had a great view of the pool  We have stayed here many times and will definately be returning  
P =>  Basic and Noisy Old fashioned hotel locaterd in the middle of the strip  rooms that face the swimming pool are very noisy due to disco bar until about  am  Rooms are very basic  queues for the lifts are common  No tea coffee faclities  Good clean linen and towels  good maid service  pleasant staff  Lifts are a good walk through the casino from the front desk  
P =>   PLEASE READ MY REVIEW I JUST GOT BACK     I just got back from Vegas and stayed   nights of my   week stay at the IP  Before I left  I read the reviews and was horrified  All of those reviews were so wrong  The only thing that was difficult was the elevators because the place is HUGE  Otherwise I have to tell you that all the staff in the whole place is awesome  and cannot do enough for you  I want to make special mention to TIM the bell man  who gave us extra treatment with lots of help  navigating the hotel  Room service that we got all   mornings was elegant  hot and delicious   I kept trying to figure out what everyone was trying to say but there really was no negative  The room was clean  very clean  and there were plenty of towels and when we needed extra blankets and in no time at all housekeeping came with a smile  The place is great and it hurts me when people so casually say negative things about a place like this  Think about who the IP is owned by    This is a beautiful well run place and all I can say is go and see for your self   VERY CLEAN    
P =>   Rennovate it      This hotel is in serious need of a rennovation or tear down  Our  quot deluxe quot  room had stains on the carpet  cigarette burns on the bedding  carpet and counter tops  and the box spring on the bed looked like it was picked up off the street  The bath tub and sink areas were chipped and stained  There was hair on the bathroom floor from previous travelers  I was glad I brought my can of Lysol    The balconys are standing room only  The elevators are extremely slow and the experience to get from the front lobby to the parking area and then to our room was really frustrating  On the flip side  the casino  gift shop areas and corridors were nice and appeared to be clean  
P =>   Good value for money You get what you pay for  there can be queues for elevators at times  room service not alaways in order  overall its a cheap feeling to it compare to other big hotels  BUT  here s the best part  for     a night  you get the best spot on the strip  its bang right in the middle  Everything within walking distance  We asked for a top floor room with strip view  we got the room right at the top with balcony and amazing views of strip and mountains  You can see the sunset over the mountains and lights at night just gorgeous  You can also see bellagio fountains in far corner from balcony  BUT again  staying in these rooms comes with a noisy price  just below this tower  theres Harras out door party tent which plays loud music from afternoon till  am in morning  During night time it is very noisy and total nuisanse  we thought of changing it after first night  BUT here s the trick again  if you leave the AC fan on  it does reduce the noise considerably  And so we stayed whole    nights in this way  But there are other towers you can choose to stay if you are not fussy about the views  Its perfact for budget travellers for its location  you cant beat it  but if you have few extra dosh then go elsewhere like caesars palace right opposite  
P =>   You get what you pay for Ok we just got back last week and had a good time in Vegas  The room was comped so why should I complain  The room looked very grimey but I can say the cleaning people came everyday to change towels  The furnishing  amp  decor is very outdated  THE FOOD  UGG  The buffet was very bland  My husband threw his breafast away  BLAND  I understand they can t over season but GOD  I hated that the pool closes       pm  we never got a chance to take a dip  The hotel staff is very pleasant  I want book here again  
P =>   For a few bucks more   stay somewhere else  We drove from California to Las Vegas and decided to stay at the IP  When we drove up to have Valet park our car   they yelled at us to move the vehicle and we hadn t gotten our luggage out of the car yet  They finally had us park down around the corner  by the entry to the parking lot  and told us they would take care of our car     minutes later   it was still sitting there  Don t stay above the fifth floor   you ll wait forever for an elevator  and at least you can walk from the fifth floor   We were on the   th floor   it was SO noisy  and you ALWAYS wait at least    minutes for an elevator  All we wanted to do was to go work out   found out there is a     charge person day to use the gym   and it wasn t that nice   Complained to the manager and left three messages for him to contact us   we never got a call  Guess they don t believe in good customer service at the IP  You have to walk through a wall of smoke to get to the elevators   the place stinks cigarettes and cigars  The only kudos I will give this place is the Housekeeping Department   whenever we called them for something they were always pleasant and johnny on the spot  The front desk definitely needs a few lessons on smiling and giving great customer service  My next trip  I will pay the additional     to stay at a nicer and cleaner place  This may be centrally located  but with the monorail   almost all the hotels are close to it  Do yourself a favor and stay elsewhere  
P =>   Fabulous location   best value hotel on the strip Having stayed at the Imperial Palace in       when my sister  some friends and I went back to Vegas in tember       I knew what to expect from this hotel and it easily met my expectations  This is the only place where you will get true value for money and personally I d rather save the extra     for shopping and gambling We booked via Expedia for    nights in Deluxe rooms   obviously a Deluxe room at the Imperial is probably on the same level as a Standard room in other strip hotels but let s face it  you don t go to Vegas to sit in your room and admire the wallpaper  Well  we didn t anyway Upon arrival  there was a fairly long queue at check in but this is to be expected anywhere in Vegas  especially as we arrived at the hotel not long after the official check in time of  pm  The queue moved pretty quickly and we were seen by a very pleasant woman who advised us that there were no Non Smoking rooms available but there would be some the next day  Therefore we stayed in Smoking rooms for one night which wasn t a problem as they were clean and didn t smell or anything  The next day we just had to call down to reception and they gave us Non Smoking rooms with no problems When we stayed in this hotel in       we were in Standard rooms and in my opinion the Deluxe rooms aren t much different except for the decor being a bit nicer  All their rooms seem to be spacious and clean and I love the fact that they have balconies  I don t think there are many hotels on the strip that offer private balconies  We had a view of the pool and our friends were on the opposite side of the corridor and had a view of the mountains and horizon  both views were great  The rooms had air conditioning units which worked fine and standard CRT TV s which had a decent number of channels  The bathrooms were nice and clean with a bath shower combo and a nice sized sink vanity area  Lots of towels and flannels which were changed regularly We loved our housekeeping lady  Linda  she was so funny  We had a good laugh with her when we saw her and she was so friendly  We always left her a few dollars each morning which I first read about doing on here and is definately worthwhile The casino area of the hotel is by far one of the most fun and relaxed environments out of all the strip hotels  Yeah it s a bit smoky but thats one of the things you have to accept if you re going to be hanging around Vegas casinos  We only ate in the hotel once as there were so many other places we wanted to go to   we stopped in the Teahouse place late one night after we d been out and I had a delicious BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger and fries   great value for money and just what I needed after a few beers We also stopped off in Betty s Diner quite a few times to grab coffee and snacks and I really recommend you try this place if you get a chance  The coffee isn t great  there s a Starbucks next door in Harrahs  but all the snacks are freshly made and delicious  The peanut butter cookies  chocolate croissants and pastries in particular  Mmmmm Overall  I highly recommend this hotel if you are just looking for a place to sleep and shower  etc   you can t get a better location for this price  If you have higher expectations of a hotel room though  you could be disappointed if you stayed here Personally  I ve already booked to go back to Vegas and guess what  I ll be staying at the Imperial Palace again  I love it there  
P =>   Great place to stay We arrived and was told there were no more double bed non smoking  We were then upgraded to a suite at no extra charge  The rooms were clean and comfortable  The room service was excellent  This is a gem it is located in the middle of the strip  I will use this hotel and casino again  
P =>   There is absolutely nothing wrong with this place  After reading some bad reviews here  I was apprehensive about staying at the IP  but I got such an incredible rate I just couldn t justify staying anywhere else  This was my first trip to Vegas and I was pleasantly suprised when our airport shuttle dropped us off at the hotel Check in was very fast   only had to wait a few minutes in line  The front desk staff were exceptional   friendly  knowledgeable and helpful  The concierge    different gentlemen  on   different days  were equally helpful  Checkout was even faster I don t understand the reviews with comments about the hotel being difficult to find your way around in  We stayed in a deluxe room on the   th floor  and the front desk clerk gave us a small map of the lobby which showed us exactly how to find the elevators to our room  Yes  it was a long walk  but all of the hotels parade you through their casinos en route to your room so the IP is no exception  And the elevators were very fast and all operable during our stay  I can honestly say we never waited more than a minute for an elevator We ordered room service one night  and received our food in about    minutes  The gentleman who delivered our food was extremely courteous and professional  Housekeeping staff was also outstanding during our stay   I m a firm believer in leaving a tip every day and it s amazing what a smile and a dollar can do   Our room was comfortable  the beds and pillows were great  the a c worked fine as did everything else in our room  The room was very clean and well maintained  The balcony was small but served its purpose  Our room facing the pool was nice and quiet in the evenings  During the day the music from the pool was pretty loud  but we weren t there to sit in our room The pool area is pretty plain compared with other hotels in the area  but it had a fun atmosphere and no shortage of sun  The poolside bar and food concession was convenient and they had a great drink special the day we were at the pool  Tuesday      Bud in a bucket of ice for       all day  It s hard to argue with a deal like that  They have a luau at the pool on select days of the week  which we did not bother with  although it did seem like a good enough deal  For     per person you got the meal  entertainment and unlimited drinks   On the days that the pool is closed to the public because of the luau you are encouraged to use the pool at the neighbouring Flamingo or Harrah s   all owned by the same group  So we checked out the pool at the Flamingo one day as well  To be honest  the IP reminds me of a typical Holiday Inn or Howard Johnson s Hotel  with a casino in the lobby  lol   There is nothing wrong with this place  If you are coming here and expecting the luxuries of The Venetian or The Wynn     you really don t have realistic expectations  This is a basic comfortable hotel and it serves its purpose well  I would not hesitate to stay here again  and the location in the middle of the Strip and the wonderful staff we encountered at every turn are the IP s best assets  IMO  
P =>  Great price great location  We stayed a the Imperial Palace for   nights earlier this year as part of a round the world trip  After travelling for over   months  price was the most important thing to us and I think we stumbled upon a little gem  We stayed in the cheapest rooms which are located outside and to the back of the hotel  they are still joined on though  The location is PERFECT for seeing Vegas  it s right in the centre of the strip and within walking distance of all the other large hotels  casinos  shops  restaurants etc  We ate at the all you can eat in the hotel once and had no complaints  it wasn t as good as some of the others we tried but was also better than others  The rooms were basic but great  large  TV  en suite with shower and bath  Our room was spotless and cleaned daily  We had no complaints at all I would definitely recommend this hotel to a friend who was visiting Vegas  
P =>  Excellent Location for the price This hotel is tucked away in the middle of The Strip where all the action is  It is right opposite Caesar s Palace and Mirage I had booked a room for the   of us through a Vegas tourism site  and even though we went during the slack season  i believe it was a steal to pay the kind of price i did  and stayed in such a location Since its bang in the centre of the strip and walking distance from the biggest and best hotels It is also connected with a kind of tram system with a stop within the hotel The rooms and bathrooms are clean and alright enough to spend jst a few hours to catch up on the sleep before you head out for partying gambling sightseeing It also hosts a music extravaganza in the evenings with the singers duplicates  like bette midler  elvis etc belting out numbers in the hotel theatre before doing some songs on the casino floor The dinner buffet was ok  and the swimming pool alright Must stay here if you plan a budget trip and would rather spend on shows and eating and partying than on the room itself Look out for good deals on the net before making a definate booking  
P =>  The IP is Centrally Located and Established This hotel needed to be imploded when the others were  but that time has passed and this place is older and showing it s age  The location cannot be beat  sandwiched between The Flamingo and Harrah s you will not be bored  The check in was flawless and the desk staff were courteous  Finding the room on the other hand was horrendous  it took us about    minutes because of the eclectic design of this building  the elevators were slow and many were out of service and with this hotel being so busy  it was to be expected There was no Starbucks or Seattle s Best but Betty s diner sufficed for the am coffee fix There is no midnight cafe for pancakes and eggs but there is a hamburger joint  we didn t eat there  The room was relatively clean although dusty under the bed and the bathroom was clean but old wallpaper peeling  The cleaning ladies are the best and they do a very good job  Hey People a couple of bucks for a daily tip does wonders sometimes I did order room service and it did come promptly and courteously  It was expensive but it s a vacation The entrance into the hotel by car is a nightmare  dodging the people crossing your path is an art form  if you wait  they will never let get by for entry  A word of advice is to valet   to self park is to self punish  you will see The gaming staff were OK  but that s hard to grade when all one is doing is playing machines  The cocktail waitresses were ok as well and yes we tipped them well The dealer tainers were entertaining and fun to watch No  I will not be staying there again 
P =>  HONEST opinion of Imperial Palace Firstly  I was very apprehensive after booking this Hotel because of all the bad reviews it has been given  Now that my husband and I have stayed there  I am giving a totally honest opinion from our   night stay Checking In   Checking Out   There was a bit of a queue  which took approx    mins to get through  but hey  this is Vegas  and the influx of people coming and going is phenomenal  We found both checking in and out no problem and were given a choice of a king size bed or two queen beds in the Deluxe Rooms  Room   We chose the   bedded room on a smoking floor  Our room was on   th floor   top of the hotel         The beds were actually two double beds  and the room was fine  The beds were very comfortable  and I am fussy with my bed   Bathroom was fine with bath and shower  Shower was spot on  Small balcony in the room which was ideal for me smoking as my husband is a non smoker  By the way  being on a smoking floor did not really affect him and he actually said  it wasnt bad at all i e smell etc  The only problem I found all week  is that the cleaners are not that great  My ashtray remained on the balcony and was never emptied  nor was the balcony swept at all  The room was fine overall and you get what you pay for after all  so all these people moaning and complaining  I would say  spend more and stay at The Mirage  Bellagio or MGM  We actually did spend my birthday night in a penthouse suite at The Mirage  suprise from my husband  and it was absolutely fantastic   like staying in a Palace  but the price matches what you get  Casino   My husband said he preferred Imperial Palace Casino as he said it was lively compared to the other casino s which he found a bit boring with not much atmosphere  IP Casino  with Dealertainers did liven things up  and we did have a few laughs with people around the bar area s  All other Casino s we went in  everyone seemed to keep themselves to themselves and seemed to frightened to  quot mix quot  Food   We only ate breakfast once at the hotel  so cannot comment  other than the breakfast was  quot a breakfast quot  and was fine  Some good places to eat would be Magaritaville  to left of hotel    LOVELY  My favourite was Tony Roma s which is in Binnions Casino in Fremont Street  Absolutely fantastic and reasonable  Ribs and Steaks to kill for  and have half an Onion Loaf with your main course MMMmmmm   We also found the Buffet at Harrah s very good and ate there a few times  Loads to choose from and all very good  We came out of there absolutely stuffed  So many good choices of dishes  we just had to try them all       Drinks in Binnions Casino are also very cheap   we had Vodka and coke and JD and coke for        Couldnt belive it   You can also have you photo taken for free  and put in a nice folder  with             Great souvenier TIPS   I would advise casual clothes and very  very comfy shoes as you will be doing a lot of walking  Best way to get around  we found  is the deuce bus  which runs    hours from one end of strip to the other     hr pass is     Well worth it  Just pay as you get on the double decker bus  They run about every       mins Swimming Pool AreaSituated on  nd Floor and we thought one of the best pools we had ever been too for atmosphere and fun  The pool is small and not a patch on the pools in most of the other hotels   but what fun we had  DJ around the pool playing great music from    s     s and    s and many a time people would be up singing and dancing   great fun  Burgers around the pool very good too Elevators   SLOW      We were there   nights and never  and I am saying NEVER had to wait longer than   mins for an elevator  Lucky  Who knows  but no problem experienced from us at all Anyway  enjoy your stay in Vegas   we did  
P =>  Location michigan The location on the strip is perfect  Walking distance to many attrations and casinos Yes the elevators were slow but they were working  Granted this is not a high end hotel but for the price I can not see a better value on the strip  Rooms were clean  service was good and the casino had a good variety of machine to play  Take your waling shoes and enjoy  
P =>   would still stay again if price right Have stayed at a number of hotels in vegas over my years of visiting  and a number of times at this hotel  Chosen because very cheap price and central in strip so easy to get to all attractions Rooms are very clean with   big comfortable beds TV and table and chairs The parking however is a long walk and the elevators took a long time to come  we were on   floor  The pool area was very noisy  
P =>   Grimy Rooms in perfect location Cons  We came for the World Series of Poker tournament and this hotel was one advertising special rates for players  The front desk staff  although courteous  were not aware of the special discount and we spent around    minutes  on top of waiting in line for    minutes  to get it all sorted out and into our rooms  We had booked a non smoking  quot deluxe quot  room with a King bed  While we were aware that this was a budget hotel  if what we got was  quot deluxe quot  then i wonder what passes for  quot standard quot   The carpet was mildewy  stained and the entire room reeked of old cigarettes and body odour  Neither the tub nor the sink drained properly at all   the most disgusting aspect of our stay  The bed was actually   bouncy twins wrapped held together by a thin king fitted sheet  Bedding was of course the cheapest  scratchiest type  The elevators were often out of service  No mini fridge in the room  We had a very old tube TV in the room Room service was incredibly expensive   with breakfast sides starting at    and going up to     for eggs Pros Wifi was available and working at a cost  AC worked fine TV actually had   working channels  Dry cleaners offered alteration services Very convenient access to monorail and free shuttle service on the strip Thank god it s situated within walking distance to the Venetian The lobby floor is noisy  smoky and cramped  The overall feel of the resort is outdated  faded  crowded and disconcerting  Would NEVER stay here again  
P =>   Aweful Place to stay  The Imperial Palace is definately a hotel I would not stay again The carpet in the rooms were stained with whatever Bathtub was dirty  Very old and out dated TV  Smoke alarms were rusty  and the general appearance of this hotel is terrible  Elevators are old  dirty and chipped railing Pool lounge chairs are old  mildewed  and disgusting to lay down on  Water in the pool was not heated and there was very little security as to who can use the pool I would not eat at this hotel after seeing the decline in appearance and unsanitary conditions  It s a dump  
P =>   Perfect Location  I cannot fault this hotel  it may not look as amazing as the Bellagio or the Venetian  but it is centre of the Strip and very easy to get to all the main attractions We stayed for   nights for my partner s   th  and we had a choice between saving           each staying at the Imperial  or staying in a better hotel like MGM or Venetian  So we decided that we wouldn t be in our hotel that much anyway and should just spend that money on shopping and roulette instead  The rooms were spacious and clean  even had a mini balcony for some fresh air  and the pool area had loads of sunbeds Would definitely visit again as such great value for money  I also recommend the bar in front of Imperial called Rockhouse for daytime beer pong and frozen margaritas  
P =>   Very dirty and not very helpful staff We stayed at the Capri rooms after asking several personnel  who just said down the hall  we found the room after about    minutes  Very sad the directions to get to the room and walked a long way to get to the casino or anywhere within the main section of the hotel  The rooms are very run down and felt dirty and not very clean  One of the worse hotels I have stayed at  If you are into the retro decor looks like it s been neglected a long time you can get beyond the stained carpet and dirty bathrooms  Drains didn t work well  I talked with others in the capri rooms who felt the same way  The price is not worth the value  
P =>   Cheap and Good If you want a clean hotel room on the cheap  we paid     a night   located right smack in the middle of the strip  with casino  food and shopping all in one place  this is it  They even have a free shuttle from to the airport  Expect no luxury  this is strictly a functional stay  You get a clean bed  trust me  I even took apart the bed looking for bedbugs  found none but did find a new matress and clean linens   If you want more luxury  go to the Montecarlo accross the street  Check in was fast  we arrived early so the bell boys securely stored our bags away until check in time  The Dealertainers will remind you were you are on a nightly basis  The casino is adequate  but kinda crammed  Great and cheap base of operations for your sojourn to Vegas  Tip  for a    tip on your pillow  you get great room service  
P =>   Loved this hotel First of all after reading the reviews I was skeptical  However  they were all wrong     Check in line was long  However it was Memorial day weekend Fri nite  they had all   stations going  The lined moved very fast  I got to choose my floor  and loud or quiet  When I got to my room I was very very happy  I booked the deluxe tub room  It was clean  and very very quiet  The hotel is very big  as all hotels on the strip are   Our room was clean and we never had any issues  Every room has a balcony that overlooks the hotel pool and a great view of Ceasars I would truly stay here again  If you are looking for cheap accomodation then you will get a room outside by the parking lot  which is NOT inside the main hote  However  if you can  get a regular room and you will be happy  The elevators move kind of slow  but again  if lots of people are staying there  its to be expected  The pool was fabulous  They had a live dj that Sat  the beer specials are awesome  Overall  I would definetly stay there again  We had no issues  
P =>   great value great value for the price  the elevators a little slow but they were doing the best they could do to fix it  would stay agian 
P =>   Better then Expected  After reading all of the negative reviews  I had very low expectations for this hotel and wasn t really looking forward to staying there  I was however pleasantly surprised by how much I liked this hotel  Our room was spacious  clean  quiet and comfortable  We loved the patio overlooking the pool area  We really enjoyed the entertainment in the casino with the dealers that impersonate stars like Alice Cooper  Michael Jackson  and Stevie Wonder   it was really fun to watch and created a lively atmosphere in the casino area  The location of the hotel is perfect and we were within walking distance of all the best hotels and hot spots  We loved the pool area which was great for lying out with a drink  Overall we had a great time and all of the staff members we came in contact with were helpful and friendly  I would definitely stay here again  Especially because it s a great deal  The only one negative comment I have is that the buffet was horrible  Even with it being so cheap I would never eat there again unless I was really desperate  Most of the food tasted funny and was cold  
P =>   Enjoyed my second stay here Stayed here before in      so knew what to expect and it had not changed much  Still offers very good rates for a great location  centre of strip really so near Venetian  Paris  Bellagio   This is not the best hotel on the strip by any means but room was fine and had no issues  Service adequate and lines were not too bad for checkin or for the elevators  The buffet breakfast was not bad but worth going to the Bellagio which costs maybe    more but was much better  Would stay here again  The casino is one of the more smoky ones on the strip so non smokers may like this less  
P =>   Excellent Location  We stayed here for   nights over Easter break  It s an ideal time for visiting Las Vegas as the heat wasn t too oppressive  unlike ust   The IP has a fabulous central strip location  It s a little bit tired  but for the money  I m not sure it can be beaten  The room was big and light and airy with a comfortable bed and a small balcony with lovely views of the mountains at the back of the strip  When we checked in  we were given a choice of rooms and I would recommend one at the back with this view   much quieter The bathroom was a bit dark  but the shower had incredible water pressure   it gave a massage at the same time  An excellent start to the day The hotel itself was like a rabbit warren   get the wrong lift and you walk around for a while  Quite a few eating choices  reasonably priced   although in Las Vegas  you can go anywhere A great base  but could do with a facelift perhaps  For what we paid though  it was great value  
P =>   Location location location That s the best thing about the place  It seriously needs an upgrade overhaul When we reserved  we were told that the beds were Queens  but they were only full sized The rooms haven t been upgraded since my last trip there    years ago  The bedspreads were very worn With that said  the location is awesome  Also  please get some new entertainment   we saw the Luau  the car museum  and Legends in      already  
P =>   Centre Strip great location you don t spend much time in your room in Vegas anyway Stayed here for   nights and had a high floor strip view room  Great view of the strip however it is loud  and the music is still continuing at   in the morning  It can be so loud you can t hear your tv properly  If you come to vegas though  you don t come to spend time in your room so it was great for us Great Drink prices in the bar downstairs  We had a smoking room and I m not a smoker but the smell was bearable  There were occassions where we would come up to our room and all you could smell was marajuana  Obviously the security in the building don t care what goes on in the rooms  Don t expect a  star hotel the pool is nice but always packed so we used the hotel harrahs next door   This is fine as they are both owned under the same company   Would be great to have a fridge in your room though Would I stay here again   be  but probably just pay a little bit extra and stay at Harrah s or Flamingos which is right next to it This is one of the cheapest hotels on the strip  so if your looking for a bed to sleep on and nothing more imperial palace is great  
P =>   Great bargain Vegas hotel  poker players This hotel isn t plush  and it isn t trendy  but it is clean  small  and perfect for those who aren t in their room much  Poker players love it here  Rooms are clean  but basic  and a bit old fashioned  It is also a lot cheaper than some others  so if you are spending a lot on upgraded flights  and want to make a saving elsewhere  here is great  I liked the fact it was not snobby  it was chilled out  and a bit tacky  The Dealatainers  and fun Great central strip location  and super cheap rates  
P =>   No luxury but clean and in a great location This is a hotel that offers the basics  Clean sheets  clean towels  hot water  cable TV  If you re looking for Vegas luxury  look elsewhere  If you need a bargain hotel in a good location  stay at the Imperial Palace  
P =>   Do not stay here  We spent   nights here and what a dump  During our stay we only got maid service once  the elevators were scary and the room was a nightmare  We gambled approx        here only received       in comps          it was pathetic  The only good thing about this hotel is the location  but I would rather stay at the MGM or Bally s as they are on the monorail route and easy to get anywhere from these two locations  The Buffet here was horrible and we will never stay at the Imperial Palace again  
P =>   Will never stay again My reservations got lost even though I called to confirm and my credit card had already been charged  Everyone I talked to about it was rude and it never got resolved  The place is a dump  The  quot deluxe quot  room looks like it would be at a motel    The housekeeper came once and didn t even really clean up  The pool is also a piece of crap and the waitress walking around the pool had horrible service  I will never stay there again or recommend it to anyone  
P =>   So Much Fun Let me say I love staying at the IP  It s not the most luxrious place in town  but they make me feel welcome everytime my girlfriend and I stay there  I could stay at other hotels that are also owned by Harrah s Resorts  and most always for free  but the thing is I like the IP  This time around we stayed in the Deluxe King Suite which was comped the whole time we were there  The room has been remodeled and was very nice and comfortable and very large  It also had a wet bar  I recommend the   th floor  We had a really nice view overlooking the pool and a great view of the mountains  We just love the room  Oh and it also had a very large love tub with mirrored walls all the way around  The bed also had a mirror above on the ceiling  Once you leave the room be sure to explore the hotel to see all that it has  If you like Karaoke then you are in luck  They have karaoke every night  The IP also has several pretty darn good places to eat some good food when you are hungry  The IP also has somewhat of a convienence store that is open    hours  Now be sure to go next door to Harrah s also for some great dueling pianos before you leave town  I could go on and on but beleive me you can t beat the Imperial Palace for location and price  Cheapest place to stay on the strip  If you have any questions please don t hesitate to ask  Thanks and have a great time if you choose the Imperial Palace  
P =>   Great Deal For Strip Location Stayed at the IP      th   Great Deal for   Nights       USD for the Deluxe Room  Basic rooms with two queen beds  Clean rooms  large bathroom  Hotel had room included balcony that overlooked the Hahara s Pool All in all Great deal for location  
P =>   Not bad at all  Wow   after reading some reviews about this hotel I was really impressed by what we found when we arrived  Some people wrote bad reviews but this is definately not one of them  Overall the hotel is a very nice place to stay for the money  For its age  the place is in very good condition and the rooms are spacious and comfortable  The casino floor is always rocking and the slots are fair  The view of the strip from the   th floor at night was stunning  Our room overlooked the carnival tent and listening to the bands play were a great way to wind down late at night  Sure  a lot of people would like to have a nice quiet place to sleep  but this is Las Vegas  Unfortunately we did not get to eat at all the dining spots  but the Burger Palace does a great burger and the beer is always ice cold  The only bad thing about our trip was a minor problem with some elevators  Other than that  I would definately recommend Imperial Palace as a good hotel to stay in  Dennis Lewis 
P =>   Best value for location and FUN  Imperial Palace used to show its age much more  but having stayed there a dozen plus times I can tell you the remodeled rooms are quite nice  Keep in mind  if you re booking Imperial you re doing so because it s a budget property  but based on that criteria  you ll be hard pressed to find a nicer budget hotel anywhere  I ve tried Stratosphere  Downtown  flamingo  Excalibur and other low rent properties  and nothing tops Imperial Palace  There s something about having your blackjack cards dealt to you by Alice Cooper  Madonna  Prince or Cher that puts a smile on your face  If you go in expecting a big casino operation  you ll be disappointed  But nighly Karaoke  fun atmosphere  a fair selection of restaurant choices  and a truly fun rock  n roll casino make this feel more like a Carnival cruise than a Vegas setting  Right across the street from Caesar s Palace in the heart of The Strip  it s right where you want to be  at a price     below the big boys  Count me in  Baby  
P =>   Don t let the poor reviews keep you from saving a ton of money by staying here We just returned from a   day    night stay at the Imperial Palace  Based on recent reviews  I was very worried about what the casino and rooms would be like and considered booking elsewhere  I m very glad I saved my money and stuck with the IP  Was this the best place I ve ever stayed  no  it wasn t  but it also wasn t the worst  You get what you pay for  Our room was basic but the bed was comfortable and even for a smoking room  it wasn t bad  The bathroom was fine and the housekeeping staff did a great job of keeping you stocked with plenty of towels  The casino floor isn t the best but you are so close to other casino s  we like O Sheas and Casino Royale for the cheap drinks  that it wasn t a problem  The pool was fine  Plenty of lounge chairs  Try a Miami Vice drink poolside  Very tasty  Will we stay here the next time we come to Vegas  probably not but we never stay the same place twice  We will stay with a Harrah property  
P =>   great hotel just back from vegas and could not say a bad thing about this hotel the rooms are large and cleaned every day   would stay here again with no hesitation   
P =>   Not as Bad as I was expecting We stayed here for   nights from il    through il     When I checked in   I announced that I would be writing a review on TripAdvisor and preferred a quiet room on a higher floor  I got Room       on the   th floor at the back of the hotel  There was no great view parking lots and backs of buildings but NO NOISE  I felt for the people who were staying at the front of the hotel  especially the ones on lower floors  because there was a lot of noise on the strip  The room looked like a      s Holiday Inn room  There were   double beds  a good tv with local channels and a few cable channels  ESPN etc   a table with chairs  The a c worked fine  There was no safe a big negative that should be updated  The bathroom was standard with tub shower combo and a clean sink area  There were basic amenities such as shampoo and soap  The ice bucket was there also  and free ice was available near the elevators  about     feet away  Sometimes there were drunk people in the hallway  but that could occur anywhere  The elevators were slow as everybody states  but I never had to wait more than   minutes  There was usually entertainment from the drunk guests but nothing violent or offensive  The location was fantastic and was convenient to everything  I had breakfast in the restaurant on the  nd floor  It was not the best but was comped based on my Total Rewards a definite must for anyone staying at a Harrah s property  I had stayed at the Paris last ember and had been receiving offers ever since so I decided to return  but the only available place with a comp room was the Imperial Palace so that s where I stayed so great for the price  free   I also had received a coupon for   free buffets at the Rio so I took the free shuttle bus there for a fantastic buffet with something for everybody  The free shuttles leave from the Paris or Harrahs next door  They also give you a coupon book at check in so I got my free Flamingos and Harrahs tee shirts after about    minutes on the slots  There was also a discount coupon for the prime rib Chinese place at Bill s  but I didn t realize I had one until I ate there the first night an did not have a chance to return  The casino wasn t as smoky as I was expecting  and I had fun playing the slots and drinking free beers  I lost a few hundred but had a great time  I am planning another trip in the fall and hope to stay at another Harrah s property so I can continue to sample them all  Good luck to all  
P =>   Perfect location great value for money I loved this hotel  it was recomended to me by a good friend so I knew it would be ok  but after seeing some reviews I didn t have high expectations  I was pleasently surprised when we turned up  we had a room on the  th floor at the back with a view of the mountains  it was very quiet at night  The location of this hotel is just spot on  right in the middle of thr strip  opposite Ceaser s Palace   last time I stayed in the Excalibur and it was just too far away from all the buzz of the Strip  It s an old school Hotel  with a dated Casino but I thought it just added to the experience of being in Vegas   take the old with the new I say and just enjoy the whole experience  The Casino has a Celebrity look a like pit and they have the best Elvis I ve ever seen  and Freddie Murcury was excellent as well  The pool was good and the frozen cocktails were delishious    out of      will recomend this hotel to everyone I know who is going to Vegas  
P =>   can t beat this place stayed may      Asked if we could be upgraded at check in and was given a nice suite on   th floor  All the staff was very friendly and nice  The bed was very comfortable and the pressure in the shower is great  You can t beat this place for the value and great location  Thank you to everyone at IP  
P =>   great location  We have just booked our  th trip to Vegas  amp  will be staying at the IP for the  rd time  You have to remember that you get what you pay for  The location is fantastic  ask for a quiet room when you check in and it s fine  Although not luxurious  rooms have basics e g toiletries  hairdryer  TV   anyway  how much time do you spend in your room when in Vegas    Bus stops are close  free shuttle from Harrahs to the Rio  also Starbucks for that late night coffee  Dennys for breakfast All in all a good value place to stay   the money you save on a more expensive hotel can be spent on trips  food  gambling etc  
P =>   Working class crowd with great location I stayed here for five nights at the start of  for Boxing The hotel is in the middle of the strip across from ceasers palace great location The atmosphere in the Imperial is great at the bars due to the working class clientele that stay here You can have a drink and a laugh it is no problem great fun The hotel is always busy which adds to the atmosphere We had a strip view room which was great although the noise from carnival court is loud and lasts from   am until   am so if you want peace make sure you dont get a strip view room The pool is adequate For a budget hotel with a great location choose the Imperial we had a ball The other hotels in Vegas are more classier ceasers mandalay mgm etc but have absolutely no atmosphere and are not worth the extra money    
P =>  Pay a few more dollars and go somewhere nicer We paid    USD a night and you get what you pay for  The rooms are very dated and feel dirty and grimey  The casino attracts a pretty dodgy crowd  If I went again I would pay      USD and stay somewhere like the Venetian which was gorgeous  Was located in a good spot on the strip  
P =>  Don t believe the bad reviews its excellent    Just returned from Las Vegas and stayed at the imperial palace  dont believe the poor reviews  the hotel couldnt be better located  its clean and got everything you need  Right in the middle of the strip  better located than MGM or Mandalay bay  The hotel has its own monorail stop which is so convienient but the deuce bus is better value and again stops right outside  The imperial palace may not be the poshest hotel but if you just need a value for money hotel in a fantastic location then dont look anywhere else  
P =>  OK but           Checked in Monday night        staff was friendly  Our room on the   th floor at first seemed ok  but I noticed a partially used complimentary shampoo left on the tub shelf by the previous occupants  Then a moth died in front of the patio door and it was STILLTHERE on Friday morning       when we checked out  I of course assume the room was not vacuumed properly or at all  Then on Friday morning as we were packing up I noticed a blood spot on the bedspread  Didn t see that prior  or I would have brought itto someones attention  Location is fabulous  Burger place not the greatest  Did not try the buffet  Too many timeshare people right near the elevator  And I would have likedan in room coffee pot  Why don t hotels have this amenity  Dealertainers are fabulous It was my first stay there and probably my last  Too bad  its such a bargain price wise  and as long as business is down  they should see that the customers they do have are happy  
P =>  Stay There All The Time I have really never had any issues  other than they need more people at check in I stay there every time I go out to Vegas and have never had any complaints If I wanted a high classed room and wanted to pay the price          I would stay at one of THOSE hotels             I just want a room that is clean and inexpensive with a good location and I have that with this hotel IF I had to pay more for a hotel  I would not be able to spend money on fun things to do  on shopping and certainly not on gambling  As they say   quot location location location quot  and they sure have that  
P =>  Great Value  I read the other reviews of the hotel before we booked and thought we would take a chance since some were good and some were bad  My wife and I had no real complaints  The hotel is located in a great location  it was affordable  and we had a good time there  We stayed on the   th floor and was told it was the quieter section of the hotel by the desk clerk  Noise was definitely not an issue from our room  We only ate at the buffet for breakfast and it was average  They had a sign posted out side of what they were serving on it and that was a big help to decide whether or not to eat there  Another plus was that it was connected to the mono rail  After a couple of days of walking the strip  our legs were sore and the mono rail came in handy  As I said before the location was great  The Mirage was across the street  Harrahs was right next door and other places like the Venetian  Treaure Island  and Fashion Show Mall were within a short walking distance  The people staying at the hotel were a mixture of young and old  So I really couldn t say which age group was more dominant there  I also seen other reviews of people talking about a weird smell in the place  Neither my wife nor I noticed it  Overall the hotel was a great place for us to stay for our first trip to Vegas  Would I stay there again  the answer is yes  
P => location excellent had a great stay at this hotel  its location is excellent for exploring all of the strip  only complaint dont get a room overlooking Harrahs as you will be kept awake till  pm with the live music  rooms large  clean and comfy would recommend this as a budget hotel  
P =>  Amazing location I had read a few bad reviews for this hotel so I was expecting the worst but was pleasantly surprised  Ok you get what you pay for  It s a basic hotel but it was clean  the shower was wonderfully powerful and the rooms were a decent size  It provided us with somewhere to sleep which is all you really need in Vegas  Who goes to Vegas to stay in their hotel room  I d heard that rooms at the front of the hotel could be noisy and certainly we could hear the bands on at the Carnival Court quite clearly but as soon as we switched on the air conditioning it drowned out everything else  I didn t have a problem sleeping  The Imperial Palace is forgiven all of it s flaws when you walk out onto the strip into the middle of everything  The location is amazing and  with the price  this hotel is a bargain  
P =>  great value best location great variety of restaurants in over    years of coming to the IMPERIAL palace  we have never had a bad time in our experience over the years  the average traveler can have a great time without having to break the bank  most of the newer hotels are nice but they don t have the friendly feeling that you have at the I P   
P =>  Great value for money   ideal location This hotel is located in an ideal location right in the heart of the Vegas strip  opposite Ceaser s Palace   It s true that the rooms are a little dated and worn  however during my stay they were cleaned every day to a good standard  This may not be the best place to stay if you re having a romantic getaway with your partner  but is an ideal place to come if you re in a group of friends wanting to make the most of the Vegas nightlife This is certainly not a luxury hotel however my overall rating reflects the value for money that I think this place offers  
P =>  What a dump   This is probably the worst hotel I ve ever stayed in  It is one step above prison  The hotel is old and rundown  The d cor is really outdated  It was probably considered fashionable when it opened about    years ago  The hotel a damp  smell to it  And to make it worst  the tub did not drain when showering  So while taking a shower you have water up to your ankles  The beds were pretty uncomfortable too  The only positive was the location  Its right in the middle of the strip  The front desk staff was pleasant as well  The only people who should stay here are the    and under crowd who just needs somewhere to store there luggage while our partying  
P =>  Bargain rate for Outstanding location Stayed at the IP with a group of friends for   nights from  th il  We were a bit concerned after reading some reviews  however these just seemed to not be true or to be based on unrealistic expectations Anyone from Europe or Australia should not have any concern about staying here  The rooms were in good condition  clean and at     a night excellent value  The location of this hotel is simply fantastic  Contrary to reports on this site we did not have any problems with waiting for elevators  long check in  no dirty rooms  no dirty sheets and we had no expectations of having coffee machines etc in our rooms  What do some people expect for     a night Quite simply I would stay at the IP again on any future visits to Vegas  The IP is not the best hotel  but it never claims to be  It is what it seems a well located  bargain rate hotel in an excellent mid strip location  
P => Second stay at Imperial palace and would stay again  Stayed at the Imperial Palace from il   th thru   th  This was our second stay at the Imperial Palace and would definately come back  Room was clean  staff very courteous and helpful  Asked for a room with a vier of the Strip and was advised that it would be noisey  Appreciated this information but said that wouldn t bother us and were given a room on the   th floor with a view  The only thing was that the   th floor is where the Imperial Palace sign was so view was limited  Previous stay we were on the   th floor and view was much better  Do however think that there could be a better choice of eating places at the Imperial Palace  Because of the limited choices we chose to eat elsewhere  Did enjoy breakfast at the Tea House Whenever in Las Vegas will make the Imperial Palace our choice of a place to stay  
P =>   The Motel   of Vegas Strip Hotels This was our first time at IP  but not at Harrah s properties or Vegas  This was definitely the lowest quality hotel I have ever stayed at in Vegas  I have stayed at Excalibur  Harrah s  Pallazo  Mirage   amp  NY NY  This was definite y a case of  quot you get what you pay for quot  or in our case what you don t pay for  There is very little luxury at this property  but it is dirt cheap for strip hotels  Lobby and casino is out dated and not much appeal  The restaurants are nothing to brag about  but I would avoid room service and head down to the    hour burger joint  it s cheaper  The pool was nice and service was very courteous  amp  towels were clean and fairly good quality LOCATION  LOCATION  LOCATION    That is what you are paying for with IP  You are in the middle of the strip with easy access to Caesars  amp  Mirage across the street as well as Venetian Pallazo up the street  Metro at the back of the property is also convenient Stay sleep here and gamble at other Harrah s properies  amp  casinos to get your money s worth  This hotel serves no virtually no other functions  
P =>   Never again We stayed here as part of a very good package deal   should have paid a bit more for another hotel  We stayed on the   th and   th floors  try not to get a room on the upper floors  The elevators were always packed and took forever  The ladies restroom on casino level flooded and I was told to go to the  rd floor  Most casinos have at least two restrooms   one on each side  Not very friendly staff either  We had fun in spite of staying at Imperial Palace   they didn t eve acknowledge that it was my birthday when I checked in  When I go back  I will stay at Casino Royale  the casino is quite dumpy to some folks  When I stay there everyone is very nice to me and the rooms have been redone  
P =>   Great Location decent rooms lousy food and awful elevators  This hotel is in a great location center strip  Who could complain    The  quot noisy quot  side is truly  quot noisy quot   My family and friends and I all stayed on the   th Floor  Big mistake  The elevators were SLOW and CROWDED all the time  We found   sets of elevators and you could easily wait about    minutes to get up or down  The buffet sucked  Do not spend your money there  In the midwest and the south  you get hot crab legs and whole ones  I have never been served cold crab legs that have been sliced in half  I was venture over to Harrah s for better food  
P =>   its not as bad as I thought it would be Well I will say this   the location is prime  Considering where it is its a cheap hotel  With that being said  this is an old hotel  There are a lot of things that need to be updated  the rooms  elevators  restaurants  The food at the cafe is of poor quality  Eat some where else  The rooms are average  just the basic necessities  I stayed in room      The bathroom is in dire need of remodeling but its not horrible  If you get a room that is facing the strip get ready for lots of noise all day and all night  You see  the Carnival Bar is located right below you  and anyone trying to get some sleep will definitely be woken up  The windows don t stop any of the noise from coming in but on the flip side of that you have balconies that you can walk out on and watch the party at the bar  The elevators are the worst part of this hotel  Sometimes we waited    mins for the elevators and sometimes we had to wait for the next elevator which was the same elevator because only one was running   Chances are I would never stay here again but for anyone who has to stay here its do able  I would say the elevators were the worst part of the entire stay  
P =>   Stay away    Nasty  tacky hotel  We got the room for free through our Harrahs reward points  I would have preferred to pay for a room else where  Rough sheets  rough towels  old shower love tub combo with no curtain  Tacky mirrors everywhere  In the shower  over the bed       Front desk won t even answer their phones  The world s slowest elevators   you will literally wait for      minutes for an elevator to open up for you  Don t bother taking the stairs up every single floor is locked  Flea market quality shops in the lobby  I will never ever stay at this hotel again  Hope this place gets demolished soon   it s time to make way for a high class hotel  
P =>   Do not bother a waste of money Arrived over Easter    on the   th floor the music from the front nightclub until  am in the mornings had our room walls moving and at  am the planes start landing every    minutes  so hang on to your bed      but the best thing was the fire alarm going off every   minutes from  am Easter Saturday till     am       we had people on the   th floor with little understanding of English attempting to go down fire escapes    the only communication of the problem  please stay in your room we are checking if its a false alarm  when I went down with my family to highlight our concerns no one at the front counter had heard of the issues   on the   th floor    NO ATTEMPT BY ANY EMPLOYEE OR MANAGER OF THE IMPERIAL TO SAY SORRY    SO DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY
