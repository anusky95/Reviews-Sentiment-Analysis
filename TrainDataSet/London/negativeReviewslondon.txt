N =>   Througly enjoyed our stay As we were staying in Vegas for   nights   we wanted more than a hotel room and something that was free of gambling  at least for someof the time  and this property delivered The staff went out of their way to be friendly and answer any questions we had   As a HH gold member they also provided several little  quot gifts quot  of cookies and water  which were above what we normally recieve Any minor problems were quickly remedied such as missing pots or glasses My only minor criticism was that this is a slightly more dated HGV than some of the others i have stayed in but that was more than compensated by staff attention Well worth the slight extra in price rather than a regular Hilton room 
N =>   Great Place  Of the three places we stayed at in Vegas  my boyfriend n i enojoyed this place the most  The room had everything we would need for a comfortable stay  kitchen counter sink  small frig w  freezer  microwave along w  the normal admenties  The hotel had free washers dryers for their guest  you just have to buy the detergent    The room was a good size even though i booked the smallest studio there was available  the room looked great  not cheaply put together  w  it s own thermostat                         the cons wld have been that there was construction nearby and the parking garage was not attached to the hotel  nor was there a covered walkway  and boy was it cold outside the last two nites we were in vegas    the thermostat didn t have actual numbers to indicate what the temperature really was  but that was ok since it was very easy to use n efficent not a bulky window unit   and the toilet in our room was very slow n actually clogged up the last day we were there   but considering our stays at the other hotels and the general layouts of other hotels we visited in vegas the small inconvenience at the Hilton paled in comparison   if i was to revisit vegas i would definately book a room here again  
N =>   No problems   pretty good place to stay Our friends who have timeshare through the Hilton chain let us stay here for a night while we were in Vegas and it turned out to be not that bad  There was a nice kitchen area with all the necessities  which was useful  The jacuzzi tub was large and the shower area was clean  The bed and bedroom area in general were spacious and pretty comfy  The Sahara was within walking distance  The hotel provides a coupon book for various things like breakfast coupons  meals  etc  They serve Starbucks in the cafe downstairs  There was also a pull out sofa in the living room if needed  The room service was friendly and housekeeping was efficient  Overall  our stay there was nice with no problems  Hope this helps  
N =>   Great place near monorail We agree that the hotel was great  suprisingly so given some of the reviews  We also had a suite  upgrade    not sure why  and the two rooms were more than needed and fabulous  The key was how quiet it was  The room  the lobby  the deli  etc  No waiting in line to check in  no worries getting a bell service to check our bags when we left  no worries getting a taxi  A couple things to be aware    The deli closes at       and there no room service     It is an easy walk  probably     ft   on a small sidewalk past the parking garage to the hilton for restraurants  gambling and the monorail    Don t take the trolley from the Hilton    it is slow  Take the monorail    Tell your taxi driver from the airport to go not take the freeway  It is an easy shot using the back roads to the hotel  Our cab ride was     from the airport and less than     back  
N =>  excellent Vegas hotel We had a king studio  spacious for the two of us  This property is very clean  Comfortable bed  good water pressure in the shower  double sinks in bathroom  flat screen TV in the living room  normal TV in bedroom   The air conditioning worked great and was silent  We heard no noise from the hallway or neighbors  No complaints about this place  everything worked  The location is definitely not central     minute walk to the Hilton to catch the monorail  but that did not bother us  We usually stay at the Westin Causarina  but we booked this one with Hilton Honors points and were not disappointed  
N =>   loved it First of all  it s on the Las Vegas Hilton property but not attached  it s own seperate hotel but easy walking distance to the Hilton  Enjoyed the room very much  especially the hot tub  Friendly staff  a nice pool but small  used for sunbathing mostly  But would go back again  
N =>  Beautiful room but loud children in the pool on   afternoons We stayed in a beautifully decorated one bedroom suite with a kitchen and FREE internet  The suite was very clean  No organized activities but it is not necessary in Vegas  The cart to take bags to the room was not available without the bellboy  who was never available when we needed him  The  quot no baggage cart without a bellboy quot  was annoying as we had too many computers  bags  and groceries to wait around for a bellboy with cart  We had a one bedroom  very spacious  but it was a lockoff with a studio next door and we could hear the people next door when we were in the living room  The little convenience store onsite and the bar by the pretty pool are nice conveniences not all timeshares have  We liked the free acres of parking  including the covered parking  We used the Las Vegas Hilton to gamble in and found the block walk fine for us but more incapacitated guests complained about the inconvenience of the timeshare location  Very pleasant  helpful staff Noisy children on two afternoons ruined the ambiance of the pool  No staff corrected the children  who shouted  quot co quot   quot Polo quot  for what seemed like hours  We just left  disappointed our sunshine time by the pool was spoiled  Otherwise  we loved our time at the HGVC  it was our  nd time there  
N =>  Average and miles away We got here after a poor experience at another property  Room excellent  Taxi scarce  Staff super good  Price OK  Pool looked great  sorry  convention attendee so didn t get to lounge around it  I ll be back with family  If you want to be close to the strip  go elsewhere  
N =>  Not that great my shower was broken and never was fixed  also my toilet clogged  The maid service did a half way job one day  Beside that it was ok  it was nice to have a fridge and a microwave in the room  
N =>  Poor Maintenance  This is a nice property but definitely not one of the newer facilities  The location is OK for most things as it is close to the monorail and trolley if you don t want to walk or take a taxi  The main problem was that the  adjustable  shower head would only provide a poor cone shaped flow and could not be set to the standard multiple streams produced by most showers  This was reported to the front desk twice before any action was taken and after it was  fixed  it still would not produce multiple streams but just a better flow of the cone spray  Also the quality of the bedding is inferior to what should be expected in this type of a resort  Motel   linens and pillows    Overall a decent place to sleep at night but not what should be expected from a Hilton Resort  
N =>   nice but not the best for vacationers We stayed here for a long weekend in ruary       It s a bit off the beaten path  not  quot on quot  the strip  BUT it is right on the monorail and at the convention center  It s nice  but not as nice as I had imagined a  quot grand vacation quot  property to be  We went next door to gamble in the Las Vegas Hilton casino    walking back after gambling and drinking was a bit of an adventure  My only complaint worth sharing was the location     it wasn t as centralized as I would have hoped  although we were both up for walking   a LOT  We literally walked the whole strip  and took the monorail back   I wouldn t stay here again unless I was in town for business  attending a tradeshow at the convention center  There are better values in Vegas than this hotel  
N =>   CHANGE IF YOU CAN Our stay at the Hilton Grand Vacations at the Hilton  was OK  but there were a few little niggles i have to tell you about  Because we put the  quot do not disturb quot  sign on the door  the second and third mornings the maid decided to make as much noise as possible cleaning the room next to ours   opening and slamming drawers  hoovering  running the bath for ages   while cleaning the rest of the room  in order to wake us up and hopefully get us out of the room so she could clean it  TOUGH    just because it was Christmas  I suppose she wanted to finish early   but we were on holiday as well    The third day i went down to reception and asked if anyone was staying in that particular room  I was told that there was someone staying in it   so they did their own cleaning did they   After that though  the noise stopped It got to be quite expensive getting to the strip every day   the monorail is not cheap  and taxis usually cost around     one way  Sometimes we walked to the stip  but some days it was quite cold  and we had to get alternative transport  When we were going back to the hilton at night  we still had to walk from the strip when we got off the bus  around a         minute walk    and it was very cold at nightIf you have the choice  stay at the one on the strip  There is a bus stop right outside   so much more convenient  and better when travelling back after a night out   
N =>  Great place to stay  We stayed there in il and returned in y  This time we stayed in a studio and it was spacious  We are not Hilton Time Share Owners  We don t belong to their club  We think this is the best place to stay in Vegas  for us   Close to the monorail  easy parking  Not good getting luggage in and out of car  but we took care of it  No complaints  no problems  very clean  
N =>  Loved the hotel We consider ourselves hotel snobs  We like our space  who likes a room which is narrow and contrived  We were in Vegas because I was turning     We are up wolrdly mibile  have money to spend  and fit    lossely translates to yes we are able to be mobile  amp  walk  we like what we like and will spend money not just on accommodation but on a variety of Vegas products like shows bars  restaurants  attractions  amp  gambling So now that you understand who we are    if you are similar    we stayed in a bedroom    Buckets of room    bedroon  jacuzzi  bathroon  kitchen and living space   BEDROOM  Kingsize bed  telly   arm chair   JACUZZI  No bubble bath supplied by hotel    or bring you re own   BATHROOM  Double sink  walk in shower   KITCHEN  Full fridge freezer  micromwave  washer driver  dishwasher   fully equipedWe loved it  We would walk down on Flamingo to they Wynn  And then get shuttle hot Brill hotel alll in all 
N =>  Two Thumbs Up  We stay at the Hilton             and were very pleased with our stay  We asked the check in lady if any upgrades to suites were available and she put us in a mini suite  no charge   in the north tower that had a great view of the strip  The room was huge and very clean and nice  The bathroom was very nice and had a huge tub with jets and another separate shower  We thought it might be inconvenient to stay off the strip but the monorail worked out great for us   took us everywhere we wanted to go  Only time we had to take a cab was when we went to dinner at the Palms  dinner at Nine and drinks at Ghost bar  highly recommend both     Had the brunch buffet at the hotel on Sunday morning  I would rate it as below average compared to the others I have eaten at hotels on the strip  Food was fine but the variety was lacking  Overall we had a great stay  
N =>   Great stay Everything was great from start to finish in this hotel  Check in was speedy  room was very nice  view of mountains great  room service prompt  The addition of the mono rail is imperative as the trolly ride to the strip was endless due to the number of people and stops made  Would definately return  
N => Glad we stayed here  We had reservations to stay at another property for   nights  which was one of those super cheap      a nights  We booked the last   nights here at the Hilton  so we could at least have something booked that we could trust  Thank goodness we did not stay all nights at the Budg O Motel  Our big mistkae was not to book all nights at the Hilton Grand  Our room was like a large aprtment  and had lots of luxuries we did not expect  It had a big whirlpool tub  and a seperate shower  The kitchen was big and had everything in it to cook with   There is a VCR and we rented a movie in the deli on the first floor to watch in our room  We felt very spoiled  and tried to forget the previous   nights  This place is a must visit  It is also walkable to the LV Hilton  nextdoor  where you can do the Star Trek experience  Pretty Cool  
N =>  sorry to disagree with all the good reviews    I just finished my stay at the Hilton grand vacation on Karen avenue  Let s get right to the problems    My plane was an hour late   sitting on the runway   after traveling all day  I was informed that my room was GIVEN AWAY due to overbooking  After much complaining  I was finally given a temporary room that smelled so badly of cigarrette smoke  I woke up with a headache and stuffed nose    I am now missing one article of clothing  a leather purse  and another personal item   all were in my room when I first arrived    My trash was never emptied and dirty soap was left in my room   of course that was before the theft at which time I had to make sure that no one would come in my room and I had to put the  do not disturb  sign on my door    I was told by the concierge that I needed    hours notice for airport shuttle even though the brochure in the room said that you only needed two hours notice  I subseqently called the airport shuttles and got a shuttle   no problem    hours in advance of my departure    I will never stay at this hotel again  
N =>  Very Pleased I agree with everyone who says that the location of the HGVC is inconvenient  However  we rented a car since parking everywhere on the strip is free and the car price was only     per day  Otherwise  our   bedroom suite was beautiful  and the pool area was nice  We were able to walk over to the Las Vegas Hilton to use their restaurant and casino facilities when we didn t feel like making the trek to the strip  Besides the location  we were very happy with our stay  We enjoyed being able to come back to our room away from the strip to relax  
N =>  Being OFF the strip is a big disadvantage   You will need a car or you ll have alot of walking to do   We thought by being  quot just off the strip quot  would be advantageous but we found it to be a total pain    We will opt to be ON the strip whenever we travel to Las Vegas again  It may look to be a short distance to the strip but it s a LONG walk in     degree weather   
N =>  Fabulous but no family friendly Our trip was in late il of       We had an incredible two bedroom that was very comfortable and very nice  The staff that we encountered were wonderful except for the concierge  The HGVC s book states that  quot Regardless of your request  you will most likely find that the Concierge Staff can offere assistance with virtually any arrangements  quot  This was one of the two very disappointing piece of our vacation  We were ignored by the concierge staff and not helped in the slightest  One example was when we requested information about a boat trip on Lake Mead we were told the the brochures were in the corner  Disappointed but not willing to give up  I specifically asked about her making reservations for us and she said there was a number in the brochure  The second of two disappointing pieces of our vacation was on Saturday  A fraternity was there for thier formals  The pool side was full of underage drinking  groping and fondling  foul language to an extreme  and broken glass  This was next to people with children   families  I was so glad my daughter was not with us  I was surprised with HGVC that they didn t attempt to tone down the fraternity college kids at all  I really enjoyed my trip  but I wouldn t call it a family place  and I would not expect to use the concierge staff  
N =>  Can t beat this place  
N =>  it was OK  
N =>  Great place to stay  
N =>  Wonderful addition to the Hilton properties  
N =>  Great overnighter Not a huge amount of things to do in the way of amenities  but a perfect place to stay overnight on business  Great accessibility  close to some good restaurants and bars  but also far enough away to be quiet and peaceful  Book a room facing east and watch the sun rise across the mountain range   
N =>   Perfect for Business Meetings We just used this hotel for one of our regional company meetings  The entire experience was wonderful  from the first phone call the check out  we loved it  We use Holiday Inn s across the country for these but this has been the best hands down  The staff went out of their way to help us  We had an account manager change in the middle of the process but the new rep contacted us immediately with all her contact info  When we went to view the meeting room the night before it was set up wrong but within   hour it was corrected with out complaint or having to hassle anyone  We were very pleased with this hotel and I would stay there for personal as well  The rooms were clean and comfortable   I m a germaphobe so for me to say that means A LOT   I was entirely comfortable in this hotel  THANK YOU TO THE STAFF   
N =>  Beste Wahl f r ein Off Strip Hotel in Las Vegas  
N =>  Good hotel great staff clean modern and comfortable We arrived at the Holiday Inn Express  Nellis  after a long journey from Seattle  having been turned away in a not very gracious manner from the La Quinta Inn opposite  who did not honour our internet reservation  Despite feeling tired and annoyed  we immediately cheered up on seeing and entering the Holiday Inn Express  It looked nice from the outside   brand new  in fact   and from the inside  where we were welcomed and given a very nice room with two large and comfortable queen beds  tv  microwave  fridge  coffee maker and free internet access  There was coffee and tea available    hours a day adjacent to Reception  together with a soft drinks machine  A comprehensive buffet breakfast was provided  no extra cost  and in addition to a smallish outside pool  there was a small inside pool and gym The bedroom was a generous size and the bathroom was good and everywhere was clean and looked new The staff were just wonderful  We had a problem with our rental car   having loaded our suitcases in the morning with the engine running in order to cool the car with the air conditioning     the weather temperature was over     degrees     the car locked itself with the key inside  We tried repeatedly to telephone Budget car rental emergency assistance  but frustratingly only reached voicemail services  The smiling and truly helpful lady on Reception  together with her housekeeper  came to our rescue  calmed us down and solved our problems     and even refused to take a generous tip for their outstanding assistance in enabling us to be on our way We would definitely recommend this hotel for people wanting to stay in the Nellis area  Not a very nice part of Las Vegas  but good for us for one night as we were driving from Las Vegas to Zion National Park and wanted to be near the correct route in the morning  There was also a large Walmart opposite which was useful to buy a car fridge and supplies for the journey  I would also mention that there appears to be nowhere decent to eat in this area   all we could find was MacDonalds and Taco Bell  
N =>  Undiscovered Gem What an undiscovered oasis this place is  Stayed three days and was never disappointed once in all that time  Luxuriously appointed rooms that were impeccably maintained as was the entire facility  Staff couldnt do enough for me from check in to check out  Quiet  well kept facility in all areas  Breakfast each morning was ample and dining area always clean and staffed  Less than ten miles to Strip and all it entails  but was nice to retreat at the end of each day to this quieter  slower pace a short distance away  Will definitely stay here on future visits and recommend this to all Vegas visitors  
N => This hotel deserves praise I was unaware that my watch was on      pm EST and checked in prematurely  It was therefore only      p m  I think it was the manager who was behind the front desk who took me in without complaint or a whimper  There is nothing fancy about this B amp B but it is clean and comfortable  I did not have much interaction with the staff but I did not find any rudeness in them  The unlimited free breakfast was excellent  Much better when I last stayed at a La Quinta in L A  I will definitely come back if I get a nice deal again  
N =>   Nice hotel not too close to the Strip Room was clean and very quiet  even know it was close to a Main road  Upper rooms would get a nice view of the neon lights of the Vegas casinos  Two big queen beds  very soft and comfortable  When we couldn t get the tv going  maintence man came promptly and was very pleasant  Breakfast had a big variety of hot and cold items   eggs  sausage patties  biscuits  amp  sausage gravy  toast  bagels  cereal  muffins  amp  pastries  coffee juice  Staff were polite and seemed helpful  We were very happy with our stay there  especially after a long sleepless flight  it was lovely to relax in such a comfortable room  My only little complaint was there was no complimentary bottle of shampoo conditioner  only body wash  amp  body lotion  No restaurants within walking distance  
N =>   Just Average We were in Las Vegas for only one night before flying home after a two week vacation in Utah  and chose this hotel over one of the large hotels so we could be close to our vehicle in the parking lot for  quot repacking purposes quot  because we had a lot of luggage  Their complimentary shuttle goes to Mandalay Bay  south on the strip  and the MGM Grand  middle of the strip   so when we found ourselves at the Bellagio  north on the strip  at the end of the evening  we opted to take a taxi back to the hotel  It cost about     but was worth it after all the walking we d done  Our bathroom could have been cleaner  and I forgot to ask for a room on the top floor so we had to listen to people stomp around above us  The breakfast buffet was typical Holiday Inn Express but the young woman tending to it was awesome  It was ten minutes until it ended and she was still bringing out fresh hot food  restocking everything  and cleaning the tables  She made my day  
N =>  Clean quiet and affordable Loved the free shuttle to the Strip  Nice  big breakfast every day  Quiet pool  Little bit of problem with reservation number we were given but this was solved the next day and no more problems  Rooms were big and clean  Would have liked to have an airport shuttle from the airport and extended hours for the airport shuttle to the airport as we ended up needing to get taxis both ways  Overall a good experience  
N =>  Another good example of this chain We chose this hotel for its close location to the airport and car rental depot  We were going to start touring the next day and just wanted a convenient hotel where we could park easily outside  At the time of booking  we could have got a Strip hotel for fewer    but who wants to park half a mile away from your room for just a one night stay The king size bed was divinely comfortable and very clean  We made full use of the free internet access  as  having flown from the UK with an   hour time difference  we were up a few hours before breakfast was served at   am The breakfast itself was good with all the usual fare of bagels  cereals  muffins etc plus some hot items If you are travelling from the UK a word of caution if you are taking SatNav with you and hiring a car  It took a long time for our new TomTom to kick in  next day in fact  and so I was glad I had printed out instructions of how to get to the hotel The next week when we returned to Las Vegas we were confronted by the traffic horrors afforded by the Strip area  but thankfully  this hotel saved us from that on our first night  We got exactly what we wanted  
N =>   Spot On Found this hotel to be just what we had hoped for  Speedy check in  pleasant staff  nice room  clean hotel  good pool and hot tub  virtually had it to ourselves   Breakfast was good  Freshly baked cookies at       hrs  Shuttle service was always on time  every    mins to Mandalay Bay and every hour to MGM  The only problem with this service is at night when the shuttle may have to make more than one journey due to numbers so expect to have to wait sometimes  If you don t have a car as we didn t then you have to go to the strip to eat as there is nothing close  There is a gas station near which sells drinks and snacks though  There was some plane noise but it never bothered us  Would recommend this hotel if you want to be away from the strip  
N =>  Rude Employees Horrible Customer Service  On the day of my arrival I called to request an early check in for my   rooms  I was told I could check in         am  I was really happy and didn t expect such an early check in  I was thinking I would be able to check in around  pm  We arrived at       am  and got all of our luggage out of the car  The woman at the desk just stared at us  didn t even greet us or wlecomed us  We told her we were checking in  she immediately responded by saying  quot Oh no  we don t have any rooms available right now  quot  I told her that I had called earlier that moring and was given an early check in  she did not believe me and asked who I spoke to  I told her I spoke to a man around     am  she looked to her sides and said   quot NO  I have no rooms available right now  give me    minutes and I ll check you in  quot  We sat in the lobby for    minutes  After waiting  we got all of our luggage out of the car and walked towards the front desk again  The man who promised me an early check was there  and we asked why did he guaranteed an early check in  His response was   quot be  I said you would get an early check in  quot  I asked again what time we could I check into my rooms  The man in the front desk replied   quot    mintues to an hour  quot  So then  I walked around for about       hours in the scorching sun  after a   hour drive  which wore out my   year old son  We went back to the hotel again and they told us the same thing   quot may be in an hour  quot  At this point my entire family decided to change our reservations to another hotel which was much more friendlier and proffesional  The sad part out of all of this is that it wasn t just us that they were rude to  We witnessed how a couple tried to check out but the man at the desk would not give them a receipt because they had checked in earlier that morning  The front desk clerk kept telling the guest that he didn t have to check out until the next morning  that there was no way he could get a receipt  But as soon as the guest that wanted to check out said I m paying cash  the clerk said Ohh  OK let me check you out    What was that about  CASH ONLY   Management needs to have a talk to the employees about their customer service skills  I mean this man was talking on his cell phone in a loud voice at the front desk  I AM NEVER GOING BACK TO THAT PLACE  NEITHER ARE MY CUSTOMERS  FAMILY AND FRIENDS  
N =>   Good Budget Option Lets face it  there s so much to do in Las Vegas day and night that you need plenty of cash  This hotel was considerably cheaper than those on the strip  especially at the weekends  so saved us some cash to spend on going to see fabulous Cirque du Soleil  I ve stayed on the strip before and hated having to wander through casinos in those enormous hotels just to get back to your room  The Holiday Inn Express was a good place to sleep and shower at a reasonable price  nothing fancy but clean and comfortable  We had a car so the location a few blocks behind the strip was great for getting about but far enough away to be a bit quieter  I have to agree that the soundproofing could be better as we had a rather noisy neighbour who had the TV on full blast all the time  To their credit the front desk did have a word with him but I think it fell on deaf ears  Overall it s a good option for those who want to save their cash for Las Vegas  many distractions  
N =>   Great for families Our family of five stayed here for three nights  this was the only hotel that I could find that was able to accomodate us all in the one room in Las Vegas  All the other hotels on the strip wanted us to book two rooms  which would have made our trip twice as expensive The room we had was at the front of the hotel and offered a great view of the strip  it was lovely to look out at the lights at night  when we returned to the hotel  The room was very big  it had two double beds and a double bed settee  It was clean and comfortable  The kids loved the heated pool and were in it late at night and early in the morning  The breakfast was just alright The actual strip was surprisingly close by and we did not feel that disapointed on the hotels location  to far to walk though   The hotel offered a shuttle service every half hour to the Mandalay Bar MGM  We did not have to use our hire car and made full use of this service while we there  which was great  Only negative was on checking in  we had been on the road was seven hours and arrived quite tired in the evening  When I spoke to the receptionist to give the family name  he just replied  I need to see your id   I told him that my actual passport was in my suitcase and I needed to unpack it to give it to him  his abrupt reply was  well you are not checking in until I see it   His unwelcoming attitude and abruptness nearly made me walk away  so I had no choice but to uppack my case in the reception in front of other guests walking by   I must add that all the other receptionists were great and extremely helpful  
N =>   Great location but near the strip and no noise  Excellent location  off the strip but very close to Mandalay Bay  Hotel offers a shuttle that runs to Mandalay Bay and MGM every     hour  Breakfast buffet ok but reasonable as it was free  Nowhere close to buy convenience items except the gas station next to the hotel  Swimming pool clean and fairly uncrowded  Housekeeping was good Would stay again  
N =>   comfy beds great service thin walls We stayed here   nights in ch  We were originally booked for just one night to be close to the airport  we had been hiking in Utah   but our flight was cancelled due to weather  The staff immediately rebooked us for the next   nights  at a rate cheaper than we had paid for our first night  I was very relieved  Overall  the service was great  Friendly front desk people and the breakfast bar was kept well stocked for the huge crowd that was staying here over the holiday weekend  The beds are very comfortable  My only complaint  and I see that others have noted this  is that you can hear your neighbors through the walls  This is my hotel pet peeve  so I am not sure if we would stay here again  Also  the return shuttle from Mandalay Bay is not reliable  You need to call the front desk to confirm that a shuttle will come by  We waited for an hour  and finally walked home  short walk  so not a big deal   Otherwise  this a good place to stay if you want to be near the airport  off the strip  and have a comfortable bed to sleep in  
N =>   Best stay on our trip ch            After traveling around for    days  we arrived at the HI Express  We were pleasantly surprised at how easily we found the hotel and were even more pleased with our room  We were greeted quickly and checked in right away  Our room was clean and very comfortable  The beds were very comfortable and after driving from the Grand Canyon  they were very welcome  We were far enough off the road to have a quiet room but close enough that if you wanted to  walk to the Strip   several blocks away   but why  when there is a convenient shuttle to take you to the MGM or the Mandalay Bay Hotels Breakfast was a bit above average and filling  It was busy  so we kept having to ask when the muffins or juice were going to be refilled  There was a bit of a wait  since they had only   person staffing the breakfast  It was good and filling  a lot of variety My only complaint is that there was trouble with the internet  which did get corrected and the front desk offered to print out our boarding passes if we needed The AC in the room was a bit loud  but was efficient  if my son didn t keep messing with it  
N =>   Wished We Had Stayed Elsewhere Overall  dissatisfied  Although we had read other users  comments about the paper thin walls  we found this aspect particularly annoying  Never stayed in a hotel where the sound from adjoining rooms were so loud There wasn t a comfortable chair in the room to sit in Told by front desk  who were very friendly  to go to a neighboring hotel to use their computer because the printer at this hotel was broke The breakfast sausage patties were smothered in grease  the eggs were cold Only   of   elevators was working Shame on Holiday Inn  
N =>   Aussie girls say   excellent Although this hotel is off the strip it is excellent value  We stayed   days in        the money we saved we used for a  st class helicopter flight into the Grand Canyon  Staff were very helpful  rooms were great  beds very comfy  linen  amp  towels were  st class  Breakfast was included  continental  and plenty for us  Shuttle bus to the strip every half hour  Getting back not as reliable by shuttle but it s cheap  amp  easy to catch a cab back  We were very impressed  amp  would stay there again without hesitation  
N =>  Good place to stay off the strip We were catching a flight out of Las Vegas  so we stayed here one night  We re not gamblers  we went to the National Parks in Utah  It was a nice enough place to stay in Las Vegas  The bed was very comfortable  and we turned the fan on in the heating ac unit so any noise didn t bother us at all  Clean  comfortable  good accommodation  good breakfast  
N =>   So near yet so Far    Just returned from a fly drive to USA with my husband and   year old daughter  stayed in the Holiday Inn Express South Las Vegas for   nights  In my opinion it was absolutely perfect for our requirements  We had an executive twin Queen room which was much larger than average complete with microwave and full size fridge  The beds were so comfortable  although the air con unit was noisey  Location wise  it was just a five minute drive to the strip  where free parking is available at every hotel and also only ten minutes drive from the airport  It was great to be so near to the strip  but I was glad that we chose not to stay at the hotels there as they were loud  noisey and brash  just as you would imagen for a town called  Sin City   Breakfast was great with a good choice of cereals  yoghurt  friut  muffins  dainish pastries etc  Also it had a computer  amp  printer in reception area to enable you to look up stuff on line or check your email  Pool was great with towels available  usually had it to ourselves  All in all I would definately stay in this hotel again  especially it you are travelling with kids  
N =>   Just right  This was the perfect Vegas hotel for us  With   children  aged    and    we did not want the full on  non stop casino invasion of the main hotels on the Strip  The Holiday Inn Express was easily accessible  but yet away from the hustle and bustle  When we went into the pool we had it to ourselves  Not a slot machine in sight  The room was clean  comfortable and spacious  plenty of room for the   of us  We got the free shuttle to the Strip a couple of times but soon realised it was just as easy to drive to one of the hotel car parks on the Strip  The complimentary buffet style breakfast was great each morning with plenty of choice  We would definitely visit this hotel again  
N =>   Great Place off of the Strip We recently stayed at this Hotel two separate times in a    day span  We were taking a motorcycle trip to California and the Grand Canyon and stayed here at the beginning of the trip and for two nights when our trip was competed  We were very impressed with the cleanliness of this Hotel  It had a great pool that was opened to midnight which was great as we returned from our bike ride later in the evening and this was a great way to cool off  Our room was very nice  we had a King sized bed  a table with a chair and another chair in the corner  Bathroom was a nice size as well  Would be nice if all rooms had fridges but you could obtain one on a first come first served basis for     per day  We didn t bother as we put ice in the sink to cool our drinks  Breakfast was very good  had lots to choose from and had a very nice area to sit in  The fireplace in the middle of the room was a great touch  We left our suitcases with management while away and they stored them for us  away from where others could get into them  This was very nice of them  The shuttle was nice to have and goes to the Mandalay Bay every half hour  We felt this could be made better if you were allowed to call for a shuttle when done on the strip as sometimes we had to wait more than a half hour for our return shuttle  We would defenitely stay here again and I think that once they expand the strip that way  which they look like they are doing right now  this will be a prime place to stay  
N =>   Well managed A very warm welcome after a long trip from the UK  We were greeted with a smile and a choice of rooms  Everything was done to make us comfortable  The Air Conditioning was a little noisy but it had to work hard whilst we were there  Breakfasts were the usual motel style and of good quality  A maid was always on hand to replenish and tidy up  It was significant that the manager was frequently visible  This was unusual at other motels on this trip but she kept an eye on things and chased her front line staff when appropriate  This motel might not be on the strip but there is a free shuttle provided twice an hour and  there is also a free shuttle to the airport and or the car hire centre  to meet travellers  demands We would not hesitate to use this hotel again  
N =>   VERY Clean Hotel Not within walking distance to the Strip  but free shuttle  We had a rental car and parked for free at the hotels  Very easy in out parking at hotels  Did notice that the buses on the Strip were always crowded  even on Mon  Tue  This is a VERY clean and newer hotel  I am very particular about a hotel being clean  I even look at caulking lines around toilet to make sure they are clean  Coffee maker and tea bags in room  along with blow dryer and ironing board  Bedding was great  You have a choice of firm or soft pillows  No frig or microwave would have been nice   No ice machine on  nd floor which we were on   Did not hear any outside noise not even the planes   but the floors are very thin  People above us came in around      AM and sounded like they opening and closing their dresser drawers over and over again and just walking around for about an hour  Even the A C couldn t hum that out  Would get top floor next time  Lobby area was very clean  front office staff very friendly Brian  and helpful  Good variety for breakfast  Entrance of hotel had a great variety of coupons and magazines with coupons  Someone earlier mentioned the neighborhood was shady around hotel  I did not find that to be the case at all  Not much to really do withing walking distance from hotel  But who needs that when you have the Strip  This hotel is closest to the bottom     of the Strip  Spent   days here and only completed     hotels on the Strip  Hotels are farther apart than they seem on the maps  Was there on a Monday and Tuesday and did not notice the lines to be long at all  Was still pretty busy during the night even though it was during the week  Was worred about all I ve heard about people standing on the side of the street handing out mini flyers of     dressed women they did that but were not pushy at all   but not one tried to hand them to us since we had small kids with us  Had the buffet at Terrible s and it lived up to it s name  Yuck  
N =>   Stay Here  Excellent Hotel Yes  I felt silly saying I was going to Vegas and staying at the Holiday Inn Express  But that faded away when we checked in  The staff was friendly and the service was impeccable  The room was clean  no hints of smoke ANYWHERE in the hotel  The pool was excellent  never crowded  we usually had it to ourselves   The beds were incredibly comfortable  and the hotel was quiet so we got lots of sleep  check other hotel reviews  you won t find that elsewhere   There was construction next door  but we never heard it while inside  Breakfast  FREE  was excellent  fresh warm cinnamon rolls  variety of juices  cereals  bagels  waffles  fresh fruit  yogurt  The bathroom and the shower   excellent  We used the shuttle to the Mandalay Bay often  and again  were very impressed I wanted to rest and relax at my hotel during my stay  and the Holiday Inn Express was PERFECT for that  I didn t want a  quot party pool quot  or a smoke filled hotel room just to say I stayed at one of the famous hotels  When I return to Vegas  I ll stay here again  
N =>  welcoming and helpfull staff what a great hotel just a shame it is off strip  apart from that i couldnt fault it  it was clean the staff were very informative and the free breakfast was a good start to the day we stayed for   nights and then were booked into the luxor for the rest of our stay if we had have known before booking how nice it was we would have probably not bothered with the luxor    this is another reveiw i have to write but not good    the room was i good nice size clean smelling and the beds comfortable  we were on our  th travel expedition to america and always like to wonder about and do our own thing without being bothered and the hotel was very helpful when we needed to get to somewhere but didnt bother us if we didnt need anything  the shuttle bus was helpfull if you wanted to get to the strip without driving well done to all the staff for our pleasant stay we would certainly return and have told lots of friends about you  
N =>   Great Place to stay off the Strip We stayed there following the good reviews on Trip Advisor  the location is very good if you dont want or need to stay on the Strip and much much cheaper  The front desk was efficient and helpful  the room spacious and clean great fluffy towels   super  comfortable beds  The complimentary breakfast was more than enough and of good quality and the cinnamon rolls        well they are as good as they claim to be  A regular free shuttle to Mandalay Bay was a bonus   check it out 
N =>  Honey moon stay This was not a bad place to stay the employees were very friendly and the rooms were clean  The rooms are a basic hotel room nothing fancy  They Have a free bus to Mandalay Bay and a free brakfast which will save you some money  We did have afew problems however  First off the employees were very nice but didnt know much about getting around or about Vegas second the pool was closed for some reason for about   days out of our stay so we had to go to another hotel and use there pool which wasent heated  They were also recharging there back up battery so the lights in our hall was out the one day  I havent made up my mind on satying off the strip yet  It is less busy and there are store where you don t have to pay a arm and a leg to get a drink or snack but the extra little trip to the strip seams like a pain some time and you don t quite get the magic feeling when your not on the strip  All and all I would stay here again but think it is a better place if youve been to Vegas afew times  
N =>  So airport handyI couldn t sleep Very clean room  but no mini fridge or microwave  Pool well located for tanning all day  Pool and hot tub temperatures were very good  The bfst was excellent in variety with cinnamon buns  muffins  bagels  oj and excellent coffee etc   There was no noise from other rooms  The window air conditioning was   high speed but it didn t drown out the airplane noise which was continuous all nite  The schuttle to the Mandalay was handy but the food there was very expensive      for a boil in a bag dinner for   It was    degrees outside but they still didn t allow shorts in the lounge  snobs  
N =>   Fantastic place to stay   don t miss this bargain in Las Vegas As with other reviewers I have to say that this hotel was one of the best places we have stayed in a long while  Last time we were in Vegas in       we stayed at the Luxor which we enjoyed but for value for money the Holiday Inn Express wins hands down  The beds were so comfortable  I wanted to take ours home with us   The cleanliness of our room and the rest of the hotel was brilliant and we had a great stay here    nights in ruary        We only had one slight glitch with our room keys but it was nothing major at all  We made use of the free shuttle to Mandalay Bay quite a lot and then got the tram up to Excalibur  If you time things well  it doesn t take much out of your day and in any case  you can spend a lot of time walking through casinos to get out of the bigger hotels If we go back to Vegas we would stay here again  
N =>  Recommended Well placed about     mile off the Strip  so convenient but more quiet  There was a Police Dog Convention while we were there  so we felt it was very secure  Beds confortable  Room bathroom very clean  There is a shuttle bus to the strip if you should wish  Would be     but the breakfast was not as good as some of the places we stayed  That said  we would recommend this Hotel  Took a flight to the Grand Canyon which was fab  One tip   go for a tour which gives you extended time at the Canyon as most only give you an hour or two to soak in the enormity of the place   not nearly enough  
N =>   Clean  Near Strip  Alternative Holiday Inn Express  Russell Road at Polaris Avenue  Las Vegas  Relatively new  clean  non casino property  Rooms were very comfortable  with the  quot new quot  HI Express bedding and linens  Breakfast was more than adequate  juices  eggs  muffins cereal biscuits  amp  gravy  fruit  yogurt  etc  A hotel shuttle will transport you to from Mandalay Bay  You re within eyeshot of many of the south strip casinos  Convenient to McCarren Airport via freeway  take  quot airport tunnel quot  to I   North  then exit left at Russell Road  There are two all night convenience stores   gas stations a few steps away  as well as a Colonial Bank ATM  We discovered the studio warehouse for Magician David Coppefield across the street you ll see the many touring trailers parked  Not much else in walking distance of this hotel complex  except a  quot Gentlemen s Club  quot  The pool and jacuzzi were sparkling clean  with nice nighttime views of the Strip lights  Oh  if you really wanted to walk to Mandalay Bay  you could probably make it in appx       minutes on a pedestrian sidewalk  but you ll have to cross a freeway entrance and exit  Complimentary computer kiosk printer just off lobby  
N =>  G t Hotel good value I stayed here with my wife and   kids     amp       we had a   bed room and it was fantastic   very clean   large and very comfortable  Swimming pool was also very handy and clean  also not very busy  We got the free bus from hotel to the Mandalay which ran every    min  we stayed all day   night at the strip with loads to do and got a taxi back which costs about      We then sat at the hot tum to bathe our feet  Go stay there it really was very good  Oh  breakfast was also super  continetal style 
N =>  Hotel great Unfortunately service poor First off  our reservation information was not readily retrieved from the front desk person  When things were finally sorted out  we thought  we checked into our room  which turned out to be a smoking room  we wanted NON  that totally stunk    as did the entire floor  Because we had a show to get to quickly  we couldn t do much other than call the front desk and ask what happened to the non smoking room we reserved  Basically the question was met with a disinterested comment about the room not being available  and would we like the room to be  quot sprayed again quot   On a positive note  the beds and bedding in the rooms are very nice  and the breakfast bar and staff running it were top knotch  Back to the bad stuff     the following day I complained to a new front desk person about how bad the room smelled and interestingly she was able to move us  It was a bit of an inconvienience  but the new room was much fresher  We had a big bag of dirty laundry to do that day  so I figured I would put a load in and then watch the kids at the pool     after bringing the bag to the laundry room  I noticed that there wasnt supplies available   so went to the front desk  They apparently ran out of guest laundry supplies    I was told there was a store nearby to get what I needed if I wanted  Needless to say  I wasn t impressed  The next day  I called the front desk to see if they had obtained any laundry supplies yet    I was told  quot yes quot  and that someone would run it up to our room  Well  after a half hour of waiting  I called the front desk and got a different guy who said there were NO supplies after all  The other downside of this hotel was the location  and the limited shuttle service to the strip  only drop off and pick up is at Mandalay Bay   I guess if you don t want to spend much time on the strip  then location isn t much of a factor The bottom line for us is the poor service we received    primarily from the front desk staff  For that reason alone  we likely would not return to this hotel  
N => Great Hotel for the entire family  This may be considered a  quot budget quot  hotel but we were treated like royalty Their beds were AMAZING   Apparently it s their new line of beds  linens  soaps  shampoos   whatever it was it was GREAT  We came from a dump of a hotel the night previous and this was such a refreshing change I m not kidding  we have a nice bed at home but I would trade mine at home for the bed in this hotel  I could have spent the entire vacation there The hotel was super clean  breakfast was great  They even gave us hot out of the oven cookies that evening The pool was nice and definitely needed in the Nevada heat AND   they have a free shuttle to Mandalay Bay to the tram until      pm each night I would stay there again and again   
N => Top Value  don t bother staying on the strip  Just back from two weeks in California  driving from San Fran to Las Vegas and back  Most nights we stayed in Holiday Inns or Express because we had reward points  It was interesting to see how they varied when on the face of it they are the same  This one was best of the bunch  the fresh clean smell in the corridors made a good impression before we even saw the room  Warm cinnamon rolls for breakfast was a nice touch not found elsewhere The pool was the best of all the places we stayed and the rooms were quiet  The only minor problem was aircraft noise  it s right under the glide path  We were surprised that the windows were not double glazed  the London Heathrow equivalent felt like they were landng on the roof but there was no sound of them inside  The airport seems to close around midnight and open at     ish so it didn t disrupt our sleep Beware of the free shuttle to the strip  We thought we d take a break from the driving but jt arrived    minutes late and already full  The driver claimed there would be another along in    minutes so we sat down outside  only to find a few minutes later a queue outside of at least a shuttle full  It still hadn t arrived to pick them up when we left in the car    minutes later Parking is free in all the big hotels  so once you ve worked out how to get outside onto the strip you ve got it made  It s about    minutes drive to the Paris which was the easiest to park and exit  
N =>  Pleased again   My second stay at HI Express was virtually the same PROS     Terrific Value       on weekends   Great Shower  rainfall showerhead  curved curtain for more space  great water pressure    Good FREE Breakfast  Coffee complimentary anytime  Free internet in Lobby and WIFI in room       Secs Max from Entrance to RoomCON    Shuttle continues to be overcrowded  weekends   Plan on a backup taxi ride of about    to South side of strip  Don  t count on shuttle to make dinner or show reservations  plan ahead and reserve a limo or call a taxi  
N => Great Find Was sceptial about booking this after being on Strip for   nights but needed a bed for the night This hotel was fantastic  we got upgraded to a suite  Make sure you ask for suite     if paying as this is the only suite with a view of the strip Room spacious and lovely  swimming pool open even though it was ember and also laundry facilities on the  nd floor  There was also tea coffee maker in the room Service was very efficient and polite  nothing was too much trouble There was a curtesy bus that dropped off picked up at the Bellagio every     hour from  am to   pm which we used as was better than staying on the strip as it was dead central Would stay here again  without doubt  
N => Loved it   My husband  my two sons and myself stayed here for two nights in ember      and was very pleased  We didn t go to Las Vegas to gamble  we just wanted to see the Hoover Dam  The staff was wonderful  the rooms were so nice and clean  We got a good nights sleep because the beds were sooo comfortable  and the rooms were quiet  The continental breakfast was very good  They have a computer in the lobby you can use to check emails also  and have free USA Today newspapers  If we ever go to Las Vegas again  we would definitely stay here  
N => An Excellent launch pad to the Strip  We stayed here t  of      and thought the hotel was great for the price  The hotel was clean and the room was excellent  We were unfortunately put next to room service s storage room  but never noticed any noise  IMPORTANT NOTES  they have a free shuttle every    minutes to the Strip  but get there early  The shuttle is a joint operation between   hotels and at peak times  seating can be limited  BREAKFAST  it was ok  but I really went Vegas to eat at nice restaurants  but it was nice to get a cup of coffee and a bagel before we left each morning  The also have free internet at the hotel  which was very nice  I would recommend this hotel over the Strip Casinos any day  
N =>  Great Breakfast   Very Clean      Wonderful to wake up to an early Breakfast with EVERYTHING you can think of    including Cranberry Juice  mixes well with Vodka  says my husband    WOW  As a smoker though   Would have been nice to have chairs in the front  while we waited for our shuttle  arrives every    min  I love the bedding  foam matteress  had a sound sleep They even had hydraulic doors to every room  so that no door slams down the hallways  Let s not forget Holiday Inn s showers that are wide spread and the pressure was great Laundry room was availiable to us as well  felt like home   HA  quot What was brought to Vegas     Stayed in Vegas quot                    Bob and i Ann Cartersville  Georgia   Originally from Illinois  
N => Very Good Stay  
N => Very pleasant stay and our room smelled clean       
N => Holiday Inn   near the strip  
N =>  Holiday Inn Express  
N =>  An Acceptable Hotel I have stayed at this hotel twice  the other time was       Not all rooms have refrigerators  The neighborhood looks ok to me  but itis definitely a ways from the Strip and airport  probably    min  from the latter  as I recall  My room was relatively clean both times  and the staff were helpful All I was using the hotel for was an overnight stay  
N =>   not bad Hotel was ok  nothing fancy  Two cars in the parking lot did get broken into while I was there  There are a lot of places to eat around and the hotel service was nice  Make sure to stay in a room on the third floor  as those have vaulted ceilings  There is no elevator though  so pack a light bag  
N =>   i was   days ago         its fine     no its not the four star luxury of the major hotel casinos in vegas    but i didnt pay three hundred dollars for a room i barely used anyways like i did the night before   i saw not a single bug    and had the back window open all night and no garbage truck pulled up   this was on a monday night    its an older motel but the room was clean    the property kept up   the only thing i could see is in the hot summer the a  c unit may not be good enough   
N =>  No Sleep Here      I picked this place after    hrs of driving time to Vegas  I was exhausted and you d think I d sleep like a log  NOT     During the night   different dumpster trucks backed up to the dumpsters located behind the hotel  If you don t mind the  quot  beep  beep  beep quot  of trucks backing up or the noise their hydraulics make lifting the bin   the diesel engine also revs during this part   or the noise they make when they bang the dumpster   times to make sure its empty then this may not bother you    however it drove me insane  Just as I would start to drift off   yet another truck came by to empty the next bin The guy at the front desk did not seem surprised regards my complaint and was short about the fact that he had no control of the situation AVOID THIS PLACE       
N =>   Will never stay there again Required to make copy of Drivers License and credit card when I made reservation Few weeks later discovered that some was trying to use my i d  with the copies made at the hotel  Fortunately the person was arrested before any charges were made on my card  When I contacted the management and told them what happened  there was no apology  Did not even offer to look into the matter  
N => Great place to stay in Las Vegas We stayed at Homestead Suites in early e  I picked this property based on the reviews that I read on TripAdvisor  This hotel is great  First  the staff was very gracious  I had a few simple requests  We were traveling with a small dog and we also needed a roll away bed  The front desk handled my requests perfectly  Our room was on the first floor  near the door  It was easy to take the dog out and we were close to our car  It was great to have a fully stocked kitchen  We were able to eat leftovers and have cold drinks in the fridge  The hotel was very well maintained  inside and out  It is a few blocks from the strip  close to stores  stations  etc  I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveiing to Las Vegas  We ll definitely be back    
N => Dishonest Stressful Had a nephew in a coma at Sunrise hospital  Needed a place for family to sleep in shifts  Everytime we talked to them the prices changed to a higher price  Finally agreed on a price and later found out they charged us     more than agreed upon  He agreed that he quoted us that price but couldn t do anything about it  He adjusted a litlle but not what we were promised  As we walked each room it took us   rooms to find one that could even be okay to stay in  The first one he showed us had poop in the toliet  The others were stinky and bedding not washed  It got to the point that it was ridiculous and moved to a different hotel  They were very dishonest and we felt like they were taking advantage of our situation needing to be close to the hospital  Very stressful 
N =>  Fantastic stay The whole staff went out of their way to make my stay next to perfect  
N =>   Very Poor Guest Service Hotel does not seem to know exactly what guest service means  The hotel manager Nur A is very arrogant and front desk clerk Rosa is not only rude but does not know what she is doing  It took us more than    minutes to check in and another    minutes to check out  Having a front desk who has been there for   weeks is not an excuse for a very poor guest service  Our complaints fell only into her deaf ears  When we checked in the manager was present at the front desk and seems to impress that he is busy doing something but actually he is not doing anything and was just looking at the poor front desk clerk do her job and not giving her any assistance even though other guests were waiting to check in  
N =>   Excellent Experience  I had originally checked on the reviews and thought  quot Oh No  quot  However  I had made my reservations and needed a place to stay for my two week training  What I experienced was a very polite  helpful staff  a very clean and efficient room  and lots of peace and quiet  Everything about my stay was excellent  The staff was always more than accomadating and I found the area to be very safe  I have stayed in Vegas  quot Off Strip quot  before and found it to be scary but this was great  I had great comfort in knowing that my vehicle was safe  I would stay here again in a heartbeat and would recommend  
N => Avoid the Homestead Please avoid this hotel  it was a disaster  Our business group was here for a convention and the room was booked for us on the Las Vegas end  We couldn t believe how disgusting the rooms were  and everything else in town was booked  There was no internet service  there was no maid service for an entire week  on a business trip  We had to buy towles at the mall it was THAT bad  The rooms were dirty  they smelled  and the air conditioning was broken for six days in Las Vegas Everyone complained  the hotel was so subpar we couldn t even laugh about it  Our company terminated business with the travel agent who booked us there  
N =>  Hated the Homestead The absolute worst hotel I have ever been asked to stay in  I was here for business not pleasure and asked the business I was meeting with what was a quiet hotel nearby  This place was a waste of money  and a depressing place to return at the end of the day  
N =>  Very close to the airport  This hotel from what I understand is roughly one year old  the hotel seems very new  The hotel and the area are fairly quiet for the exception of the airport noise  Its located at the exit of the terminal of the aiport so a I imagine wouldnt cost much to get there  I d like to stress that this hotel is NOT walking distance to anything other than the rental car center which would be about a   to    minute walk  They do have shuttle service  however it only takes you to mandalay bay and picks up there  Overall Id come back if I wanted value but not convience  not there fault  
N =>   Nice Place but unhappy with service Our family of   stayed for one night at the end of a trip outside the US  The property is very nice but we were not happy with the service  Half way through the designated breakfast time  much of the food ran out    excuse was that they didn t expect to be so busy  That excuse is not acceptable  Next issue is that before going to breakfast we took our bags to the car  leaving only a couple of items in the room  including some medication that is taken after eating  The maid was not on the floor when we left the room  While we were out the room was cleaned   even though we had not checked out  The maid put the few items that we left on the bathroom vanity into a bag and had it on her cart  however the medication was gone  It had been thrown away  This action was also not acceptable  This is a nice place but does not appear to have good management  For that reason we do not recommend this property 
N =>   Nice inside but too far from the conventions and taxi costs too much  We had the two room suite       small kitchenette  fair living area  rooms are nice with standard tub with shower  good ac heat  rooms with ceiling fans  helps   four of us Beds are very soft and pillows not for me   bring your own    others in my group had no problem Their continental breakfast   hummmm   well lets say stick to the coffee unless you have a strong stomach  Not much in the way of a store at the front desk Taxi rides to Sands convention center averaged         with tip  each way  car rental for four days cost us          well worth it  Hertz   The hotel is not well known so make sure you have the address when you leave to give to the next taxi driver to get back  
N =>   Comfortable and Quiet    Yet Close to the Action This hotel is a wonderful place to stay if you want to get a good night s sleep in Vegas   but still be close to all the hubbub during the day  Rooms are reasonably priced  new    clean and spacious The staff is very helpful and friendly  We were thrilled to find out that they have a shuttle that takes you to the airport or to the Mandalay Bay Hotel  You can get everywhere from there by walking  taking the tram or Monorail system  Taxis are available  but you have to wait forever and they are not cheap We loved the free breakfast    lots of variety We thoroughly enjoyed our stay  
N =>  Brand New Homewood Our second stay in a Homewood didn t compare to our first stay  but it still was nice  The  quot dinner quot  here was anemic and disappointing  mini burritos and chips with salsa  really more of an afternoon snack  certainly not like the other Homewood I stayed at which had a real dinner  Breakfast was ok  certainly not up to the standard at the other Homewood either   tasteless scrambled eggs  dry sausage and cold amenities pastries This place was brand new  So new I wondered if anyone had stayed in our suite at all  Some lamps weren t plugged in and our hot water didn t work at first  the maintenance guy had to come and  quot fix it quot  somehow  We stayed in a   bedroom   bath suite  with sofabed and   TVs   for only      which was awesome   full kitchen too  Certainly bigger than anything else you could ever have in Vegas for that price  The location itself is hard to find and away from everything else  really quite isolated   although it is obviously in a flight path of the airport  Still  I found it very quiet  just what we needed on the last night of our trip  My main complaint is that they need to work on their food and presentation  I d rather have less choices which were high quality  than more stuff that was subpar  Certainly not the quality I ve come to expect from Hilton hotels  
N => Perfect Very good location to stay at south strip  One of Vegas smaller hotels  which I prefer It doesn t take long time to get access to your room  
N =>   I enjoyed my stay Well after reading most of the reviews  I was very hesitant to go  But I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived  Check in did not take that long  The room was clean  beds were good  Staff were nice to deal with  I paid less than    bucks a day fri tues   Location was awesome  A few cigarette burns here and there  but room was better than I expected  I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to save a few bucks  
N =>   WOULDN T STAY HERE AGAIN My husband and I decided to go to vegas and on our drive up we booked the room here at Hooters  We thought it was a good price  However we will never stay here again  To start off the elevators are falling apart  There were cracks in the corners from the top to the bottom  if you push the wall a little you can see through   SCARY     The hall ways to the rooms are so dirty and it smelled  There was no ice in the ice machine the whole time we were there and had to go up   floors to get ice  Our shower didn t work right  Half the water came out of the shower head and the other half came from the tub spout  The handle to turn on the water in the shower needed major maintence  Our air heater was sooo loud that we had to turn it off to sleep  The capet was so dirty and the room smelled funny  However one nite we got in really late  or you can say early  about  am  and were hungry  so we ordered room service and I would say our food came fairly quick and it was hot and tasted good  We had decided to extend our stay but did not stay here  We booked another room at another hotel and stayed   more days there  This would be a decent hotel if they would keep up with the maintence and do a little more cleaning  
N =>   Nice room good facility adequate staff  We checked in and were given keys to an occupied room at the opposite end of the facility  Had to return to the lobby with baggage and baby for another room  We were never offered help with luggage which would have been polite after making us walk so far  Wanted big bed but got   standard  it was a pleasant surprise that we could get an infant bed  We liked the room  it was very clean and tasteful  not fancy but good  Beds were adequate Big letdown was the staff  Most were polite but nowhere near the standard I find at the restaurants which we frequent  when we returned to the desk after being given the wrong room we were helped politely but never felt like we were important  The   desk people chatted with a  rd employee from retail  the desk guy was trying to get a free shirt  The girl in the poolside cofffee shop in the morning was just plain rude  
N =>   If this is a   star hotel I don t even want to know what a   star would be    If you re traveling on a budget  pick something else  I m pretty sure you ll be better off at Tropicana  Excalibur  Circus Circus  Riviera  etc    This place was awful  Their staff is not really friendly  The front desk guy was short and harsh when we were checking in  When we got to the room  the decoration was cheap and tacky  one of the lamps was damaged  the beds had a dip in the middle  like very used mattresses   the sink was clogged  and there were shampoo bottles from previous guests in the bathtub  My brother s room had a wet  used towel  Basically  the hotel has  quot Please  remodel me quot  written all over it The hostess at the Dan ino restaurant was not friendly at all  It looked like she was doing us a favor   and she wasn t very happy about it  Plus  they wanted us to wait    minutes to get a table at   in the morning even though we were only going to get food to go  The good things about the hotel were the wings and the location  And that s about it  
N =>   Not bad for a B hotel off the main drag Liked the hotel on the whole  Not as fancy as the MGM across the street  but close enough to the strip to get to things  accessible to the monorail and the prices were good  
N =>  excellent holiday this hotel was excellent   ideal location to walk anywere   rooms clean and had everything you needed casino was ideal size not too big but again had evertything you needed pool was gorgeous weather was lovely for november sat by the pool most days everyone in our group enjoyed it and they varied from age    to    men and women  room had   double beds in tv and computer games   
N =>   Excellent value for money just round the corner from The Strip Check in and out were slow and the standard of service at the desk neither as efifcient nor as friendly as we experienced in other hotels and motels while in the US  however this hotel was excellent value for money  less than     for two nights    We were supposed to have a Bungalow room but were given an Ocean View one instead   this turned out to be a blessing as it was several floors up away from traffic noise and music piped around the pool area from early morning  The room was large and well appointed  The only gripe was that the bath took ages to drain of water when having a shower  The breakfast buffet in the hotel restaurant was good varied and fruit plate I had was huge  Prices on a par with the other places we breakfasted during our holiday  The room was quiet  however we think that occupancy levels were pretty low  The other guests of the hotel were predominantly a younger crowd than us   we re in our late   s  
N =>   Never again I will never stay here again  The worse service ever  I would rather stay at Motel   where I have recieved better service  I was given a smoking room even though I told them due to me being asmatic I needed a non smoking room  They didn t even make an effort to accomodate me  The view I saw was trash  When the maid came in to make the bed it looked like she just threw the bedspread and pillows  The Dan ino restaurant had extremely slow service even though it wasn t crowded  I was completely dissapointed  I have written a letter to the hotel manager but have yet to recieve a response  
N =>   Hooters better than I thought it would be  After reading some of the negative reviews on this hotel casino I was a little unsure  but   the price was right  amp  it was so near the  quot strip quot  First  the room was clean  fair sized  amp  comfy  I also had a great view of the strip from my window The pool was awesome because it is open       After a big day night of LV  it was nice to swim or hot tub at any hour  It is nothing fancy at all  Just a nice  amp  clean pool    of them   amp    hot tubs On site restaurants were fine  nothing special  The casino was nice because it was small  amp  clean It is right across from MGM so you can just walk across the street to be in a huge casino  night life  studio     fun night club     amp  the tram  the tram will take you up the  quot strip quot Tropicana is right next door  amp  Excalibur across from that  So it is near many fun things to do if you don t have a car  I stayed when the prices were dirt cheap  It was only     a night  but I see their prices have gone WAY up  too bad  it is not fancy  Not all that sexy either The people who work there are real nice  amp  professional as well  the security guards were NOT awesome  They mostly talked to each other  amp  never really seemed to care what was happening around them  I had to ask them a question  amp  they both seemed annoyed I interrupted them  Oh well    
N =>   Great Hotel for the price and location not to great if you have minors  We stayed at hooters las vegas from     thru the   th  We went to Vegas for a wedding and decided on this hotel as it was fairly cheaper and close to the strip  its a pretty small hotel not as big as i thought it would be the staff was very nice to you IF you where gambling if you where just walking through the casino they seemed to be very rude and very rude to my son  I have a    year old  we where walking to the garage and we where waiting for the rest of our party to catch up  so we stood right in front of the elevators to wait for them  this very rude person comes up  who works for hooters  and rudley asks him ARE YOU OVER       i looked at her and said no he is not and your point  she tells me well this is a gaming area so he is not allowed here  i said ok well we are staying here and going to our car we are by the elevators  which mind you there are no games by  and she was like well he needs to wait in the garage  i looked at her and was like umm yeah i dont think so but thanks for your suggestion LOL  at that point the rest of our party arrived and we left  The gift shop sucks it only has a few items  most of the areas are empty or just have   or   shirts  OMG and the restaurant ewwww   i had never eaten at hooters before so we decided to have dinner there our first night to try out the wings  Once again because we had a minor we had to wait longer as they only have one area for you to sit with minors   all this really means is that the girls dont bend down and have there hooters all over the place LOL   Once the wait was over we where seated  right by the kitchen area where all the traffic is because everyone is going back and forth to get the food  The girls   i was a little surprised i thought they would all be very pretty with nice bodies and that was not the case  I was sooo dissapointed with the wings they where just oozzing grease and had no flavor whatsoever and these where suppose to be the hot wings  All in all i would never go back to that restaurant   
N =>  Cheap price friendly staff but would prefer to stay elsewhere for a few bucks more scored the room for     which included a breakfast  all staff we came across was friendly  room was a decent size but really needs to be updated  i would typically say it was amazing bang for my buck but in Vegas perspectives  i cant say such a thing  for about the same price or maybe      i couldve stayed at many other options including Excalibur  which i have stayed at before and was much nicer and with a great location  also Sams Town was cheap and better but I avoided due to nonconvenient location for my plans on my trip  overall  not terrible  but i personally would try something else on my next round  
N =>  Not as nice as I thought  but definitely worth      Hotel was okay  I expected it to be a little nicer since it said that it opened in       but I think they just redid an older hotel  Dealers were really nice and taught me how to play craps  Had a lot of fun at that table  The dealers were not the standard  quot Hooters quot  type workers though  so that was different than I expected  I only paid     per night so it was a great deal in that regard and I would stay there again because it was so inexpensive  If you don t mind staying a tiny bit off the strip it ll work    
N =>  great time had a great time  check in was very good staff was great very informative  room was cozy for the price best deal  went to see tod paul very good  casino was small but nice  pool was nice but very cold  Stayed there twice and loved it will stay there again  Food was great at marino  the steak with garlic sauce was excellent  Plus hooters food was great to  Check out was very easy  Needed a later check out and got it with no problem thanks  
N =>   Hooters is just for Wings   LOOOVE hooters wings but not their hotel   waaat kind of place is this anyways   we weren t in the room more than to change and sleep but wow was it run down  Moldy showers  Dirty Carpet  DUMB front desk staff  and to top it off as we were packing to leave I discovered ANTS on the bed that had found their way to my suitcase  One reason would be because Room Service didn t clean up food from the hallway     just GROSS  
N =>  Wouldn t stay again It was the worse nite of our stay in Vegas  The carpet was filthy the valet was terible he suggested i was on something  LOL the front desk was so slow my grandma is faster then they are  the key cards didn t work my wife had to wait a     an hour for me to get back to here  The only thing i like there was the waitres in the ino room and the wings  Thanks for a bad evening Hooters Jim 
N =>  Stay Away from this Hotel Worst Experience We have Ever had in Vegas  We visited second time Vegas and stayed in Hooters for   nights  We were so upset by everything with this hotel    We booked this hotel through hotel com  When we checked in they gave us different room then we have selected and we have paid for in advance  There was only   person at the front desk and long queue We waited for almost an hour     There was only   persons at Valet parking and long queue of cars too     Next morning we faced a terrible problem of water blockage in bath tub  We called     times to front desk  Maintenance  Operator etc  Staff was rude and not helping  Waited for     hr for engineer  We missed our show     The same day we came back at the end of the day and found our keys are not working  We were on   th floor and did back and forth to front desk     times to get keys fixed  Nobody cared wasted   hour again in hall     again there was a problem in toilet  Water was running on and couldn t use it for long time  Same as previous day with maintenance service    We expected some kind of apology compensation at the time of check out for all the troubles we have faced but completely ignored Stay away from this place  you would find better place on the strip or close to  
N =>  Never stay there again      Room had major issues  The bath tub didnt drain so the water back up to our ankles and the bathroon sink had plumbing problems  I told the front desk about the room as soon as it started that night  The next morning  the remodeling started next door   When I asked to change rooms  the supervisor  she  told me it would be a hour before we could change  After a hour went by  I asked the front desk they kept saying not sure when a room would be available  The one had a hole punched in it  After several hours went by  I asked the front desk again he said still not ready yet   I told him that the supervisor said it would only be an hour  yea right  He went back and spoke to the same supervisor WOW he came up with a room  finally after waiting all day  I know we get what we pay for  But OMG this was very bad  So was your public relations  Your website is very false leading  At least one thing room service was friendly  
N =>  Did I really pay for this   Just returned from a long weekend in Vegas and have to share with you  This place is a dump  From the snotty front desk  to the bad food  filthy dirty carpet in the halls  nasty windows  For the     price tag was expecting dated maybe but not just nasty gross We went to the Dan ino for Sunday brunch   OMG  Seat yourself fine  all tables dirty  busser took our drink order after    minutes  another    then someone else brought them  We got our silverware from another table  along with condiments  waitress was polite but a horrible waitress  After the entire   hour  I asked to pay for one buffet as i took one plate and left most of it  They did comp the meal but I would never go back again Room was ok size but nasty carpet  filthy windows  and a c unit that ran all of the time  and not quietly  Outside was     so turning it off was not an option  It was basically a spring break  sleep  puke and party situation  One passed out in the hall by the phones while I was walking to the restroom  another left a bucket of vomit by the soda ice machine on our floor  it stayed all night and into the next morning  Save yourself and pay another    bucks and stay somewhere else  The only positive was the polite security guard that showed us to our room and came back again to open the doors when the keys did not work  
N =>  Not Bad   Check in was good  Hotel  pool and casino is small Did not win at the casino did see someone win         on the free        games Was upgraded to the tower rooms no charge The rooms were ok  mostly just slept there The cleaning service was good The air condition worked good in the room Stayed   nights          not bad  You have to walk to the MGM to get to the strip  or else a long walk up the street  only a       taxi fare from the airport Overall you have to get a good deal to stay here  It is like a hotel good to slept  shower and go do your thing Did not eat there not sure how the places are Not a bad place  they do try    
N =>   Disgrace to the LAS VEGAS scene This hotel is not fit to be in or anywhere near the strip let alone in front of the MGM This hotel was of low quality  very old  dirty  grotty and the rooms corridors are rubbish  This hotel is no comparison to the neighbouring  Real Casinos  The pictures on their website are very misleading Save yourself the disappointment  paythe extra and go to a decent casino hotel like MGM  Bellagio  Wynn  etc  You can probably even get a room in Luxor for the price of Hooters  Luxor is not as booming as the main casinos  but atleast its decent  fairly new  neat and looks wicked on the outside   like a pyramid They even charged us a resort fee after we had left  on our credit card  When we emailed them  they said its in the small print onthe booking agreement  I have checked the booking agreement and it says nothing aout such nonsense Also  on check out  they told us no more charges  yet they di the dirty on our credit card  
N =>   Dingy rooms but okay overall I probably wouldn t have stayed here  but I got a great deal on a room  so I gave it a shot Pros Small casino   easy to get to from your room  Didn t do much gambling  but made out pretty good on what I did  and the cocktail waitresses were quick to bring comped drinks  even when I was just playing penny slots Very friendly staff   upgraded my room for free  bartenders were cool and made good drinks  Nice eye candy from most of the Hooters girls ent location   technically off the strip  but you can be on Las Vegas Blvd  within minutes  If you cross Tropicana to the MGM s back entrance  it is a quick walk to get to the monorail  If you re planning to go downtown  you can head a block south and get the route      which is cheaper  less crowded  and much faster than the Deuce  Room service food was good overall   got to my room in about    minutes and the quality of the food actually wasn t that bad Good deals on food if you re not too picky   the Dan ino s tries to be classy but basically it s a glorified Hooters  The    cent wings after midnight did hit the spot after a long day of drinking though Beds were clean and comfortable  It was actually pretty quiet in the hallways and I didn t hear any noise from my neighbors   overall I got some good sleep in the room Cons Elevators look and sound like they re about to collapse  They re almost as bad as the notorious ones at the Imperial Palace Hallways and rooms are in serious need of rehab  New paint job and carpets are in order   lots of stains  cigarette burns  etc  A room service tray I placed outside of my room to be picked up was left there for over    hours Ice and soda machines on the floor did not work A C unit was extremely loud TV seemed like it was about to go on the fritz   sound kept going in and out  Ordered a movie one night and it kept going back to the PPV menu Overall  if you re a guy looking for a cheap room to basically sleep and shower in  and aren t picky about your accomodations  this might fit the bill  Overall  if you re looking for cheap digs  I would prefer getting something closer to midstrip like Imperial Palace or Bill s  but if you get a good deal  Hooters may be worth your while FYI   do not take a shuttle from the airport to get here  I figured that since Hooters was so close to the airport  it would be a quick trip   no such luck  Took well over a hour  and the shuttle I arranged to pick me up was over a half hour late before I decided to just grab a taxi  The extra       you d spend on a taxi versus a shuttle is well worth it  
N =>   Love the place   Highly reccomended I highly reccomend this hotel  clean and lively and cheap  This was my  rd time here and would not stay anywhere else  
N =>   DO NOT Stay At Hooters Hotel  First off let me start by saying  I am absolutely not a picky person   as long as I am in a clean environment  I m good  I wanted to stay at a cheap Hotel in Vegas because I wanted to spend my money elsewhere  gambling  dining  shopping etc   well not only was Hooters cheap it was extremely dirty and gross  The location was not that bad  unless you want to be in the middle of the strip   The check in check out people were extremely rude  they were not helpful with our questions and gave us total attitude  The casino was amazingly small and was kind of a joke  While walking down the hall to get to our room we noticed lovely stains all over the floor  which were gross  When we got into the hotel room we noticed stains everywhere  The A C was incredibly loud and it sounded like there were small animals in the unit trying to escape  The bathroom was horrible   There was one towel  amp  one wash cloth  The bed had no sheet on it and we had to call room service up to see if they could put a sheet on our bed  which took   hours  Our room keys constantly would not work and we would have to make frequent trips back to the front desk to get out keys renewed  At the end of it we noticed almost      added to our hotel bill  they had  quot accidently quot  messed up our bill and put random charges onto it  which we had to fight them on taking the charges off  Seriously  if I could do my Vegas trip over again I would spend a little more money and stay at a nicer  amp  cleaner hotel  Hope this helps  
N =>   Grotty But liveable We staid in this hotel in march      We wished we had stayed in circus circus  the place was full of frat style men  trying to relive there youth  giving unwelcomed attention to any female that walked past  We were asked for a massive security deposit at check in  we had no credit or bank cards with us   so had to pay cash  the reception desk was unsympathetic and just stared at us whilst chewing gum  never have I paid deposits and I have stayed in Hiltons etc belive me this is no hilton We stayed out in the back house through the small grotty casino and through the pool area  The room was clean   and we had a TV and a small balcony  the best bit was we had rear parking and rear access to our room so not having to troll through the casino front again  its in a great location and you can walk the strip etc no problem  I am glad I stayed there for the experience but will never go there again 
N =>   Not a deal just dirty I looked at the reviews and I decided to give Hooters a chance  since I was looking for a  quot deal quot  and I knew I wouldn t be spending too much time in the room anyways  My girlfriends took me to Vegas for my bachelorette party and I didn t want them to have to spend too much money on a hotel room  Well  I kind of wish we spent a little bit more  First off  I thought the crowd in the casino would be young and fun group of twenty and thirty somethings  Insteasd  It was a bunch of old and trashy people who looked like they had been up for    hours straight  I guess it wouldn t matter if you just need a clean place to stay and you don t plan on gambling or using the pool facilities  Unfortunatly  the room was just as bad  Honestly  I am not a picky person  If the place is basically clean  I can deal with it  Well  the room just had a nasty feel  The bed sheets had stains on them  I didn t even try to firgure out what it was   half of the carpet was wet and we all had to wear shoes in fear of athletes foot  The beds were tiny and the bathroom was not cleaned very well  Oh  and the a c was so loud it kept me up at night  Again  I am not picky  and I really think this hotel is nasty  In fact  we were tempted to go find another hotel   I am all for saving a buck  but please spend a little bit more and avoid this dirty place  Trust me   
N =>   WARNING  False Advertising  We booked the  quot Standard w      of Extras quot  and recieved only one of the offers included in the list of  quot extras quot  which was the      of promotional slot play for each of us  The free buffet  rib special  complimentary drinks at Pete  amp  Shorty s and Dixie s  the complimentary tickets to The Mentalist  the     in match play  and the     in free play all were not fulfilled  When we brought this to the attention of the management there they just spouted off that they  quot reserve the right to change the promotions and other offers at any time  quot  Well the thing is we wouldn t have stayed there without the      of extras we thought we were getting and paid more for the same room because of those extras that were supposed to be included with the room  Then there was the room issues  first they didn t have the   double bed standard room we reserved but instead put us in thier cheapest  quot bungalow quot  room with one bed  First one had ants all over the place  Second one the sink and shower didn t drain and had ants but fewer than the first room  The third room they moved us to was a little better since the beds were actually made but even after turning the shower head on the water continued to come out of the spout so you ended up in over   foot of water by the end of your shower  They finally put us in the correct room the next day but we paid more than we should have for that first night and moving your luggage four times in    hours isn t the best way to start what you want to be a relaxing vacation  Don t stay here whatever you do you can stay at New York New York or Excalibur or Luxor for just a little more and not have to deal with endless problems  
N =>   Great times The room was great  the service too  All in all I had a great time   Loved to eat my breakfast by the pool    
N =>  Major disappoinment  Staying at the Hooters sounded like a lot of fun beforehand  Unfortunately the hotel was shabby  smoky  and sleazy  Staff was tired and bored  even the famous  quot Hooters Girls quot  acted like they would rather be somewhere else  Only positive thing was the location  right next to MGM Grand  
N =>  Great stay better than expected I would recommend Hooters to all that were curious about staying here  Originally booked a bungalow and was upgrade to a lower floor on the tower upon arrival  The room was clean and the bed was comfy  That was all that I needed  The food was alright for the price  The casino was small but fun  I would stay here again  
N =>   way better than expected  honestly  after reading all of the reviews i was REALLY worried about staying here  we had booked a bungalow room in early  at a really good price  on the way there  we called to see if we could get early check in  around  pm   the staff was super friendly and was able to get us checked in around   instead of the normal  pm check in time  what was even better was that instead of getting a bungalow room  we were upgraded to a tower room which was really awesome  the room was decorated really fun and the beds were very comfortable  the bathroom was so so  there were some mildew spots in the tub and the carpet looked slightly greyish  but nothing to make us cringe  i was really pleased with our stay  its a really good place to stay on a budget and if you just need a place to stay and its REALLY easy to walk to the strip from it  we felt like we were on it  i really wouldnt listen to the negative reviews about this place because i really feel like they are left by people who expect this place to be as nice as the MGM or something which obviously it isn t because its a   star hotel  the only bad complaints i have are the parking garage was a little sketchy  the waitress  at the hooters restaraunt are bad and the breakfast at dan marinos was not tbe best  
N =>   We had a hoot  Our only really problem with this hotel was finding a room   when we first checked in the first room we were allocated was very noisy  the second hada broken window and chewing gum stuck to the table  We struck it lucky  rd time and got a great room with views down the Strip   Please be aware we are not fussy people    The location of the hotel was great  and the value for money was good  We went as a group    Guys    Girls  and we all had a positive experience at Hooters We ate at Dan inos and the food was good  esp breakfast  
N =>  Would not stay there again Second time I ve tried the hotel  First time had to be moved from cabana area to the Towers because the first room was overrun by ants  This time the room in the tower was only superficially cleaned  The carpets are filthy  cellophane wrapper on the floor  bathroom was just not clean  The hotel needs a thorough top to bottom cleaning and new carpets  Hotel charges and extra    day on top of quoted rate  deceptive advertising on internet  Also charges almost    day for   hrs of internet connection  ripoff  Too bad as this is one of the friendlier hotels in Vegas  
N =>   Vegas Vacation      We stayed in Hooters Hotel Casino we reserved a Bungalow Room we checked in got our room and went out to eat  We were going to walk to the strip since Hooters is right off  As we were walking the wind was so bad we only made it to the Tropicana next to Hooters we looked around while we were there and since I had just drove close to    hours so I was tired and we decided to get some of the Hooters Famous Wings  big disappointment  Hooters will not sever you if you walk up and order at the bar you need to buy a drink and put a nipple on it because the wings take a long to fly to you  So after       minutes waiting we finally got them and since there was no sitting spaces available and I had an    Pack of Ice Cold Corona s in the room we went back and ate there  Now maybe what I think they forgot to drain the wings from all the grease  there was about a cup and a half in each container my wife passed on eating them and settled for the cold cuts and french bread we brought with us  I turned in about   pm I know it s early but I was up at  am that morning and drove all the way here so I was tired  Then about     am I woke up needed to take a wizard as I walked in to the bathroom I turned on the light and there they were COCKROACHES scattering I did my business and woke the wife and call the front desk  the said they would look in to it  but what was there to look at I wanted them dead or a new room out of the bungalow area too close to the pool and that attracts roaches  I could not wait or sleep so I went to the front desk  Now surprisingly the guy there was looking for another room and he said he tried calling the room with no answer but who knows for sure if he did  He had another bungalow room which I turned down so he put us up on the   th floor in the tower  a lot better away from the pool and roaches I even took one of the bell hops since he was there not doing any thing and he was cool we drank a couple of beers as we moved  he had to be discrete about it but in the next few days he hooked us up with tickets and booze as long as he could have a few drinks in our room I was cool with that he even brought a pizza and a big calzone on night about midnight some one ordered it and got in to a fight and checked out  So this what to seem like a bad start to our stay turned out all right I can t tell you the guys name don t want him to get in to trouble if the wrong person reads this All well that ends well  
N =>   Poor Management We had one night in Vegas and when we got to Hooters to check in  we found a line to the back of the Casino  We were told that people in front of the line had been waiting for   hours  This was dinner time and we were very tired and we now had to spend our night waiting in line  Not only that  but they did not do anything to make the wait more comfortable  When I asked the security personnel why the line was so long  I was given a death stare and told that the computers were down as though I was personally responsible for this  When we finally got to our room  the bathroom was disgusting  There was shampoo dripped on the shower curtain along with mildew  It had obviously not been cleaned in quite a while  The caulk was all mildewed and falling out  The floor was dirty  The floors were dirty throughout the hotel  actually  We were given a free mediocre breakfast buffet for our trouble  
N =>   The Smell of the Pool Rude Staff Computers Down and the LINE  We had found a     web only  non refundable deal  We thought to ourselves we just needed a cheap one night stay before we had to catch a plane the next morning    boy little did we know it came with the aggravation of a football field long line and a rude staff  They told us when we saw the line to stand in   quot our computers are down  they have been for three days  now go stand in line  quot  When we paid online  directly through their website  it took our payment  no problem  But when it came to getting our room  good luck  We stood there for an hour and moved   feet  no  it s not an exxageration   Thought I would check out the pool in the meantime  When I went outside  it smelled like something had died  garbage all over the pool area  When I found a chair to sit in  I think I caught something  We ultimately did not want to spend the whole night and following morning in the line  so we left  FORGET the     web special  for about     more you could go to the LUXOR  which is about a     times better than this DIVE  
N =>   Dead bugs in room smelt like sewage and dirty pool to start  To start the room had dead bugs on the floor   not just one many  our comforters had burn holes in them  the bathroom was dirty  and when we tried to open the sliding glass door in came off of the track and almost fell over the balcony  The place smelt like sewage  The pool was dirty and had stuff floating around in it  Our room was never serviced  The front desk was rude and charged us a  quot resort fee quot  on the day we left   this place was the opposite of a resort  The Dan ino Restaurant was okay minus the slow service  The bell boys were the ONLY good thing about this place  They were helpful in getting us rides and holding our luggage when needed  You couldn t pay me to go back  
N =>   So so room rude personnel Booked the Hotel online and we selected the Tower rooms  room was spacious and acceptable for the price  Registration personnel was rude  Unreasonable deposit requested at check in to cover eventual damages to the room and walking around and see all these drunk people we figured out why  
N =>   This hotel was great This hotel was great  I did not expect much but I was surprised  The room was a good size with comfortable beds and all the needed amenities including safe  iron  but no coffee maker  The bathroom was clean and had plenty of towels and products  In general  it would compare it to any other   star hotels All employees were easy going and seemed to like working there  No matter who you talked to there was no  attitude   Unlike the larger casinos on the strip  people seemed to be having fun in the Casino  The pool bar was fun and Dan ino s had top quality food at a reasonable price  Dixie s Dam Bar was kind of weak  Although I had a VIP pass that stated free admission they still charged me at the door  The location is great  It s barely off the strip  Actually  parts of MGM Grand are further off the strip then this whole hotel  This is just a nice friendly reasonably priced place  I have stayed at the bigger fancier hotels in Vegas but I will return to this one next time  
N =>   Great stay in Vegas Had a Ocean view room on the   th floor  Overlooked the pool  WEather was decent so some hotties were out but afternoon weather was windy Rooms were quiet and very clean  No problems with extra noise or drunken partiers  Walls were thick enough to mask most noise Beds could use an upgrade  Squeeky but OK comfortable Casino was good and the casino service was adequate  Food  Hooters rest  and Dan inos  was good  I would recommend this hotel to anybody  Party people and some families who don t need the  quot resort quot  experience  
N =>   I would pay more just to stay somewhere else  Who knows when the room was vacuumed last  Dead bugs and old clothes labels littered the floor  The carpet looked like the original   from quite some time ago  The toilet bubbled up sewer gas periodically  including through the night   We had   in the room but did not have enough towels  When I went down first thing in the morning to request more towels   I was told that they would be up shortly   they never arrived  The only saving grace was that the afternoon desk supervisor  Frank  actually allowed me to cancel our second night   now I just have to try and get that money back from Travelocity  I will never stay there again  
N =>  OK for the cost We paid    usd per night  The room was spacious  The linen was a bit old and tatty  The staff at reception were not rude but not loverly either  The casino floor is small but always had some action     blackjack tables were great  It took    minutes to walk up to New York New York  If you can get a cheap room it is a decent place to put your bags  sleep and shower  
N =>  Pleasantly surprised We stayed three nights  Friday   Sunday  through a booking with Travelocity  We typically stay downtown so we are not what you would call high maintenance hotel people We had a non smoking room on the  th floor of the Oceanview Tower which had a view of the Strip  odd numbered room   I thought the room was clean and the bed was firm and comfortable  There always seemed to be plenty of hot water available and we never had to wait long for an elevator The pool area was quite nice but you start to lose the sun at around  PM  There was a security guy at the pool area  but we never had to show our room card or anything We loved the small size of the hotel casino  Being just off the Strip made it much easier to get to and from by car I will say this  the hotel room walls are wafer thin  I could hear the guy next door to us get his morning phone call from his wife clear as a bell  
N =>   nice choice MinusHotel smell a bit and look dirty  Internet not reliable and not free  window was not locking PlusIs not dirty  people are friendly and helpful  nice location  nice food  EXTREMELY CHEAP  comfortable  nice room service  clean room and shower and WC  hot water     RECOMMENDED  
N =>   Not a bad hotel for the price  My husband and I went to Las Vegas last year and wanted to stay in a cheaper priced hotel but didn t want something junky so I started looking up reviews on hotels  I read the reviews on the Hooters Hotel and Casino and they seemed pretty decent  We booked the room at only     night  I was actually surprised  It wasn t a fancy hotel or romantic which we were not expecting but for the price it was comfortable and clean  The elevators were a little scary  They sounded like they might fall apart at any given time and I really didn t care for the casino there but I m not a big gambler  Their promotional slot machine dollars they give you don t get you much  I never really saw anybody winning anything  But all in all it was a nice stay  We would stay there again  I will say it is probably for a younger croud though  
N =>   Clean Room   LOOSE Slots We booked this because the last time we were in Vegas  we kept winning on the slots in Hooters  We read the Trip Advisor reviews and booked through the Hooters Casino website and got a great deal  We were not expecting JW riott or Ritz Carlton  Our room was clean  comfortable  bed was a pillow top   quiet and close to the elevator and right next door to the ice machine  Never heard a peep except for the loud lady across the hall slamming her door a few times  Didn t notice an visible remodeling but don t have anything to compare to as this was our first stay  Everything was in good shape in our room   some warn spots on the chair but HEY IT s A HOOTERS Hotel  what do you expect  SLOTS WERE LOOSE  My sister s boyfriend won       within the first    hours we were there  ino s Restaurant has a great breakfast buffet  timing is everything   food goes quick and you have to wait for more fresh food  Take advantage of the Owl Rewards Club upon arrival  We got two great coupon books and ate breakfast half price for two days  Regular portions off the menu for breakfast included alot of food  When checked out  my husband and I both got money back from playing on the slots  The Main bar in the front of the casino was slow  Waited a long time for drinks but the cocktail girls on the casino floor were quick and nice  Front desk staff was pleasant  Ask for a free upgrade for a room with a view  Pool area nice with palm trees  Too cold to swim but there were fire pits  Casino is close to MGM and New York New York  Lots of visible security Will stay again   One strange thing did happen   when I was cashing my Owl Rewards in  the guy waiting on me passed out and fell back and hit his head on the counter behind him  The female staff member standing to his left didn t even flinch  I was  quot Hey this guy just passed out quot  she said  quot It s happened before   quot  Very non chalant  The other employee working the desk on the other side of the guy who passed out called security  It took forever for someone to come and the whole time  this guy is on the floor  glasses broken  eyes closed and not one person had bent down to help him or even check to see if he has swallowed his tongue or if his head was bleeding  Very freaky    I was scared for this guy  He finally sat up when security came and he seemed okay  The ambulance arrived as we were getting in our cab  I sure hope he s okay  Older guy    ish   
N =>   Place is trashy but hey for the price you can t expect more  This place is OK  Rooms aren t terrible but they are not great  I found them to be clean enough  but the halls had a bit of a smell  The shower didn t work very well and yes  you can hear everything in the halls and next door  But Hey  you aren t in your room that much I would only recomend this hotel for a younger  single crowd  definately don t bring your Girlfreind or Wife here  they will probably not be too comfortable in the rooms The place definately has a Party vibe  and I found the Casino to be preety low key and fun  Always easy to get your free drinks while gambling  unlike the big hotels where you are lucky to get a dring every    min if you are lucky The Pool area is OK to relax at but       a beer All in all  I would say this place is OK  but would not go back  A little more money will get you a big upgrade Derek 
N =>  Cheap place to stay My husband and I have stayed at this hotel and it was pretty nice for the price so we decided to stay again because it was so cheap  On Saturday our rate was only      Sunday was     and Monday and Tuesday the rate was only     night  Everyone is complaining about how its now perfect but I look at it that I just got to take a vacation for dirt cheap  If you want something spectacular then maybe you should stay that the Wynn  We booked a bungalow but when we were checking they had none available so they upgraded us to the tower  I didn t find anything different between the rooms except the tower has a view  I had no problem with my stay  You have to remember that you are staying at HOOTERS   I will stay here again just because I know it s cheap and I m not in my room very much so why pay alot for something your not using very much  
N =>  Inspiration to stay away from the room as mcuh as possible OK the price reflects the Hotel  It was cheap we got a great deal  but we paid for it  The room had paper thin walls  it was not very clean and it really inspired us to leave the hotel as much as possible  The location is great because you have easy access to other places in Vegas so you do not have to stick around the Hotel  It was a short walk to nicer Hotel Casinos like MGM  New York New York  Tropicana     It was also a short walk to a bus stop for the Duece I did find it interesting that the advertise    blackjack       Now  they do not claim that it is    hours in a row  So  do not make my mistake and assume that there will be a    table  Plus if there is one open   and only one  then it is too crowded to get a seat  If you do not want to relax in your room  and want to use it as a place to shower and drop off your bags  this is the place  If you enjoy a good night sleep  this is not the hotel for you  
N =>   Moderate maybe two and half stars I read all the reviews on trip adivsor and from what I had read it sounded like Hooters was the best place to stay on a budget  Right now they are offering an free upgrade from a bungalow to a standard room which was good because the outside of the bungalows looked like they were hourly rooms to rent seen on COPs  The Standard room was okay  It was large and the bed was comfortable but lights didn t work  the bathroom tile was chipped  and you had to call housekeeping to request whatever was missing from the room such as ice container and coffee maker  I was on the   th floor in the Bay View tower which over looked the airport and the Extended Stay America and Motel Six and I kid you not every day there were four cop cars over there busting people  It was good entertainment but was a little worriesome  The SASS spa was great  The people there were very friendly  The hooters girls were also really nice  Actually the all of the staff were great  The hotel its self would be good for college  single aged friends to stay at because if you don t spend a lot of time in your room you would be happy  Overall  I wouldn t stay there again but if my son wanted to go to vegas with his friends  I would put him up there  
N =>  Great Again We stayed at Hooters uary        this was our third trip to this hotel and we had a great time  We arrived before noon and got into our room right away  The room was clean and very comfortable  The bathrooms are a bit dated  but very clean  Everyone we encountered during our trip from the front desk  the Owl Club desk and all waitresses and bartenders were very friendly  the service was outstanding  The location of the hotel is convenient to the strip  We are planning to go back again next year  
N =>   Comfortable  Five of my friends and I went to Vegas this past weekend for a mini reunion  We wanted to stay somewhere on the strip  somewhere clean  they had a bad experience with Circus Circus before   and affordable  Since we wouldn t spend much time in the room  we didn t really need a fancy hotel room  The Hooters staff  boys and girls  were all very hospitable and friendly  Checking in and out was simple  and the front desk staff was very helpful when we needed some recommendations  We stayed on the  th floor of the tower  not facing the strip   and it was beautiful in the morning  looking over the pool area and we got to see the mountains  Dan ino s    hour fine dining inside the hotel was pretty good  I d recommend joining the Owl Rewards Club  free  and you ll get a coupon book  Within it  you ll find a BOGO free breakfast buffet ticket  That was the best meal of the whole trip  and it was only     The ONLY thing that was funny or weird was the smell that came up from the pool area to our balcony     cheeseburgers and fries  If that s a smell that you don t enjoy  then request a room in the other tower  haha  We didn t mind it though  It was more entertaining than anything  We ll definitely stay there next time we head out to Vegas  
N =>  Fun and great location  We drove into Vegas and did not have a reservation on ember           We knew that Hooters had a great deal on prices and we knew the location was right across the street from all types of conveniences  We checked in for   evenings and we were very surprised by the young vibe and great energy  Our room was clean and spacious  We did eat at the restaurant  Hooters  which was consistent as all Hooters Restaurants are  Our heater  it was very cold  rainy and windy that evening  was not working great and was a bit noisy but we were too tired to deal with it  The next day we called downstairs about the heater and they sent up a wonderful maintenance man  who immediately responded to the call  and he fixed the heater  Well that didn t last as the barrings had gone on the heater  so they moved or I should say they upgraded us to the SUITE    full bathrooms  master bedroom  livingroom  wetbar    plasmas  The front desk told us they wanted us to fully enjoy our stay and apologized for any inconvenience  The staff was very kind and personable  We loved that we could walk across the street to any casino  show  the metro  shops  etc  
N =>   Never thought I d stay here  After the airline changed my flight  I needed a place to stay for one more night  I booked Hooters through Hotels com because it was cheap and close to the airport  I just wanted to stay the night and get out early  I ended up with a Bungalow room out by the pool  This would have been great in the summer  but meant nothing since it was cold in Vegas at the time  I did not see an elevator  so I had to carry my bag up the one flight of stairs   ok  so a guy was nice enough to carry it for me   The room was clean and comfortable  I can t say anything bad about the place  The heat worked  so that was a plus  If you have trouble sleeping  I guess you wouldn t want to be this close to the airport  but I wasn t bothered by the noise at all  Hooters charges a       resort fee  parking  telephone  amp  pool  on top of what Hotels com charged  but I wasn t going to complain  I took the shuttle r t from the airport and was the first one off  last one on on the two trips  I probably wouldn t stay here again because I m not crazy about the location  
N =>   Dirty roomspoor service   Stayed   nights in     Front desk staff rude and disinterested on check in room was dirty with mold and rust in bath tub carpet old dirty and smelly My non smokeing room stunk of smoke and heater unit was so noisy I had to turn it off to sleep    minutes to cash a travelers check at desk with photo id When I had dinner in the Hooters restaurant in the hotel tried to charge meal to my room and photo id was demanded again even though I had a key card and was a registered guest Pool area was closed due to snow but was charged resort fee even though pool area was not usable they would not reverse this charge would not recommend or stay again  
N =>  The casino was better than I expected First of all  we did not stay here at this hotel but we did visit the casino  which was fine Everyone seems to complain about the      promotion that you have to play at a set of roped off slot machines  My hubby hated this  but I actually liked it  Of course  he was out in a short time and I was able to play and get drinks for quite a while  Also  the lady next to me won some money on this so I know that it is possible to win  Basically  if you want a very slim chance of winning with no money invested and still receive drink service  this is not a bad promo  I got pretty good drink service here  but my husband really went through the money and had a hard time finding a waitress to get him a drink once he was done with the promo  I think it was worth a try  
N =>   Cheezy as expected   but worth the     to be less thank a block from the Strip Check in staff were not friendly and neither were the lady bartenders  maybe because I m a girl   The hot tub wasn t so hot  but that allowed me to spend over   hours in it getting to know some Brittish guys  Room was about motel   quality  and the bathroom had mold in the calk around the bathtub  HOWEVER   I paid     for one night   it was well worth the     because you are less than a block from the strip  Stay here if you want to be close to the strip and can t get a room for under       
N =>  Crap time Hooters style Having been to Vegas several times  we have never been let down by our hotel standard  not the very top of the range but good  Stratosphere  amp  Sahara  So this time our travel partners booked Hooters  It is well located  amp  not far from the airport or Monorail at the MGM  so it is accessable  It is advertised as a Floridian theme  I never saw grey drab walls inside  amp  out in Florida dull  The room we had      was of a low standard  stained carpets  poor decor  looking onto the airport flight path with all that take off noise  We had an interconnecting door  so all in     could be heard  At some point early morning    am  in     either someone was having a ride to heaven or the adult movie was on loud  The walls are so thin  unbelievable Breakfast another bad experience        but watch out  juices  toast etc extra  The basic breakfast was a poor selection  but then again it was        Service was poor  being held waiting for seating when the place was nearly empty was a joke Waiting staff  bar one lady  was dreadfull  no tips there The whole place was well below par in every respect  To add insult on check out  we were OK  but our friends were handed a bill for drinks they never had  Someone had charged a large round of   Buds  amp  prawn cocktails to their room No  Obviously bar staff did not care to check validty of the order  They did not pay that  amp  await the outcome When you look at the deals now on in Vegas  in hindsight we should have just turned up  amp  got in the MGM of Venetian as my friends wife wished  plenty of room  Sadly we stuck it out from Monday to departing on Saturday morning our fault there  So any one reading this  please  please do not go to Hooters  it is certainly not a Hoot  quite dreadfull Take care all  amp  do not be Hootered     Les wilkinson  an un happy Brit Abroad  
N =>   Value For the Dollar I stayed during ober      I was looking for an inexpensive room in Las Vegas during the week  this was my choice The hotel was very clean the room was well furnished  the bathroom was also clean  Only one negative no tissues  but I managed If I am going to Las Vegas again I will look into Hooters  
N =>   More than I bargained for I booked our room late tember for our   night   day stay in Las Vegas because it was such a deal     a night  The insane price during Columbus Day weekend was a deal on top of       free slot play      match play   the tables  free drink   Dixie s  free breakfast buffet  free night show and more    But I was a little apprehensive AFTER reading all of the reviews  But I figured  if I checked in and it was lousy I knew there would be other options Figured out that after almost a   hour drive from San Diego and arriving at the hotel at  am  checking in was no problem and we were given a room on the   th floor in the Ocean Tower  To my surprise the room was big  spacious  amp  clean  There was a stain on the carpet  but I wasn t planning on sleeping on the carpet anyway  Two clean  comfy beds and a decent bathroom  Not to mention my own make up counter next to the minimal closet It WAS NOT bad at all and I was extremely impressed  It wasn t no Bellagio or Caesar s Palace    but when you re in Vegas all you need is a room to shower and nap in  Who the hell goes there for the rooms  
N =>  Cockroaches mold and dirty carpets   Oh my  I booked my room at Hooters Casino Las Vegas for my brother s   st birthday  The hotel halls were extremely dirty and stained  Once in our rooms  first thing I found on the bathroom floor was a cockroach   Later another cockroach was found roaming the bathtub   I was disgusted  Then on further inspection the shower curtain had several mold mounds gowing  I would expect this from some cheap motel but I paid         per night to stay at this infested hotel   I think they charge extra for cockroaches and mold   I travel to Vegas well over   times per year and this is the worst hotel I have yet to stay in  Needless to say  my brother s   st birthday is one to be remembered  just not the Vegas style memory I was hoping for  
N =>   Hooters Restaurant YES   Hooters Hotel NO  We stayed there the first month it was open and LOVED it  We stayed there again last Saturday  tember   th  This time we didn t  The deterioration was unbelievable  It s pretty obvious that employees really don t care about the facility  The hotel hallways and room carpets were black with dirt  You even saw dirt tracks permanently in the carpeting from luggage  I don t believe they have ever washed the carpets  The maintenance in the rooms were nil  Our bathroom had multiple mold and rust stains  missing shower curtain rings  toothpaste on the front of the sink  dirt in the crevices of the bathroom floor  The room had filthy carpeting and stuck taped paper toilet paper on the wall over the bathroom door  You couldn t miss it so I find it hard to understand how it could still be there  If you end up in room      look up  The slot machine promo is truly a joke as others have said  There are approx    machines that are roped off  You stand in line to push a button on a       machine and you only have   winning combinations  I also never saw anyone win anything  I actually won       in coins which added to my total but I was not allowed to cash out because it was not one of the   winning combinations they designated  The comedian was also worthless  Several people walked out of the program out of disguist  Old jokes   I definitely recommend he find some new material  Heard it all before  They could easily upgrade this facility to make it liveable but apparently chose not to  New carpeting  new paint  employ friendly people who take pride in doing a good job  One highlight   the band in Dixie s  the Country and Western Bar  that night  They were amazing and I don t even like CW Music  But  don t stand at the bar  You ll stick to the floor  I walked right out of my shoes the floor was so sticky  My husband and I got a chuckle out of that  Again  we have always loved Hooters Restaurants and plan our vacations around them all over the world  We have a Hooters wall in our bar at home  But  they ve really lost it at this facility  They need to make some real changes to bring it back to the standards that make it resideable  It s too bad    we loved it the first time  I would not stay there again without some serious renovation even with the great location and great price  
N =>  Not so great service  rooms or stay all around   of us booked our stay at Hooters for the weekend we saw Jimmy Buffet at the MGM across the street Checking in was a breeze and the counter help was great  We booked King size beds however all   couples got   singles  The were out of rooms with Kings                The rooms were not clean  hair clogged the sink  the hair dryer was broken and there was junk all over the floor behind or under anything the vacuum could not get to  Two of the four light bulbs over the sink were out  I called and got a replacement hair dryer right away  The Dan ino Restaurant when we arrived off the plane was empty  the bar was closed at      pm and our server let us know it was his last night because he was going to a better place as the restaurant was no longer highly rated  The pool side service was the worst  the waitress took my drink and food order at the same time  I waited    minutes then chased her down to see if I could at least get the drink  She said  quot OH I thought you wanted the drink when your food came out quot   The last night of our stay was the concert night  We ate at the Hooters Restarant and had a fabulous server named Stephanie  She made the best of a bad situation  We all ordered and began getting our food except my meal which they forgot because it was seafood  Stephanie removed the charge for my meal  The gift shop had really fun items and the staff was very kind  All said our next stay will be at the Stratosphere in ember  
N =>   Bad Promotion Some positive and some negative   We arrived early and were able to check in and the process was very quick with no one else in line  Booked directly with hotel because they were having a     dollar free casino credit   dont be lured in by this promotion    only certain slot machines included and I dont think anyone has ever won     cant cash out when you do win  BAD promo    and should not be deciding factor in booking this hotel  Hotel is very close to airport  so cab fare was only about    dollars  However  far away from Old Downtown Vegas  cab fare    dollars with tip  BED is awesome  shower had NO NO NO pressure at all   took    minutes just to take quick shower  We were on the   th floor though  Not a huge pool area  about        guests max or there would be to many people    Only had one bartender on a Saturday and with the huge group there had a hard time getting drinks  perfect just to lay out and jump in to cool off  Water had a dirty film on top  could have been from the huge group of people there   Loved the hooters wings   Always good    Breakfast buffet       kind of expensive  but convenient  not sure if they have a dinner buffet  ALWAYS a cocktail waitress to get drinks in casino area and at inside bar  that was nice  the bigger hotels you could hardly find one on your own  C lose to MGM  Tropicana  Excalibur and New York New York  Other hotels a bit of a walk  Overall  I would say that if I had not been lured in by promo I would have stayed elsewhere  Would only stay there again if I get hotel FREE or around       a night total  
N =>   beds are comfy We were in the  nd floor bungalow facing the pool  Yes  we had a real balcony  The bed was comfy  the view was great  but we didn t spend too much time in there  it WAS Vegas after all  We had a great time gambling there at Hooters as well as other places but after a long day of fun in the sun our bed was soooo comfy  sleeping wasn t an issue   The pool music does turn on at   am or so though     
N =>   worst    hours We always enjoyed the friendly atmosphere at San Remos  We have been going to and staying there for over   years  This year we planned early  payed for the room months in advance and was looking forward to another enjoyable trip to Las Vegas  WE HAD THE WORST    HRS  AT HOOTERS                  We got in late Sunday night  only to find that because we would not allow the boy on the desk to charge         to a charge account  in case we trashed the room    He agreed to bring the figure down to         CASH  We were tired from our   hour flight and just paid it knowing full well that we would get it back at the end of our trip because we had no intention of damaging anything OR spending a dime more than absolutely necessary here  The hotel as well as the room is in poor shape Our bathroom floor and caulking around the fixtures were dirty  The room was scary  from worn bedspreads and filth  too the poor workmanship of the wood that was added to the ceiling and every place else that it was put  We won t even talk about how bad the carpet needed cleaned and in someplaces needed replaced  It looked like they took the old San Remos nice clean rooms and tried to give them a cheap facelift  A GOOD CLEANING WOULD HAVE GONE A LOT FURTHER  The extremely loud music and extra gaming tables they squeezed in to the  quot casino quot  area made it hard to get around  There were a lot of  quot seedy quot  looking people lurking around  that made me feel uncomfortable  We thought we were stuck there for   Days  Thankfully  my husband  after discussing our misfortune  while setting up a players card at Sam s Town Hotel  amp  Casino  was offered the same price        per night  We jumped at the chance to put Hooters behind us and actually have a great vacation  Also  they did not require         or even         in case we damaged anything  They were more than happy to have us  We won t be patronizing Hooters again or suggesting them to anyone  Smarter PA couple 
N =>   Vegas baby   After reading a few of the reviews I decided to make my own mind up  was in vegas for memorial weekend in  to watch ufc and stag party most of whom stayed in the nearby MGM Grand The Hooters rooms are huge and have all you need  true the corridors might need a lick of paint but who comes to vegas to sit in their room  staff where very friendly  even got a replacement room swipe card when one of my buddies was out with ours and i needed to get into the room offered to bring it back but told to not worry about it  the casino staff were first class even giving a helping hand on the blackjack table sometimes     and the place overall had a less pretensious vibe than the larger casinos all about having fun  food was ok a bit greasy sometimes but just what the doctor ordered after a few nights on the sauce Excellent location opposite MGM   mins from strip  Excalibur  Tropicana  New York New York  Luxor and Mandalay Bay all nearby would choose Hooters again for the laid back party vibe and the lovely Hooters ladies  VEGAS BABY   
N =>   Don t do it Stayed in this hotel after a delayed flight  The staff are friendly  amp  helpful if you can ever find them  Restaurant dreadful  dirty  amp  nasty  Filthy plastic seats  appalling buffet  Bedrooms had revolting carpets  TV did not work  internet did not work  Graphic pornography on the TV when it did work  Horrible  horrible  horrible  amp  we weren t paying  
N =>  Yikes  I would probably have chosen the  quot terrible quot  category but the desk staff and restaurant staff were very nice  Upon check in  we were offered what s called a  quot bungalow quot  category room  After dragging our bags through the casino and pool area  we found our room to be poolside  I m without words to describe how nasty it was  The carpeting was filthy  the vanity sagging and it was dark and dingy  The smell which was fresh paint  covering smoke stained walls and topped off with cheap air freshener was sickening   I literally became ill from the stench  From what I could tell  it s a very old motel which is now Hooters  The walls were concrete and brick which allowed no cell service or internet access  The music from the pool was very loud and permeated the walls  Upon checkin  we were directed to sign up for      of slot play which was the most ridiculous thing  We stood in line and a very cranky man signed us up  We then stood in another line where    or so machines are roped off and pre set to pay out on what I d venture to say is a specific schedule  Many of the casinos offer     of slot play in the machine of your choice  If this was designed to get us into the gambling mood  it did not   we didn t spend a dime in the casino after this annoying experience  I would say  if you re a young man about to celebrate your   st Birthday  this is the place  The pool looked fun  the Hooter girls are cute and it s close to the strip for about     per night  We re not the boring or picky type   the smell was just too awful  
N =>  it was really ok   better than we thought Booked this hotel thru airline so it included flight       cab from airport   arrived early   pm fast checkin  room ok yes it was basic but beds really comfortable  plenty hot water  oh no  quot where s the coffee maker quot I said  cannot live without that   asked a maid in the hallway  lucky she understood  and within   minutes coffee maker and good coffee packets were delivered  now every day we had to call housekeeping to ask for more coffee packets but that was no problem  also enjoyed swimming in the pools which were larger than the basic hotels offers  room was quiet  on   th floor  taxi back to airport    
N =>   Unimaginative Management After travelling    hours from the Southern hemisphere we were looking forward to getting our heads down on a bed   but no   we had to wait   more hours  Why  My brother in law booked and paid for our rooms and I had an email printout of confirmation  but because it was his name on the reservation  and he hadn t mentioned our names when he booked  the form didn t ask for all names   and he wasn t arriving for a further six hours on a different flight  we were not allowed to have our room  The young duty manager seemed to take some pleasure in telling us he wouldn t let us in  quot because Las Vegas is a bad place and there is a lot of fraud here quot   He offered for us to buy another room  or go somewhere else    In the end we were forced to store our bags there and go out on the town until my brother in law arrived  Surely there could have been some other compromise arrived at  Apart from that the rooms were fair for the price paid  After all  its the location  over the road from the MGM and monorail  and just a block to the Strip  that makes this hotel good value for the money But would I go there again  NO Moral of this story   make sure you put ALL names on any reservation you make  
N =>  A Horrible Scam   Stay Far Away  The Hooters casino advertises         in free slot play when you join their slot club  We called to ask   quot What s the catch  quot  and were told there was no catch  When we got there  the free slot play was only for a small  roped off section of machines  We also got some useless coupons  including one for a free drink at a hotel bar that did not open for several hours  We were so turned off by Hooters  deceptive advertising practices that we left and did not go back  
N =>   I was a bit disappointed I stayed here with my brother for two nights in e     I was kind of surpised to find the property a bit shabby  My first impression was in the parking garage and elevator  Both were filthy  The elevator drops guest out    somewhere      and it took some suitcase dragging through the casino to find the check in desk  The check in clerk was friendly and make check in easy and painless We went up to our room on the   th floor and found a pair of full size beds  I thought those disappeared with I Love Lucy   The elevator was slow and reminded me of an old elevator I rode in a Hungarian hotel a few years ago  More importantly  no coffee pot in the room  A full pot of coffee delivered to the room by room service was about         That was really lame  Getting coffee in the morning was a hassle and expensive   I think about       a cup downstairs in the crowded gift shop The bed was comfortable and the room was reasonably clean  albeit small  poorly lit and drab  The windows were filthy and hard to look out of  The air conditioner worked OK  I found this room to have less than average storage  drawers or places for my stuff   A TV armoire with a broken shelf was about it  with the exception of a standard motel closet with about   hangers  The room did have an electronic safe that worked   I did not have any encounters with hotel staff  All in all  it was not a bad value  but nothing to write home about  I expected a cleaner  more well maintained property  It was no so bad that I would never stay there again  the rate would just have to be very low  like              a night  to match up with the Fremont Street like grunge feel  
N =>   More positive than negative We went to Vegas on our first trip and didn t know where to stay   I did alot of research and needed specific times to fly out so we booked seperately    I came upon Hooters while searching for a good bargain  The prices seem great for our budget and at first I was not happy that it was not on the strip  But come to find out it was right across from MGM so it didn t seem to be too far   and it was not at all  We reserved a while in advanced and it was the bungalow   there were alot of reviews that were bad but we took our chances  Upon arrival  checkin was not long and we were given another room  The Room was great    I don t know why people complained soooo much about this place   it was nice  We are not cheapos but this our first trip so we wanted to be conservative   we knew we would not be there long  The room was clean  cold and of ample size   we were above the pool and could not really hear anything   the a c was not overbearing   and the beds were to die for     I have paid more in the past for other places and they were horrible  We were so glad with our choice and plan to go back there again    the only downslide is that some of the Hooters girls were kinda rude and had attitude like their you know what didn t stink   and they were not even that cute   food at Hooters restaurant was great and Dan inos Breakfast was good tooo especially the fruit  It was nice there too because all the other Hotels were sooooooo freakin huge and the walk to our room was nothing and convenient  the slots were okay but not great but who cares there hundreds more to enjoy on the strip    Also the free slot pay is a joke      Yet the coupons we got made up for it   The cleaning staff were nice ande didnt enter when we asked them not to and offered fresh towels everytime we saw them   great hard workers     FYI take a cab to and from the airport it is about nine bucks the shuttles are more just mention to not take the highway    They will try to scam you  Anywhoo  we enjoyed our stay there and hope you will too and fancy amenities are for those who like to blow money   I had more money to shop eat and gamble     Have fun 
N => 	 Days stay at HOOTERS This hotel was exellent value for money  The staff on reception were very helpful  HAPPY  and even upgraded us to kingsize rooms which were very roomy in the Tower Block  We viewed the bungalow rooms in the old part of the building but they left alot to be desired  The staff in the shop were not so happy and not so helpful  Pool area was very clean   waterfall out of use   Food was ok  didnt go a bundle on the chicken wings tho tasted disgusing  but other people seemed to like them  Coffee was exellent value  if you bought a Hooters mug  your coffee was free for the whole of your vacation  A little disappointed that there was no chill out area ie lounge with comfy seats to sit and relax and drink your coffee  The choice was either drink it at the machines  or take it to your room  there are tables and chairs outside but the temperature being    degrees wasnt an option for us Overall this hotel is exellent value for money right next to MGM and other major hotels on the strip  and only     taxi ride to the airport  
N =>   Excellent Hotel cool casino   recommended  We booked a boys  trip to Vegas in il      and on a friend s recommendation  we chose Hooters Hotel Casino for our accommodation ArrivalWe flew to LA from London and drove straight to Vegas that night  meaning that by the time we reached the City  we were shattered   so hoped for no issues at check in  We weren t disappointed  The guy on the desk called up our details straight away and directed us to our to twin rooms in the  Tower   You enter the hotel through the casino  so are immediately greeted with the sights and sounds of Vegas   and of course  the site of the Hooters girls The RoomThe rooms were clean  tidy and well decorated  There is an overall  beach  style to the place which is no bad thing  The room had two queen sized beds  a decent sized TV  a desk and  crucially  good air conditioning  The bathroom was a touch dated  but clean and had no issues  We were on a lower floor  so our outlook was a flat roof with air con ducts  but also the MGM Grand opposite  Our friends  room was poolside   but again  too low to see the pool over the flat roof  Still  if you are coming to Vegas to sit looking out your hotel room window  you might want to rethink your destination FacilitiesWe didn t use the restaurants in the hotel  but they were always busy which is usually a good sign  The bar by the pool was nice  and a good place to stand around sipping cool beer  We used the casino a few times and liked it a lot  Far less pretentious than the big Strip casinos and good fun  LocationGreat location  Just off the strip  but literally across the road from the MGM Grand  so not far away  We did a couple of day trips   Lake Mead for example   and the hotel was the right end of town to drive there  Big car park so no problems there Any problems Vegas is a   x  city and as such  you have to accept that there will be times when there will be noise at times that anywhere else would be unacceptable  After our       arrival from LA  we checked in and then hit the strip  returning at  am  At  am  what sounded like    girls  but was probably only      of them  arrived back to the room next door and made a lot of noise for an hour or so  This was all the more of an intrusion due to there being a  locked   adjoining door between our rooms  OverallAn excellent hotel  in an excellent location  To be honest  we weren t sure what to expect  but were very pleasantly surprised to find Hooters to be an excellent place to stay  
N =>   Worst Hotel Room Ever    The room and housekeeping was atrocious Window was filthy Sheets smelled mildewed  I called housekeeping twice to have them changed and they were never changed in the three nights we were there  Luckily the room had two beds and we slept in the other one  Sheets were not changed for that one either Had to call housekeeping each day for hand towels  They supplied us with bath towels and washcloths  but for some reason they hoarded the hand towels The floor was not vaccumed when we first arrived  Little specs of paper was on the floor The ice bucket liner was not changed the entire time we were there The sink stopper was broken  Sink wouldn t hold water The shower curtain was tied in place with a towel This had to be the worst hotel room I have ever stayed in  I told the manager and I was give a     food voucher for the restaurant  The staff was friendly I would not recommend  
N =>  Clean Room I was a bit scared booking here after reading some of the reviews  our room was just fine  yes it s average  I guess if your used to staying at the Wynn or Bellagio it wouldn t meet your expectations  It was a clean  average room  the beds were clean and so were the bathrooms  Our room was not ready when we arrived because we were about   hours early so they upgraded us from standard to ocean view tower without a problem for free  They also have the        promotion going on which is sort of a joke  didn t win anything on the promotional machines  but hey  it was fun with their money anyway  The walk to the strip was not bad at all  maybe   or   minutes  and you don t have to hike through miles and miles of casinos to find your room  I think the only complaint I had were that working vending machines were hard to come by  there is a store right downstairs  and if you leave your window open it smelled like chicken wings  I think we would stay here again for our next trip if it s still around  
N =>  not as bad as i thought it d be Found this place on hotels com for        a night  For that price  I thought  quot why not  quot  first impression   very bad valet service  I had to wait about    minutes for them to come out and take my keys  and it wasnt like the valet was busy  I was the only one waiting to have my car parked  after checking in  we went up to the room which was on the  th floor of the ocean view tower  The hallway smelled kinda bad  musty like  The room itself wasnt too bad at all  Beds very comfy  room pretty clean  and decorated in a tacky but cute hooters decor   like a beach florida type theme The only two coplaints with the room was the air conditioning was very noisy  and there was MOLD on the shower curtain liner  My other complaint was the pool area   nice pool area  and they had a really cool looking pool bar  When I was there    days at the end of may  the weather was hot  in the mid   s  and the pool bar never opened all in all  not bad if your just going to sleep in the room and be out in vegas all your waking hours  
N =>  A dump The room was an unmitigated dump  The carpet was polka dotted with cigarette burns and something that was white  I don t want to know what  The walls were paper thin  The folks next door were not loud  but I could hear every word  Noise from the hallway and garage came right through  The light coming through the connecting door was bright enough to require me to put a pillow over my head to get to sleep  At one point I thought   quot at least the bathroom is clean  quot  A summary inspection proved that wrong  The floor was dirty  The faucet in the tub had been leaking so long  it had rusted out all metal parts below it Service  What service  I am told the hotel has been sold and won t be around long  No loss  
N =>   Clean and Comfortable We booked the Hooters Casino Hotel because of price and location  South strip  so no car needed   and because it had reasonable reviews in the Unofficial Guide to Las Vegas and on Tripadvisor  A no frills establishment  but the room was clean  the bed comfortable  The only problem was that our room was not ready at  PM as promised  The room was sufficient for our needs  we spent our days elsewhere and returned only to sleep  A good choice if you are just looking for basic and inexpensive accommodations  
N =>   Was OK will not stay again  Arrived at the hotel at noon  The chick at the desk acted like it was a problem that I tried to check in that early and made it very clear to me that no rooms would be available until  pm  which was fine   I gave her my card and she said the rate was      I booked for     but since I had no receipt showing that  I called the hotel and booked over the phone earlier that week  I was stuck paying the extra      No big deal Came back about     pm and our room was ready  Hotel room itself was big and the bed was comfy  There was dried paint split all over the floor of the bathroom under the sink and the carpet was dirty  Opened the window and had a great view of the south strip  Window was gross though  The worst part of the room was the A C unit  It was as old as dirt and when we turned in on it made this horrible grinding noise  We laughed at everything wrong with the hotel though because we knew it was going to be tacky  The A C was really a pain though trying to sleep  When we slept we just turned on the vent because it didn t make that noise until you hit the COOL button  Lo and behold in the middle of the night somehow the COOL came on  no one touched it  and the grinding noise wouldn t stop and we literally could not get the unit to go off  We pushed the OFF button several times and nothing  It just stayed on  even when we left for check out it was still on The staff here acts like they go out of their way for you but they don t  None of them have nice Hooters either  believe me I looked  The      in slot play you get isn t worth it  You re only allowed to play on the designated machines they have  Also check out is at   AM and housekeeping will come to let you know  They were knocking on our door at     AM to ask if we needed help getting our things together to check out This hotel is OK if you re on a REALLY tight budget  or just spend the extra     a night and get a cheap room at Excalibur   But I wouldn t stay here again and quite frankly  I m glad this place is getting sold and closed  
N =>  wow   WORST  FOOD  EVER  I m only writing this review to comment on Dan ino s restaurant  We stopped by shortly after midnight for their    cent Hooter s wings special  Being a big fan of Hooter s wings  I ordered    and was expecting to have a great late night meal  Wrong  When the wings arrived they had a pale  sickly look to them  They were drenched in grease and had minimal breading on them  On top of this  they were almost cold  As a guy who can devour almost anything no matter what it tastes like  I figured it didn t really matter what they would taste like as long as they filled me up  Well  after my first bite I almost vomited in my mouth  Keep in mind that I have NEVER turned down a meal before and I am NOT a picky eater  The taste of the wings was indescribable   something along the lines of   week old dead roadkill  perhaps a possum  drenched in greasy raw sewage  Disgusting  The crazy thing is that I was actually able to eat   of them in the half hour we were there  We were placing bets on me eating all     but those would have to be the worst odds in Vegas  Everyone at my table had an identical experience  In total  we ordered    wings and only ate   of them  Not wanting to start anything  we just paid our bill and got the heck out of there  A short trip down the street to McDonalds and I was in heaven   it tasted like a   star restaurant in comparison  I have sworn off Hooter s completely at this point  I will never eat there again  Just thinking about it is causing me to get a lump in my throat  This was literally the worst food I have ever eaten in my    years on this planet  
N =>  LOVED Hooters   My boyfriend and I stayed here for the weekendand and we LOVED our room  I read some bad reviews so I was a little nervous going into the room  but it was nicer then the room I stayed in a few months ago at the Luxor  The bed was super comfy  and the room was very spacious  The only downfall was the maid service came around every morning and knocked to ask if you wanted our room cleaned  even if you had a Do not disturb sign  Everyone was super friendly and they had great deals on food  We even ended up staying an extra night   
N =>  Hooters was awesome Myself and   mates have just got back from   nights in vegas staying at Hooters   it was awesome  I had read the reviews and was a bit worried but neednt of been  The pool  casino and food were all good  The girls were obviously lovely and everyone really polite  It was a great stay and will definatley be going back  If you going with friends its a definate  couples   it depends what you like  Families really a no no There was a good mix of males and females which was surprising but good to see  Thoroughly enjoyed it all  
N =>   Loved Hooters We stayed at Hooters il              We really weren t sure what to expect of the rooms  but had been to the casino before and loved it  We checked in early and they found a room for us an hour before check in  Second floor oceanview tower  king sized bed  As far as standard rooms  it was very spacious  The bed was super comfy  I felt like I was melting into it  The only downside to the room was that the bathroom  while big with a tub  was kind of dark As far as gambling goes  the dealers were all very pleasant  There was always a cocktail waitress nearby  We ate at Hooters   times  Of course  we do love the wings All in all  I would stay here again in a heartbeat  
N =>  Worst Stay in Las Vegas I stayed at the Hooters Hotel and Casino in il      and it was the worst hotel that I visited in Las Vegas  The hotel room had bed mattress with bed bugs  the bathroom was dirty upon checking in  the sink in the bathroom was clogged up  and the Internet was not working  Upon complaining to the front desk it took over an hour for the maintenance staff to show up  I would definitely not recommend this hotel to anyone else  
N =>   Lots of fun at agreat price I know it s not the first place you think of when you are going to Vegas  But you should give it a try  I really like the location  Your not on the strip but you are really close and you don t have to pay strip prices  Lots of fun   Clean room  Great Price Lots of freebies  
N =>   Fun and affordable Booked through their web site  and got a     per night rate  I thought it was too good to be true  but it wasn t  They even upgraded us to a tower room for free  and let us check in early  The dealers were personable  and the drink service is THE BEST IN VEGAS  I couldn t finish a drink before they brought me another  It can t compare to other casinos as far as decor and frills  but if you want to have a good time in a laid back atmosphere  Hooters is the place  
N =>   Not Impressed Date  ruary         Traveler from MinnesotaI just returned from a few day get away to Las Vegas  I chose Hooters Casino and Hotel for the price but also checked out the reviews and saw it was rated a   star Hotel  I was originally given a room on the   th floor that I was so unimpressed with along with the drain in the bathroom sink hardly draining at all that I thought it was a fluke and asked for a different room  The  nd room was even worse  The first thing I wanted to do in the  nd room I was given was turn the fan on  Not only was the lid that you flip up to adjusted the temp  cracked but it fell off in my hand  In the bathroom the sink drained a bit better  though it still backed up  but when I took my shower the next morning I ended up in standing water that came to within       inches from the top of the tub  I called the maintenance people and asked that they fix the drainage problem in the tub  The  quot fix quot  was done while I was out that day and when I took my next shower  the standing water was  quot only quot  up to my ankles not half way up my shin  There was also a lightbulb out in the bathroom the entire time and a plastic tag that was on the floor by the door that was never vacuumed up I am not a picky person about my hotel rooms but with the water drainage problem and over all ick feel from the room  I would never recommend this hotel  I would strongly suggest spending a bit more money for a better room at a better hotel  
N =>   Perfect for the right traveler s  If you are trying to decide where to stay for your next visit to Las Vegas  consider Hooters for these reasons      We have stayed at Mirage Treasure Island Ceasars Flamingo Harrahs Excalibur Luxor Hilton Bally s  We have gambled in a lot more  Although none of our group did very well gambling this last trip  we all agreed on one thing  Hooters was the friendliest  most fun casino we have ever been in  hands down  This opinion was shared by my wife  This could be because Hooters does a good job hiring  or  more likely   because their dealers get to keep their own tips  Unlike most other casinos that  quot pool quot  their tips  each dealer gets to keep whatever tips he she receives  In other casinos  one good dealer is typically followed up by   or   bad or very bad ones  Unfriendly or distant is how many dealers at other casinos always come across  but NOT at Hooters  The worst dealer at Hooters was more fun that     of the dealers at most other places  We have always liked Harrahs becuase they seemed to have a little higher number of happy  friendly dealers  Hooters even blew them away  I guess if your  quot style quot  of play is to treat the dealer as an  quot adversary quot   and don t care about socializing with them  then you might not care for the casino  If however  you like to  quot play quot  when you play  Hooters casino is for you    Hooters is not right on the strip  but it shares a parking lot  basically  with Tropicana  and is directly across the street from MGM  It is very easy to get anywhere you want  The taxi line was never very long  and you were right across the street from the monorail  Hooters is a small casino  so if you like the huge casinos  we get lost    then Hooters is not for you  If you like small and comfortable  and friendly  see      then you ll like Hooters  Plus you are right next to the largest casino in Vegas  MGM  if you want to change things up    Hooters is generally much less expensive than the bigger strip casinos  You will not get a      a night Venetian Suite at Hooters  for     or whatever   but you will get a nice  clean room with a comfortable bed  Hooters upgraded us when we checked in just because they had a nicer room available  Others in our group had standard  tower  rooms that were clean and comfortable  not terribly fancy  There is some signs of wear  some interior doors did not close properly  and there were some other signs of depreciation  but really  you had to be looking for problems  The room views are generally nice of the strip or the mountains  one of our rooms looked out over the pool  which isn t so nice in ruary but probably is pretty awesome when the pool is actually in use  Because it sits back from the strip  the views are generally not obstructed by the monsters on the strip  one of the worst views we EVER had was in an upgraded Ceasars suite   We would complain  however  about the manner in which Hooters placed the spotlights on the hotel facing toward the strip  our room   once the lights came on  it was a little like a police helicopter with a million watt spotlight was hovering outside the window  I think they could reposition the lights to be more indirectly shining into the guest rooms  However  this is not big enough of a problem to lessen our overall enthusiasm for the property    Service was generally friendly and prompt  We had a problem with our room safe on day one  and they were in the room in       minutes after our call  We have had problems at other Vegas properties that took days to take care of  Overall we were very satisfied with the service at Hooters    We ate at both main Restaurants  Hooters and inos  We had a good steak at inos  but felt that they may have lowered the quality  and prices   to appeal to a broader array of customers  It was not quite the quality dining experience we hoped for  Hooters on the other hand was a Hooters  We are not  quot Hooters regulars quot   I have probably been in a Hooters     times in my life  and my wife has been in one only one other time  It seemed pretty standard compared to the others I ve been in  ent food  decent price  decent service    Our group had people age from          including men and women  Everyone agreed that the hotel and casino met or exceeded all of our expectations  and offered outstanding value If this casino existed when I was younger  I cannot imagine that I would have gone anywhere else  The dealers are not all  quot Hooters Girls quot   and included men and women in button down shirts  HOWEVER  the Hooters Girls that were dealing were in many cases  quot model beautiful quot   Top that off with their friendliness  and any heterosexual single man  and probably too many married ones   were really in seventh heaven  This is not a place to be a drunken slob and disrespect the employees  plenty of security ready to help you out to the street   but if you were there for fun  and can behave  you ll have a blast All of the Hooters employees  including the  quot hottest quot  Hooters girls  seemed to go out of their way to make my wife feel comfortable  She really had a good time  However  she did feel uncomfortable getting in a cab by herself at Ceasars and telling the driver to take her to Hooters  I was working and she was shopping   That uncomfort was probably exascerbated by the jerk responding  quot whoo hoo  quot   Only you know what kind of couple you are  and if the  quot Hooters quot  name is too much for you or not In conclusion  if you are looking for a fun  convenient  smaller  clean buy not necessarily luxurious place to stay in Vegas  I think you d have a hard time finding a better choice and value  Being a Vegas  quot veteran quot   half the battle is determining a good  quot match quot  for your groups  quot personality quot   Hooters was a very pleasant surprise for us  Wherever you end up  remember  don t take more than you can afford to lose  and then have a great time   
N =>  Dirty It was very dirty and not organized there were nasty stains from the last people  They did not get cleaned up  I will never stay there again and customer service sucks I do not recommend staying there  The only thing that was half way decent is the ladies 
N => 		 A Night Poolside  We visited Las Vegas last week for my moms birthday  We stayed at HOOTERS because the casino is small  close to the strip  and was a heck of a deal  We found        a night for two doubles  We stayed in the BUNGALOWS  This used to be the SAN REMOS hotel  Built probably in the    s or    s  The room was clean  and the bedding was great  The bathroom was obviously older  but not a big deal  We were expecting the VENETIAN  The room we had was     We had to use a key to get into the building as well as back in from the parking lot It was convenient to the car  and casino  No multiple elevators  or hiking for an hour if you left something in the car  We were poolside  and the fire pit was outside our window  The noise level was a little higher then other hotels  again with age   We signed up for the member card that took a while  slow moving line  But it was worth it  We received a coupon book          worth of slot play and free tickets to see BOBBY SLAYTON  amp  ROBERT DUCHAINE  These tickets sell for almost        a person The Hooters rest was good  I normally dont eat there so I cant compare  But Dan inos left a bit to be desired  slow service  considering that is was after midnight and the wing special was advertised allover the hotel All in all    This was a great deal  and we had no complaints  
N =>  Hotel Nightmare It was the worse hotel I ever stayed  They sent staff      A M  in the morning using high pressure water jet to clean the vent on the roof top  My room just next to it  I tried to compliant to the manager on duty  have no response  and stay that was routine maintance  For me I have to suffer the unbearable noise until      a m  And I have to work     a m  in the following morning  I will let everyone that I know about the terrible stay of the century  
N => Thanksgiving at Hooters For the  th year in a row  we headed to Vegas for Thanksgiving  We were a group of          depending what day it was  Most stayed at the Flamingo on the strip  however  my husband  amp  I decided to try Hooter s Hotel  amp  Casino  It s convenient location to the monorail and the great rates we received  Why Not Check in was a breeze  We reserved a downstairs bungalow  The room was small  but cute  amp  had a slider door to a patio  We were there   days   nights  amp  everything was great  Good service on the casino floor  amp  we even won a little bit of moolah We are planning a return trip in ust for our nephews   st birthday   Can t think of a better place to celebrate a   st bday  
N =>  I am always happy with Hooter s This was the second time I have stayed at Hooter s since the remodel  The first time was literally the weekend after it opened  the rooms weren t finished but hey  it was a place to sleep  Our most recent visit we were originally put into a room with two full size beds     so not comfortable  My husband asked if we could be relocated to a room with a king size bed     the room was so much better  The bed was comfy    all in all I was very pleased  I love this casino because if you go with a group people are easy to find because the casino is so small  We never had a hard time getting drinks and the casino seemed to pay out for everyone in our party  The food on the other hand  not so good  same with the service  My husband loved the bacon at the Dam restaurant but they have closed this so now all the casino offers is Dan inos and Hooters  Dan inos is terrible  terribly slow service and rude employee s  The Hooter s  lets just say you pay for what you get  The girls are hot but lacking customer service   But I have to say I love this Hotel    I just don t eat here  
N =>  Not worth the money  We decided to stay somewhere new in Las Vegas and did we make a mistake  We thought Hooters would be fun  but were we wrong  Besides the fact it was New Years and we paid         per night  In some cases more than MGM and New York New York  thinking it would be different  We were not greeted with cute little Hooters girls but quite the opposite  The only place you see the cute Hooters girls are in the restuarant in the back  the problem here is that the line is always long to get it  Then when you get in the service is not good The casino is very smoky  and has people in it from somewhere else Then our room was so plain  the air conditioner was broke and we were told the night we arrived  after the engineer had been up   times to check it  that it was not to be fixed until the next week  They did offer to move us the next day but fortunately it got colder outside plus I did not want to pack everything up again We will never stay here again   
N =>   Won t be back    It was a clean place to sleep    that s really it  Terribly rude staff in Dan ino s  a man got up and left it was so bad  and poor service in Hooters  a pretty face in orange shorts doesn t make up for the lack of service  one customer was so disappointed with the service she made a big scene   Walls are thin  Another family on our floor had children  and you could hear every word they said  The Hooters Casino Hotel website said there were  quot complimentary coffee stations quot  in the rooms  Our room didn t have one  and when we inquired about it  they gave us a blank stare  and told use we would have to gamble in the casino if we wanted free coffee  All with an air of rudeness Stay away from the Tahiti Village booth  The Tahiti Village staff make you think it s part of the Owl Rewards Club and you tell them which room you re in  etc  Turns out that Tahiti Village is not connected to Hooters  and they just have a booth in the hotel  Tahiti Village is a timeshare property  and they will give you tickets to a show if you go to a two hour presentation  and put a deposit on your tickets   We mistakenly thought it was part of the Rewards Club and gave them our room number  THEN they gave us the timeshare rundown  and we weren t interested  They called our room on three separate occasions and left somewhat harassing messages  This isn t necessarily something Hooters can help  but they do allow Tahiti Village to have a spot within their hotel and market to  i e   harass  their customers  Because we felt like we had to continually avoid they Tahiti Village harassers  and because of the general rudeness of the staff  we spent little time in the Hooters casino    go across the street to MGM  It s much nicer  and the staff are a lot friendlier  The two stars are for the clean room and a decent location  We won t be back  and don t recommend this hotel  
N =>  What a great place We looked for a hotel just off the strip  close to the action  We came to see the various cirque de soleil shows  and wanted to be close to the vemiues  Hooters filled the bill perfectly W e had a large  clean  updated room where everything worked  No noise  no bugs  no smell  the elevator arrived within seconds on most occasions  It certainly wasn t posh  but we weren t paying posh prices  Only fault was that there wasn t a dresser for clothes  and you had to pile your stuff in the bottom of the tv cabinet  Staff was friendly  adn after a while  got to know us  We were across the street from MGM  and thought  quot great quot   we can stay at the Hooters  and use the facilities of a  quot real quot  vegas hotel  After a few days  we realized how much better it was at Hooters  and ended up using their facilities  At MGM and other large casino hotels  you walk for what seems like miles to get to the various restaurants  shops  the pools etc  and wait in line  Everythign at Hooters was convenient   the pool was right next to the elevators  several restuarants and bars within a few steps  there wasn t the  quot zshoom quot  of hundreds of people in the lobby  restaurants  etc   The casino was small and uninspiring  the mega casinos seemed to be a lot more fun  But we didn t come to gamble   our daily limit was         and we had fun visiting many of the different casinos  all of which were welcoming  despite our limited wagers Perhaps others had bad luck during their stay at Hooters   ours was really good   
N =>   Good Service    needs some improvements First  let me say that I am not usually too picky  Although I have been fortunate to stay at some very nice hotels on the strip  I have also stayed at my share of lower end hotels  Clean and comfortable are all I really care about  The check in process was friendly  quick  and we got the rooms locations we requested  Although we were there at      our room was already available which was nice  The rooms are remodeled and attractive  There were no bad smells which I have experienced in non smoking rooms in other Vegas hotels  The beds were very comfortable  The comforter and pillows were pretty  however after looking closer at the matching decorative bed pillows  we noticed small stains that appeared to be blood on them  Yuck  A few stains on the carpet but not enough to make a big deal of  The bathroom   needs work  The toilet barely flushed half the time  We were scared it was going to overflow  The tubs appear old and the drainage is slow but all in all  it s adequate  The Dam Restaurant and Dan ino Restaurant were both very good with great service  Nobody in our group won anything at the casino although it was a nice comfortable size and not too smokey  The two gift shops offer some great unique Hooters gifts and they stay open quite late to make it easier to shop after the night out  A group of younger guys would probably be perfectly happy at this hotel  I think most others would be satisfied enough even with the few problems  How often are you really in your room anyway  It s Vegas  
N =>   ent but not great I stayed at this hotel from         The hotel overall wasn t bad  The casino was a bit small  amp  ranked very low in my book when I compared it to the other casinos on or next to the strip  I would refer this hotel to the       age male traveling groups  amp  no one else  Its like a Holiday Inn Express with a Hooters restaurant inside  
N =>  Good to the next to last drop We just returned from staying at the Hooters Casino in Las Vegas  We found the employees to be very friendly and it is in a great location  We had an enjoyable time until   minutes before we checked out  More on that later We are among the unfortunate few who stayed at this hotel in recent years when it was still the San Remo  Based upon that  our expectations going in were very low  We were greeted by enthusiastic front desk people  Our  quot Ocean Front quot  room was spacious by Vegas standards  with a King size bed  desk  dressing area and bar table with stools  The bed was as comfortable as anything you ll find in more upscale hotels  The carpeting was stained in a few places  but otherwise  the room was clean with no offensive odors The dressing mirror and counter was a nice touch  but there weren t any electrical outlets there  On the nearby desk  however  there was a powerstrip and computer connection The bathroom was nice and again kept clean  We stayed three nights and the housekeepers did a nice job maintaining the room For gamblers  there is a greater variety of table games than the casino offered when it first opened  The     minimums kept many of the Hooters clientele from gaming  Even on Friday and Saturday nights  you could find empty seats at the tables  The Casino Royale on the strip  with their lower table limits and liberal cocktail service  seems to cater more to the    to    year olds that were staying at Hooters The only hiccup came the morning we were checking out  Hooters has a    hour cafe called the DAM Restaurant  We arrived at      a m  to eat breakfast  We were seated and the hostess put breakfast menus in front of us  We ordered two of the English Muffin breakfasts  The waitress said we couldn t have that because breakfast didn t start until       As we walked out  she apologized and asked if we could just wait five minutes  My question to her was   quot if you don t serve breakfast until    why give someone a breakfast menu  quot  It s not like this is an inexpensive place  Their breakfast menu started at       and went up  We stayed here as part of a package and got a great deal  While the overall experience was good  it s not worth the      rack rate they advertised for a weekend night  
N =>  Sexy hooters girls   The girls were great  Coming from Ireland it was some change to see these girls   though wouldn t wanna live there Check in spot on  quick  stayed on  th floor  Nice room    double beds  v confortable  Cleaned every day if wanted  Food in restaraunts v good  salads even tasty  Casino was good too  small and friendlier Only fault was the fact that access to reception was through whole building to get there Location good  just beside mgm  amp  nyny And again beautiful girls  
N =>   Welcomed by cockroach in bathroom We went to Vegas for the Badgers vs  UNLV game  We were traveling with a group of about   couples from WI  My husband and I were the first to arrive in Vegas and Hooters on         We had been on planes since  am and it was now  pm our time and it was HOT in Vegas  All I wanted to do was get a cold beer and change my clothes  Upon arrival they have brilliantly placed the bar right next to check in  I was able to satisfy my first desire by ordering a cold beer  Check in was great  Easy and quick  Although  for some reason we got   double beds instead of a king  No biggee  me and the hubby will snuggle  We proceeded to our room     in the Bayview tower  The room sort of look like the pictures  The decorations were all what I expected  What I didn t expect were the stains on the carpet or the rust on the bathtub  There was also cracked  peeling paint on our bathroom walls  The view left a lot to be desired  We could see the back of MGM along with the exhaust fans on top of the Hooters roof and parking garage  Not much for an inspiring view  However  really for the price and it being Vegas I wasn t expecting a palace  Just something clean and functional  I immediately opened my suitcase and grabbed some cooler clothes  I went into the bathroom to change  Out of the corner of my eye I saw something scurry across the wall into the corner by the mirror  I looked closer to find an insanely large COCKROACH  First of all  I have never seen a live one  Second  I have never seen anything that big except on like the Discovery Channel  Disgusting   I made my husband kill it  I am not a prude  though  One bug isn t going to scare me off  Although  now I was inspecting every nook and cranny of that room  I didn t find any of it s friends so we carried on and left to go to Downtown Las Vegas for the day  We returned late that evening and ordered room service  Room service was good and prompt  I took a shower that night  Which led to another discovery  My shower curtain had mildew all over it  I was so tired and so sweaty from the     degree heat I just didn t even care  I carefully washed up trying desperately to not let any body part make contact with the shower curtain  Gross  The next morning I was walking around the carpet barefoot while we made plans for the day  I went to get dressed and put on my shoes  As I leaned over to put on my socks I noticed the bottoms of my feet  To my horror they were dirty and black  Did I mention I took a shower the night before  Yep  all I walked on that morning was the carpet in our hotel room  Puke   This was my final straw  I was now just grossed out by the uncleanliness of the place  I called the Manager  Wendy  I told her about the bug  shower curtain  and my feet  She seemed very calm and non responsive  Even started telling me how yes  bugs in the desert are bigger  They seek out moisture and sometimes come in through the vents  I kept thinking  ok  but I am EIGHT floors up   Also  why is she telling me this like it is something that is common  If I am customer service or a Manager at a hotel I would not want my guests to think there are more bugs  I would act completely appalled and tell them that is unheard of and apologize profusely  She finally asked if I would like to change rooms  She said the set of rooms I stayed in are not as nicely renovated as the Oceanview ones  She could change my room and the bellman could help us  We just had to do it before  pm that night  We already had plans for the day and were about to walk out the door  I told her I would call her back and we would try to meet the  pm deadline  Problem was  we had completely unpacked our suitcases  I told her if we didn t meet her deadline then at the bare minimum I would like my shower curtain replaced  I mean really is that all she could offer  To inconvenience us more by making us pack back up and now moving into another room basically identical to ours  but  quot possibly quot  in better shape  We ended up going out with our group of friends  having loads of fun on the strip  and did not get back until late  Past the  pm deadline  However  we did notice our shower curtain had been changed by the cleaning service  What we also did was from the night before when we ordered room service was accidentally drop a french fry by our bed  We joked that morning about it and I said that would be my test to see if they cleaned it up  Yeah  it was still there  Beds were made  Towels and toiletries replaced  but that stupid french fry was still there  This became our gauge on how well the cleaning crew performed  Yep  that french fry never moved the entire   days we were there   I  personally  don t think they vaccum  I never saw a vaccum by one of the cleaning carts  I did see a man vaccuum the hallway once outside our door  but that was it  I also question whether they sweep the bathroom  I dropped a rubberband one morning and the next day it was still there  I think they simply change your towels  empty trash cans  give you toiletries  wipe the sink tub  and call it a day  Even glasses and empty soda cans weren t thrown out for us  Like they thought we were going to the local recycler or something  I don t know       In WI our hotels clean top to bottom  be that isn t the norm in Vegas  No  that cannot be this is like our  th time in Vegas and never have I seen such poor cleaning in a casino hotel  Especially a hotel that is realitively new to Vegas  has a well established brand  and is trying to make a name for itself as a Vegas strip hotel competitor  Unbelievable  Therefore  if you like creepy crawlers  black dirty feet  stained up carpets  and living in trash  By all means stay at Hooters  Its  cheap  but you have to be willing to comprimise on clean  Trust me your not getting any sort of Vegas Strip luxury hotel staying here  YIKES      We took pictures  I am in process of getting them developed  I will post them as soon as I do  The only thing we missed was the bug  My husband killed it and flushed it down toilet before I could snap a picture  Seriously  it was the size of a walnut  Makes me shiver thinking about it    Sincerely a Grossed Out Badger Fan 
N => Overall OK but some problems I stayed at Hooters y       as part of a private Parrothead Party  The hotel offered special rates for our group  so can t complain about the price  During our stay  one of the three elevators to our tower ceased to work  It was not repaired while we were there  The hall carpet was stained and appeared to be filthy  found someone else s hair in the bathtub  and generally was not so clean  In the hotel s defense  the beds were very comfortable and clean  the staff was very friendly and helpful  there was a nice pool area and tiki bar  Would not be my first choice of places to stay in Vegas  but was convenient for our group s party  
N =>  Great Time  My husband and I and another couple choose Hooters for the price and were not disappointed  We stayed there      to     Check in was fast and friendly  even got free tickets to the comedy show there Rooms were clean and nice  our view was of the strip The pool was fun and lively but the pool service was poor  we had to get our own drinks even thou there were several girls walking around The casino was fun  youthful and had great service The wings were great and so was the Key Lime pie at the Dam resturant We will stay there again  
N =>  DIRTY  I have never written a review about anything  I feel very strongly that people need to know my version of the truth about this hotel  First of all  I would like to say that I have no complaints about the staff  Everyone there was very friendly and helpful  They were also very eager to compensate for our dissatisfaction  Upon arrival at the hotel  everything seemed fine  The reservations were correct  thank you Vegas com   The room availability at the time of check in was either two queen beds or one king bed in the bungalows  A bungalow  overlooking the pool  sounds fun  huh   We give our bags to the bellhop and head up to our room  The room was located outside of the hotel casino structure  Walking through the pool area was a must to get to it  We opened the door to get in the building and immediately were taken aback by the smell in the hallway  It smelled just like a deep fryer  as my husband liked to say  I think it smelled more like someone had died  Being optimistic  we continue on to the room  We open the door  It is quite dingy and dark in the room  We stayed there for about an hour and a half until our luggage showed up at the room  we did have to call for it   Then we headed out to eat dinner  our first meal since breakfast   over dinner we decide that we can t stay in the room  It was just too dirty for our standards  We go talk to the receptionist and she was very accommodating  She said in about an hour she would have a room for us with a king size bed in the ocean view rooms  We were excited about this  She comes and gets me in an hour and my husband and I gather our things from the old room and move them into the new room  We immediately attempt to turn on the air conditioning  and what luck would have it  it wasn t working   las Vegas with no a c  not going to happen   Then I realize the sink in the room does not drain  We call for someone to come fix it  After   phone calls and    minutes later  the mechanic arrives  He fixes the a c  thank God  and attempts to fix the sink  He used this contraption that forced air through the pipes to remove any clogs there might be  This device managed to spray dirty  leftover  sink water onto the mirror and counter space  The man doing the work used the room towels to haphazardly wipe up the mirror and sink  I do have to say  for the quick fix it did work for about    hours    then the sink went back to overflowing if the water was running too long   we did not want to take the effort or our time to have someone come fix it The following day  after being at the pool all day  we come back inside to shower and get ready for the evening  My husband showers first and then I hop in    while I m in the shower the lights int he bathroom turn off     not any other outlet or light in the entire room   so I am condemned to taking a shower in the dark  With all of this aside the rooms  both of them  were filthy  There was a layer of dust on the artificial plants as well as the night stands and clock radio  The carpet looked as though it hadn t been vacuumed in a month  I was thoroughly disgusted  
N =>   no pool I stayed at Hooters in Las Vegas only to find out that we were unable to use the pool for   days due to a private party We had the option to use the pool Next door but if I wanted to use that pool I would have booked a room next door  Instead of Paying a        donation fee 
N =>  Rooms leave much to be desired I stayed here for   nights with my husband and best friend over the weekend  When we first arrived we got our room  no problems there  and headed to the elevators  We were in the Bay View Tower and only one of the two very slow elevators was working  When it finally came to get us  we went up to our floor and walked to our room  I did notice the carpets in the hallways were stained and everything just felt dirty  The room was ok  We had a view of the pool with a tiny balcony  one person size  and the two beds we requested  When we left the room we waited   minutes for the elevator to come get us before trying the stairs  The signage was very poor and while we were able to figure out a passage to the outside  by the parking garage  we couldn t get to the lobby level casino  So  we had to go back up the stairs to wait for the elevator again That night  after a long evening of drinking  we came up to bed  I woke up many times throughout the night due to the incredibly uncomfortable beds  All in all a pretty restless night of sleep  Then  at    PM  I know  it is noon  but it is Vegas   we were awakened to blaring music  A band had started playing at the pool and there was no chance of sleep after that b c everything could be heard The rest of the time was no better  The hotel became more and more trashed as the weekend went on and never seemed to be cleaned up  They did the individual rooms but the hallways remained disgusting  On Sunday morning  a trashcan of vomit was placed in the hall by the elevators and although I saw the maids several times all morning  it was still there when we checked out at   PM On the bright side  they do have good drinks  the Nipper Juice will knock you over with   kinds of rum and the pool is a good time  I also appreciated the location b c it was so easy to get to MGM and the monorail  I am a firm believer that a room is a room in Vegas and just a place to pass out   but if you can t get to your room  or out of it  due to slow elevators  you can t sleep b c your bed is uncomfortable and a band is playing and you hate walking thru the halls  maybe it is better to stay somewhere else  
N =>   Spend the extra money and stay somewhere else I booked three rooms three months in advance for the weekend at Hooters  After reading that the hotel seems to get your rooms wrong regularly I decided to call about four hours before our arrival and verify the rooms we requested were in fact the rooms we would receive  I was told no problem over the phone  We arrived    couples  and we given all wrong rooms  Two rooms were smoking  non smoking was requested  and one room has two beds  one was requested   We were told this was all the hotel had available  Once in our room we called the main desk and begged to be moved  the smell was awful   we were moved down the hall to a room with two beds  It was our anniversary weekend and did not want to sleep seperate  Called again and was told our prior room was all that was available  Now lets talk about the view from the rooms  second floor  our view was of an electrical box and the parking structure  our friends had a view of the ventalation system with a bunch of cigarette butts outside the window  Not very pretty  The lay out of the rooms were nice and the beds were comfortable  Casino was to small  played at other casinos that had tables open  Lastly they were filming a TV show at the pool and the pool was not open until      on Saturday  not very good when it s     outside  we were credited     dollars to the resturant  whooo hew       
N =>   Loved Hooters My husband called Hooters hotel back in ch to ask if they could do anything special for our   th anniversary in e  They told him to book a tower room and they would upgrade  When we arrived    no waiting line  they had upgraded us to a two room  hot tub suite  The room was beautiful   The king size bed was soft and very comfortable  The L shaped couch along with the     inch   flat screen TV made you feel right at home  It was like a small apartment and it had two bathrooms  The casino itself was small  not like the mega hotels  and had a great atmosphere  The servers came around often  The only bad thing was that the maintenance workers and housekeeping had to use the guest elevators as there are no service elevators for them to use  
N =>  Hooters Las Vegas Nevada We arrived at Hooters on Thursday and I really enjoyed staying there  The rooms were very nice and had very soft beds  I loved the casino  It wasnt huge like the rest of them  so you could find your way around easily  I would NOT recommed going to the Hooters restaurant  The service was TERRIBLE  My group ate there twice and we had to literally go and find a waitress to help us  It was pretty spendy and not that good  They girls looked like they were about    years old also  So if you dont want terrible service and spendy prices  go elsewhere The elevators were all working good and there was never a line to get on  The hotel was also in a very good area  not too far from the strip  The pool was very beautiful  but the sun is blocked by the hotel early  so you need to go to the pool about   am to get a good few hours in  So overall i would for sure stay there again  but i would NEVER go to the Hooters restaurant ever again there  
N => LOVED IT    I was a bit nervous   my husband and I wanted to go to vegas for our    year wedding anniversary and we got an incredible deal on this hotel  I read some reviews   got some feedback from others who have been to vegas  this was our first time  and so I was still nervous but bit the bullet  We had a WONDERFUL time  We got there early and rooms were not ready  you just drop the bags at the bell desk and off you go   we didn t mind the hotel at all  the room was clean the bed was comfy  and we didn t spend an enormous amount of time in our room   Some drawbacks   the elevator  very slow   it got stuck once with my hubby in it   and the water in the shower would go from scaulding hot to cold the entire shower   but its an older place   again for the money something I was willing to tolerate   we would love to go back and the location of this hotel is close to the airport  and also right off the strip  so we walked a lot to and from the bigger casinos   Its not something to be afraid of   the staff was nice  we had a great time and you will too  
N =>   Had a w owl of a time Have just spent   weeks at the Hooters Casino Hotel  Booking in was quick  but we did have to wait until     pm to get into our room The room was very clean  well set out with a large TV and enough space for clothing  The bathroom was adequate  the one cup at a time coffee machine was in there    but there was plenty of room for it next to the sink   The room had a bar stools and table in the corner  which we didn t use much  rather be sat in a real bar The bed was extra large and extremely comfortable  very soft  The only down side of the room was the noisy air conditioning unit  which rattled away during the day and night The casino itself was small by comparison with most of the others on the strip  and the bars in the casino got very noisy in the evenings  But the hotel does cater for the younger crowd  so the noise was to be expected The pool was nice if you could get near it  we struggled to get a sunbed most of the time  you had to be down there by      to get one  No one asked for any ID to get into the pool area  so anyone could have used the pool The hotel was only a five minute walk to the strip  and a five minute drive to the airport  we were ripped off by a taxi driver on the journey from the airport to the hotel  so make sure you only pay around    dollars for the trip We found the beer expensive in the hotel bars  much cheaper at other casino s like Bills  Overall the hotel was clean and the room adequate  but we didn t feel we could relax by the pool or enjoy the casino because of the noise  
N =>   Excellent Value for Money   Good Location I was slightly concerned about my choice of hotels after reading the mixed reviews but I needn t have worried The staff at check in were helpful and friendly  We were told that they didn t have any king size non smoking rooms available but would we be happy to accept a room with two double beds instead with the option of changing to a king size the next day  After a long flight though we were more than happy to accept this  The room was fine   a good size with very comfortable but very high beds  We had an excellent view of the strip and it was quiet  well  except for the air conditioning unit which was annoyingly loud    The rooms are nicely decorated but they are obviously not to Bellagio or Wynn standard  but you can t really complain when you re only paying     per night  Although everybody thinks of Hooters as a  party hotel  we didn t experience any excessive noise  One of the lifts was out of order for a day or so  which proved a bit of a pain  and they aren t air conditioned so when you re stopping on every floor from the   th in a small lift it can get a bit stuffy The hotel itself doesn t have a huge amount of amenities but enough to keep you happy  The casino is small and friendly and it makes a nice change from the other  super casinos  on the strip  There are plenty of Hooter girls to be seen although some seem more interested in chatting to customers rather than serving drinks I d definitely recommend staying here  especially if you ve stayed in one of the bigger hotels before and fancy a change  
N =>  Hooters this place is a hole Stayed at Hooters e       our second night our roof started leaking  we were on the top floor   floor      we had to get transferred to the  rd floor no comps for this   Manager was a retard would not even give us a free night   got the  rd floor room and the A C was busted someone did show up and they fixed it  all in all if you are on a budget its not bad   otherwise avoid this hole  
N =>  Just OK I arrived late Wednesday night and was able to get the room I requested  king  nonsmoking   The room was clean with a view of the pool  I will say the the beds are wonderful but they are put on a metal box to make them higher  I hurt myselft twice because part of the bed frame sticks out  One of the elevators was out for   of our   days so it made going up and down a long wait  On our  rd day our A C went out but it was fixed by the time we returned to the room  Housekeeping was good but we had several lights out that were never replaced and the smoke detector was left on the desk the whole stay  For the price the hotel was fine  We did have issues with the casino because the craps dealers pulled our bets incorrectly twice  so that was frustrating  If you are on a budget this hotel is good but I don t know if I would stay again  
N =>  Not a bad hotel but service wasn t great  Our stay at the Hooters was fine           it s a partying place  so definitely very upbeat and loud  But that s to be expected if you re going to this style hotel  The rooms were clean and neat  and we had a view of the pool  which was nice  Location isn t bad  either  just   block off the strip  Our only issue  was when we arrived at       am  and was told we had to wait until  pm to receive a room key       no problem  By  pm  after   checks with the clerks  we still did not have a room  and they were just then sending the maid to clean the room  They had told us they were sending the maid  x already  starting at  pm when we originally came for the key   At this point I was frustrated  as we had tickets for a show at    and needed to get ready  etc   so I asked our options  They replied   quot We don t guarantee check in time  nor do we guarantee the room you ve paid to receive  Just that you ll have  quot A Room quot  by the evening  quot  I have never heard of such a thing  Why on earth does one pay additional for a nicer room  if there s not a chance you ll get it    I wasted money without knowing it  So  whether it s the response of a grouchy clerk  or their customary policy  I would not recommend based on the service levels  Otherwise  it would be a decent  less expensive option in a pricey city               
N =>  Extremely poor customer service The reservations that we booked for our stay requested a king size bed  When we arrived we checked in with no problems  went up to our room and found   double size beds  My first agitation with them is they said nothing about this at the front desk  When we called to have the problem fixed they were less than helpful  and all they could say is that they only guarantee the smoking preference of the room and not the bed request  The attitudes of the staff was extremely rude and irritating because it was clear they could care less  We were told to call back the next morning for assistance in switching to a new room  The next morning we called and were told it was first come first served  I considered us first since we were there the day before requesting a king size room  They wouldn t even assist us  and kept saying they didn t guarantee the room and started to say they wouldn t even guarantee the smoking preference  Even the manager treated us rudely and wouldn t do a thing to satisfy the situation  I will never stay there again  and have told everyone I know it wasn t worth it  
N =>  NOT NEAR ENOUGH HOOTER GIRLS Stayed in the suite top floor  Room was OK  Staff was mostly friendly  Drink service at the pool was non existent  Location was good not near enough staff for the volume of people  
N =>   Loved Hooters My husband and I stayed at Hooters Easter week to renew our wedding vowels  we could not have been happier   Check in was a breeze  the girl at the counter offered us several rooms to choose from  we took one on the  th floor with a great view of the pool and the airport  We could lay in bed and watch the planes go up  We had NO noise problems at all  The room was very clean and welcoming  The bathroom sparkled with plush  thick towels  Housekeeping was on the ball  we would put the do not desturb sign up until we left for the day  flipped it over indicating the room was ready to be cleaned and it was when we returned  I can t say enough about the casino  we loved it   It was small enough that we didn t get lost  but big enough to have a great time and win enough to continue playing  We have stayed in other places on the strip in the past  but we will only stay at Hooters in the future  Don t worry about the  quot Hooters quot  girls  they are as nice as can be and very professional  most are just college girls trying to earn money  We actually passed up drinks while we were gambling  The location is great  you are only   blocks from the strip  there are sidewalks and walk signals All in all we had a GREAT time and will be going back in the future  DON quot T LET THE POOR REVIEW SCARE YOU OFF  IT IS A GREAT PLACE TO STAY  
N =>   Terrible Service Terrible service  Would not honour non smoking even though our email confrimation stated it  Manager was inflexible and rude  Rooms were below average  No bedspread and they did not give us one during the entir   days stay  Room windows were filthy and whne opened a deep fry smell filled the room  Casino is dingy and girls are average  Would not return  Advice  spend the extra     per night and go elsewhere  
N =>   Fun  Redneck  Weekend We booked our stay at Hooters because we had previously visited the casino and it looked like a fun place to stay  The offer of two tickets to the Nascar race also helped in our decision  We already had tkts to Brooks  amp  Dunn s show so we took the chance  Despite some iffy reviews  we had a great time  The beds were great wanted to bring mine home  Pool area was nice  Staff was friendly  We had a late check in and had no problem  We would definitely stay there again  If you are looking for a smaller friendly place to stay in Vegas  give it a try  We did  
N =>  Great value for the money  This hotel was remodeled recently  and the update was great  The surfboard and palm tree theme was fun  I called early in the day to tell the hotel we would be arriving very late  but would still need a non smoking room due to my son s asthma  The front desk staff who took the call was extremely helpful  asked what we would like a view of  and reserved a room so it would not be an issue when we arrived late  He added that he would put us in for a late checkout since we were arriving after midnight  extra points  When we got there  we were starving  so we ordered room service at  am  having low expectations  The prices were standard room service rates  but I was astounded that the fruit plate included yogurt  a big muffin  granola  and a HUGE plate of wonderful fresh fruit  It was large enough for all of us to have a good helping of everything  The bathroom was very nice  very clean  and the towels were better than the towels at any big bucks hotel  The pool area looked great  though we didn t have time to enjoy  This hotel was a great value  
N =>   Great value and service for the money My husband and I recently stayed here and we were a bit skeptical at first  but had a great time  Here s some positives and negatives about our trip Positives Great price look to the Hooters website for the best ratesFriendly service Not everyone is runnning around in Hooters uniforms but everyone down to the chambermaid said hello to us on a daily basisSmall enough not to get lost in if you ve ever stayed at some of the larger hotels on the strip you know what I mean  The lobby was very easy to navigate with a fast check in serviceSmall but engaging gambling floor lots of slots that pay and lots of tables that were always busy including a hooters girl pit for those who just can t get enough  Great restaurants Hooters was above average compared to our local Hooters and Make sure you try the nachos at The Dam restaurant HOLY COW big enough for     people who are really hungry and they re good too    We had to have them twice while we were thereSuper comfortable beds  Clean rooms and great views from the ocean view towerHooters rewards club Make sure you join it s free  swipe your card on a daily absis to try for a million  but if you don t win  you still get free points towards cash back as well as free hooters stuff like t shirts  shot glasses  etc  We did our cheesy gifts form Vegas shopping this way Negatives  Room was a little low budget for Vegas but still nice just not a lot of glamSmell of smoke occasionally in the morning in our room   not sure why   Overpriced Hooters stuff but it s all overpriced in Vegas Pool could use some more landscaping  but it s still a super fun place  with an actual waterfall coming down  Very fun amotsphere  conviently located to food and drink access Overall we had a great low budget vacation in Vagas  and Hooters was the highlight  We just wish we had stayed at Hooters the whole time instead of switching to Hard Rock we actually came back to gamble and eat at Hooters while we stayed at the Hard Rock be sure to read my other review on that  
N =>  Not a bad place at all for the price We stayed a night here the first part of   I was highly skeptical  especially since it was   females  I was extremely impressed  The decor is cool  sort of beachy  surfboards  etc  The room is a really good size  with plenty of counter and desk space  It was clean  I have stayed in many of the enormous hotels in Vegas but what I liked about Hooters was the fact that it was relatively small  not a lot of walking from check in to our room  and not a lot of walking from the elevator to the rooms either  The windows in the room opened up too  which was nice for fresh air  but really not very safe  as they were low and a person could easly step right out   It was not pool weather but the pool did look pretty small  however we didn t walk around it to know more about it  
N =>  First Time in Vegas My stay at Hooters was part of my first visit to Vegas  I along with three other friends were on a three week road trip and Vegas was one of our last major stops so price was a major factor in our decision  We got a deal through Expedia where we ended up paying only     total for three nights  This unbelieveable deal gave us a little pause on the type of hotel and room we would find when we arrived in Vegas  but to our delight our room was clean  spacious and defintely worth every penny  The location was great too    It was directly across the street from the Monorail and steps away from Excalibur  the Tropicana  the MGM and New York New York to name a few major hotels  One complaint we had though was with internet  Although we knew they didn t offer a wireless option our friends did purchase ethernet service and were unable to use it  However  the hotel promptly refunded their money   but it definately was an irritant  Also  although the valets and housekeeping staff were excellent  the front desk upon check in was really sketchy  In fact  I thought it was funny that the individual checking us in  quot Robert quot  not only gave us the worst attitude but was also designated the trainer on his name tag  My professional work includes training and development and I think that with leaders in the work environment that treat customers in such an inappropriate way is definately not good business and should make this establishment think about who they place in those roles in the future  
N =>  Friendly fresh and convienent As a    year diehard feminist  whose work a lot of time involves working with women victims of violence  there have been a lot of times that I have to explain my deep love for Hooters restaurants   My fiance took me to a Hooters for a nightcap on our first date   Imagine how my love was heightened when they have added a casino to their line of restaurants  When I saw they were opening a casino   the old San Remo in Las Vegas I couldn t wait until it opened  A business trip right before New Year s weekend took my fiance  amp  myself there for   nights  It was fun  clean  amp  a very pleasant surprise  Their uniforms in comparison to the other casino s waitress is pretty tame  Also  the girls and guys on staff were all very friendly  Across from the enormous MGM this place was refreshingly intimate but big enough to serve our needs  I had been to the San Remo twice before  it used to have a great steakhouse  and in its ending days it was clear the place needed to be redone  Keeping the orginal setup for Hooters  the palm trees  white on orange decor is cool  bright  amp  hip The Dam Diner was a good value with good food  amp  friendly service  The Hooters was a run of the mill place but nice  The nicer Dan ino s was empty but nice    elegant  dark  amp  sleek  The martini bar with the TKO house band performing cover songs was nice too  The waitress was attentive and the drinks generous  The band is nice  amp  willing to play whatever the audience wanted to keep the dance floor packed  It was fun  The rooms were just redone    not much  just update furnishings  amp  painting but nice nonetheless  I loved having the Hooters bar table  amp  stools in my room     it made our nights festive for a drink of our own  Even the fake palm tree in the room with its kitcshy ness made for a nice visit  I highly endorse this property    I will definitely be back  
N =>   Very Dissapointed  We looked forward to visiting the  quot new quot  Hooters Hotel and Casino on our most recent trip  We found our room to smell like an ashtray and the water heating to be sub standard  As for the casino    YUK  It wasn t at all what we thought it would be  The staff was less than friendly  less than professional  and they sure didn t support a  quot fun environment quot   I think we ll just stay at home next time and go to our local Hooters and play cards  Hooters should be ashamed of this endeavor   it is not representative of their other operations  
N =>   mixed feelings also My husband and I reserved our room at Las Vegas  com  and we got a really great deal  One of the reasons we wanted to stay there was for the fact that Dan ino s resteraunt is in side that building  also for the fact that I am afraid of heights and elevators  When we found out they gave us the   th floor  and we were not aloud to use stairs  we went back to the front desk  and they quickly changed our room to a bungalow second floor out by the pool  It was lovely  The room was great and the service was awesome  The second night we were there however we wanted to get into the hot tub because it was very cold that night  We were told to get out of the hot tub  it was closed  even though it wasnt nearly ten yet   I thought in Vegas  nothing ever closes   We complained to the front desk about it  and they told us  well  we dont guests to get sick   because it was cold outside  The casino is small and smoky  but they are all smoky  but were from California   Dont eat at The Dam resteraunt for breakfast its awful  Other than that DO go visit Holly in the bar  she was a great person to hang around  
N =>   Not impressed with Hooters My wife and I just returned from a   night stay at the Hooters Hotel and Casino  We arrived in a good mood  but left disappointed We had reserved a non smoking room with a king size bed  However  during check in  we were informed that none of these rooms were available  After telling the young man at the registration desk that we had specifically reserved a non smoking room with a king size bed several weeks ago  he told us that Hooters doesn t accept reservations  only requests for rooms  and none of the rooms that we requested were available  This wouldn t have been that big of a deal if we hadn t traveled across the country and my credit card hadn t already been billed for our   night stay We asked for an upgrade  but were told that the only rooms available were smoking rooms with   full size beds  but that we could be moved to the type of room we requested the next day  Since we didn t have any other options  we decided to accept his offer  I asked for a discount for the inconvenience  but was given four free drink coupons instead Our first room was on the second floor  The view out of our open  unlocked  broken sliding glass door was of some electrical equipment  The bed comforters smelled strongly of smoke  the water took over a minute to get hot  and it tasted moldy The next day  we had to wait until      PM for our  quot expected quot  room to become available  The water in this room still tasted moldy  but the water didn t take long to heat up since hot water was constantly leaking from the shower  This was more of a feature than a problem for us  This room also overlooked the pool area  which was a bonus  but it didn t change our impression of the hotel  Perhaps if we got this room from the start  we d be happier with the hotel The maids were the nicest people in the hotel  The staff at the registration desk were mixed  Some were very nice  some weren t The Hooters restaurant was good  but no different than any other Hooters restaurant across the country The casino is small compared to other nearby casinos  but this wasn t a big deal to us  since we don t gamble much This hotel is a   minute walk from the intersection of Tropicana Blvd  and Las Vegas Blvd  If you ve never been to Las Vegas before or stayed on The Strip  this probably won t be an issue  However  having stayed at New York New York last year  my wife and I agreed that it would be worth the few extra bucks a night to stay on The Strip in a newer hotel than save money by staying off the strip in this refurbished hotel  
N =>   Hooters is NOT a new hotel  My wife and I have just returned from a trip to Las Vegas  We booked our hotel online  when the price for the room showed up at what we thought was a too good to be true price  We called to talk in person to verify there was no mistake  We were instucted that the rate was a promotional rate because it was a new hotel  We were given a choice of tower rooms or poolside bungalows We chose a bungalow  BAD DECISION  First  there is nothing  quot new quot  about this hotel  It is a slightly refurbished group of old buildings  The bungalow room we were given was dirty  and rundown to say the least  As it was late in the evening we decided to  quot deal with it  quot  for the night  We attempted to clean our room  only to notice there were ants crawling all over the bathroom counter  Not to worry a few ants can t be that big of a deal  I will just take a quick shower and take care of things in the morning  Hah   Not a chance  unless a cold shower was good enough  after all it was a cheap rate  The hot water was almost non existent in the tub  I don t mean that the water would only flow cold  I mean water wouldn t flow at more than a trickle from the hot water faucet   this  quot new quot  hotel has old two handle faucets  probably got a good deal on them on E bay  The water flow wasn t enough to make the shower head spray  At least the bed had a comfortable mattress  Upon going to the front desk in the morning and bringing my concerns to their attention  I was informed  quot  What do you expect you booked the cheapest room in the place quot  After being insulted in a such a manner  I answered back  quot  I don t consider a clean  bug free room with running hot water to be too much to ask for  After a few more snotty comments from both sides I was informed  I would be moved to a tower room for the remainder of my stay  however they wouldn t be able to move me until the afternoon The remainder of my stay went off without any additonal problems  however I do not believe I will consider returning to a hotel where it is OK to allow a guest to pay the  quot asking price quot  for a room  misrepresent what that room is  then insult the guest for not paying more  
N =>  Felt very welcome We were not sure what to expect  but we were very happy with everything there  All the staff were very friendly and questions were answered right away  the pool area was nice the way they have it set up  no matter where you were sitting you had a good view of all the action going on  George the security guy by the pool was so very friendly even if he had to keep his eye on alot of things The room was just perfect  Well i was not to crazy about the colors  but who cares  the beds were so very  very comfortable  we were right behind the elevators and i worried about the sound  but that was doable also I would stay there again in a second  very close to things we wanted to see As a first time Black Jack player  i felt that the dealer was so nice to help explaine things and even when i lost I felt that she felt for me  nice  
N => Great Time Had By All Once again the staff at hooters were great  Everyone was so friendly and helpful  Nothing was any trouble  We will definitely stay there again next time we go to Vegas  The bed was the best we ve ever slept in  
N => Not a bad place to stay If you book the hotel in advance i would say you will get a better room We reached Las Vegas at   am in the morning and got room in this hotel The room was not appreciable ac duct was making lots of noice We also booked a room in the same hotel in advance for the next day which was pretty decent one Reasonable price served my purpose  
N =>  Don t even think about it  not worth it even if just passing through  We chose to stay here because we were driving home from california and got tired on the drive  we didnt need anything too extravegant  we were only going to spend the evening there and then wake up early and get back on the road  The lobby was nice and the price was right   but we were quickly dissapointed when we were put on the  rd floor and it took forever to go through all these hallways that were about    degrees  Our room  when we arrived was so unbearabley hot we had to stand on our balcony  We could not get the air to turn on so we had to call maintanence to get it it running  and it took at least an hour for the room to get remotely comfortable  We turned down the bed and there was long hairs in the sheets like they were not changed from the last visitors  There was no clock anywhere in the room  the tv speakers were blown  and the corners or the rooms where filled with dirt  The worst of the night was that the people next to us were so loud and going in and out of the hallway slamming their door so loud  Time after time this went on through the night  and then at  am they are screaming so loudly at each other that we can hear word for word what they are fighting about   the police came and handled the situation  But overall the location seemed a little dangeous and as a woman i was not comfortable to even leave the room  
N =>  Careful Not a good stay  Rooms were not the best in the world  Not sure if they had double booking issues or kept giving people the same rooms but multiple people kept coming into our rooms because they had been given the same ones  Also  our wake up call was a guy knocking on our door telling us to get up  This place seemed a little sketchy  
N =>  Owner of this hotel is a fraud and liar  After a flight delay  arrived at this hotel a little after midnight which was no problem since I had guaranteed late arrival via credit card  My reservation read  quot NON SMOKING QUEEN quot   I was given a Queen room that was smoking and had a strong smoke smell  I went down to the desk to point out that I had reserved a NON Smoking Queen room  The owner asked if I didn t want the room  thinking that he was offering me another room  I said   quot Yes quot   He subsequently gave me a piece of paper showing a zero charge  I asked him what was going on and he told me I could take my business elsewhere  I said no  I m not going anywhere  I have a reservation  He told me he didn t want my business  I told him that I needed to stay at that hotel as it was extremely late  close to my destination the next day  and that I would call Howard Johnson reservations  I called reservations and they said that they couldn t do anything about it  Even if you exclude the fraudulent cancellation by this  quot owner quot   the fact that Howard Johnson reservations don t even stick up for their own customers means they should be put out of business  I told the owner that reservations insisted that I get my room  He asked to speak with them  saying they had no right to tell him how to run his business  and I refused  I needed someone to take my side  I begged the manager to help me out  he said he couldn t do anything as the owner controlled the entire hotel  I still refused to leave  After saying something like   quot Please sir  I would appreciate it if you could accommodate me  and even though the smoking room was not what I reserved it is better than nothing quot   he remained silent for a couple of minutes longer and finally gave me a non smoking king size room on the first floor  Finally the pressure was off  and I was staying there two nights  but I would NEVER stay there again                                     Stayed         and           
N =>   I wouldn t recommend Was not pleased with this property  We were here on business and had to pick a place close to our event  All around this area were wedding chapels and people walking  It was kind of scary  Everything here was small  The bathroom  you were barely able to get into and the one queen we had was almost at the dresser at the end of the bed  I just felt cramped in this room and wouldn t really recommend unless you have no choice  
N =>  DO NOT STAY HERE    I cannot stress enough  do not stay at this hotel  We were asked to leave by the manager for querying that we had booked a king bed and the bed in our room was a queen  He told us just because we had booked it doesnt mean we get it  I am not joking I have never experienced a hotel or hotel staff like it  We had no where else to go but were told  quot don t worry we can find you somewhere quot   quot if you don t like it you can leave quot  we saw the manager also ask for  quot time outs quot  with other guests  The  nd night the air conditioning broke in the room and we were too scared to complain even though it was     degrees outside  we also wanted more pillows but were afraid to ask  also our tv and lights in the rm did not work  The hotel is right at the end of the strip a good   mins to an hour walk to the main hotels  please do yourself a favour and stay at one of the resorts  we moved to the MGM grand and it was fantastic and cheaper    I have complained to Howard Johnson and I got a free night to stay there again  if I return to las vegas  Trust me if I return to LV I will never ever go back to this hotel again  
N =>   cigarette burns on pillows dirty towels blood in sink     i stayed here because it was the most inexpensive hotel i could find for my friend s birthday  there was what looked to be BLOOD in the sink  the towels literally had dirt on them  the sheets and pillow cases had cigarette burns in them  there was a  quot suspicious quot  stain on the floor next to the bed  while we were sleeping  a large motorcycle gang  maybe    people or more     was outside blaring loud music  having a party and yelling from about midnight until approx   am  we called the front desk about   times to complain and ask them to get security to shut the people up  they refused  then at  am  the motorcycle gang started up again  reving their engines  talking loud  playing music  we called again  still no help  when we checked out  we demanded a refund and luckily we got one  it turns out  that night  because the motorcycle gang was SO scary  several staff members QUIT and the entire lobby was filled with complaining hotel guests  all demanding their money back  this place is DISGUSTING  do NOT stay here  
N =>   Complete Filthy Dump  This was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in in my life The manager  quot OSCAR quot  was so rude  I get to the front desk and I tell the manager I have paid for one night in advance  He tells me I have to pay for the other two nights up front  I say No I don t I have never done that before and that I will pay for the other two nights before check out time in the morning He got angry with me and told me that he would have to cancel my two nights and if they were still available I could get them but not at the rate I had if I didn t pay up front  I asked him where in his hotel did it say I had to pay up front for all nights he just said i m not going to argue with you its the rule I told him to do what he had to do I wasn t going to pay up front  I usually do this because I want to see the room  st  I AM SO GLAD I DID NOT PAY UP FRONT   The room is on the second floor  NO ELEVATORS IN THE FREAKIN quot  HOTEL    I had to lug   big bags upstairs   I get upstairs and there are the maids sitting and talking and eating lunch in the hallway  I open the door to the room and it smells I look at the beds and the spreads on the beds look like they haven t been washed in    years  Just nasty and filty dirty  I pull the spreads back and see that the blankts underneath are nastier than the spreads I grab my things and go back to the lobby and I tell the manager he has to be kidding if he thinks i m going to stay in that filth  I tell him to go look for himself but he doesnt want to which leads me to believe he knows what kind of hotel he is running A SLEAZE BAG hotel He gives me another room on the  st floor  I go to this room SMELLS  I look at the bed spreads nasty and dirty  I pull the bed spread back and discover that these beds have no blanket just sheets  I go into the bathroom and there is a  inch long COCKROACH  i run to the front desk and tell the manager to come look so he won t think I am making this up  He comes to look and gets a maid to come also  I show him and he says the reason there was a roach in my room is because my room was close to the pool area outside   that is no justification for a big       roach to be in my room   There were no hair dryers or irons in the room like advertised  I wouldn t have used them anyway  The pictures on the website are a smoke screen  The only thing remodeled was the lobby the rooms SUCK He then goes on to tell me he can give me a refund  I say that would be good  He then says well if I give you a refund you have to leave  I was like you re kidding me right This was All Star Weekend with a couple of conventions going also  even if I did consider leaving there were NO ROOMS available ANYWHERE  I was stuck  Luckily for me I am the type of traveler who brings their own sheets  pillow cases and bath towels or it really would have been all bad  The next morning I was out of there  my trip was cut short because I didn t have anywhere else to stay and I am so glad my friend that was supposed to come didn t make it  that would have been so embarrasing because I am the one who made the reservations  DONT STAY AT THIS DUMP  If you are used to staying in nice clean hotels Like I am then this is one Howard Johnsons that is giving the chain a bad name I found out later through a series of complaints I am giving this hotel that they are all independantly owned and they have the use of the name Howard johnsons  If they get enough complaints the privlage of using the name will be stripped away from the owner  I HOPE SO they don t deserve to use it  
N =>  Nasty Nasty Nasty This was the nastiest hotel we have ever stayed in  Had reservations but check in was a big hassle  The lobby was nice so assumed the rooms would be but they were the dirtiest rooms I ve ever seen  have stayed in hotels much cheaper than this one that weren t near as nasty  Room was very crowded with dirty furniture and very smelly  Threw away the white socks I wore the  st night  yes we were stupid enough to stay   nights  long story  as they were black  never took my shoes off the rest of the stay  When I wrote HJ corp  to tell them we would never stay in an HJ again they had the hotel contact me which they sent me a coupon for a free night stay  weeknight only and only that hotel  and I mailed it back and said  quot thanks  but no thanks quot   Also not sure how safe the hotel was  Can t think of one good thing to say about this place 
N =>   What ever you do make sure you bring your gun  I was short on time  I rented two rooms for our group  I requested two rooms with queen beds   First thing when we checked in they gave wrong rooms  Two rooms with twin beds  next was the stench in the hallways  At least they had new pavement  Money spent on pavement would have been beter spent on paint and carpet There was broken glass in the other room  They never did clean that up even after several requests  It is no wonder the Shot Show pesenters did not recommend this hotel  It would be best to dozer it and put a carwash in it s place If you are into watching this would be ok  the prostitute walking down the hallway was different  They also have a porno sore and strip club right across the street  SEEDY is not even enough to describe this place  The photo used to describe this location must have been taken    years ago  Stay at Circus Circus instead  They have a full circus      this place only has a FLEA CIRCUS         Maggie bring your gun    Also free dope in the parking lot   
N =>  Dirty Linen On my first night I wanted to go to sleep  however the still dirty and stained linen prevented me from doing so  The bed had been made over top of this linen   need I say more  I do not recommend this place  I would rather stay in a hostel  
N => About what we expected but worse  Well  I have never cared for Howard Johnson s motels anyway  and the ONLY reason we stayed here was that we were traveling the West with our constant travel companion  our small    lb  dog  and we could not find places in Las Vegas which allow pets  Also  when we called HJ s reservations to inquire about this hotel  we were told that it was one of their Gold Medal Award Winning Properties with nicely renovated rooms  So much for truth in advertising But  it was somewhat worse than I had expected and its billing as being  quot on the Strip quot  is pretty much stretching it  It was on Las Vegas Blvd   however  it was miles to a decent  safe area  The rooms  carpets  furnishings  and spreads  sheets  etc  were not only old  frayed and dingy but just looked downright nasty  I don t believe that we could have stayed there more than one night   our  quot little guy quot  even seemed depressed by it I could go on and on  but you get the picture  Unless you are in desperate need of a hotel room and absolutely cannot find anywhere else  do not stay here  
N =>  Don t Bother   Location Location Location We had spent    days travelling around the southwest of USA  This was one of the worse  Room needed up dating  This is was the only motel in the    days that had a warning about taking the towels  they would charge you if any towels where missing and it included a price list for each and every towel and bath mat  I was tempted to take all the towels to the front desk in when I checked out to prove all towels where there  Staff only just plesant to you  The location     Near the  strip   be warned you have to walk almost a mile to get to the bottom end of the strip in the heat it is hard work and   miles to the bellagio  and you have to walk past other motels that rent room by the hour          Did not feel safe walking around in the late afternoon and only did it once in the evening and that was to the internet cafe to book somewhere else  Thankfully I did not have any children with me  Would not stay there ever again  Went to the internet cafe and booked else where for the rest of our stay  If I could give it no points at all it would be better  Stay there at your peril  
N =>  Needs Improvement   Rooms are old  need renovation  pool not cleaned properly and unsafe  A C old and too noisy  stained walls  I would never stay here again  not for the money I paid  Howard Johson needs to drop this location from their franchise list or get rid of it if they own it  
N =>   Stay away safety comes first  Bad  unsafe area of Las Vegas  My car was broken into in the hotel parking  the GPS was stolen  Hotel was extremely experienced and cleaned the broken window glass quickly to hide the shame from the guests  Security cameras are installed everywhere inside the hotel but none outside  If you worry about safety   stay away  I had to waste a day of my trip and paying      to fix the window  The manager was apathetic    quot there is nothing we can do   quot   quot we are not responsible    quot Stay away  safety comes first  
N =>   Poor Choice for CES Attendees As a travel arranger for our company I made this reservation directly on short notice due to all other hotels filled  My traveler attended a convention and this hotel was on the shuttle route  However  the staff was unaware of the timing or any information relative to the shuttle to get to from the convention and kept referring to going to pick up the shuttle at another nearby hotel  Rooms a bit worn dirty  and staff were just ok  Not a good choice for people expecting shuttle service for a convention  
N =>   Not up to Par This was my second stay at this property and this stay was not as good as the last  Great TV and great bed but the room was a little dirty  The elliptical machine in the workout room had old dirt and sweat and looked like it hadn t been wiped down in a long while  The gym wipe dispenser was out of wipes too  Breakfast was unimpressive  They ran out of juice glasses and charge extra money for eggs or sausage  Some of the staff members were friendly while others were not  Guys that stepped off the shuttle bus in suites where greeted warmly  The staff just kind of stared at me when I walked in like maybe they thought I wanted to rob the place and I m a GP Platinum member who travels regularly  This place also smells  When Hyatt remodeled the property they apparently spend money on new granite  wallpaper and carpet but forgot to scrape the popcorn ceilings in the rooms and the halls so this material holds the same old stale  smokey smell the hotel had when it was a dumpy old Amerisuites  For GP members who need a place in Vegas to accumulate points  I guess it is okay for a night or two  however  I would NEVER bring my wife to a place like this  Hyatt Place still has a ways to go before they are up to the level of Holiday Inn Express or riott Courtyard  
N =>  Ok for families  Don t expect much  Hyatt was good w  our kid  We had to share a room  which is always a bum  Kid on sofabed in living room part  We were cumfy  Bed was foamy  Breakfast was toast  fruit  coffee  no eggs meat  which left much to be desired  Not enough people working to refill coffee pots  etc  Long lines for breakfast  Even so  for price paid        it was clean and nice and I d recommend for families  It s a re don AmeriSuites  Best part was huge flat screen TV  Off strip  and quiet  except for airplanes  right near the airport   Front desk printed out a list of places to take children  which was very nice  and the free shuttle took us to the strip  GREAT   but didn t know info  for the Strip bus     all day is good for    hrs    Drop off was at Planet Hollywood which was fine and close to everything  Paris  and Bellagio   
N =>   Great Place to Stay  We stayed at the Hyatt Place   th     th       while we were in Las Vegas for the PBR World Finals  We chose this hotel because it is close to the Thomas and Mack Center and we could walk to the event each night  The staff was amazing  Everytime we entered the hotel they welcomed us back and asked if we needed anything  Even the shuttle driver asked us if our room was ok and if we needed anything  The free breakfast was adequate  We took advantage of their free shuttle to the strip which leaves every hour during the day until      pm  The rooms are comfortable and clean  When we were ready to leave for our trip home  the shuttle took us back to the airport at no charge  We travel often for both business and pleasure and stay in alot of   star hotels  We were so impressed with the staff at the Hyatt Place compared to other hotels  We will definitely stay at this hotel again and highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a clean  comfortable room at an affordable price just minutes from the strip  
N =>   some issues not a great stay I hate Las Vegas  I needed to stay here for one night and wanted a hotel with no casino  no smoking  and off strip  This was all those things however various parts of the hotel smell of smoke anyway  I guess it can t be avoided in Vegas and since there were Europeans everywhere in the hotel perhaps it was just their complete lack of understanding of the non smoking concept that caused this  The decor is stylish but the rooms were pretty average other than the    inch LCD TV  All the plumbing drains and supply hoses were fully exposed in the room which was very ugly  Also  apparently I had an accessible room and the shower was a handheld type  The handheld unit looks like it was replaced yet the mount was from the previous model so the shower head flopped around and I could not take a shower without holding the shower head  room      Also  I was awoken out of a dead sleep early in the morning   am  by maintenance  He said that his paperwork showed that the room was vacant     minutes later housekeeping came also thinking the room was vacant  They should have fixed this issue the first time I was disturbed  I called the front desk to have them ensure that I would not be disturbed again  This was unacceptable The breakfast was satisfactory  It was motel style fare but that s fine  Bed linens and bed were motel style as well Based on my search of hotels and prices for this stay  I think this place was worth half what I paid  I would say for a weekend in the summer this place is not worth more than      considering all the other options I love the Hyatt Place concept but this stay just didn t work for me  I look forward to trying the Aloft hotels from Starwood once they open in more cities that I need to visit  Perhaps they ll get it right I still hate Vegas  
N =>   Pleasant stay Stayed here after Delta cancelled our flight and booked us in here  Located very close to the airport and the free shuttle will collect and or drop you to airport Reception staff member was most unhelpful when we discovered we had to return to airport and collect a different voucher from the airline to pay for our stay   she wouldn t let us leave our luggage even though the stay was confirmed by DL  Not our favourite person Room was lovely  very spacious  modern and spotlessly clean  Get the impression this is a newly refurbished hotel  
N =>  Gutes Hotel   leider in Einflugschneise des Flughafens  
N => Robbed The place was horrible  Not only was service terrible when we first arrived but we were actually robbed in the middle of the night while we slept  We think someone from the staff did it as our door was locked  When we reported the incident the following morning  we were ignored by security and he actually told us to hope  quot our money may be returned quot   That was all he could did  Never again will I stay here  With the money we lost  we could have stayed somewhere way better  
N =>   Imperial Palace   ho hum Room was decent  low cost  but noisy because of outdoor bar next door till   am  Requested a king got   doubles  Casino had a lot of smoking  cheesey lip sinkers  Central location  
N =>   HATED IT    DIDNT EVEN STAY THE SECOND NIGHT me and my boyfriend stayed at the imperial palace and it was like staying in the ghetto of AC  We opened the window and we were staring at a brick wall  The room smelled like cigarettes  and wasn t even attached to the lobby we had to haul all of our to the back o the hotel out into a dark alley and up   flights of stair into a motel in the back parking lot  NO RESTAURANT WORTH EATING AT  NO DANCE CLUBS  HORRRRRIBLE IMPERSONATOR PERFORMANCES  AND HIDDEN FEE S WHEN YOU CHECK OUT THE SECOND NIGHT WE CHECKED OUT AND STAYED AT THE MONTE CARLO WHICH WAS ONLY    MORE A NIGHT TOTALLY WORK THE EXTRA    BUCKS however Imperial Palace didn t even refund my money for the nights we canceled  RIP OFFFFF  
N =>   DON T BE MISSLEAD i have read all the bad reviews about the I P and the last time i was here   yrs ago  SEE THE CARS   i would have agreed BUT THEY GAVE A GR  DEAL so i went w  low expectations but they have done a gr  job making this place over the room was nice the staff was nice  amp  helpful a little construction here  amp  there but that says   me we are trying to give this old girl a makeover and i think they are doing a GR  JOB no this is not the Paris OR CEASARS but a good value    the only complaint was the buffet was bad    all day eats  one of the worst i ve had they served the lunch menu along w  breakfast   am that does not give much confidence about lunch we   lunch but that was all we could take we skipped dinner  lucy the server was fast amp very good at her job lucy was the best part of the buffet too bad she didn t cook     in closing the i p is a nice value hotel casino w  a very bad buffet stay here but eat another buffet 
N =>   Wedding From Hell We don t even know where to begin   I guess in   when the IP ruined our engagement   found feces and puke throughout bathroom  and holes in the sheets big enough to drive a truck thru   when we complained to the front desk   the moved us at      at night   we don t get an I m sorry   just the website address   all they did was promise not to do it again  seeing the chapel already had our money  which of course was no refundable    don t get us started on the run down  shotty appearance of the chapel  which they dropped our unity candle  that we had to find out by our parents telling us about    Now for the hotel stay     The start   being locked out of our hotel room  for most of the day  making us miss the final Tux fitting and cake decorator meeting   having thier so called securty treating us like criminals  to cover thier maids going into our hotel room  when the Do Not Disturb Sign was hung    this happen to several of our guest  money taken from one guest  FILTHY ROOMS     To Not Being Able to brush your teeth without the water clogging up  and don t even think about taking a shower  without the drain overflowing    THIS WAS IN THE PENTHOUSE       When we arranged with the bellmen concerning our wedding cake  Valet forced the car to be moved  before bellman arrived  causing Cake to be damaged by other guest      never got   I m Sorry  in fact  after we made our incident report in the security office  was told to vacate the premises  we got to the penthouse  and found our stuff was being loaded onto the cart  and as we came into the room  found the bellman had dropped our wedding gifts  and was standing and kicking them out of his way  and he continued to pack our luggage   not even to bother to pick up the gifts      when Hotel Manager finally arrives  after    minutes with security in tow    never an apology  when my bride said she just wanted to leave this mad house  with tears running down her face  on her hands an knees picking up the broken wedding gifts  the manager has the balls to say  he also wants us off the property as quickly as possible    I can certainly see why  with the guest gathering in the hallway  then we were escorted from the penthouse  down the elevators  thru the crowed hoted casino lobby  like criminals  for all to see    shame on you  shame on you    and the worst part  WE PAID FOR THIS KIND OF TREATMENT  In What Universe is this JUST  This does not include the horror stories from our guests    EXPECT A VISIT FROM OUR LAWYER  You deserve it     Gave you every oppurtunity to make this right      SHAME ON YOU     
N =>   Well at least we saved money I have been a member of Harrah s Gold Rewards for over    years  and I have to say that I have NEVER had a stay as bad as this one in any of the Harrah s hotel casinos  The room was okay  clean  and they gave me the extra coffee that I requested  The D cor was straight out of the    s   mirror on the ceiling and everything Negative     We went to find something to eat   granted it was   pm  but this is Vegas and we are at a casino   but finding food was a joke  The hotel s after hour s food choices are the Burger Palace or Ginseng    Bad choices since we can t eat burgers and don t like Korean  Japanese  amp  Chinese foods  So we were forced to go out on the strip to find something to eat Negative      The coffees we ordered from the Cocktail Waitress were watery and almost cold  We don t drink and only order water and or coffee  and yes  we do tip the Cocktail Waitress  Negative      Hard to find  quot Non Smoking quot  sectionNegative      The next morning we went to take our showers and were surprised to find that there are no hand holds to assist in getting in or out of the large Roman Luv Tub  especially since you had to climb into it to shower Negative      The next afternoon after we returned to our room for a rest  we found that although the bed was made  the rest of the room wasn t clean  The garbage wasn t emptied  the coffee pot was not cleaned  amp  emptied  no fresh coffee  dirty counters  etc  We called down and talked to housekeeping about the problem  and they seemed to have an attitude that I was bothering them with a trivial matter  When we returned later that evening  we found that they emptied the coffee pot  wiped the bathroom counter and that was it  Garbage was still in the trash cans  paper bits were still on the carpet  i e  not vacuumed   etc I could go on  but suffix to say that I am writing to Harrah s about this experience  
N =>   Poor very noyse expensive  They put us in a room without soundproof  we couldn t sleep at the first night  then we asked to change  They tell us is a   star hotel but for me  was a   star one  
N =>   We will stay there again We booked a deluxe room under a special mid week promotional rate  three nights           Our room         was clean  comfortable  quiet  short walk to elevators  not luxe by any means  but met every requirement for moderate cost accommodations and had lots of big plush towels  Fantastic fantastic location on the Strip  We had some facilities issues  slow draining toilet and shower  but called the desk and an engineer showed up within    minutes with his rolling toolkit to solve the problems  We needed wi fi which is available for an extra     day    it performed flawlessly  Hotel staff was helpful not intrusive  Elevators were a little slow at times  We did not eat in any of the hotel restaurants    but used the coupon book we were given on check in to dine at the Flamingo  Paris  and Harrah s    all right up the street  The Imperial Palace is an east walk  as well  to Bellagio  Caesars Palace  Venetian  Ballys and Mirage  
N =>   wedding nightmare in vegas I searched online for the perfect wedding chapel inside a hotel because i was told you have a better experience if they are connected to a casino hotel  I am familiar with Harrahs and believed them to be top notch with their properties and treatment of guests The wedding planner was very nice and helpful the entire time while making arrangements and planning the wedding so I felt confident my first and only wedding would be wonderful  we booked our rooms at the IP along with the maid of honor  best man  and grooms parents  and sister and brother in law   when we arrived my wedding dreams began to fall apart   we had been told we could choose the background for the chapel that was not true  we did not receive the runner or flower petals down the aisle  we were told they had a selection of music to choose from for our first dance  they didnt have it available for us so we gave them   song choices and asked to be called if they didnt have them  the day of my wedding i asked which song we were going to have  never got an answer and it ended up being a song I had never heard  and the minister anounced it as our last dance  the way everything reads I believed the toast was included as part of ceremony and would be on dvd  it isnt they had our sparking cider and broken glasses in a bag for us to take like party favors  the wedding planner was aware that my parents are deceased  and reminded when we arrived because they asked about them and I broke down in tears   it was very hard to get married w out my my and dad   the day of my wedding the photorapher kept asking where my mom was for pics in the brides room   then even when i said my parents weren t coming they were dead he proceeded to have the grooms mom stand up saying he thought she was my mom  the wedding planner wouldnt let the best man and maid of honor sign the certificate because it had to be ledgible  She then proceeded to put the grooms name in the witness spot so our certificate is full of white out the minister was cracking jokes  it didnt seem appropriate as we had not even met him before the ceremony   I found out his name by reading our marriage lisence We were mislead by the wedding planner on how many picture we were atually getting in our package and afterwards found out why no one was allowed to take any pics in the chapel   the photograher s packages were expensive the wedding planner set up appointments for myself and my maid of honor at the salon located inside IP for hair updo and makeup before the wedding         for that seemed high but hey it was my weding day and we should be pampered right   well they ended up charging us an extra         saying we didnt get basic updo   by the way my maid of honor had to redo both our hair because I didnt even get off the elevator and my tiarra fell out and curls were gone  hers were falling too   The Princess wedding chapel did nothing to compensate us for our disaterous wedding Our room at the IP was a deluxe so we actualy got a one cup coffee maker  but only enough coffee for one cup  we are   adults who drink coffee  the maid did find us a little more one day but told us they were out so we had to go buy coffee and rig a filter in order to have coffee   we were lucky because the regular rooms do not even get a coffeemaker so our family had to either come to our room in the morning or set off to find and buy coffee the faucet in our luv tub didnt work properly couldnt get hot water to come out so had to haul water from the shower in the bathroom to fill it and then the faucet wouldnt turn off so we had a trickle going  the doors on the closet were off the track my husband had to keep fixing then everytime we needed to get into it  the sliding glass door was hard to open and kept going off track too 
N =>   a bit disappointed Was there for a week and upon returning i found that my digital camera was missing  I left it in my room and never used it   Reported it missing but seemed like a waste of time since they didnt seem too interested  Older rooms but centrally located to the strip  just cant trust leaving anything in your room  
N =>  not everybody is disappointed with this hotel I read review about this hotel after it had been booked Most people werent happy I can honestly say ot her than a twenty minute wait to check in I would reccomend this hotel Its not expensive but hotel staff very helpful our room was clean and tidy Under bed could do with a clean though We did have the buffet which got slated in reviews It was value for money after all what do people want for     A good location some people we met where not happy with there room they were moved to a different one I would stay at this hotel again  
N =>   Another Perfect Vacation With Imperial Palace This is our  th stay at imperial palace with the value and customer service on all of our visits it won t be the last  We arrived early as always they got us right into a room   hrs early  i asked for a room with a view  Our room was right over the pool great view but a little loud for us  I went to the front desk to see if we could switch rooms   minutes later and no trouble at all we were in a new room  My wife takes mecidation that needs to be kept cold so they comp  us a fridge in our room for the entire   night stay  The maid service was impeccable everything was spotless and plenty of towels   don t forget to leave a few dollars for the maid it will be well appreciated  Room service took literally    minutes and was HOT and FRESH  And best of all we checked out on our tv and didn t pay any attention to the price a few days later reviewing my visa statement we realized they charged us      less than our reservation price  when i inquired why i was told they automatically change your reservation to the lower price  Well appreciated surprise  just to let you know what a great deal this was i payed      for a   night stay  including saturday  and room service once  Excellent visit we visit every   months as its such a great value we can strech our vacation budget alot further  A                     
N =>  People are hard to please Just returned from a   night stay  our first time at this hotel and too be honest I cannot see what all the fuss is about I did not have any blood on the walls or vomit on the carpet  no probs with the plumbing although it did take awhile for the water to drain after a shower but other than that it was fine Staff were friendly and helpful  room was always cleaned when we returned  never had to wait more than a couple of minutes for the lift   or as our Americans cousins refer to them  quot elevators quot   which usually had chatty and friendly Americans in them We tried the emporers buffet and to be honest quite enjoyed it  one of the few places in Vegas that offered value in my opinion In all honesty for the price you pay I think it is a great hotel and despite the fact that our last trip to Vegas was to a   star hotel I would certainly stay at the Imperial again Vegas on the other hand I have a lot of complaints about and will not be returning to  I dont feel that this is the place to talk about it but I felt strongly enough to email the or and was flabbergasted when I got a reply  which was very polite but none the less  unless things change dramatically in that town I will not get the opportunity to stay at the Imperial again  
N =>  Basic room but a good bargain Was able to book a  quot Deluxe quot  room in the tower on a non smoking floor  Room is decorated like a      s motel  and is rather dark as the only window is a single sliding door to a little balcony  The elevators have stained carpeting and are a little jerky  and the hallways look anything but upscale  But you can t beat the price  My room was clean and quiet  Was quieter than MGM  Slept well  although the mattress was not terribly comfortable  Nice iron  amp  clean ironing board  My only complaint is there was no safe in the room  
N =>  Worst hotel on the strip Do not stay here   this place is flithy and even after changing rooms   times   ended up sleeping in my clothes  They wouldn t even do a refund for the cancellations on the rest of our reservations  
N =>  First time and last at The IP The parking lot is kind of a pain to find  When we went they were having an AARP convention so there was no non smoking rooms left all thowe i requested one They upgraded me to a mini suit witch was nice  Some one on are floor ordered food to there room after eating it they wheeled the table out in to the hall were it was for the whole trip some one on the last day took the table and put the food plates on the floor next to the door  The smoke smell in the game room was bad  It is in a great location but after walking the whole strip from end to end there are a lot of better hotels for the same or even less money  The pool seams like a nomal back yard pool  nothing like the other hotels  For the first time ever going to vegas it was an okay hotel we were not in it very much  If you go to embers the fine dining place there two people can split a meal very easy  And if you are young like we are expect to be the youngest people there  
N =>  Don t Pass this one by Have been and stayed in Las Vegas for the past    years  Needless to say that my husband and I have frequented several hotels  We have stayed in   Star down to   Star and along with us have seen them either age and pass on or age and be maintained  I don t care what you have read or heard but anyone who tells you not to stay at the Imperial Palace really needs to reevaluate their thinking  Their check in service was fast  The room  a simple deluxe  was both larger and cleaner than some of those that we have stayed in at higher priced hotels  We saw two of the best shows on the strip right in the convenience of the hotel itself and were given discount coupons for the both of them when we arrived  Even the show tickets had several perforated coupons attached to them that we used to receive even further discounts in the hotel restaurants which were not bad at all  The location cannot be beat  Every age group was represented and everyone   guests  hotel workers  etc    were absolutely friendly  My husband and I were shocked at what we had been missing  It all boils down to attitude  If you go to any hotel with a negative outlook before you get there  then by all means you will have a terrible time  But if you go with a flexable one  then Aha  You will have the great time that we had  By the way   the elevators were A    fast or even faster than any other hotel we were in  And it is apparent to us that the Imperial is undergoing some cosmetic changes in that everything was clean and shining  The crowd was hopping and we had a blast  Thank you Imperial  We will return  
N =>  Good hotel   great location  I was pleasntly surprised by the hotel  The location was perfect  there was free parking  the rooms were huge  clean and well equipped and we had a great stay The casino was buzzing   and the hotel was a great place to explore Nevada  amp  Arizona  
N =>   Great location mid strip serviceable nothing outstanding at all Stayed here twice and its worked both times b c of the cheapness and location on the strip  Absolutely no frills room in the  quot Capri quot  area of the hotel  a bit longer of a walk to the strip  but perfect for most vegas trips  because who wants to hang out in the hotel room in vegas  Casino in this hotel is not great   cheap hold em tourneys daily  mostly crowded gaming floor  cheesy dealertainers  food is very average  not that I was expecting much  between harrah s and flamingo  I may not know what I m missing b c Ive been to vegas twice and only stayed here  it seems to be one of the main hotels for the cheap airline ticket hotel package deal  Will prob stay somewhere else next time just to change it up  but have no reason to avoid this hotel either  Very ordinary but not terrible  
N =>   Best Value In Vegas I stayed for   week in     and would definitely choose to stay there again on a budget trip  I picked the hotel because I needed to do this particular trip on a tight budget but still be mid strip   and it did the job perfectly  Of course the hotel doesn t compare to those that you would be paying   or   times the price for  which seems to be the main problem for a lot of travellers    however my own experience was that we got checked in really quickly and got a great room overlooking the pool  I already knew not to go for the strip view rooms if I wanted to sleep   We had a small bank of elevators near our room that we only had a wait for on our checkout morning  and even then only a couple of minutes   Our room  deluxe  was of good size  the bed was comfortable  the shower was great  amp  housekeeping did a great job   the room was always spotless upon our return  In short  this is the best value on the strip if you want to save more money for the many pleasures of Vegas  
N =>   Luv Tub Nightmare  Horrible Hotel    Ick I purchased a room for some friends of mine who were driving a long way to meet us in Vegas  Originally we planned to split the costs  and they didn t want an expensive room  My husband and I were staying at the Mirage  but it was booked full  So we thought  this was close   and I figured if I upgraded their room  it might be nicer that the standard rooms  which don t have a great reputation   I was WRONG  Upgrading was a mistake  Their room was actually in the basement  and was filthy  They didn t even bother to empty the ashtray  It smelled like mold and was comparable to a bad  quot by the hour quot  motel room  We are not picky people  but my friend ended up asking them to DOWNGRADE her just to get out of that room  Her standard room was   x better   but still pretty gross  I wouldn t recommend this hotel to anybody  except maybe a    hooker     Honestly    keep looking  
N =>   Great price great location better hotels out there Was my  st time in Vegas so I knew I wanted a central location  that was key  And price was very important to  since I was travelling alone  I had no one to split the cost with  When I got there  check in took a while but when I finally did get up to the counter  the staff was polite and friendly  I was told the only rooms I requested    queen king  were facing the Carnival Court  a very LOUD outdoor bar that has bands and a DJ until about  am   My other option was a smoking room  Thankful that he advised me of the possible noise instead of my being surprised  I took the smoking room  I realize I m in Vegas  but after being out shopping all day and partying all night  I want a quiet room to come back to and get some shut eye  So  off to my smoking room I went Luckily  I was on the  nd floor so no elevator needed  Try to get a room as low to ground as you can as the elevators take absolutely FOREVER  I was content with my  nd floor smoking room every time I walked by the elevators watching people standing there impatiently for easily    minutes  I know because when I checked in  I took the elevator  I couldn t get my luggage up the stairs on my own   View from my room   the cement wall of the hotels parking garage  Whatever  that didn t phase me at all  The room was quiet other than the occasional honk from a car in the garage  and that s all that mattered to me  The showers were good  water pressure good  lots of hot water and plenty of fresh linens  The beds were comfy  no complaints  When I did come home though  I had to wash everything in my suitcase because it smelled of smoke  Not a strong smell  but I m not a smoker  so I noticed it The buffet restaurant in the hotel   garbage  The breakfast was really bad  the lunch bad but not as bad as breakfast  I ate breakfast at Denny s down the street every morning  Coffee s good  egg s are hot  and it s cheap to  and everyone knows Denny s  so you know what you are getting The pool is nothing special  but it is there if you want  I spent a couple hours one day lounging by the pool  They had a DJ playing some good music  which I like  and girls walking around taking drink orders Overall  I d stay here again  but only if rooms at Harrah s weren t available or were outrageously priced  I m in Vegas to be out and about  not to hang out in my hotel room  so I m not one to stay at the more expensive places  these   suit me just fine  
N =>   Nice Stay Just recently stayed at Imperial Palace it was clean and not a bad hotel  
N =>  Close to casinos The room they gave me at first was only partly cleaned  The bed was made  but there was trash still in the bins and used towels on the bathroom floor  Reception was very helpful and gave me a different room without troubles  and this time it was clean  The Imperial is close to the rest of the casinos on the strip  however  in a large place like this one has to expect to do some walking to get to places  Would have had to pay for using internet in the room  which I didn t  
N =>   Dirt cheap great location if you just want a comfortable place to sleep  Right on the strip across from Caesar s  We paid     night for a Mon Thur stay  The room was clean but not fancy by any means  reminds me of a Comfort Inn or similar  Our floor was quiet  when we were there   Bed was surprisingly comfortable  even better than a riott we stayed at in Flagstaff  If you want luxury  go someplace else  If you want a cheap place to crash  right in the middle of the strip  check the IP  
N =>   Not for me Yep  it is everything that as been said on this site  My fourth time to Vegas  stopped in mgm signature last year   this time went with mate  who unfortunately was on a very tight budget  For me  coming back each night to this place became more depressing each visit  We found staff to be pleasant   amp  our deluxe refurb d  bedroom to be acceptable         BUT the rest of the place        Listen  if you dont mind classless tastless darkness   amp  can put up with all i have mentioned  then go for it  Showed my mate Gold Coast Hotel  cheaper just off strip  he now wishes we had stopped there  amp  got the free shuttle bus daily  People who say the dealertainers are good          must have been seeing different to what we saw  but ey  each to there own  personally i have never seen worse  Have now finished with Vegas  but it is a place i nothing but fond memories about  except one place   amp  believe everybody should visit here at least once in there lifetime 
N =>   Horrible     Disgusting    Our room was not clean at all  The bathroom looked like it hadn t been cleaned in weeks  The sink had tooth paste in it as well as the cap to a needle from the people before us  The toilet had crusty stuff all over the seat and the tank  VERY GROSS    The bathtub hadn t been cleaned either  We didn t even have a shower curtain  it was a bed sheet with holes cut in it  This was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in  I will NEVER step foot in the Imperial Palace again  
N =>   affordable The hotel is not really easy to access on the strip  You can see it from the strip but the entrance is quite hard to find  Room service was a bit slow but it was during spring break week  Room was roomy  Overall I would stay there again  
N =>   NEVER again   First of all this  quot Palace quot  is NOT a Palace  My now husband and I booked our trip almost   months in advance  When we arrived at this dump they had our reservations all wrong and we ended up in a room that we didn t book  Our room over looked a beautiful parking garage  When we got to our room the rugs were filthy   the bathroom was absolutely disgusting   We went to Vegas just to get married and have the Vegas wedding we always wanted   but this hotel almost ruined our trip  We had family travel with us as well for the wedding and their room had the pipes literally fall apart and spew black crud all over their bathroom which happened the day of our wedding and caused us to be late meeting our limo and late getting to our chapel  When you walked out the doors of the casino it constantly smelled like sewage  The rest of the hotel was dark and dingy and you had to wait FOREVER to get an elevator and when an elevator would finally show up it was usually jam packed and you had to wait for another and another  We would take the steps down to the casino floor but you could not take the steps back up to your room because the doors were locked  A friend ordered us room service for our wedding and we only received half of the order and our friends needed to be reimbursed  We ate at the    hr burger joint which was very filthy and my husband and I both got extremely ill immediately after  It was a horrible experience and I would never stay there again nor would I recommend this place to my worst enemy  
N =>   Poor check in service The hotel was a decent price and a good location  But by making reservations you have to wait until after the official   PM check in  People who didn t have reservations were able to check in and get hotel keys right away  we had   rooms and only   available by   PM  Then one room wasn t even cleaned after we got the keys to check in  Then we couldn t even get a discount  The noise was also annoying  And the pool closes way to early  We have stayed at the Circus Circus before and had better service and rooms  I would not stay at the Imperial Again  
N =>   GOOD VALUE      NO FRILLS Stayed in room        a mountain view between two wings of hotel  It is also near but not too near the slow lifts which many people complain about  Moved to this room after first being allocated a room almost overlooking Harrahs very loud outdoor music venue    no problem being moved We have stayed at The Imperial several times over the last sixteen years and it hasn t changed that much  no better  no worse  It is a good value  ideally located hotel  in need of some updating but clean with comfortable beds in good sized rooms with a generous bathroom The Emperors buffet we feel had deteriorated by last year but happy to say this year was much improved  though avoid sitting near the beverage station as it can get very noisy when servers are clearing the tables and stacking their carts  we had to move The covenience store in the hotel is very expensive  much better to walk to Walgreens outside the Venetian and buy from there I would have no hesitation to book The Imperial again next time I am in Las Vegas     
N =>   Our stay at the Imperial Palace We went to Vegas for our wedding  We stayed and got married at the Imperial Palace  For the most part our experience was a good one  The Wedding Chapel was great  Our room was clean  We ate at the breakfast buffet a couple of times which was good  We weren t impressed with the Pizza Palace  We had a good time walking through the Auto Show display  
N =>  Great value  When we went to check in  the room in the Capri building with a King bed that we had reserved was not available  amp  they told us that we would have a room with   double beds  I told them that it was our honeymoon  amp  that we had requested a king size bed  The gal immediately said oh  your honeymoon  well let me upgrade you  She asked if we minded being on the side above the outdoor club  amp  we didn t  cause we knew we d be sleeping in the day if at all   For the money it was an awesome room  The only complaint is we could of had was the elevator  I was not working properly the entire   days we were there  Some days only one was in service The pool staff was very friendly  amp  attentive  amp  even gave us a free shot because we were on our honeymoon Overall if  you re on a budget  amp  want somewhere to lay your head down for a couple of hours this place was great  We would stay there again  
N =>  servicable Well  Vegas wasn t quite for me  but it was an experience The Imperial Palace itself certainly doesn t compare to places like MGM  Ceasars Palace  Bellagio etc     that much is a given  but for a neat hotel  in an excellent location  you really can t go wrong  Plus the dealertainers are awesome If I go back to Vegas  I probably won t go back to the Imperial Palace to stay again  I would probably go somewhere bigger  but it certainly was good enough for us btw  Not quite sure why the pool closes      that annoyed us 
N =>  Everything was Great Up graded to suite during checkin room was nice service was great the deals were friendly  The burger palace was reasonable but went up on price three dollars one morning so we went to harrahs breakfast buffet that was the best i have been to in a long time and the nice lady at cash register gave us a coupon for   dollars off for each that made it better The I P buffet was not so good  Room was keep clean each day and personal were very nice  Not in the room that much anyways Do go to Ellis Island for the steak breakfast and also supper but you have to ask for specials not on the menu steak supper       Steak Breakfast       its a hidden Gem 
N =>  No Better Deal In Vegas     We were pretty skeptical from some of the reviews so we were hesitant to stay at the IP  But from the moment we arrived to check out we were nothing but impressed  For the money you won t find a nicer place with outstanding service  We were catered to and treated like the entire time  You can find nicer hotels on the strip but you will pay much more  But you will never be treated better than by the staff at the Imperial Palace    give them a shot     you will be pleasantly surprised 
N =>   Excellent value for money couldn t ask for a better location on the strip This was the first time my partner and I had been to the Imperial Palace  My sister recommended it to me  I was warned not to expect anything like the Paris  where we had stayed on our previous trip  For the money we paid  I wasn t expecting it to be quite so good  Ok so the rooms need some TLC  and the first room we were given was unmade and full of dirty dishes  But after going back to reception they gave us a different room and were very apologetic  Lets be honest  when your in Vegas all you want is a comfy bed to sleep after a long day gambling and shopping  This was definately what we got  The staff at the Imperial were brilliant  The look a like stars that deal the card games were very entertaining  The atmosphere and buzz around the casino was amazing  We did try the Emperor s Buffett  which I wouldn t recommend but the burger place was good  There are so many different places to eat in Vegas  to suit every budget you just have to shop around and try it  We enjoyed our stay so much that my partner and his friends are going back in ch      for a   th birthday celebration  
N =>   Ok for the Strip  My stay at the Imperial Palace was from         to          I was in town for a Travel Trade Convention  I wanted to check out this hotel since the rates were excellent for being right on the Strip but the reviews were  so so   It s certainly not   Star but it was clean  amp  served it s purpose  I was a little disappointed since I knew this was part of the Harrah s properties now  However  with this addition  the Harrah s now has an Hotel for every  walk of life   The cafe  served great breakfast  I also picked this Hotel since it was part of the Monorail system  amp  needed to get to the Convention Center daily  I didn t want to be stuck at the hotel right next to the Convention  although Hilton Las Vegas is perfect   but it gave me a chance to be close to the strip  I also stayed at the Bally s  another Harrah s property   check out my review  amp  photos also  
N =>   Great Stay I read all the reviews of this hotel and was a little worried  Starting with check in  We arrived about      pm and there was a long line at chedk in  But I am a frequent player at Harrahs so I went to the Platnum Diamomd line and ther was no one in line so our check in was quick  We got to our rooms and they were very clean and had everyting we needed  Yes they are in need of some TLC but they were still very nice  We went next door to Harrahs to catch the shuttle to the Rio and quess what  no one in line to check in there  so I guess price does matter since rooms at Harrahs are at least twice as much per night as the IP  We stayed for three nights and had no problem with maid service at all  Now the elevators  Yes sometimes you had to wait a few minutes  but it is a very large hotel and had a lot of guests  They have several banksof elevators  so you just find the ones closest to your room and use those  The ice machine closest to our room was out of order  but the one further down the hall worked just fine We did not eat at his hotel because having been to Veagas many times before I had already made plans to take our Grandson to other places that we enjoy   The purpose of this trip was our Grandson s   st birthday Our stay at the IP was very good  We used valet parking and it was prompt and courteous  It is mid strip and you can walk to everything  If you want a good room on the strip the IP is the place to stay  
N =>   First room the put me in When we arrived they put me in room      which was a   elevator trim    up and then a long walk to   down  The room was old  musty and overlooking a fire escap  I went back to the desk and told them I wanted to change  but was told that that was all they had in a non smoking room  Since it was   PM  I had no choice  I was told to come back between   and   pm the next day and see what was available  I went back to the desk early the next morning and when I asked the lady about a change  as I would not be there between   and   pm that day  she asked me wha floor I wanted and gave me a choice of rooms to move to as she had them ready at this time  They put me in a very comfortable room  clean and near the elevator  Assuming this  I am sure that there were rooms the night before   I would recomend that if the put you in a room in the     numbers and if they will not move you speak to the manager  as the originaly room and location should not be acceptws  
N =>   would book this hotel again just returned today on arrival we were told that our room was a bit out of the way as we had to get   elevators but to come back the next afternoon to get a better room which we did although there was nothing wrong with the  st room it was on the  th floor overlooking the strip it was a bit noisy but this didnt bother us as we spend little time in our room the room spacious enough  the bathroom was a bit small but clean no complaints The dealertainers were good would have like a comfy chair in   of the bars to listen to them  my only complaint would be the buffet only used it once service was poor food average have been to better buffets would visit this hotel again perfectly situated in the strip 
N =>   Just unlucky We were told that Deluxe rooms have a better view and recently renovated compared to the standard rooms  so we went ahead and booked it  However was given one which was not renovated and no views and it was dark  We asked to see another deluxe and room and found that it was much bigger than our room  The stadard room was no different to our room apart from the beds headboard  different shape   be because we booked on a cheap deal  The room had a funny smell and looking at it  it has not been occupied for a long time as we could see the dust off from the information booklet  If you re going to book this place  make sure you request for rooms on a higher floor as they look bigger and cleaner with lots of light  Reception staff were not knowledgable when asked for simple tourist information  not the best customer service  They muddled up our room arrangements  It took my friend forever to try and arrange a shuttle to the airport  she was passed around like a ball from one person to another  We were not keen on the restaurants so didnt  try it  Overall  the location was good for the price  All depends on what you re after  I certainly would spend a bit more on a better hotel even though it s only a bed for the night  But it pays to sleep in a comfy room  
N =>   this was my first time at the imperial palace and i loved it  try to visit all the free activities they have to offer  they will fill your day up completely  
N =>   Great spot cannot beat the location We just got back yesterday  We stayed in deluxe room        The balcony was facing the strip  with the rockhouse below it was very loud  this I knew  and requested  It s open till  am  great for loud and wild travelers  Don t bother bringing any Bon Jovi  they played it   or   times a day   quot So funny quot   Great view could not ask for better  especially for only     a night  It is old but  holding up well  We stayed tues fri check in was fast  The room was a little used  I heard from other travelers to bring clorox wipes  that did the trick  IP does get busy during the weekends  so naturally the elevators were slower  The longiest we waited was    min  There is   sets of elevators  just ask the staff aroud they tell you  We used valet the whole time  real easy just give them a buck each time  it s worth not having to walk  considering your walking everywhere else  Hope this review helps  I took a chance and i m so glad I did  I was worried about the reviews  I had booked our trip   months ago  and was reading the reviews for   months  Recommend to all  Go Steelers  
N =>   Best decision of my entire vacation We are Aussies and it was our first time in Vegas  Stayed for   days on the  quot All in quot  package  This meant that in addition to our room  we had unlimited drinks at the casino pool bars and unlimited visits to the buffet and Tea Room cafe  This turned out to be the best decision on the entire trip  as we saved so much on food and drinks  Was about US     per night  total for   people   Here s a few quick opinions Location  Fantastic  Enough said Room  We had a  quot Deluxe Luv Tub Room quot  which was huge and always well cleaned  Old yes  but more than adequate considering how much time you actually spent in it  Ice machine worked fine the entire time Elevators  Seems to be a common grudge on here  Personally  we never had to wait more than   minutes for an elevator in the lobby  going UP  To be fair  we always took the stairs DOWN from our room  so we only had to wait on our room floor once when we checked out with our luggage  only   mins  Buffet  Forget it  Worst part of the hotel by far  Very Glad not to be paying     each time we went  Avoid if possible Food  Tea House   We only went to the  quot Tea House Cafe quot  for our meals  at least once a day  and food was standard American fare  generous portions and prepared quickly  Can t complain  Can t comment on value because it was incuded in our package deal Staff  All satff we dealt with were courteous and attentive Casino  Old  and a bit stale smelling  But if you don t like it  just go somewhere else  It s Vegas DUH  Dealertainers are great fun and a must see if you are visiting Pool  Fine  Good Bar service and not over crowded  even on the days when it was     degrees Again  to be fair  we did stay mid week  Sun Fri  so we weren t there on the weekend Imperial Palace is what it is  Would I stay there again  No worries  
N =>  Great Location but DISGUSTING rooms  price can be good at the right time of year  This was our third trip to Vegas  second time staying at the IP  Our first trip was great  just my husband and I  The room was fine and had no HUGE complaints  so when we decided to go again with more people  we chose the IP because we had no HUGE problems previously  and for the value and location  you can t complain  Right     WRONG    We went with five people and shared a room and had two queens and brought an air mattress   SSSHHH Don t tell    Anyhow   we arrived around midnight and waited in a line so incredibly long   it took an hour and a half to check in  Throughout the E NTIRE process  the lady kept saying  if you don t like you room  just let us know  Whey would you say that over and over and over   We soon found out  Even with the EXTENSIVE map she gave us to find our room  and about four elevator rides later  and only getting lost twice  we FINALLY found our room  WHAT A DUMP   It smelled musty  but we were looking forward to finally gambling  As I changed into some cuter clothes  I thought the floor was kinda damp  but paid it no heed   We just wanted to go play   Well  around      we were ready for bed  The room was still smelling musty  so we went to open a window   NO WAY TO DO IT   It was a completely sealed room  no ventilation whatsoever   OK  And it was a smoking room   How does a person smoke with no ventilation   Anyway  we all changed into our PJ s  and I laid down in bed  THERE WAS A HUGE WET SPOT ON MY BED            By this time it was   in the morning and my husband wanted to go to sleep so he put a thick layer of towels down and switched sides with me  When we got up around     we went downstairs to somplain and switch rooms  and the  quot manager quot   in a VERY snotty tone  told us we should have complained earlier  And after MUCH complaining they finally switched the rooms for us  No sorry  no comps  nothing  We had to complain and complain and complain to finally get a new room  What kind of customer service is that    In the end we still had a decent time  but the whole trip I couldn t get laying down in a wet bed out of my mind    it STILL gives me the eebie jeebies  UGH    We will be returning in ember  but no way in HELL are we ever staying at the IP again     P S  The tea room  I think it was  is INCREDIBLY over priced        for a BLT  are you kidding me   And the pool is TINY    
N =>  Nice clean room Stayed at the IP for   nights with   friends  We were on the   th floor  Check in was fast  clerk very friendly  Everyone we encountered was friendly  Our room was clean  We tipped the maid every day  I left her one note asking for extra shampoo  Every day after that we had extra toiletries  Room was cleaned late in the afternoon every day but we were usually out at that time  We were in our room one day and just asked her to wait a minute and left so she could clean  My room was comped so we had a nice free stay but would have been worth it to pay  No  this is not a   star hotel but everyone should realize that  It was clean and quiet which is what we wanted  We had breakfastone morning at the Teahouse and the food was very good as was the service  
N =>  Very dissapointed     will never return I read the reviews on here and was a little concerned but it appered that the good reviews outweighed the bad so I gave it a chance  We were dissapointed from the second we pulled into the parking garage  We have traveled to Vegas many times and usually stay at the Monte Carlo  Because of the holiday weekend we deicded to try the Imperial Palace since it was cheaper and we were trying to travel on a budget  There was free parking which was good but the parking gararge was hard to navigate  The walk to the building to check in was confusing and long  You have to walk through the entire casino full of people to get to the front desk  The newer hotels have the front desk and guest elevators in a more private location so you aren t navigating a crowded casino floor with your luggage  Check in was ok and we went up to the room  The hallway smelled like urine and the room is old and dingy  There were hairs in the bathtub and the room needs to be updated  The TV didn t work well and the air conditioner didn t turn off so we froze all night  The bed was stiff as a board and we got a terrible night sleep  The walls weren t as thin as I would have expected and it was quiet which was the only plus I can think of  The elevators were slow and always full  We had to wait for close to    minutes to get down with our luggage when we were ready to check out  The bathtub did not drain when you took a shower so you were standing in water the entire time which was gross since I knew the tub wasn t clean  Wallpaper was peeling and the rooms need a serious update  I will not stay here again nor will I reccomend to friends  We were traveling with another couple and they have taken away my hotel selection privlages as a result of this trip as they were also unimpressed   
N =>  Worst hotel of the holiday   Bathroom dirty with leaking taps  Room substandard with dirty wallpaper hanging off  Elevators didn t work  one working elevator for       rooms   took    minutes to get from floor    to ground in the morning  No option to use the stairs if coming up  Pool closed on sunny day because of non existent threat of rain      charge for internetbe worth       night tops but not       they charge on a weekend  
N =>  Great Value  Every complaint I read before this trip complained about elevators being slow  We didn t experiece this problem at all  If you take the first set of elevators closest to the strip you will be fine  We never had to wait  Other people that took the set of elevators closest to parking had problems where they would wait and turn away     elevators because they were full  The casino was friendly with its payouts  The dealertainers   some were spot on and others    missed it completely    We didn t eat there  but we used the coupons our room came with to eat at Paris and Bally  both good buffets  Didn t go to the pool  but did check out the car collection  
N =>   PLACE IS A DUMP Service was good when i first got there  room wasnt very clean  especialy the bathroom yuck they seriously need to do a better job cleaning the bathrooms and the tub didnt even drain it just filled up they need some plumbing done  beds arent very comfortable its like sleeping on springs  the pool was kinda gross as well  towels had stains  pool smelt strong of chlorine and had hairs and random stuff floating in it  the pool chairs did not smell pleasant at all  the elevators took foreverrrr it got really irritating  cheap rooms but not worth it  better off spending the extra money for a nicer hotel  i would not stay here again this hotel needs to be rennovated or just completely demolished  i would be embaressed if i owned this hotel 
N =>   Clean Comfortable stay My husband and I were looking for a cheap  but clean and comfy stay on the strip  After looking through many options  I found The Imperial Palace  I am always one to look at reviews and do my research before I book anything  I read some good reviews on this place  and read even more horrible ones  I saw great pictures from other reviews  and it didn t seem too bad to me  I was pretty skeptical of course  and was afraid of walking into a horrible room  Well we arrived to Vegas on a Wed  late evening  check in was a flash and we right away got our keys We went up to our Deluxe room on the   th floor  and i could right away tell the difference of the clean non smokey smell up there  Our room was amazing  we had a king bed which was very comfy  and very very clean  and the room smelled very very clean as well  I felt like I wasn t even in a hotel with a casino in it  I don t know why people give so many bad reviews  I guess if you plan to stay in the Capri rooms which are cheaper  and in the motel part of the property  then yes  you might have some complains  But we decided to spend a lil more and go for the deluxe room  For   nights  the whole stay cost us only       We will definitely be going back to The Imperial Palace whenever we head back to Vegas  Its the cheapest  cleanest most comfortable place on the strip  
N =>   Great Value  Would stay here again  We live next to Vegas in Henderson  We decided to stay on the strip for my birthday instead of risk driving home after an evening of drinking and playing tourist  After reading other reviews  we were prepared for the worst  but figured we could stand anything for just one night We arrived around  pm on a Monday and only had to wait   minutes to check in  We were very pleasantly surprised as to the cleanliness and size of our room  We had a king bed and there was still plenty of space for my wife to drive her mobility scooter around  It was a nonsmoking room and there was absolutely no smell of cigarette smoke  Our   th floor room overlooked the pool which seemed very popular There were a few minor negatives though  The elevators were slow and very small  wife s mobility scooter just barely fit   Finding the self parking garage was a challenge  There was no in room coffee maker   There was an iron  ironing board and hair drier though  Overall  we felt that is was worth much more than the     local s special rate we paid  The location on the strip across from Caesars Palace and just a short walk to Bellagio  Mirage and Treasure Island can t be beat  We will stay at the Imperial Palace on our next mini stacation  
N =>   Loved it and can t wait to go back    I went last tember with my boyfriend  best friend and her boyfriend  When we got to the IP it was about              And there was a line up to check in but it went smooth and fast  Our rooms were right next to each out which was great  He had to wait a bit for the elevator  but that was fine because it gave us a chance to meet other people a staff Once we got up to our room the view wasn t the best and there were a few unknown hairs in the bathroom  but that wasn t a problem because we went in changed and headed to the strip  my boyfriend wasn t feeling well so unfortunately it was an early night The next morning I went to the check in counter and advised then that we didn t like our view and the bathroom was a little messy  So apologized and apologized and asked how fast can we be packed up to move because she has two rooms next to each other that we could take right now  When we switched rooms it was awesome  It was a high floor and you could see the strip but couldn t hear the noise  Food was awesome and staff bar tenders security valet and store clerks were awesome As a travel agent I recommend this hotel to a lot of other agents and clients  You can t go wrong with the IP  the location is AMAZING  The day we were checking out our plane didn t leave till later that day  So there was a room where we could safely keep our stuff so we could kill time with out dragging it around We are going back this t and are staying there again  The way I see it  you re not going to SIN CITY for the hotel  you re going for SIN CITY  Less money paid for the hotel more money to do things I give this hotel    out of       
N =>   Terrible place to stay I went with three friends for four days of Las Vegas fun  We had a good time in Vegas but the IP is a dump  The staff was less than helpful and on our last night all four of us ate at the Pizza Palace Restaurant at the Imperial Palace  Three of us shared a pizza and ended up with severe food poisioning  The paramedics were called and we all suffered because of the bad food at the Pizza Palace Restaurant  We missed our flight because of the sickness and the Imperial Palace had the nerve to charge us for the room for the extra day  In addition  never did anyone from management contact us in our room to see if we were okay or offer any kind of assistance  I have tried to contact Risk Management at the IP to try to get the room charge for the extra day to be removed to no avail  I have left messages and then called and the phone just rings  It has been a week and my friends and I are still not well  DON T STAY HERE  The room was overall  quot well worn quot  and that was an upgraded room  The TV was about a    quot  TV Well I will keep on trying to contact the IP management re the room charge  
N =>   Great location and not as bad as others say I was worried about staying here after reading some reviews but we had a great stay overall  It is in the best location  right across the street from Caesers and close to other newer hotels  We had a quick check in at  pm on a Sunday and they gave us a room that was ready  No big waits with the elevator but they were not all working  Our room was on the   th floor and was clean and comfortable  We had trouble with our tv the first night and they sent someone up within    minutes to fix it  Front desk staff were friendly and helpful as was the concierge  Pool area was not nearly big enough and not much shade so we didn t even use it  Had the breakfast buffet once  lots of choices  service was okay  HIghly recommend renting a car for a day and going to Red Rock Canyon and then to Hoover Dam  it was nice to get off the strip  
N =>   Not Worth Your         It was my second time going to vegas and my first time experiencing it the way it s meant to be seen I was over     well  I went with my boyfriend  brother and my best friend and we booked at the Imperial Palace we saw the virtual tour on the website and we thought it looked nice     well our trip finally came and we were so stoked however  from the minute we walked in we knew something wasn t right   check in wasn t long however the person who helped us could have been new on the job because he didn t know anything We were offered a chance to get a upgraded room however we declined it would have been an extra        and we wanted to save as much money as we can    well we were given our key and then told where our room was well come to find out it was wayyy out on the other side of the casino it overlooked the parking structure   we walked in and were immediately shocked by what we saw the tv was a small     television and the TV had a Nintendo    controller hooked up to it  that was weird   The carpet was worn and it left black stains on my socks so I learned very early on to keep my shoes on until I went to sleep  The bed was comfortable the room service was great but our first night there we went back to our room and we heard a bunch of people laughing and yelling and it turns out one of them punched out a window and left a trail of blood out on the floor  whoever that was I hope they went to the hospital  It really shocked me and my boyfriend that s not something we really expected  Well the next morning I went into the restroom and the floor was totally wet   the toilet was leaking  disgusting  we called the front desk they said they would fix it but no one ever came to our room  Besides our hotel room being a complete diaster it was a fun trip but I do recommend staying somewhere else it was not worth your money  trust me 
N =>   Not as bad as made out to be This was our  st stay in Vegas and as we were celebrating our silver wedding anniversary we wanted to spend more of our money on shows and tours so the Imperial palace was the right chose  Having read most reviews expected a long wait to be checked in   this did not happen we flew from the UK and there was only one other couple in front of us  At check in she told us our room number and asked us to make sure we were happy with it as we were staying    nights  it was fine not posh but clean and tidy  The maids were good and kept the room clean daily and i asked for extra pillows and got them  Did not have a strip view as were informed could be noisey we were on the  th floor overlooking the monerail and mountains again ok  We did eat there a couple of times the Tea room average no problems  burger palace yes the burgers a little bit dry but were given plenty of sauces The buffet only had brunch there fine plenty of choice  Our    day stay there was great a very comfitable hotel yes not ceasers not belligio if you want their services then expect to pay for them if all you want is a clean room to lay your head and get out to explore its a great location to be in  
N =>   Loved it     I honestly don t get the bad reviews of IP  yeah it s a dive   but a fun dive We ve stayed in bellagio wynn  thehotel and a bunch of other much fancier places but this time we blew the budget on ufc tickets so decided to go cheap with the accom   and we are so glad we did The rooms were true motel wuality   but you get a balcony which was pretty cool The pool music was super loud and everyone seemed to be having a great time   sure it s only a plain smallish pool but it was alot of fun I think fun is what sums up IP  It was typical kitschy trashy vegas fun and we loved it  Where else do you get to get dealt blackjack from dolly parton and hug michael jackson I wasn t brave enough to eat there  one has to exercise caution  but the central strip location for such a good price really cannot be beat   as long as it s around i m going to stay there for sure would rather spend the extra money across the road at the forum shops On the slight downside the place reeeeeeked of years of serious smoking dedication   hallways non smoking rooms you name it If you can t handle that look elsewhere  Like everyone else says elevators were annoying but there s a few sneaky ones round the back that went a little faster   but it was pretty frustratingwaiting up to    mins for lifts The bars in the casino are pretty bad too   head elsewhere to eat and drink I actually found everyone from check in guy who stopped for    mins to talk to us about australia   to cleaners sooo polite   much more so than over at some of the fancier hotels   everyone was really lovely and had a big smile for us even fellow guests were great   especially the super drunk ones in the hallways   If you are looking for fun vegas at a cheap price look no further than IP  
N =>   Quiet Room with No View We just returned from a wedding trip to LV  not ours   We stayed at the Imperial  Reviews were accurate and helpful  Location was wonderful  Everything is a twenty minute walk  or    minute cab ride   Concierge found us good tickets to a show  Elevators were slow but our non smoking room  which was actually smokefree  was on the third floor so we just walked down when we were leaving and when we were coming back the slowness was not a big deal  Bathroom was clean although the drain was slow  I did check the linens for hair but they were clean  Plenty of towels and our room faced the parking garage so it was perfect for sleeping at night  Main concern  the lobby was smoky  Many of the newer hotels have MUCH better ventilation systems but it definitely met our neeeds  
N =>   Never again     I was getting ready to go to bed around      AM when I heard a  quot girgling sound quot  from the bathroom  I go to the bathroom and that s when I saw the clogged stuff coming from the drain and the bathtub started to fill up with water and all kinds of grime  dirt and all that was gross and colored brown and black    It would not stop  and no the tap water was not on   and next thing the bathtub was fillng almost to half of the tub   I called the front desk and they sent maintenance up  He could not fix the problem obviously it was that big of a problem so he needed to get some more tools  This is now      Am  We talked to the maintenance guy  he was wonderful and very professional and worked so hard  and decided it was best to be moved   Called the front desk and asked to be moved  explained the situation to them  Guess what their response was     quot I have no room for you   quot  So they told us to ask the maintenance guy how long this was going to take etc   We talked to the maintenance guy and his immediate response was   quot Oh yes they will have a room for you     quot  Thanks so much for this Mr  Maintenance  we would not have been able to convince the arrogant bunch working at the front desk if it were not for your help Front desk people said the best they could do was a     credit on our food  No thank you we said I needed to use the shower and we could not even use the bathroom  For all is concerned staying in that room with all the filth coming up from the drain was too disgusting of an experience  apparently according to maintenance guy the main pipe connected to other rooms were clogged   So he talked to the front desk and said  quot YOu have to move these people  this job could take    minutes or    hours or three days  quot  The fact that the maintenance guy had to advocate on our behalf speaks to the kind of bad service and dismissive attitude provided by the front desk people  So sure enough they had a room for us  But we waited for three hours until we finally got out of our room  since nobody came up till then to give us the key to another room  We had gone down to get the key ourselves but they instructed us to wait in our room  By the time we got into our new room it was  AM  Oh  and we did get a     food credit  I do question the professionalism of the front desk people and management  The fact that the room was booked through the internet and therefore was on a cheaper rate  does that render then some kind of unequal service that we do not deserved to have our needs and our concerns met particularly on this awful mishap   I have to applaud however the maintenance guy who worked dilligently to have the problem resolved  But two thumbs down for the management I stayed at another hotel after that  On the way home to the airport I was having a conversation with the shuttle driver and he told me that he has heard terrible things about this hotel  So there you go  
N =>   Buyer Beware    I booked a package deal through LasVegas com  and it is true that you get what you pay for  Originally  I booked a  Deluxe Room  which was anything but deluxe  The room reminded me a scene from a horror movie  The bed was hard as a rock  the pillow cases had mascara on them  the room was dirty  and it had a wonderful view of the casino roof  The air conditioner sounded like a low   flying bomber making a final approach  Fortunately we were able to upgrade to a  Suite Room  which was closer to what I has envisioned a deluxe room would look like  The room still was not as clean as we would have liked   but we were comfortable and the housekeeping staff were wonderful  as were all the staff we had dealings with  Dining was also a little different  The buffet had good   average food  but the atmosphere reminded me of a college cafeteria  We ate at the Paris buffet one night and found it much more appealing  DO NOT EAT AT THE OVERNIGHT BURGER BAR  If you do   practice your Heimlich maneuver before doing so  We had cheeseburgers were so dry that we could not finish them  There was no dressing of any type on them  and ketchup was the only condiment available at the self   service area  After tossing them I went to the counter for a soda refill and I noticed the staff had mustard and relish available behind the counter  I asked why they didn t have it out front for us to use  The answer was  we have it for you behind the counter  cheap  cheap  cheap  The elevators were SLOW AND OUT OF ORDER  We walked down to the lobby to save time  but waited and waited to ride them up to our seventh floor room  We plan to stay somewhere else next time we are in  Lost Wages  Nevada   
N =>   I ve stayed in better for free Checking in at the service desk was slow  Employees changed shifts while lines were long  and once they finished their last check in they simple just walked away never stating  quot someone will be right with you  quot   They just let us stand there never acknowledging we were standing there  After getting our key and waiting at least    minutes for a elevator to go to our room  we found the carpet was very dirty and filthy  It was the same in the hallways too  The bed spread and curtains were very dull  and faded  and the room was dark  Although the room was over the pool  we requested a room change  The second room was also dirty  The bathroom was not clean  the toilet was dirty  Someone s feces was left on the handle  and along the bottom of the toilet  Towels from previous guest left hanging on the shower  and the tub was dirty  Not to mention    inch T V s Come on now  what hotel still has    inch T Vs  There were no coffeemakers or microwaves in the rooms  and no complimentary coffee in the casino  A non working ice machine and it s     degrees  We eventually requested another room change  We actually had   different rooms  The lady at the front desk stated the rooms were all the same  and haven t been upgraged in about   years  I have stayed in better hotels for free  Don t fall for the internet photos because the rooms look nothing like them now  I would not recommend this hotel to my worse enemy  
N =>   Do not stay here    ever  I could go on and on  but I am still so PO d that reliving it might send me into an apoplectic state  so  I ll keep it short Other than the fact my sheets were clean  I think   everything else about the hotel was pathetic  Service was lousy  floors were filthy  employees  with two exceptions  seemed to not want to be there  most things didn t work properly  remote control  TV  ice machines  sliding doors on balcony  elevators  drains in bathroom  and so much more   food was awful  beer at bar was warm  and other than that everything else was incredibly unpleasant  The reason for writing this review is that some people claim to have had an OK room  I can t believe that after speaking with people who were staying there  and seeing the sour faces on these people  one person told me that his room opened up into the parking garage  yes  look up room     and you ll find he wasn t kidding   So  I don t want anyone falling for internet photos  or reviews from  friends of the hotel  persuading people to try it   it can cause such a let down to one s entire vacation  I ran into two young guys from England who were miserable because they had a non cancel clause  not much money to switch hotels  and they found themselves in a stink hole  A woman told me she had to lay down towels all along the path she took after her shower because she didn t want her feet to touch the carpeting  in my room  the carpet by the sliding doors actually stuck to my shoes I just hope this serves as a warning to everyone even thinking about saving a few dollars  DON T DO THIS  And by the way  I am not a prima donna used to staying in   star hotels  though I have   when I used to travel a great deal for business  I would stay in Courtyards and Hampton Inns and places like those  The worst Courtyard I ever stayed in would be a ten fold improvement over this dump Other than that  I was able to enjoy Las Vegas    by staying away from the Imperial Palace until I needed to sleep  
N =>   excellent situation and value for money recently stayed for   nights  arrived late evening after long journey and didn t have to wait too long to check in  but did find the check in staff somewhat slow and not overly helpful  Having prebooked non smoking room seveal months in advance arrived only to be told there were non available  and yet other member of staff offering non smoking to someone else   took room for the night but requested that be moved the next day and room was made available for us  Rooms cleaned daily  beds comfortable  Hotel is in excellent position on strip as central for all hotels and virtually centre so can get to either end with ease  Use the bus   Deuce    for   hr unlimited use  this takes you up and down the strip  really useful to get to the Freemont Street Experience   not to be missed  
N =>   You get what you pay for   what a dump Great location  That is the only good thing I can say about this hotel  Our  quot deluxe quot  rooms  which were  quot recently renovated quot  were actually renovated about   years ago with what looked to be like junk from my grandmother s garage sale in       The furniture was nicked everywhere  and the chairs in the room had stains on them   disgusting stains  There was a tiny TV on top of the bureau which I didn t hang around long enough to see if it even worked  The carpets were vacuumed but filthy  the balcony had bird droppings all over it  and the pool area was sparse   absolutely no atmosphere  The halls had a weird chemical smell which none of us could identify  I was supposed to stay here for   nights but said no way  and moved to the Flamingo next door  Yes  the Flamingo was more expensive but worth every single penny  especially since we upgraded to the  quot newly renovated quot  rooms which actually WERE renovated beatifully  I m no high roller but it was my vacation  I was here for   days  and no way would I spend it in this       
N =>   Could Not Ask For More I love the I P  Just returned from a   night trip and was not disappointed at all  We arrived very late and our room was not available  were upgraded to a pool side room at no additional cost   It was a smoking room  but you could not tell or smell old smoke in there  The A C worked very well  The room was kept clean  the shower was incredible  I will say parts of the hotel are out dated  however it s nothing that even warrants complaining about  Check in was a snap  express check out kept us out of the long lines  The Dealertainers were awesome  We even saw Michael Jackson giving directions to some lost guests  Can t say enough good things about I P  Perfect location  friendly and helpful staff   We will be back  
N =>   Great location but tired rooms   in need of a refurb I am a travel agent and loved the location of this hotel  but the rooms were very old and in need of a refurb  Bed linen was quite old and balcony doors did not shut in our  st room  We asked to swap and they gave us another room    again the balcony doors did not close properly  quite noisy at night   We gave up and just settled for the room as we were not planning spending much time there anyway I tend not to recommend this hotel to my customers now  but it is great if you are on a very tight budget  Spend an extra    pp and get a nicer hotel  it will make your holiday  
N =>  An unforgettable experience  After parking our car in the parking garage  it took us about    minutes to find the check in desk  as there were poor signs   When we got to check in  we found it fairly quick and proceeded to the lifts  The lifts were very slow and some out of order  With no signs indicating this   One night we decided that we would use the stairs up to our room as we were only on the  th floor and would be quicker  only to find the door locked when we reached our foor  this was the case for all floors   When we went back down the stairs we found the same people STILL waiting for the lifts When we decided to get some ice  we found that the ice machines were broken and that the only ice machine that was working was on floor    This meant everyone cramming in the lift with ice buckets to the  th floor The shower was very powerfull  however  the water took about    minutes to run down the plug so you couldnt work out if you were showering or bathing The room was good for the price  after all  you only really wash and sleep in it  The casino also smelt of stale smoke  Not sure i would want to stay here again  Will try out some of the other hotels  
N =>  Good Casino Horrible Hotel First of all they have what they like to call the  quot capri quot  building and no one informs you until you arrive there that that means a motel in the back of the hotel  There is horrible cell phone service back there  there was hair in the shower of my first room  the TV did not work there are no bars to hang washcloths and towels  yet they ask you to help them preserve water buy reusing them  After I paid     to upgrade to be in the actual Imperial Palace Hotel  the room was identical to that of the motel so what did I upgrade  A quicker trip to the casino  The best thing about them is their location  and their overall layout which is easier to maneuver than some of the other casinos  
N =>  I ll stay at IP next time I m in Vegas My sister and I stayed   nights the end of y  We had to wait in line about    minutes to check in  People seem to complain about the elevators  but we never had to wait more than   minutes for one  and that was only   time  We were on the  th floor poolside  I liked going out on the balcony to watch what was going on at the pool  Everyone seemed to be having a fun time  The casino was smoky but hey it is a casino  It was stuffy inside the casino as well  but I found it to be that way in most of them  Caesers Palace was the worst  I thought I would die before I got out of there  I think the A C in the casino s were having problems dealing with the unusual humidity being experienced by Vegas while we were there  We ate breakfast in the Teahouse   mornings and the food was decent and a fair price  The room was fairly clean and I thought the bed was nice and comfortable  I like that IP is right in the middle of the strip  I would definitely stay there again  It was exactly what we were looking for  
N =>   Great Location From a person who has stayed in many hostels  Imperial Palace is a dream  I opted to upgrade and recieved a king size bed  The air conditioning worked very well considering it was     outside  The room was clean  well maintained  The best part was the location  right in the middle of the strip  You didn t have to walk too far to get cheap booze meals gambling as the hotel was ok for that but other places were better  I would recommend for anyone to stay here as long as they are not expecting the hilton  Checking in and out took no more than  mins  
N =>   Worst Hotel I ve Ever Stayed In I could not wait to leave this hotel  The elevators are unsafe  slow  kept stalling    a real hazard  There isn t even a coffee pot in the room    a very cheap place  indeed   and not clean  No matter what the rate   it is too high  
N =>   Will NEVER stay here again  I read a lot of the reviews for the this place and decided to book because of the price and location   unfortunately  the worst thing about this hotel wasn t mentioned in any of the posts I read  It began to rain Monday evening while we were driving back from the south end of the strip and by the time we pulled into the parking garage entrance  a very rude security guard first told us the garage was closed because of flooding and we couldn t go in  When my hubby told him this is our hotel  the guard tells us we could pay for valet parking and when this didn t fly with my husband  the guard gave us a long babel of directions to get to the back entrance so we could park  We get there  it s blocked  I call the hotel  he gives me  quot employee parking quot  directions which lead to the Harrah s parking garage  we get out  realize we are still on the other side of the gushing river flowing through the Imperial garage so would have to walk around the entire block to get to the entrance  my   year old is crying because he scared  my hubby calls the hotel again and the same guy tells us there is a security guard flagging people through to the garage  but we are standing here STARING at said guard telling people they can t go in  After we hang up  the hotel guy comes out  now realizing no one is being allowed in  though not admitting it during the call   talks to the guard and they go stand in the RIGHT place to flag people into the garage  I read this happens every time it rains and the hotel refuses to do anything about it  even though   other hotels that had similar problems have spent the   to fix it  Needless to say  the lady at check out didn t bother asking me how my stay was  This is a video of what it looked like   it s not even my video but change daytime to nighttime and it s exactly the same  We were even stranded on the side of the river where the video was taken      Other CONS  Smelled like sewage every time I turned the faucet on  Waited a minimum of   minutes  as much as    minutes  for the elevators Long walk from parking to check inPROS  Good location 
N =>   Smoky Room was smoke free but it was too smoky walking through the casino and you can t get anywhere if you don t  Consierage was good  One day we had no maid service  
N =>   Great Location I took my daughter for her   st birthday and was worried about the hotel I had chose  We loved the location of the hotel the best  The check in took a bit but they had a lot of people working and were doing there best so we were patient and it paid off  The room was clean and our balcony was overlooking the pool which was very nice  The only thing bad I ccould stay would be the elevators  Very slow  But other than that everyone was very nice and helpful  We did not encounter any rude workers just a couple of travelers  I would probably stay somewhere else next time just to have another experience but would recommend this hotel to anyone  I would recommend to eat else where  The food was not that good and very expensive  But  there are very close places to eat  
N =>   good hotel Great location and price we would definitely stay again This was our third visit to Las Vegas and we have stayed at Harrahs for the past two years so this year we tried the Imperial Palace as it was half the price of Harrahs and for a change  There was no waiting time to check in and the Room was as good as Harrahs everything was nice and clean and the room was cleaned and fresh towels placed every day  The only slight problem was the elevators there were plenty to choose from but as they are quite small you had to wait a while for one to fit into to arrive  All the staff were friendly and the breakfast buffet was especially good in one of the restuarants  We would definitely stay here again and we stayed for   nights without any complaints  
N => 	 BUCKS A NIGHT     MILES IN THE HOTEL For     in a fantastic location  no one should gripe  But  we did have to walk an amazing distance from the  free  self parking garage  through the casino to the front desk  then back through the casino to the elevators  then down a LONG hallway to our room  The room was clean and well done  a typical hotel room  nothing fancy  but decent  The buffet was closed on the Monday we were there  so we went next door to Harrah s for a        buffet  get the coupon from the IP  which was fine  We were able to walk to the Treasure Island show and enjoy the sights on the strip because of our location  The Internet is    per hour  The pool closed at   p m   what was that about      the concierge didn t even know   Our advice  get a room near the front of the hotel near the elevators  You will save some steps  
N =>   Great Price Great Location We stayed at the IP     and found this hotel to be excellent value  OK it may not have the pomp and ceremony of some of the other Hotels on the strip  but I would prefer the extra     in the wallet for retail therapy shows  We returned New Years Eve    and again no complaints  No lines at check in  rooms clean  maid service could not fault and found everybody to be pretty friendly  Exactly as it was in   Yes the lifts can be slow at times  but why stress  There are more important things happening on this planet to stress about rather than a slow lift   We have stayed previously at the NY NY and the Flamingo  and yes the rooms did have a higher spec but that is reflected in what you pay  I can t fault either of these two hotels  but for LOCATION and COST the IP for us cannot be beat  We return in tember  register your rewards card on the net  we have paid      for   nights at the IP via our rewards card  It costs us more to go to Spain    Believe me it can t be that bad  if it was we wouldn t put ourselves through an   hr flight and a   hrs time difference to go to a room that was not clean and comfortable  
N =>   Not the same Imperial Palace i started with years ago This was like my  th time in    years or wutever  I ll start good  like the room was really nice  a Delux    queens and a balcony  great price thru Expedia  The auto collection up on the  th floor was  as always  kewl  Location is great Now the not good  Parking was a horror  They changed where you could drive to the main elevator with    minute parking while you register  I ended up in the back    and took like forever to get to registration  The whole place is a maze of corridors and signs  different levels  unknowing employees and confusion in general  After registration I just used valet and left the car  The bath sink stopper was broke so water could not flow out  Front desk said it would be like   hrs  Three girls  one sink   you figure  I used a nail file  after breaking a nail  to pry it out of there so we could continue  Went to the Emperor Buffet at      PM to use our   buck off coupon  It closed at    Will open   AM  Whoever heard of a casino buffet closing at   PM  ided to use coupons at the Rio  which there was a free shuttle IF you can find it  After   different employees sending us   different ways and    minutes of stupidity I got a taxi outside and    bucks later arrived at Rio   Very good buffet AND they knew where to catch the shuttle back to Palace   Breakfast Emperor was pretty bad  waited for the omelets  dry and tasteless  We did not finish  rest of food sorta blah or wutever  Still like   bucks even with off coupon  About     of the employees I dealt with were not nice  thank goodness the other half made up for it  There was a        quot resort quot  surcharge per room per day that I knew was to be collected at the check in desk  so we paid cash for that  Going thru Expedia the rooms were paid in advance on the plastic and no refunds  So imagine my surprise when I got home and see        pending on my card  I called  did the push    push   routine  Spanish English  had to go thru front desk to the mgr  It s like        a day they hold from your card EVEN IF THE ROOMS ARE PAID  OMG  it took like   days before it got credited back to me and they still kept        so I called AGAIN and they claim it was the second day  quot resort quot  tax  Come on ppl  get real  Why would they only collect   day at check in when you re booked for two  Plus I remember the    and change we gave  This place used to be happy  easy going  friendly  made me feel at home and personal  At this point     the ppl there have no idea what the right hand is doing as well as the left  The in house buffet is not convenient and not overly appetizing  I feel like I ve lost a friend  Goodbye Imperial Palace  it was fun  
N =>  Some good some bad My wife and I stayed over the  th of y weekend in a Luv tub comped room  Thats why we chose the IP  We have stayed all over Vegas  this was my first time at IP  The first room we were given was not cleaned and still had some items in it belonging to other people  Called the desk  they sent a bellman up and he brought us keys to the new room The second room was much nicer  it was larger and laid out better  Had a balcony  The elevators are the bad point of this property  We did figureout to use the back elevators and walk a little bit more  it beat standing around The gaming was great  Good minimums  good dealers  THe dealertainers are better than you think  Billy Idol was cool and Christina A  was hot  It is a very short walk to the O SHeas casino next door  THey have great gaming also and good music playing  You can also see the outside from you table We only ate there in the Tearoom one time for breakfast  It was good  not great  We ate other places every night  Stay here on a budget  be prepared for elevator waiting at busy times  THe staff and delaers were very nice and check in was a breeze  They also comped our pool cabana when we left early    
N =>  Great Location Bad Service and Value From the outside the place looked old  Check in took   min The room was a decent size  Great view of the pool  Room service was prompt  Convience to every where you want to go was Great cause of the location  hotel was right in the middle of the strip   not bad for      
N =>  You could not pay me to stay at that place again  What a fool I used to be  Now I am older and wiser  A two hour wait to check in was our welcome after working our way past the meaningless directional signs  It was like some cruel hoax  those signs were so wrong  The next morning we gave up waiting for an elevator and decided to take the stairs  not knowing there was no way out of the stairway without opening an alarmed door  lying signs again   even on the ground floor  Luckily  we ran into about    other guests in the stairway who had also given up on the elevators  so the doors to other floors were opening from the hallways pretty often and we had no problem returning to the elevators     to wait and then only have them be totally full when they arrived  It was almost    min  from the time we left our room  right next to an elevator  until we got downstairs  I would always rather take the stairs  but this hotel doesn t allow that  Same thing going up later that day       a line all the way into the casino of guests waiting to get onto an elevator  What a miserable joke this hotel is  I can t believe it wasn t intentional  No mgt  can be that incompetent by accident  Monkeys can do a better job  Next time I go to Vegas  I will be sure to drop some garbage off at the Imperial Palace  
N =>  A dirty grubby tired and dated hotel  Do not stay at this hotel  You will be bitterly dissapointed  After spending hours travelling to Las Vegas  on an eagerly awaited holiday  we arrived at the airport and got ripped off by a taxi driver who took the  quot scenic route quot  to our hotel  On arrival and check in I was spoken to by a very abrupt member of staff at the registration desk  No one at this hotel ever showed us any courtesy and I found them to be very ignorant  When we entered the hotel room I could not believe the condition of it   The carpets were filthy the beds even had sweets under them from previous occupants  There was thick dust at the back and tops of units and the floor in the bathroom was dirty  The corridors are filthy and evry where smells of smoke and stale alcohol  Stay somewhere else      
N =>   Never Stay Again I would never stay here again  We booked online  but the prices don t tell you that you are in the bowels of the hotel  far in the back looking at the end of the garage The room was never made up  no towels to replace the used ones  no soaps  shampoos or anything   left over dirty finger nails left on counter when we arrived  Very difficult to find your way around that place and staff is not very friendly  it s not expensive but would rather stay at the Venetian than in the pits  I actually like the old strip better and the rooms are easy to access   nope wouldn t recommend this place to anything    oh yest  if you weigh over     lbs  you won t fit in the bathroom  
N =>   Dirty Old Hotel The room we were given had no tub and the water would spill out on the tile  the room had an odor like moldy carpet  We changed room which was an improvement  the hall carpeting was stained  The only good thing was it was centrally located around the other   star hotels  The parking was convenient  however the hotel still has a hold on my credit card after I ve already checked out  I wouldn t recommend staying here  unless you stay drunk and don t give a damn  
N =>   Awsome Value Great Location  Unlike all the negative reviews on this hotel i have a positive one  This hotel was great for value  If you expect a   star hotel  book at a   star hotel for an extra        The rooms were clean and just roomy enough   we got a balcony which overlooked the pool   the only downside to thatt was the music was blaring at   a m   great if your an early riser  but not so great hungover   The room service was excellent  this is where we ate most of our meals  food was excellent  The beds were confortable and the bathroom was and quite roomy  The casino downstairs was really nice  not huge   but they had  quot dealertainers quot  where they dressed as celebrity s and pretended to sing their songs   they were a hoot  you can also play poker  etc  with them dealing to you  The Location  again  was awsome   you walk out and your right in the middle of the strip   not a long walk to anything really  If you wanted to get to the other end of the strip   there is a double decker bus called  quot the deuce quot  its   dollars for    hours pass and it brings you to both outlet malls and freemont street  with random stops all the way up the strip    i suggest this bus other than the city buses or trains    those were sketchy   We went to one show   the Improv at Harrah s   was the cheapest one and we had a blast  the comedians were hilarious  but make sure you go to the      show   we went to the       show and it wasnt even full which made it less fun  the      show was packed  We went to all the attractions   The Secret Garden The Mirage    Eifell Tower   Stratosphere   Freemont Street   and the little shows outside each hotel that go on at night  They were all great  I would definitly reccomend this hotel if your planning on getting out and seeing the world  If your on a vacation to sit in your hotel room   go somewhere else  
N =>   Great Location  We booked a   nite stay through Allegiant Air as a package deal  Everyone was extremely helpful and courteous  When we arrived we got our choice of room location and the horror stories of the rooms in the back were unfounded  Our room was neat and clean and not noisy  No fumes from the garage area The buffet wasn t elaborate like some hotels but the food was good As with everything in Vegas you do have a lot of walking in ALL the hotels to get to your room   This hotel could use some updating but the location was great  Other major casinos were a short walk away or you could catch the tram behind the hotel We will stay at this hotel again     
N =>  OK but the layout is confusing  We had lots of trouble navigating  There were different elevators  for different floors  Too much walking for elderly  We had to go up an escalator  then down another to get to the parking deck   Very confusing  Elevators were not large enough  
N =>   Eat elsewhere  This may be a little old  but I understand things have not improved  My wife and I flew to Vegas intending to stay a few nights there and then drive to Death Valley  Lake Tahoe  Yosemite and San Francisco  The second day there we had sea bass for dinner that was heavily spiced  We were both ill  but my wife suffered very badly  the effects lasting about a week  Our flight over the Grand Canyon was completely spoiled  as was the drive to Death Valley  The service at the hotel was almost non existent and there was no help in finding one s way around it  The room was fairly clean  but not what we would hope for  Like most of Las Vegas  the exterior was showy  but the casino and interior were tatty and had no atmosphere  
N =>   Better Than We Thought It would Be     My husband and I just got back a few days ago from a   day    night trip out to Vegas  We are not  quot big quot  spenders when it comes to gaming  however when we entered in our Total Rewards card   back in uary  we were shocked to find that the Imperial Palace was going to comp us every night of our stay except for Friday night  a steal at       We didn t hesitate to book the trip  though we have to admit we were pretty worried about what this  quot Free quot  room would be like  Previous reviews have given horror stories about room conditions  so we were more than prepared to slip a     to the front desk clerk if they were going to put us up in a Capri room  to try and upgrade  Turns out  we could not have been any happier with the room they gave us    th floor  simple but clean  with a fantastic view of the strip and looking right down over Harrah s Carnaval Court  which if you are not a heavy sleeper or like to go to bed before  am is not helpful with getting a good night s sleep   The water pressure in the shower was unlike any other I have ever experienced nice and strong  and never wanted to leave the shower once I got in  Staff was very friendly  pool facilities were adequate but not flashy  and it is a bit difficult to find the first time around  consider yourself warned   We had breakfast at the Teahouse and also at Betty s  both places did the job  but again nothing too extravagant  I would like to mention as an extra bonus to check out the poolside luau and show on Tuesday and Saturday nights get reduced price tix from inside O Shea s and you can save         per person off the VIP package  We really enjoyed the show and dinner  Of course you CANNOT beat the location of this hotel  The only negative I would have to state that really ate up time  especially the morning we were checking out  was how incredibly slow the elevators were  Twice it took us over    minutes  no joke   to get an elevator that wasn t packed to capacity  All in all  we would not hesitate to recommend the IP to anyone looking for a clean  friendly place to lay their weary heads and bodies down after a long day of gambling and walking  Better than we thought it would be  
N =>   Very bad customer service and Watch out for your incidental charges Very stern receptionist who wouldn t listen to our questions  just kept saying  quot Next in line quot  I paid for supposedly a  quot DELUXE plus quot  Suite but TV was broken we were switched to another room which had electrical problems After my trip when I reviewed my credit card  they graciously charged an extra     charge  which they admitted was a mistake  but would take at least five business days to refund     WATCH OUT    
N =>   ITEMS STOLEN FROM ROOM WORST HOTEL IN THE WORLD  My husband and I are easy to please but this was like hell  My husband has to take medicine for an illness  We specifically remember leaving the bottle of pain medicine on the table because he would need it after we returned  IT WAS GONE  EVEN THE   LOSE PILLS THAT WERE RESTING ON THE TABLE  The hotel police assured me that we both have just been drinking and his employees have done nothing  The investigation done was a joke  Then a fire siren was under repair during the time we were sleeping  daytime      it took   hours  The next day there was some kind of drillling for constuction on the floor above us  The casino took forever to bring complimentary drinks    per hour  We didnt get any sleep and my husband had to finish the trp in pain  The problem is the quality of staff they hire  I dont think half of them would pass a background check  We were fine with the hotel smelling musty and being very old  we were trying to save our money for spending but I WILL NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN                       IMPORTANT NOTE              Stay away from those timeshare presentations that give you a free show for attending  The Wyndham Manager was very sleazy  we signed a mini contract saying if we stay for   hours we get the show tickets  They wouldnt let us leave without buying time share and when I tried to tell him we signed a deal in writing he stated   quot I dont care what that paper says if you dont sign your not getting any tickets  quot  After   hours      HOURS    we finally were given some dumb impersonation show tickets and not the Cirque ones we were promised  
N =>   Loved it  We spent   nights here in the delux love tub room free on comps  amp  loved it  We had great housekeeping service every day  Fresh linens everyday  All staff was very friendly  amp  helpful  Wasn t impressed with the burger place but spent most of our time out  amp  about so found other places to eat  Check in was the only bad part of our trip  Spent about an hour in line  Would recommend to anyone  
N =>   What do you expect for     night  We got a ridiculous deal through one of the travel websites and once flights were out of the way  the hotel worked out to     night  Split that between   guys that were looking for a launching pad for the party that is Vegas   and you can t beat a deal like that  Anyways  getting to the useful information Check In   We got there at  am on a Sunday   line up was huge and not moving at all  One of the clerks was busy telling every person that came to the counter her life story and literally in the time it took to get one person checked in   the other girl did three  So tried the old slipping the     bill in with the id credit card trick   she didn t even take the money and didn t even acknowledge us when we asked if an upgrade was available  First time ever that has happened to me  Room   Well   it was hotel room that I m pretty sure looked the same as it did when I stayed there last time      years ago  But really  for the amount of time we spent there   it was perfect  There was a little deck to stand on while we smoked  the a c worked like a charm even if it was a little noisy  TV was small but worked fine if you wanted to find out how to play Blackjack or something  Cleaning service was great and efficient  left us extra towels when we asked for them and even an extra garbage can that we used as a cooler  Elevators   Brutal and slow   always packed around check in time and not a lot of room to begin with  When you put the four of us in it   there wasn t much room and we re not exactly fatty fat fats Pool   One pool and one hot tub   hot tub in   plus celsius weather  no thanks  The little waitresses were quick and seemed to know exactly when your drink was ready to be refilled   but look out man  when you re used to drinking for free at the machines tables   it get expensive when you sign off on a few buckets o beer  Food was perfect for poolside  Burgers and dogs  Music seemed like we had time warped to the    s but that was fine  Who doesn t want to hear a little old school Motley Crue when you re drinking in the sun by the pool Dealertainers   These guys are money  Not one of them would pass as the actual celebrity that they re impersonating  but to be able to stay in character while dealing cards   like when Michael Jackson does a little spin when the house gets Blackjack   too funny  Nightclub   With your room key you get free access to the bar across from the lobby   it s worth a look but I ll say this  I ve never been  quot hey baby quot d by so many  um  working girls in my life in one location  Ugh    ent crowd though  We were there Sunday through Thursday night and stopped in there for a while each night  It s always a busy scene and not as fru fru as some of the other clubs in Vegas  Shuttle Service   To airport Freemont anywhere   non existent    Restaurants   We ate at the Teahouse on the first day after check in   and it s a lot like a meal you d expect at a truckstop  Lots of food  and you walk away full   but it s not gourmet by any means  Here again  you get what you pay for and for the    I spent   I was satisfied Location   Perfect  Monorail is right there   Freemont is a     cab ride if you want  You re close to the Fashion Mall if you have to pick up stuff for friends back home I d definitely recomend this place to guys that were going for a stag party and just need a staging area for the night s activities  I d post photos   but for this trip what happened in Vegas   stayed in Vegas     
N =>   Do not STAY HERE TERRIBLE  Stayed here before that is why we returned hotel dirty gone down hill half of the restarants are closed room dirty found long hair alot in my bed and did not get the suite i ordered pool never any chairs opens late great location to strip put a charge on my sons credit card that never happened still awaiting credit Do not take the stairs down no way out no fire doors have to come back up and bang on door hopefully someone will open it for you elevators old and very slow You have to pay for ice now from machines Very disappointed will not return and tell my friends not to I hear New York hotel great  
N =>   Not the worst I have stayed at but could have done better for the money We arrived on a Wednesday mid afternoon so check in was fairly quick  The staff was friendly at all times but the hotel lacked in so many other ways it would be hard to recommend  The layout for the rooms is crazy and as others have noted  the elevators are slow and many times only one working out of    Room was clean  beds were comfy but I was really surprised to see a    quot  TV  I thought they were all dead  bring your own shampoo and conditioner because what ever they provide will tear your hair out  The food is overpriced and nothing less than terrible  I would suggest eating anywhere but there  If you have a folding cooler bag  pack it  That way you can at least keep drinks and snacks in your room  The location is good and that is a plus  Easy walking distance to great hotels and places to eat   The buffet at Treasure Island is really good and less than          The gaming was not too bad  but I prefer O Shay s right next door  We chose it because we didn t want to spend much on the hotel to leave more money gambling  Next time I ll stick to my favorite  Golden Nugget downtown  
N =>   Not great but works if you re on a budget or in a pinch  I would say the customer serive we experienced was pretty average  The elevators were always incredibly packed  The room was very outdated and not very clean  There were some little hairs in the bathroom and some weird pink stuff I had to wipe up  I had some other family stay in the hotel on the same floor as us  My sister said her room was disgusting and my brother said his shower leaked  It s not a great place to stay  but I doubt it s the worst out there either  It worked for us because we were looking for something cheap on the strip  but I don t think I would stay here again  
N =>   I would not recommend this hotel to my worst enemy After reading several reviews before my recent trip to Las Vegas I still decided to go with the Imperial Palace  After all I was thinking it is just somewhere to rest my head while I am out and about on the city  Well let me start of by saying when we arrived at the hotel around  pm  There was a long line for check in and only   desk agents  We waited roughly    min to be checked into our room  After this long wait we were given wrong information from the desk agent as to which set of elevators to take  So we take the first set as instructed by the front desk  We then had to walk around the   th floor for    min before we found our room  So we arrive at the hotel at  pm and step into our room for the first time at   min til   pm  Keep in mind this is just night one  Well we shower up and get ready to herad out for the night  One good thing about this hotel is the shower head pressure  Very nice shower  Anyway we make our way out  we loved the location of this hotel  we were near Harrahs Carnival Court  Jimmy Buffetts margaritaville  caesars  mirage  flamingo  all within   min walk  After out first night out we head back to the IP and want something to eat  Well the only thing open is the overpriced Burger Palace  The burger was so so  fries were cool and had been sitting  We wake up the next day to find out that for whatever reason our buffett was closed for the day  Embers the  quot nice quot restaurant of the IP does not open til  pm neither does the pizza palace  So once again if we wanted food we had the only option of the burger palace  We declined and went next door to Harrahs for the buffett  Which was awesome  Food quality and selection was awesome  After several more days of being unsatisfied with the IP we were on our way home  or so we thought  we were bumped from our flight and had to get another room for one more night  we well chose the Excalibur  and loved it  We regret not chosing the Excalibur for the entire trip  I guess the moral of my story is if you want anything good in Vegas it is not at the Imperial Palace  Not only would I not recommend this hotel to a friend I would not recommend it to my enemy  Any fun we had or good food we ate did not come from this location  Thank goodness we were close to actual nice places  I wish like the other outdated places in Vegas the IP would be torn down and make room for something a little more upscale  
N =>   Definetly didn t stay for the elevators  This hotel is in a prime hotspot location  The price was great and definetly affordable BUTfor the amount of people and rooms that this place has  they NEED to get their elevators fixed  This hotel is weirdly designed since you have to walk through a maze to get to an elevator to get to your room  but when you find the elevator you have to wait an addititonal    minutes to get a ride in it  
N =>   Reasonable accommodation in great location I stayed at Imperial Palace from Wed    to Wed     and managed to get a great deal online which worked out at less than      for   nights in a Deluxe Room Check in was on a Wed morning   I checked in   to   hours early which was no problem   there was around    mins wait for check in The put me in a room with a view of the mountains  not the older Capri tower    the advantages of this were that the noise levels were fine and I was close to the Monorail plus the back entry to Harrahs Apparently the rooms on the strip side get some loud noise from the night club until the early hours of the morning The room itself was very basic and whilst everything was clean comfortable it was definitely the most budget room I have had in all my visits to Vegas   although this is comparing to Bellagio Signature at MGM Planet Hollywood Ballys Excalibur For someone travelling on their own and not planning on spending much time in their room but wanting a good location   I think Imperial Palace is a good option If you are travelling with a partner I would recommend upgrading to a nicer room or even staying somewhere else The layout of the Imperial Palace is a bit confusing at first but eventually you can figure it out The casino is quite cramped and a bit worn down compared to other casinos on the strip   it does have a good atmosphere especially with the  Dealertainers  who not only are dealers but each play the character of an entertainer and get up to sing a couple of songs throughout the evening   the Freddy Mercury and Elvis Presley characters always seemed to attract a crowd The sportsbook at Imperial Palace is actually located on the third floor   would have been one of the worst sportsbooks on the strips and even though it is quite large never seemed to have more than   or   people there   they were unable to take bets on any Boston Celtics games because the CEO of the Harrahs group is associated with the team   so this often meant going somewhere else anyway The poker room was not bad but was also quite hard to get a game at times The restaurants at the hotel were not that great   the buffet was the worst I have had in Vegas as far as variety and service went   the Pizza place was ok but nothing special   Burger Palace which seemed to be their only    hour restaurant made reasonably good burgers   I often ended up venturing next door to Harrahs or O Sheas for something quick to eat  
N =>  Worst hotel on the strip We stayed at Imperial Palace and did not like anything about it  First off when we go to check in there was a long line with only   people working at the counter  Once it was finally our turn  we were surprized to find out that there was a      security deposit  leaving us with less spending money for the week  DO NOT EAT AT BURGER PALACE           McDonalds is a   star restraunt compared to that  We tried the Emporers Buffet  not horrible for the price  The casino  pool  and restraunts are rather boring compared to all the other hotels  The rooms are old and somewhat drity  My feet were BLACK just from walking in our room  No exaderation but it took nearly    minutes just to get from the front of the hotel to our room  The hallways are so long and windly its a maze to find anyting in that hotel  Took almost an hour just to find our room when we checked in  We had   people staying there between   rooms  All   keys simutaniously stopped working  Leaving us to walk a mile to the front desk to get a working one  to walk a mile back to the room  Spend a few extra bucks to get a nicer hotel it would be worth it  
N =>  Great Location My sister and I take a vacation in Las Vegas every year but normally stay downtown  We decided to try staying on the strip for the first time this year  We had a great package deal for IP  The Imperial Palace is a great location  We were able to walk around and still go back to our room if needed  The hotel room condition was old but it was clean  The housekeeping staff was great  They always asked if we needed anything when passing them  I look forward to staying at IP again next year  
N =>  Old but comfortable in a great location  Stayed   nights last week and was pleasantly surprised on first impressions  Room was clean but basic with a balcony overlooking Harrah s pool which was a bonus  Found it difficult to sleep because of the noise of A C  at least it worked  and the outrageous volume of the music from Harrahs  I enjoyed the Casino with the dealer entertainers very professional  and there was no shortage of waitresses bringing you free drinks   dont forget the  tip tho   Swimming pool was good for a chill out with no shortage of towells and beds  Best Restaurant we went to has to be Voga at the Flamingo where they transform what seems to be a basic meal from the menu into a gastro delight   quot Legends in Concert quot  at Hurrahs was brill but i suggest you buy tickets  as for all shows  from one of the many     price ticket booths you find along the Strip Overall  IP is a cheap and cheerful place to stay  
N =>  What at terrible experience I am a dimond member first time staying at Imperial Palace  I would NEVER recommend any of my friends or anyone to stay  I was promised by a rep with all exiting and great strip view room  I was totally exited and cant wait to be there  but when I got there  things totall different from what I was offered and was never fullfilled the satisfaction  Unfriendly staffs  frontdesk supervior was not very helpful  all she did was to apoligize  Looking for my room like it was going thru a maze  Elevators were down and it took us between     minutes to get down  Room was dirty  very small for a delux suit for a double queen beds and a small TV  I give a tremondous credits for celebrity dealers though  They worked really hard to put on a show every night  
N =>  Great experience We stayed the week of il   th  We wanted a good inexpensive clean place to stay with a good location  so we could afford as many Vegas experiences as possible  The location was wonderful   It is located in mid strip  next to Harrah s  We had no problems or complaints  Rooms were just the right size  clean  and comfortable  Staff was friendly and helpful  We had plans to see Vegas  not sit in our rooms  We never made it to the pool or experienced the other amenities  There were six elevators near us and three more around the corner  but each morning they were packed with visitors on their way to check out  Later in the day  we never had to wait  Our room was quiet  The rooms facing the strip may hear the noise from the streets  There is music playing from several nearby locations on the street  Hey  this is Vegas   We had a great experience and can t wait to go back  
N =>  Don t Bother Unless You Just Want Cheap  The updated rooms aren t bad but the service at Imperial Palace hotel staff is poor  They messed up my reservation by showing I checked out a day early and then rebooked my room to someone else  I came back to the hotel to find someone sitting in my room waiting for their friends to got their room rebooked  I m just glad everything in my room wasn t stolen  They offered a     dinner but that didn t even cover the food and liquor in my room I had to throw out   It is in a very good location on the strip though  
N =>   Old run down hotel in a good location  I wish I would have started here before making reservations  The hotel was old    years ago when I stayed there and I don t think anything has been done since  If you are looking for a cheap place to stay and you are doing everything elsewhere  then you may not mind staying if old and slow doesn t bother you From the time we arrived with our luggage in tow to when we left we were constantly harassed by the staff pushing Tahiti Village  Every time we passed the booth to go to the elevators we were asked  It got old very fast  They try to bribe you with show tickets to sign up for the tour and sales pitch  typical time share stuff The elevators were slow  luckily we stayed on weekdays when it was not as crowded  The Buffet cost was too much           however the prime rib was excellent  especially don t go if you are looking forward to the seafood  it was all served on ice The rooms were outdated with mirrors on the ceiling and the Luv Tub was just a big bathtub with no jets  should have asked ahead of time  The bathtub had missing caulk and what appeared to be mold growing in the corner We went downtown to the Freemont Experience and decided that for the value and what it had to offer we would stay downtown next time  much more activity and fun  
N =>   I was surprized    it really was OK We arrived for check in at      am  No lines at check in  We had reserved   smoking and   nonsmoking room then decided we would rather have adjoining rooms  I m a no smoker but would give in so we could all be together  They accomodated us Got smoking rooms        amp     facing the pool  The rooms were OK  Pretty generic  Had an old tv but it had cable and a good picture  Carpet was worn with a few small stains  You really couldn t tell it was a smoking room  Had a balcony with a sliding glass door which we loved   nothing like fresh air  One bad thing   I looked at my bedspread  amp  I saw what appeared to either be dried mustard or puke  The housekeeper was just down the hall and I asked her to come in  amp  see this yellow stuff  She freaked yelled  quot oh my God  oh my God  It was another shift  Oh my god  quot  She immediately pulled the bedspread off  amp  it was replaced with a clean one apologizing prufusely  Bathroom clean  Water pressure very good  The Main elevators are very slow but if you go past the gift shops up to the escalators  toward the monorail station  then up another escalator to the  nd floor  there is another set of elevators that were alot faster  Yes it really is maze  like but worth it  Our room was very close to this set of elevators so we really didn t have to wait at all our whole trip  The casino was fun  I didn t think it was dark or smokey at all  I thought Harrah s was the smokiest casino we went in  Waitress service was good  The pool was clean and spacious  Always plenty of chairs available  Hot dogs and hamburgers are grilled by the pool        for a    lb hot dog good  too  I ate the brunch buffet once  It was OK not bad just OK  We stayed there because the room was comped and they offered me a      Macy Gift Card  The location is great  Would I stay there again  Probably  if it was the only free room I could get in that part of the strip  I asked for a late check out    pm and got it  The casino host printed our boarding passes for us  Over all service was good and everyone very pleasant  It s just an old hotel that really is showing it s age  I was expecting it to be alot worse but it really was OK  You get what you pay for  You want cheap  Don t be afraid to stay at IP  It really was OK  
N =>  Find somewhere else to stay     I arrived with a group of    women to enjoy the strip and some much needed Girl Time  The front desk had all the reservation screwed up and insisted we all give our charge card numbers  even though the rooms were all paid by the organizer  The restaurant left a whole lot to be desired  We ended up eating at other hotels  Denny s  Panda Express  McDonalds  anywhere but here  My roommate and I were on the   th floor  if the elevators weren t slow        minute wait  they were broke  we actually took the stairs  guess you can say we were on the  quot loud quot  side of the house  Two druken bridesmaid s decided that  AM was the perfect time to have an argument that escalated into a fight outside of my room  The only positive was the friendly housekeepers when you asked for something that should have already been in your room  
N =>   You get what you pay for  When our travel agent booked us here we were excited about the price and then come to find out  there were so many people we knew who stayed here and said it is the only place they stayed in Vegas  They all told us it was an older hotel  but was clean which is all we cared about  not to mention the location  we are NOT picky people  However  We were really disappointed   and it takes a lot to disappoint us   Our first day we had to be moved because sewage backed up in the bathtub and it STUNK    Management was very gracious about moving us  however the next room we were moved to didn t have the greatest plumbing either    sink bathtub didn t drain  The carpet was stained and there was a cigarette butt outside of our door in the hallway for THREE days that didn t get picked up   YUCK  Just goes to show the cleanliness of the housekeeping staff   I also had a bad experience with the watistaff on the floor  My husband  amp  I were playing slots for almost an hour and didn t have a waitress  so I cashed out to seek service and was told that it was shift change  which was understandable  however  the waitress that took my order followed me back to BE SURE I was gambling and stood behind me to watch and make sure I put my voucher back in the machine like I was a child  I m in my late   s     I was appalled   I ve stayed at the Excalibur prior to my visit at the IP and would definitely prefer to stay there over the IP in comparison to the value  not to mention there is more entertainment there than the IP  The pool was not open and it was the second week of il  which is pool season in Vegas  Packed my bathing suit for no reason  If you prefer to stay at a hotel where things are going on and you would prefer cleanliness  I wouldn t recommend this hotel  
N =>   Exactly what I expected to find   clean small room friendly staff good food I traveled to London with my girlfriend and we found this hotel through Trip Advisor  Based on the reviews and descriptions  we found exactly what we expected  The hotel was right in our budget  the room was clean  the food was good  and the staff was friendly  The location was good as well  not a very long walk to Trafalgar Square  easy access to St  Pancreas and Kings Cross  and some very cool restaurants along the main street  If this is your budget  I would highly recommend this hotel  
N =>  Excellent value for London perfect for Eurostar Terminal I agree with almost all the other reviews  Stayed for   night before Eurostar departure  Found room quite small  but expected that from these reviews  However  very clean  amp  compact  Tea coffee in room   amp  ensuite  Amazing how you much you can get in a room if planned well  For     double room I thought very good value for money  Breakfast included in rate  but due to very early dept unable to have any  No discount given which I normally may expect but as rate so reasonable you can t really argue  Also the staff said we could help ourself to toast etc  but we had little time Having stayed at some other hotels  this was by far cleanest  amp  most comfortable  We had  rd floor room and I don t think there were lifts  Fine for us  but suggest lower floor request for some people This was ideal place for what we wanted  Nice  clean room  less than  mins to the St Pancras Eurostar Terminal  Great  
N =>  Very good choice if you want to stay near King Cross station area Great location  only     mins walk to King Cross train station  Service was very good  When I arrive at   am  I left my luggage and then went Cambridge  When I came back in the afternoon  they ve moved my luggage into my room already  Althouth my ensuit  double room was not very big  but it s clean  comfortable and quiet  Breakfast was also very good  I ll recommend this hotel  If I need to stay at King Cross train station area again  I ll choice Alhambra Hotel as my first choice  
N =>  Brilliant location The Alhambra Hotel is an excellent one if you want to see london or are moving on to airports or by train as it is litterally two minutes from K cross  amp  you can see ST Pancras from the hotel  friendly staff clean and modern facilities good cooked breakfast to start the day nothing was to much trouble for the staff  will use this hotel every time we have to go to london  cost for a double was     night inc b fast  
N =>   ideal location at a fair price We also stayed in room    in the annexe  which we found absolutely fine though a little small  so wouldn t want to spend more than a couple of nights  also has step up to shower loo which was strange   We had been accomodated in a ground floor quiet room as I have limited mobility  this was no trouble to organise for the very helpful staff  There was some renovation work going on to the annexe  but it was not overly intrusive The breakfast service was efficient and quick  We did have to share a table with another couple  but we didnt mind  Very yummy breakfast and they were able to organise a veggie version for my husband with no fuss We were travelling from St Pancras International the following morning  and the hotel could not have been closer or more convenient for the station  We are hoping to go on the Eurostar to brussels and bruges for our next holiday  and would have no hesitation in using this hotel again  and recommending it on  
N =>   Beware of time zone changes hotel policies and a hotel s bottom line My    year old daughter and I intended to stay at the Alhambra at the end of e  but made a miscalculation with time zones similar to the couple from Auckland who wrote a review last month  Prior to check out time on the first day of our reservation  my husband emailed the hotel from the U S  via their secure server letting them know that we were en route  would be arriving late and would like our reservation held  He received a confirmation indicating the message was successfully delivered  When we arrived  we were told they did not receive the email  the hotel was fully booked  and we would have a difficult timing finding another hotel because Wimbledon was going on  In addition  they charged our Visa for one nights lodging  My daughter and I were exhausted after travelling from the U S  and found Bruno and ek s attitude and communication quite cold  We also got the run around intially and were not very clear who really was in charge there  I would advise travelers to make sure of their dates before booking with their credit card because hotels such as this one don t really care if you make a mistake because it can be to their advantage  I can understand a hotel charging someone for not showing up or canceling  but I don t think it is fair that a hotel can charge twice for a room when they are able to rent it out  Landlords can not charge two different tenants for renting the same place on the same day  and I don t think hotels should be allowed to either  
N =>  Perfect for us We enjoyed Alhambra  Our room was small but not as small as I thought it could be  It was also clean  and cleaned every day  and furniture seemed quite new We had a shared bathroom witch worked fine  It happened to be always free and toilet was clean  Only minus was the lack of sink in toilet  I would have liked to wash my hand befoure touching many door handles   Free breakfast was very good and I couldn t have eaten more  It was nice to be able to choose between English and continental breakfast I was very peaceful in hotel  You could hear voices from corridors if someone was walking there but people were doing it silently  Also some noise came from the street but it was tolerable  Espacially thinking that hotel was so close to metro  Location was great  It is so close to the stations and trains go everywhere  Only at night we had to take a taxi for few kilometres because the night buss didn t go to King s Cross from Piccadilly  
N =>   A clean comfortable and efficient hotel with a yummy breakfast  We stayed in a quad room on ground floor  Room      Argyle   The room was very clean and the beds were very comfortable  Everything was in operating order  coffee maker  lights  outlets  shower  and internet   The room was a bit small  but it was amazingly quiet considering St  Pancras and Kings Cross stations were practically across the street  All staff members were very polite and the hot breakfast was very good  This hotel exceeded my expectations  I would stay here again  Note  It takes about   minutes to walk to Kings Cross from the Alhambra        minutes to buy tickets  at peak hour   and    minutes travel time to Heathrow  Thankfully  the station has escalators and an elevator  no stairs to battle w luggage in tow   Tickets cost about   GBP each  
N =>   Rude Old Lady I stayed at this hotel in        I saw all the good reviews from Trip Advisor so I decided to give it a try  I booked this hotel by email  We planned to stay there for   nights orginally but then we changed our schedule  I informed the hotel to change our booking from   nights to   nights  The room was just okay  It s not particular clean and comfortable  We were okay with our stay anyway until on the check out day  As my niece was not feeling so well  so I asked one of the staff if we could check out a bit late  He said the check out time was   am but we could check out by      am  Therefore  we checked out at        When we checked out  there was an old lady at the counter  She asked  quot do you know what the time is      it s   am   Don t you know the check out time is   am    quot  I couldn t believe what she said  I was like what kind of attitude is that   She then asked  quot is that you request to change the reservation from   nights to   nights quot  I said  quot yes  because we changed our plan quot  Then she said  quot  you should have made booking for   nights instead of   nights quot     I was totally appalled by her attitude  Although she kept smiling when she was talking to us  I still think she s way too rude  I will never come back to this hotel  
N =>  Good choice My second hotel experience in London  the first one was catastrophic  therefore I was pleasantly surprised with this one The room was clean and confortable  the service was discrete and friendly We had a good night and a good breakfast  not too expensive and very close to St Pancras  i ll definitely go there again if needed  
N =>   ok but could be better i stayed at this hotelfor   nights an the last two mornings we had got woken up at    am in the morning by builders that was working on the room directly above us  we wasnt advised of this and spoke to a person at reception who didnt have a clue that there was any builders  he wrote a note for the manager but nothing was done or said about it  we didnt even get told that there will be people working  we paid for the room tio stay in yet got woken up very early  
N =>   Superb   My Daughter and I spent two nights at the Alhambra  the accomodation was spotlessly clean  comfortable  and the Staff very helpful and friendly   It is difficult to find a place to stay in London that reaches the quality of the Alhambra  the convenient location will not be beaten   and the Breakfast is a perfect start to a busy day  I have no reservations whatsoever of recommending the Hotel Alhambra to visitors to London  Do go there you will not be dissapointed  
N => Convenient Location a Plus We stayed two nights at the Alhambra in ember in rooms with private baths toilets  Our rate was    BPS per room per night including breakfast Pros  Check in was efficient and easy  We were able to check in at      p m   which was great  We missed the regular breakfast time because of the long line that snaked out the door  However  we went down    minutes after the breakfast hour  and the host very kindly arranged for us to be served even though the cook had cleaned his pan  We really appreciated it  The rooms were very basic but clean  the shower had hot water and good pressure Cons  The rooms were small  but we knew that going in so we were not surprised  Someone in the building just next to the hotel was working on a construction project late at night     p m     a m    Hammering  drilling  pouring of some liquids out the window   The wall of our room rattled as they worked  Our biggest woe was the intermittent beeping of the fire alarm system in the hallway outside my parents  room  We complained about it three different times  but it was not fixed in the time that we were there  In fact  the first time we complained  the guy acted like we were making it up  The alarm beeped consistently day and night about every    minutes   nine short beeps followed by six additional ones  My parents asked for another room  and they were offered one  but it didn t have a private shower toilet  
N =>   Excellent value We just came back from a short trip in London and we enjoyed our stay at the Alhambra Ideally located near St Pancras station  it takes    minutes to walk to the city center Room was clean  large  comfortable   of course  we clearly heard our neihgbours coming back to their room but they were particularly noisy  Breakfast is really enjoyable and the staff warm and welcoming In short   for     pp  what else is it to ask for    
N =>   Clean Convenient Location Will stay again We  four    something canadians  spent four nights at the end of tember after being all over UK  Our daughter recommended this place which she learned of from Lonely Planet and she and her husband stayed here in the spring  Given the cost  which was the lowest of our three weeks  we were not expecting much but we were very pleasantly surprised to find the rooms very clean  comfortable though small  the bathroom and shower room  shared  convenient ly close to the room and clean  This is an excellent budget accommodation  felt safe  close to the underground  a couple of good pubs  Staff were frindly  cooperative and helpful  They arranged an inexpensive and very clean car to take us to Heathrow  WE will definatley stay here again whenever we are in London and will recommended it to friends  It actually makes London more of an affordable destination for us  Breakfasts were excellent  
N =>   Excellent Value for Money Used the internet to select this London hotel for my wife and I to spend an overnight stay while we went to a West End theatre Ideally situated close      metres  to our mainline railway station  Kings Cross   Kings Cross underground very convenient for access to anywhere in London Family run  very clean and tidy  All staff helpful and create the impression of wanting to help you  We were in the annex to the main building     metres directly across the road  which may seem like a problem but in fact proved even more convenient as we were given our own key to the building as well as the room so access was probably even easier than having to go through reception  Potential problem of getting to restaurant for breakfast if weather was bad and the volume of guests trying to get into the restaurant which was clearly designed to cope only with the original building  at breakfast time are very minor compared to the level of facilities and service provided at the price Excellent value at less than     total for the two of us to share a twin bedded room and both have full English breakfast  
N =>   ent Budget Stay We selected this hotel for the low price comared to any others in central London  The location wasn t quite central  but it was less than one block walking distance from a major train station  the King s Cross  which was great for getting to  quot downtown quot  and Paris  The neighborhood didn t seem very safe at night but other than being followed around by one stranger  nothing happened  The hotel was clean but modest  The breakfast was fine  
N =>   I came to know for this excellent hotel vis internet  Good experience  I stayed for   days in your hotel while coming from USA for my onward journey to Pakistan  Its was an exellent experience to stay in such like accomodation as I always stay in big hotels  For ones resonable budget its an excellent place  Very close to Tube  amp  Bus stop  I recommend to young couples or living alone to stay here  Excellent and cooperative staff and good breakfast  Worth the money you spend  Will always recommend to my friends  amp  family  
N =>   Disaster   avoid  Hotel was full so was directed over the road despite having a reservation  Did not feel secure in this  apartment block  with no staff reception telephones  Room was noisy and I could hear everything from room above due to extremely creaky floorboards  Room was also VERY HOT  Due to all of the above  I tried to complain and check out a day early  Receptionist Owner called me a liar  demanded     cancellation fee and told me no one has ever complained at the hotel in her    years working there  She may have worked there    years but it has taught her NOTHING about customer service  
N =>   Okay nothing fantastic When we checked in  we were directed to a block across from the hotel  There was no explanation whatsoever  I assume the main hotel was full and this was the overflow  We had a room on the ground floor with windows opening to an air well  It was a hot day in London and we requested a fan as the open windows did not help in ventilation  The man at the reception said  can t you open the windows   I said we did and it was still stuffy in the room  He then said  try tomorrow  I got no fan   Needless to say  with that attitude I did not try again  The room was really tight  It had   single beds and moving around was very difficult  There was no room for the luggage  Eventually we moved all the beds together and there was sufficient leg room  The toilet and bathroom was separate  The shower was really light and we had to adjust the nozzle to get a decent spray    small bars of soap  amp    towels were provided  nothing else  The sink was in the room  next to the coffee tea facilities    portions of milk was supplied  There was no fridge or hair dryer  There was a flat screen TV which was bolted on the wall on top of the wardrobe  The sheets  amp  pillowcases were clean It was difficult for friends to contact us as there was no phone and the reception was across the road  Friends said they left messages but none was pass on  Or said that there was no such person Breakfast was adequate  Nothing fantastic  You had a choice of an English breakfast  one egg  one slice of bacon  one sausage and baked beans  or oatmeal or cereal  You were not allowed anymore  However you could request for more toast or tea coffee  Their hot chocolate was rather nice  however they did not tell you it was available until I notice another guest having it  You would think that having children at the table that the waitress would offer it  The waiter or waitress just said  quot tea or coffee quot  The room rate was about      bed  amp  breakfast  We chose this location because we needed to go to the Eurostar  If you are not fuss about the basic accommodation and did not want to spend too much  this would be an adequate place  There was also free wi fi  Ask the reception for the password  There were not many eating places around nor shopping  The British Library is nearby and worth a visit  I would recommend turning left  from Argyle St  onto Euston Rd and walk to Totenham Court Rd  Enjoy the window shopping all the way down to Charing Cross  amp  China Town  If you are on a tight budget  you might choose this hotel  However I think there are many others that can offer a better service  amp  location  Unlike the other reviewers we did not meet any friendly or helpful staff  
N =>   Great location  I only stayed at the Alhambra for one night of a   week UK vacation  but I must say  it was a very nice hotel with a very helpful staff  The location is excellent  right across from King s Cross station  which was a big draw  The young lady working the front desk actually helped carry our luggage upstairs  something none of the other hotels we stayed in offered to do  which was very nice after a long train trip  The room we had was VERY small  the smallest of all the rooms we had stayed in during our vacation   amp  the view from the back window not very appealing  a dirty back lot area   On the plus side  the room looked fresh  amp  there were in room tea  amp  coffee making facilities  amp  also Wi Fi access  which was also something not available to us at our other hotels  The breakfast room looked nice  amp  they also offer a fully cooked breakfast  which is an added bonus  All in all  a very good deal  
N =>   Great hotel in hard to find hotel London  After a lot of researching to find a decent hotel in London  I managed to find this one  it caught my attention since it was managed by portuguese people  and me being portuguese  I gave it a try and  Yes  it just absolutely great Ok  the rooms were very small  but when you re in London you re not going to be in the hotel They were small  but very clean  and the breakfast   to die for Highly recommended    
N =>   I recommend this place   First time in London  so I cannot compare with others   Compare to continental hotels the room is not that large   But  everything is in it  If we would have to stay in the room for an evening    thats not very confortable  but a stay in London doesn t take place in a hotel room  For a french speaking people it is a rest to have french at breakfast     If I would come back in London  and I will      this hotel will be my first choice  
N =>   terribile   I have booked this holel for    nights in august this year based on the positive feedback and we hade an orrible surprice   we booked the hotel alahmbra but they put us in the argyle hotel opposite to the street   Mr  miguel and mrs valoti are very rude  dispite the fact we were on honymoon and we stayed there    nights they put us in the lower room     floor room      very awfal room  dirty and small with a very very thiny batroom  we cold not move inthe room and in the night we could not sleep due to the fact that we heard everything from above and near room   we heard all the people walking inthe rooms upsters going to the bathroom or walking  we heard everything because the wall are very thin we stayed there only   night sbecause we could not sleep    i wanted to leave the first night but they wer e going to charge us for the not advise   and likely i found the Mabledon court hotel NEAR THEM  where i had WONDERFUL STAY  The people there are exrtremnely kind  they but us in a top large room with garden view and WITHOUT NOISE  WE SLEPT all the nights in peace P s  the breakfast at ALAHABRA IS NOT huge  the huge one is at MABLEDON COURT HOTEL  IN MABLEDON STREET At alahmabra mrs valoti claimed that i have taked   little box of corn flakes dispite the fact that we had ordered english breakfast i did not know atMABLEDON the buffet was huge there were youguttyh  fruits  cornflakes chese  etc    while at alhanbra there was only cornflackes  
N =>   Small nice and cleah hotel I was induced to book at Alhambra hotel thanks to the generally positive comments on TripAdvisor  but just before the holiday I was bit scared by the latest opinions Nevertheless my experience there has been positive  we booked a double room with en suite toilet and shower  We had to change room in the middle of our stay  but this condition was clearly stated already in the booking confirmation  Moreover the    charge when paying with credit cards was present both on the website and in the confirmation Both rooms were small and not very soundproof  but definitely exteremely clean  at ground floor light vibrations caused by the tube trains could be perceived  Mattresses were comfortable  and towels were changed daily  Hotel staff was always very nice and polite  Breakfast could be either English or continental  we tested and liked both options Finally the location was ideal  the nearest King s Cross tube station exit is    meters away from the hotel door  and we never felt to be unsafe  
N =>  Small Bright  We booked the Alhambra for our one night stop over before flying home  We booked it for the price and the easy access to the tube  It s extremely easy to find and we had no problem going from Waterloo Eurostar station to King s Cross with our luggage  We were very surprised as to how close it actually was to the tube station  Check in was quick and easy and we appreciated being able to check in early  We dropped our bags off quicky and hit the city for the rest of the day Room was on the small side and we had booked a room with no shower or toilet  They were very close by and we got very little noise from others in the hotel  Room had a very large window which we kept open for some venilation  The room was very  very clean  I inspected the mattress which did not appear to be old  There was no sag and everything was clean and there was a whiff of cleaner in the air  Room was a bit overstocked with furniture for its size  The bed is small though  it is a double and was placed in the corner so it can be a struggle for   people  I believe we were in room   which was up a flight of stairs  The seperate toilet and shower down the short steps were very clean and I had no issues with them  This was our first experience with this and we had no complaints Breakfast in the morning was good and service was with a smile  The only time we encountered a bit of a problem was when we asked the younger man working the desk what time Harrods closed  he replied with  quot I have no idea quot   It was  PM at the time and we didn t want to go all the way there if they were closing soon  He offered us no help at all and no suggestions  It was extremely off putting as it was the only help we had asked them for  Other than that  the older woman who was normally at the desk was always friendly and smiling to us We booked directly with the hotel via email and each email was answered quickly Would I stay here again  I would if we needed budget accomadations and if it were a short stay  I think we got our moneys worth as hotels in London are extremely expensive  We ve stayed at two budget accomadations in London now and I would take this place over the one we stayed at last year  the London Elizabeth which was awful  
N => Meeting London In my first trip to London i had the privilege to stay in Alhambra Hotel with my wife and i could t choose better  as i am from Portugal  and didn t knew the city  the location helped me a lot  it s near the Kings Cross Station and close to all tourist attractions  the english breakfeast was very nice  richer than we are used to  and other thing that i liked was that the rooms were always very clean  the staff was always very helpful and friendly  i won t hesitate to come back again  I sincerelly recommend wohever wants to visit London to stay in Alhambra Hotel Thanks for the beautiful holidays i had  
N =>   Warning  BED BUGS i don t know who is posting all the good comments about this dive but our experience was the worst ever  the room was so miserable  tiny  dark and moist  our double bed was broken  the mattress was so old it was like sleeping on a piece of cardboard but to make things even worse   we woke up in the middle of the night  after our long haul from australia  covered in red spots  all over and incredibly itchy  we switched the light on and to our horror    little black bugs scurrying everywhere on the mattress we went downstairs  no one was there  stayed around till someone arrived at    am and showed her my body covered in these red bumps  i was     covered with them  they did not want to refund our money and when we wanted to check out it was before our   day booking so we had to pay for those nights but we were not going to stay  paid it anyway and vowed to write this on tripadvisor  i am still recovering from thse spots  the tiny brown scars they left are only just going away  
N =>   Wouldn t stay here again We stayed at Alhambra Hotel based on the reviews posted on this site  We were given a room across the street at the Argyle  The room was a queen with shower and sink and there was a shared toilet outside our room  I expected basic  but not shabby  It was a dark  dank  tiny room  The linens  amp  carpet were worn and outdated  The shower was not big enough to shave in  The shared bathroom was right outside our room and we could hear everyone and everything in it  I understand budget and that is what we were looking for  but I believe you ll find something better for the same price at the travelodge or Comfort Inn  I would compare Alhambra to some of the hostels I have stayed in  It wasn t a comfortable place to come home to after a long day of sight seeing  The breakfast and breakfast room are good  As well as the location to the tube  Other than that I d pass  
N =>   Exceptionally clean We enjoyed our two night stay in this exceptionally clean B  amp  B  The breakfast was good  the service friendly and clean towels every day a bonus  Taxis were booked and arrived as we needed them  The only thing we would have liked was being able to make tea coffee in the rooms  Otherwise  highly recommended for a short stay  
N =>  Pleasant Helpful Clean Value for Money  Travelling to London for the first time alone can be a daunting experience  especialy if you are stuck with the hotel from hell  Fortunately I booked the Alhambra Hotel in St Pancras Kings Cross  A very simple booking process through their website ensured I had the room of my choice and the map directions provided with my confirmation e mail proved very handy in finding the hotel  especially as I had no previous knowledge of London streets A warm welcome and directions to my single room on the top floor led me to a tiny attic room with a wardrobe  sink      size bed  dresser  chair and tv Basic but very clean  soap and a towel were provided  but I was glad to have taken the advice of a previous reviewer and took a towel of my own as only one was provided  The bed was very comfortable but only   hangers were provided so it might be beneficial to pack some if staying for a long time Breakfast was very good  again if there is anything you don t like they will substitute it for something else  Clean  bright surroundings to eat in  which is surprising as you are in the basement  I didn t feel self conscious eating alone  although I found it was strange that they only have tables set for    if the room was busier I would have had to share a table The location was a stones throw from the tube station and easy to find  A variety of take away food outlets are in the surrounding area  but surprisingly this does not lead to a disrupted nights sleep Overall I highly recommend this hotel to anyone travelling alone or as a couple  looking for some cheap accommodation whilst staying in London who prefer to spend their money on other things when holidaying  I am planning another trip back in  and will have no hesitation in booking the Alhambra again  
N =>   Pleasant experience I have just returned from a one night stay in this hotel and I got a pleasant surprise  It was excellent value for money  The room was small but adequate with a sink  toilet and shower  The beds were clean and comfortable  It was a little noisy with the tubes at night but this was to be expected and wasn t a great problem  It has an excellent location just    mins in the underground to the centre of London and close to all major attractions The full English breakfast we got on our day of departure was fantastic it set us up for the day  We were able to leave our luggage in the hotel to collect before we left for home which was great  All in all it was a great stay and we will definately go back next time we are in London  
N =>   Just Perfect My wife and I are frequent budget travellors and we come to London often  We decided to try a different hotel in Kings Cross this ober        and opted for the Alhambra  which was cheaper than some others on the road  We went with measured expectation of our en suite double and were very pleasently surprised  The room was small but very clean  the bed was small too but very clean and the matress was obviously new The location being Kings Cross  we usually stay here  was excellent transport wise though there was a bit of construction going on  I suppose that would effect all the hotels in the area though The final thing was the breakfast  FANTASTIC  Full english and fully cooked  A perfect way to start our days of trudging around london We will defintely stay here again  
N =>   It must have been us    I booked this hotel due to the great reviews on this website  and I can see that this trend has continued  so I m thinking we must have missed something  My husband and I stayed here in y and had a very bad experience  and I must tell you that we are not high maintenance in the least  We arrived from the airport late in the evening  using the tube  which was extremely crowded making it very awkward carrying all our luggage  We emerged from the Euston station to find loud road construction all around  ratty convenience stores check cashing places  and some drunk street people mixed in with the young  tough crowd that was walking around the area  We found our way to the hotel and dragged our luggage up the stairs into the  quot lobby quot   The first sight we were greeted with was a young man in just his boxer shorts asking the front desk for an extra key to his room as his  quot mate quot  had passed out in their room  and he could not get in  The front desk man  a young  smarmy  winking fellow  checked us in  gave us our key  and pointed out the window across the street to the Argyle hotel where we would find our room  Strange to have our room be in the Argyle hotel  when we booked the Alhambra  although I can see that has happened to several other people  and it does not seem to have bothered them   We made our way over to the room  again dragging luggage up stairs  to find a tiny  drab  hot  but clean and tidy room  with a miniscule bathroom  The small shower stall had cracked tiles  stained floor  and a hair in it  We were hot and exhausted  and were so disappointed when we laid on the mattress to find it worn and uneven  We wanted to open the window to let in precious air  opening the window was a project in itself  but it did not feel safe  as the window opened right onto the street  scary  and it was noisy    the street construction continued until      in the morning  We barely slept all night between the heat  noise  and uncomfortable mattress    what a way to start our vacation  We spent the next morning hoofing around to see if there were openings at other hotels nearby  some of them cute ones that I had seen on this website     but I had booked the Alhambra instead trying to get a bargain    All were kind  and looked comfortable  but did not have sufficient vacancy for us  We finally came upon the Premier Travel Inn  which is a chain Holiday Inn type hotel  which thankfully could accommodate us  Now to deal with the front desk at Alhambra  We were treated very rudely  When we explained our situation to the owner  the matriarch of the family  I assume   she became quite angry  She agreed with us that the all night street construction was very noisy  but said it was not her fault  which we realize it wasn t  but we simply couldn t stay there and not get any sleep   When we commented on the mattress and the fact that we couldn t safely get any air  she accused us of making these things up  After asking us to step aside to talk to other customers  who spoke French  and some more argument  she did agree to cancel the rest of our reservation and not charge us  I took one of the business cards from the front desk thinking that I might send her a note of appreciation and further explanation after we got home  but she snapped at me to put it back saying something like  quot you do not like it here  why would you take a card  quot   and kept saying it over and over  Very strange and unnerving  We were glad to leave there and go to the comfortable and friendly Premier Travel Inn  even if it did cost more  Unfortunately  we were exhausted for our first day of sightseeing in London I must admit we did go down for breakfast at the Alhambra before we checked out  and it was hot and tasty  We felt we deserved it after the night we had  
N =>  too much noise and no sound insulation The rooms were clean and the breakfasts substantial  Access to the tube was brilliant  as was access to the best south indian restaurant in London   Chutneys   in Drummond StreetBUT We stayed   nights and got hardly any sleep at all  The fire doors banged really loud each time they closed  which was often  and because there was only  plywood  between the rooms we could have taken part in the conversations of the men in the next room   and the conversations lasted all night  Between floors was no better  a chap on the floor above coughed constantly all night Perhaps we were unlucky  but just in case     take some ear plugs Also  there was a surcharge for using a credit card  which we were t told about when we booked 
N =>  Nightmarish    We    people  had planned to stay in London for   nights and we booked a room there having read the encouraging reviews above  I must say we went all the way from Liverpool  where the hotel was perfect  and as soon as we got there it was    nightmarish We had booked a  quot superior double quot  room  What would a  quot standard quot  room have looked like    There was just enough room for the bed  supposed to welcome   people  good joke   two little furnitures for the clothes  a washstand and a tiny shower  with toilets outside   I didn t have room to put my suitcase  Plus a few webs on the ceiling  plus the light and the TV not working    Also the room was across the street  so we had to get out and go downstairs for the breakfast On top of that  parking the car was impossible   not free of course but you have to move it after   hours of time  The only solution we had to avoid the congestion tax was to park the car behind King Cross  Station      for one day and a half    Not forgetting a noisy building and area  I think the price of     a night   breakfast included   is VERY expensive    
N =>  Moved us to a different location We were booked to stay in the Alhambra  but  when we arrived were sent across the street to the Argyle  It was a much smaller room than pictured in the advertisements  Shower was small  We stayed in a twin ensuite  but we could not both be be up  walking around at the same time  It was VERY clean  and the staff was helpful  Wireless worked great  Breakfast was a trek back across the street to the Alhambra  and downstairs  However  it was worth the walk  as it was a good meal  This is a good hotel for the price  It is very convenient to Kings Cross stations  both   and the front door is within a block of the bus stop  It is not aircoditioned  which under normal London circumstances would not be a problem  However  we were there for three days of over    degree weather  Got rather uncomfortable by the third night  
N => Great Budget Hotel This hotel was not the easiest to find  but maybe it was the jet lag  It was a few streets from the St Pancras King s Cross tube station  There were lots of tourists in the area  and a few small hotels The breakfast was great   fried tomato  eggs  beans  bacon  toast and or cereal or oatmeal The staff was extremely friendly and they accomodated us to the fullest  When we first got there  the room smelled like paint thinner  We went down to tell the front desk right away and they told us we could switch rooms if we wanted to  but they had just cleaned the washroom  We chose to wait the smell out and went out to explore while the room was airing out  It was extremely clean  The space of the room itself was limited but sufficient for the budget traveller  There was a closet wardrobe  the sink was in the main part of the room  Our shower didnt have the best pressure  but I must say here we are very picky shower people  so for most  it would probably be more than sufficient  There was no handheld  We told the staff about the lack of pressure and the maintenance man actually came up with us and fixed the pressure for us  apparently there was a small leak in the plumbing Overall this hotel was great  staff was great  breakfast was great and it was in a very handy area for seeing london  
N =>   Terrific  I can t say enough about this hotel  The staff was wonderful  The rooms were very clean and the breakfast was great  For an inexpensive hotel this place was amazing  Great location and everything you need  I would recommend this to anyone  You won t be dissapointed  There are a lot of hotels on this little road  however this by far was one of the nicest  we were supposed to stay at one down the street and came to find that it was extremely scary    the Alhambra was welcoming    and a sigh of relief  
N =>  Brilliant Breakfast We chose to stay at the Alhambra for   nights recently on a UK European holiday  The room was small  without ensuite  but there were two showers and two toilets just outside in the hallway  We never once had to wait to use the bathroom The staff were very friendly and the cooked breakfast was the best we ve had in a B amp B in London  The location was great  walking distance from Kings Cross  even with heavy bags   The place was spotlessly clean We would certainly stay there again  
N =>  Nice Budget Hotel I booked this hotel after reading the reviews  I wasn t disappointed  It is a good inexpensive  friendly  clean hotel  I booked a single room and was given a double  The breakfast was cooked to order  I asked for no beans  I don t like them   and was given an additional egg  It was too hot to eat immediately  I could have had more  hot  toast if I had wanted too  I booked a shared facilities room and this isn t always ideal  The only improvement I would make to this hotel would be for it to have all ensuite rooms  but I expect this would make a stay at the lovely Alhambra Hotel more expensive  I have to go to London again soon and have booked a room here  
N =>  Ok but would probably go elsewhere This place is cheap and good value  the rooms were clean and they offer a good breakfast  My room was extremely small even for London standards and the room was quite noisy from other rooms and a nearby bathroom  It was ok but I think there are better places to stay 
N => Enjoyed the Alhambra Stayed at the Alhambra at the end of ember  Staff was very friendly and accommodating  We arrived early in the morning and were allowed to leave our bags until our room was ready  Our en suite double room was across the street from the main hotel  Our room was on the first floor facing the street  but we still found it to be quiet and never had any problems sleeping through the night The free wireless internet was very convenient as well  
N =>  Small but immaculate Stayed for two nights   Miguel the Night Manager was extremely helpful  even giving us a rundown on where to go in Portugal  tho  we ended up going to Turkey   maybe to your home country next time  Miguel   I d read about the size of the rooms before booking  so was not expecting anything but a small room  Not  quot disappointed quot  as it was indeed compact  actually a little larger than I d imagined   I thought I d be able to lay on the bed and touch the walls either side simultaneously  but couldn t    However  as we were out travelling all day it served its purpose as a place to sleep  comfortable bed  too   I WAS pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness and decor  which were both outstanding  Yes  the bathroom was also  quot compact quot  and we had to go  quot next door quot  to the toilet but this was only a minor inconvenience  pardon the pun   Hearty breakfast served in a delightful dining room   great way to start the day Overall great value for a superb location   so close to Kings Cross station and to the Thameslink to Gatwick  couldn t have been better P S  If the Alhambra happens to be booked out  as it deserves to be    then try The Apollo Hotel just up the road     Argyle St         marginally more expensive  GBP     but rooms are a bit larger and the hosts are tremendous  as is the breakfast  too    
N =>  Good value This hotel was good value  We had a triple with shower and toilet  It was a bit on the small side  but OK  No fridge or tea coffee facilities  but the breakfast was excellent  We stayed in the annex across the road  which appears to be a good option  We found it better than subsequent London hotels  Definitely worth a try  I would go back  
N =>  We will strongly recommend the hotel to our friends We   two Norwegian couples   spent five nights at Alhambra in the end of ember  At the web  we had discovered this affordable and central hotel  where guests described the hotel in very favourable words  We were certainly not disappointed  The rooms are clean  the staff friendly and helpful  and although it is located very close to a centre of communication  Kings Cross   it is not noisy at all  We will strongly recommend the hotel to all our friends who are going to visit London  
N => A good choice  
N =>   Very clean nice   but also not too cooperative  
N => Nice enough but nothing special  
N =>  cerca estaci n de tren y metro  
N =>  Pas de surprise pour nous   
N =>   ottimo Low Cost Hotel  
N =>   Horrible pas propre et pas insonoris   
N =>   Buon Hotel in posizione strategica  
N =>   Appalling We were promised a luxury apartment  it was filthy with chipped doors and furniture  dirty carpets greying towels and threadbare bedding  The bathroom was caked in limescale and the kitchen table was a piece of chipped formica with the edging strip missing and folding garden chairs  We had asked them to dismantle the bunk beds before our arrival so our twins could sleep in single beds thhis was not done and the receptionist who was going off duty showed no interest in helping us  The  rd bedroom fitted in the beds and no more there wasn t even room for the children to sleep on the floor There is NOTHING luxurious about Allen House and to say so is at best optimistic and at worst fraudulent  We had to pay   weeks in advance and I can see why  if we d had to pay on leaving we would not have stayed  it was the worst room I have ever stayed in anywhere  and had no redeeming features whatsoever  
N =>   well located excellent management I needed an apartment for our first days in London due to traveling with a family of five  but was skeptical of those companies who wanted all of our payment upfront  So  I found this apartment via London friends  They wanted a deposit but then accepted payment upon arrival  The apt was in an excellent location off of Kensington High street  very close to Tube  great restaurants and shopping  Managment was very attentive to any needs we had and was very prompt in responding to a plumbing crisis while we were there  The apt itself was clean  somewhat dated in furniture and TV  but ample room sizes  Kitchen fully equiped  including laundry facilities  For a family  this really was a perfect situation in terms of room size  location  and excellent management  Even though the furniture  etc was somewhat dated  we hardly spent time there anyway   Beds were totally comfortable and baths included heated towel racks  The benefits outweighed the lack of posh appearance   
N =>   Not as Expected I hate to write a negative review as the office staff were really very friendly and did what they could to make our stay comfortable We went to a lot of trouble looking into our accommodation options prior to our stay in London as the standard was very important to us We even went as far as to have a local friend view a couple of apartments at Allen House and elsewhere Here is the catch   she viewed a   bedroom  renovated apartment  We booked a three bedroom apartment  unaware of the fact that some remained unrenovated The postives   The location is fabulous  The apartment itself is spacious  apart from the  rd bedroom which literally fits a bunk bed with no room to move   Having a washer and dryer The negatives  as the apartment was unrenovated the carpet was soiled  the apartment was generally dingy and the bedding  towels had seen better days  It made us feel quite uncomfortable for the duration of our stay  Don t get excited about the third bedroom if your children are older than   As they were fully booked we could not change apartments and were offered a small discount   which was generous as we had no option to cancel I think I may have been a little optimistic about what you can get for your money in y in London Just a warning to ask ALL the necessary questions before you go  
N =>   Very Small Rooms Fairly conveniently placed for underground connections to most of tourist attractions  Check in was friendly and efficient and reception staff generally pleasant and helpful  Similarly  waiting staff in the Breakfast Room were hard working and attentive  All very positive so far  Unfortunately the rooms are very small  and I do mean small  In our room there was a king sized bed which left little room for anything else  not even a chair  If you wanted to sit down  there was only the bed  The bathroom was also very small  There was a TV in the room but reception was so poor as to make it unusable  The walls between rooms were paper thin or appeared to be as we could hear the conversation quite clearly from the room next us  The hotel was spotlessly clean overall and we had no complaints on that score Breakfast was more than adequate with a reasonable range of dishes  The published  quot rack rate quot  was      for a double and I don t believe it is value for money at that level I have stayed in much worse hotels but none with smaller rooms even in Tokyo  
N =>  dont stay there  the hotel was a big disappointment  i greatly regretted staying there  the room was in a bad state  it was freezing cold but they would not turn on central heating till november  there was a breeze coming in through the window  it was like camping in a small room  thank god they gave me a wool blanket so i wouldnt be as cold  unfriendly  quot room service quot  if you want to call it that  rusty bathroom  no food or snacks available  only breakfast for   pound which is a ridiculous price for some toast and orange cordial  i would never go back there  sorry  
N =>   Clean central accessible close to a good selection of restaurants  Helpful staff  clean with comfortable room bathroom  Shower temperature stable with power  towels adequate with shower shampoo sachets  amp  soap provided  Tea  Coffee  Sugar  amp  milk tubes  sometimes a challenge to open  gave refreshment  TV channels provided the basic   with reliability Noisy guests returning later in the evening posed an irritation but it was momentary Air Conditioning was provided  amp  both silent  amp  operationalDuring our last visit the lift was being maintained  amp  therefore out of use   we were in the basement with only one flight of stairs to negotiate Breakfast was simple but enjoyable   we kept to the basic  Continental  option with a more than adequate supply of croissants  butter  jam  marmalade  cereal options  milk  coffee  tea  orange juice etc    you can inexpensively upgrade to  Full English  if you wish The Bar was well provisioned  a discount voucher provided for your first round  spending over    gained    minutes use of the hotels computer network Staff were friendly  amp  helpful  room service left our room re provisioned  amp  neat  amp  tidy All in all this is the  th time I have used this hotel   it provides a reliable  clean  amp  easily accessible hub for Earls Court  amp  surrounds 
N =>  Room was rundown and unclean  Insufficient bedding to keep warm  No heating in room and room was cold  Light bulb not working  Bedding stained Room poorly cleaned  Insufficient bedding to keep warm  Breakfast was very poor quality and very limited choice  Don t stay unless you are desparate  
N =>   Not as bad as expected After reading the reviews here I thought I was going to spend four nights in a dump  It was really not that bad   The single room I was staying in and the doubleroom my friends were staying in were tiny  but all you do is sleep there so it doesn t matter  The room was clean  which is the most important thing  The location was super  only a five minute walk from Gloucester road underground station It is definitely not the best hotel I have stayed at but it is not the worst either  I don t think I would recommend it to a friend  but I would tell my friend it is not as bad as the Trip Advisor reviews makes it sound like  
N =>  STAY AWAY Okay I got to this hotel   hours before check in so I left my baggage with them in their security room  Thing about it though  it s not locked  anyone can go in there  Anyways I checked in and I went to my room  The hallways were very small and I had to go through a fire door to get to my room which was not very convenient with all my luggage  I then go into my room and first thing I notice was the size  Very small barely any room to walk  Supposed to get   double beds instead got   single cots pushed together  The  quot colour quot  television only had   channels which only   had actual colour  Bathroom was not bad despite a hair I found but very small  At night it sounded like i was sleeping in the hallway  I could hear every door shut and close and I could hear people talking  showering and even brushing their teeth  Also our phone didn t work and it was very fixed  No fridge  microwave nothing  The customer service was horrible because I always got stuck with the same guy who was no help at all  Finally I got a room switch  The room was bigger  had bigger beds  bigger windows but it still wasn t great  The shower curtains didn t close all the way so water would go all over the place  Not to mention when I originally went to the room there were guys in it fixing it  The location isn t bad because it has very good restaurants around it plus an internet cafe which was excellent and had dirt cheap phone calls to Canada    pence a minute   Luckily there was a tube station   or so blocks down  The internet at the hotel was    pounds for    hours and not to mention anyone could access it unless your on your laptop  I got a late checkout because of the time of my flight  I had  pm as a checkout time but at     pm I was rudely interrupted by room service complaining they had to go home at    Not my fault  The man at the front desk actually called my house in Canada telling me if I wasn t out of there he was going to charge me     pounds Bad stay  Don t go there  
N =>   Terrible experience Really terrible  We had all the  quot adventures quot  possible    A screaming client during the night  and the staff haven t made much to help     hour locked in the elevator  that was broken before   a bug in the room  the window didn t opened weel  it was blocked   the room was very hot  the shower didn t worked well  the door was jammed  so we needed to pull and push very hard  the TV wasn t working well  the water heather wasn t working at all  the service was poor     anyway  if you have a choice  don t go there     
N =>   Very Accomadating I found this hotel to be an excellent place for the money spent  The room was clean and had a beautiful view of the church across the street  Very close to the tube and supermarkets  The staff was very accomadating since I travelled with an    month old  They checked us in  hrs early so we had a place for her to sleep  warmed her food daily as well as provided us with a mini cooler fridge in our room to put her food in  I would definately stay there again  
N =>   The WORST hotel I ve ever stayed in    Oh boy  where to start   This piece of      hotel should be condemned and closed down  Never  ever have I ever had such an awful experience at a hotel  I was there with my    year old son and if this hotel hadn t already been paid for through my vacation package  I would of checked out immediately after seeing our  quot double room quot  which consisted of two twin cots pushed together without enough space to make them seperate beds  I was with my    year old son for goodness sake  I tried calling down to the front desk only to find out that our phone didn t work  I went down to the front desk to ask for a larger room with beds that didn t physically touch and also had a working phone only to be told that they were fully booked and I would have to wait until the next day During this time  there was a problem with part of my vacation and I NEEDED a telephone  Since the phone in our room wasn t working  I asked if they could dial a local number for me from the house phone in the lobby  Nooooo  that phone only RECEIVES calls  So I asked where a payphone was only to be dismissed with a wave of a hand  I asked for change for the payphone   NOOOOOO they can t provide change for the payphone either  Finally  in tears from frustration  I demanded to know where exactly the payphone was and was given the answer of  quot on Cromwell Road quot   Beautiful Reluctantly somebody finally dialled the number I needed  on the house phone that only RECEIVES calls  and I was able to make my call The next day  I came down and asked if they had another room ready for me  Nope Needless to say  it took   days before they changed our room  It was slightly larger  and at least there was some space between the beds  However  there was a massive ball of thread or yarn or something in the corner of the room when we checked in  Not a big deal but I decided to leave it there to see how long before it was noticed or cleaned up  Needless to say  it was still there when we checked out  Housekeeping consisted of them coming in and making the beds and folding the towels  Not once was anything actually CLEANED I wouldn t stay in this      again if you paid me  The front desk guy is the rudest  meanest       I ve ever met I requested a late checkout til   pm and they told me no problem  Just call down in the morning to remind us  I said okay  I called in the a m  to remind them of the arrangement I had made the night before for a checkout of   p m   quot No problem quot  I was told  So the day of checkout  my son and I are out and about doing our last minute London things  We get back to the hotel at      to a yelling front desk clerk  He said he s been trying to call my room and there has been no answer  No      sherlock  we re just getting back  He is absolutely livid that I was supposed to be gone at    and I m still there and if I don t check out they are charging me     pounds  I told him I had an arrangement  with him of all fricking people  to check out late  Anyway  he rants and raves for awhile  I go upstairs to finish packing and now it s housekeeping banging on my door telling me to get out  OMFG    These people are whacked    So I finally get everything packed and we re downstairs in the lobby by       Mr  Personality at the front desk is still ranting and raving  I told him that obviously there was a miscommunication and that I was out in plenty of time for housekeeping to  quot clean quot  the room  He did not charge me     pounds  but even if he did  I would have disputed the transaction with my credit card company  And get this  I get back home to Canada the next day and there is a message on my answering machine from the nutjob at the front desk telling me if I m not out of the hotel by   pm they are charging me     pounds  Now seriously  what are the fricking chances that I m actually going to receive a message left for me in Canada when I m in LONDON   I would never  ever  in a million years recommend this hotel to anybody  not even my worst enemy Stay away families  stay away couples  stay away elderly travellers  stay away students  stay away anybody from anywhere    
N =>   Awful awful place worst hotel ever stayed in  Booked this a week before our visit through lastminute com  Hotel website describes refurbished rooms and believe me  they must have had a very good photographer to make the place look something it isn t  We arrived after lunch and they hadn t allocated us a room  They then tried to put us in a twin despite having a print out that confirmed we had booked a double  They placed us in a corner room on the  th floor which according to the receptionist was a  quot lovely nice room quot   It was absolutely boiling hot  with no aircon and only one of the two windows opened  The room was an absolute disgrace  it s only saving grace was the clean bathroom  They had pushed together two single beds  and there was a gap of about one and a half feet to squeeze round the bed  The sheets were clean  just  but the scabby old blanket on the bed left a lot to be desired  To say I was quite possibley scared of touching said blanket is an understatement It is quite obvious  unless the other rooms are as bad  that they have kept a few un refurbished rooms for lastminute com customers who aren t paying  quot full whack quot   We didn t even bother with breakfast  I would not recommend this hotel to anyone  unless you really don t care about where you stay and only want a roof over your head for the night  
N =>   Great location for Earl s Court   very basic I stayed here with a friend when we visited London to go to the Brits in Earls Court  The hotel was ideally placed for this  and was close to the bars in Earl s Court  Our room was booked a day or so before we were travelling  and was quite inexpensive at about     per person  We had a twin room but it was very small  with the beds close up next to one another  and very little space  Ensuite bathroom was tiny but fit for purpose  Only real complaint would be that the room was boiling hot  and there were no windows which could be opened  English Breakfast was included but this was very basic and wasn t to our taste   we headed for a local coffee shop instead  All in all cheap and cheerful  but great location  
N =>   Looks better from the outside  Had the mis fortune to stay at the Ambassadors for   night on Tuesday   th il  booking through Lastminute com   The room we stayed in was very small  run down and dirty  The bed linen appeared to be old and dirty and needed to be thrown away rather than changed  The bathroom was extremely dirty with paint peeling off the walls and dirt and rust hanging off the radiator The cooked breakfast was thrown at us and was poor quality although there was plenty of toast and croissants to fill up on This stay cost        for   people so for London it was quite cheap but I certainly wouldn t want to stay more than   night  We definitely won t be staying here again  
N =>   Blood stained pillow dirty sheets rudest manager in the UK  Where do I begin    I booked the hotel on a  quot special offer quot  at     for a nights stay  Alledgedly this was a huge price reduction  Upon arrival we were given a key to a room in the basement  After eventually locating the room through a maze of dingy corridors we found the room  I say room  but cell would be a more accurate description  It was dark  tiny  very shabby and had bars all over the window  Hate at first sight  We went back to the reception  and complained  The man at the desk said people often complained about those rooms  could not give us a refund as the manager was unavailable and offered us an alternative on the third floor  The room again was very shabby  boiling hot  very small  the shower was clearly bodged as was a array of grotty pipes in a bathroom that you couldn t move in if the door was open  Reluctently after a long day travelling  we accepted the room as we were only going to suffer it for one night  After returning to the room post dinner in a local restaurant  we got back and decided to watch the tv to distract ourselves from the grimness of the room  We could get poor reception on only two channels on a tiny old portable tv  so gave up and decided to get some sleep  Bad move  I pulled back the first thin quilt to reveal it s underside was obviously unwashed for some time  underneath it was something that resembled an old  quot velvet effect quot  curtain with some burn holes in it  Under that was a very thin sheet on a very cheap  lumpy mattress  But the worst wasstill to come    One pillow had a turin shrine like image of someone elses make up  another  had a deep  large blood stain the size of a fist on the actual pillow  Now exhausted and extremely fed up  we threw the revolting articles on the floor  and resolved to complain in the morning  We woke up and got out as soon as possible to see someone to complain  The receptionist got a duty manager  who spoke to presumably a cleaning supervisor who went and checked our bedding  Obviously embarassed and not too surprised by our circumstance  they went to see the hotel manger  whho was desperately trying to avoid us in his office  We were offered     back  Understandably unimpressed  we asked again to speak to the actual manger  This time he stormed from his office  told us we were only able to have the     off and what did we expect for what we d paid  I pointed out his customer service skills were as acceptable as a blood soaked pillow  at which point he shrugged and pointed out it had a pillow case on it so it wasn t bad at all  Not once did he apologise  in fact if anything he was busy trying to be intimidating and arrogant  We gave up and left  promising to seek compensation another way  So in short  don t book here  By the looks of other reviews we re not alone    stars is a joke of a rating for this hell hole  
N =>   Much better than expected I have recently read most of the reviews of the Ambassadors Hotel and my expectations were very low after that  However when we arrived it turned out to be really very good  It was clean  the service friendly  the breakfast  cooked  good  I agree that the rooms are a bit on the small side but on the other hand  the bed was enormous  No mould or dirt as described in other reviews  The rooms were made up very nicely every day  We all agreed  we would certainly come back another time 
N =>  Terrible Service mouldy walls insects  Where do I start   My Mum had booked a triple room   weeks before arrival on rooms com and we arrived with the confirmation sheet that the room was booked and paid for  We were told there was no such booking  We waited close to an hour before it was sorted  We were offered   single rooms which we did not want  We were not even offered a cup of tea while we waited  Eventually got the room which meant some other visitors would have the same hassle later that evening  The receptionist had not got a clue and never once apologised for the mix up the room was tiny and the walls had mould on them  I am not fussy but when my mother woke up with insect bites  i was disgusted we decided to just try and enjoy our weekend away anyway Breakfast conisted of   choices of ceraels  bread rolls  not croissants  and tea coffee   all of which we had to get ourselves through the crowded room when we were checking out  we were told that their was a phone call at  am that morning from someone    We asked who called and were told  I forgot to write his name down   We were told that they had tried to put the call through which I dont believe for a second as we were awake at the time Checking out  there was no thank you and no apology for the mix up  This kind of  hotel   should be closed down as it gives foreign tourists a bad impression of London  
N =>   Inexpensiveno frills hotel  Excellent location for price  Firstly  I would say that the reviews that I read before my boyfriend and I went away did worry me but I thought I would give it the benefit of the doubt However  I think most of the reviews are exaggerated and people obviously didn t realise a    hotel in the centre of London would be the standard of the Ritz clearly not done their research if you ask me     When we arrived we did have to wait in reception in order to check in and get our key card as the reception area did seem to be under staffed  Not the warmest of welcomes to be honest We were allocated a room on the  rd floor  yes the room was small but it was clean and to be honest we were more interested in seeing the sites of London than lounging about the hotel room  The shower was super and the bed was comfy what more do you need There wasn t too much wardrobe space as we were there for   nights but it was ok The breakfast was a full english not worth       I must add but nevertheless it set us up for the day  There could have been more of a selection on the continental side  We had paid for breakfast anyway but some people would pay that price One thing I would say is that there is not a lock on the door of the luggage room were we left our bags on our last day  Anyone could have said they stayed at the hotel and went and took someone s luggage  Our purpose was to see the sites of London over Valentines long weekend we had a fabulous time and the hotel was overall a great base for seeing the city  If you read this and are after a cheap and cheerful hotel in the centre of London then this hotel is ideal  
N =>   Disgusting  I can honestly say this hotel is THE worst hotel I have ever stayed in  I went away  for one night  with a friend and couldn t have been more disgusted  The first room we were put in didn t even have enough space to walk straight forward  This was supposedly a twin  which to my understanding is two single beds  Instead it was two beds joined together  Mould was growing from the walls and the skirting boards were rotting  which affected my asthma  We went to reception and the receptionists looked worried but agreed to move us to another room  This was a triple  and had no heating apart from one small electric heater which took nearly an hour to heat up  We could have dealt with this if it wasn t for the shower also not working  only cold water would come out of the taps   Again  we got moved to another room  this time on the fifth floor  which was the worst of the lot  There was mould growing from the ceiling  tiles coming away from the bathroom floor  blood on the bedsheets  womens hair on the towels and beds  this can t be ours as i have short hair and my friend has blonde hair whereas this is long black hair   My friend and I couldn t be doing with another argument with the very rude management so decided to put up with the room as it was only for one night  only to find that after Id showered  the bathroom floor was flooded in about an inch of water  ruining my clothes  which i hadn t expected to be in danger when i left on the floor     When we went downstairs to speak to management  we were told that there was only one member of staff until nine the next morning  who was a newly trained  obviously very nervous reception who ddn t speak the best english  We cleared the water up best we could with the few handtowels we were given and wentt out  In the morning we had out  quot full quot  english breakfast which consisted of  on my plate    bacon    sausage    hash brown    quarter tomato and on my friends plate    bacon    button mushrooms  a tiny slice of tomato and   hash brown  Although our breakfast was included in the package  some people would ve paid       for this  Before we had a chance to even eat the little we had  I found a hair on my sausage and it was pink in the middle so we left  hungry  The waiting staff were also extremely rude and made both my friend and I feel extremely uncomfortable  by speaking not to our eyes  but to our chests   amp  we were still in our baggy pyjamas  not sat there in our underwear   Management had not arrived at nine  as we were told but we had to wait til we collected our luggage  from the unlocked  unguarded cupboard   when we finnally got to speak to someone  The way I was spoken to was nothing less than disgusting  I was spoken to as if I was    and accused of leaving the quite obviously old blood on the sheets and putting my hair on the towels and sheets  Obviously I did this before I even checked in   Overall  this hotel is the most repulsive place I have ever spent the night  And my standards are not high   
N =>  Clean but tiny room and extremely hot in there  Down to London for four nights with my job  I choose this hotel because it was working within a budget and it was a sensible distance  via the Piccadilly Tube  to my place of work  Checked in   fine  and I found the staff to be friendly and polite at all times  Got to my room   opened the door   this was the tiniest bedroom I have ever been in  Very clean   but just a tad too small to be considered cosy  During my stay the room was made up as one would expect   with nice new clean towels  etc  no problems there  Unfortunately the central heating in my room was on full blast at all times  all through the night  The large window had a chain on it restricting the opening somewhat  It was like a bloodly Turkish bath in there  I reported this after the first night  but it was nt corrected by the time I came to check out  days later  Continental breakfast was provided    but unfortunaley the staff there did nt seem to be able to toast   slices of bread  Pity   might have been prepared to put up without the toast but the sauna conditions have meant I will be staying elsewhere in future  
N =>  Terrible terrible terrible We booked through  quot Superbreaks quot  for   days in London to celebrate the   st birthday of my daughter and have never ever been so disappointed with a hotel anywhere in the world We had been  quot upgraded to the suite quot  which was in the basement looking out onto a small terrace covered in rubbish including a used condom  The double glazed units around the terrace did not fit properly and there was a constant draght  On the first morning we had an electrical problem which meant no power to the suite for over an hour  We then found that the shower wouldn t drain and the bath taps did not work  Additionally there was no heating in the room apart from two oil filled electric radiators and one broken a c unit The  quot full english quot  breakfast food was lukewarm at best with a very poor buffet selection of cooked items On our second morning the toilet blocked and overflowed and filth started coming up through the bath plughole when the shower cubicle was used The management seemed totally disinterested in any of the problems  Just dreadful  
N =>   Filthy Hovel  Absolutely filthy  grotty hovel We work away from home at least   months a year  and this is one of the worst hotels we have stayed in for a long time  We arrived around midnight  complete with booking number  They could not find the reservation  and hence the payment made by our company  After paying again we went to the smallest  dirtiest room I have seen  Towels were dirty from the last occupant  bedclothes were just as bad  Glad we only had   nights there  Didn t try the food   didn t want to take the risk NEVER AGAIN  
N =>  Absolute Crap I wish I d known about this website before we booked Wanting to spend a few days in London  we opted to go for a   Star Hotel and not go for our usual Holiday Inn weekend break  On arrival the place looked disappointing  We checked in and made our way to the lift  It was tiny  It smelled  was covered in graffiti and it was obvious someone had been smoking in there   And this is coming from someone who smokes   The corridors were tiny and on opening the door to our room  the look on my boyfriends face said it all  I took one look at the room and burst into tears  The  quot art work quot  on the wall was a map of the London Underground   need I say more The carpet was ripped  the bedside lamp was broken and hanging off its fitting  The bathroom   covered in mould  It was hideous When I told reception it that there was no way this was acceptable  he seemed to be suprised  We were shown another room and again  the bathroom was hideous  We decided that there was no way we could stay in the hotel but nor did we have the time or energy to look for another one after a long day travelling  We were then given a twin room  Again the bathroom was hideous  There was a huge crack in the sink and had simply just been filled in with super glue  Our travel agents were a problem  as they really didnt care how bad it was or offer to help move us  After  quot settling quot  for the twin room  realizing it was only for one night  we took a trip down the road to Holiday Inn and ended up staying there afterall  The consierge who helped us out was worth the extra money we had to pay All in all  AVOID this hotel at all costs  the staff really didn t care how upset we  weren t helpful and looked at us like we were mad when we told them about the problems with the room and the management were not available to speak to    Stars    STARS  YEAH RIGHT  IF ANYONE WOULD LIKE TO SEE PICTURES OF THE  quot DELIGHTFUL quot  ROOMS THE AMBASSADORS HOTEL OFFERED US  INCASE YOU THINK I M BLOWING THIS OUT OF PROPORTION   I AM MORE THAN WILLING TO E MAIL PICTURES  D   
N =>  DISASTER    there is absolutely no atmosphere in the hotel alcohol is also not served and the people prefer to just stare at you than serve you  i booked a twin room and was given a tiny double  eventually was moved to a twin which was extremely tiny your arms out stretched reached     of the way across the room the bathroom was even smaller and was nearly impossible to shut the door when inside  there was ripped carpet and the mattress  were broken  there was no a c either and the rooms were boiling  it was too noisey to even open a window when leaving the hotel a man asked what room we were in and that he was on that floor the week before and had a similar problem The hotel is not deserving of a  star and it is far from it  
N =>  Worst Hotel I Have Been In My Life I travel an average of   weeks a month  and this is without doubt the worst hotel I have ever been in  The whole experience with this Hotel was an absolute nightmare  We stayed for   days in this hotel  the rooms were smaller than a prison cell  Our door wouldn t open and was not fixed during our stay  Every time we wanted to get into our room  we had to be scorted by someone in reception with a masterkey  the Hotel was fully booked and we didn t get an alternative room  We complained to general management  but obtained no response at all 
N =>  Do Not stay here  I booked this mistakenly thinking it was part of the same organisation as the Ambassador s  in Bloomsbury  where I have stayed  amp  it was lovely  After my first night I asked to be moved as the shower did not drain properly so one had to shower in  stages    also the shower stall absolutely tiny  amp  water ended up on the floor  TV did not work in first room  it did in second room  but standard   channels only  I ate breakfast the first morning but not again   watered down fruit juice  amp  average food  I have stayed in much nicer hotels for the same price      night   Location is good  but that s about it   the staff  I must say  were charming  amp  helpful  although I did not have many dealings with them  Furniture is very poor standard  both rooms I occupied were noisy  The second room was a double  allegedly  although the only way one could use the desk dressing table was to sit on the end of the bed   no space for a chair  I filled in a feedback form but have yet to hear from them  
N =>   Disaster   Long story short  Arrived hotel      pm  late check in went fine  Woke next morning and noticed an old used condom hanging from the in room hairdryer    Politely notified reception on way out  afternoon  asked  room  b cleaned  Came bak  find room clean and my cash  roughly       stolen from safe we d  admittedly  stupidly    left ajar   Notified reception after tearing room apart  b sure it was gone  the response being a flat  quot   its nothing  do wit d hotel  u need  contact police quot   No offer of using recepion fone or help finding police station number  She simply ignored us  Most staff we came in contact with from then on pretty much avoided us  No member of management  after many requests  would speak to us face face   d record  d officers said dare was every indication it was a member of staff since dare wasn t forced entry  Only saving grace was a very empathetic   sumthing man on reception who was friendly thru out  Location was convenient  
N =>  Absolutely horrible       This was without a doubt the worst experience I have ever had at a hotel  This double booked my room and told me that they would find me a room at one of their partner hotels  They assured me that there would be rooms available at the other hotel  There were not any rooms available  After waiting almost   hours  they finally found me a room at the Best Western They told me that since I only gave a credit card number to hold the room  it only guarantees that I will have a room  Perhaps they need to look up the definition of the word guarantee  To all those looking for a room in London  please book it anywhere BUT the Ambassadors Hotel  From other reviews I have read  it seems like double booking is a common occurance there  The staff was rude and very unhelpful  
N =>   Poor staff    tatty  apperance The hotel is situated close to the tube at Glouster Road approx   min  walk When checking in the staff on duty appeared to have trouble understanding me as their English was not good enough  he appeared to have trouble locating our room   I expected a problem because our party had three rooms booked via two agents under the same name   this shouldn t really cause a problem  We were sent to a  suite  in the basement which was not a suite  but was in the basement  The room was cold  the ceiling was low  i am     quot  so not a freak   the wardrobe door was hanging off  the paint was peeling from the ceiling in the bathroom  the bath did not run  the shower did not drain very quickly  and there was no view of London from the basement  I was running the London athon on the Sunday morning and had requested the facility of an early breakfast on the day of the run as offered by lots of London hotels   this request was met by staff who did not appear interested  They stood around with hands in pockets shrugging shoulders   I heard one staff member say to another guest who was double booked  quot you have to help me out here quot     The bed was uncomfortable  and the general cleanliness was poor   we found a dead cockroach in the bathroom upon arrival The breakfast I did have after night   was good  and there were plenty of staff  I was also suprised by the amount of guests who had stayed in the hotel  and wondered if they thought it was acceptable or not  As we waited to check out there were still un happy guests and potential guests complaining about various problems and being met by indifferent staff who didn t want to help  So much for service This hotel is poor  I am aware it is only  star but the basics were missing   it is more like a hostel and if you want a hotel   then book somewhere different  if you just want a  tatty  room stay here  
N =>  Great Breakfast included in price I And three other friends stayed at the Ambassadors hotel  The biggest problem was that my room had been shorted by about a foot with a build to the wall headboard and My friend and i were sharing and repeatly stubbed our toes from the first bed  But to be fair the housekeeping was first rate  Every day the beds were made and the room was clean  But by far was the breakfast that was included in our price  Fruit  Breads  Cereal  Cheese  Preserve  Yougurts  Tea Coffee Hot Chocolate  amp  Hot Milk which were restocked quickly and repeatly  The dining area was clean 
N =>   great location nightmare time  They distroyed our trip turned out ok   In ember my boyf and i booked this hotel online as it seemed convinient to our plans in London We had a theatre   dinner ticket for   o clock and arrived at the hotel at      only to be told they were double booked  with this we were told nothing else except we were off to a Travel lodge in Battersea  obviously not knowing London well i was asking location and trasport and they gave me nothing  also the girl was extremley rude and obnoxiousAfter alot of upset as it was now     we were told we would have a taxi to Battersea and not to worry  I called someone who lives in London whom told me i could only get a train or bus as there is no tube stop and Battersea is over the river  not far but very incovinient  The manager could see i was distressed and offered to send a taxi to take us to covent garden at      so we reached Battersea at      with no time to change  after a long day urgh     The travel lodge was next to NOWHERE  and a scruffy one at that and more in Clapham i think  than Battersea  the taxi wouldnt wait as another had been booked and we rushed to get changed in   mins thinking we mayas well Several times we called the hotel and the taxi had not arrived  amongs a comedy of errors   finally at     it got there  we had to phone the restaurant who were understanding  we got there     and had to explain that we needed to be seated at     in the theatre    mins away  They were really good and got our food quickly  but the whole night and the whole point of visiting London was ruined for us both  Not to mention after the show we had to have a drink in CG when the plan was to get the tube back to gloucster road where we had already cased bars out by the hotel  as there was NOTHING by our travelodge   we then had to get back to battersea and as we had no idea where we were in comparison to buses and trains  as hotel didnt know and we had no time  it cost us      And the taxi driver deducted    as he felt sorry for us  to get back  which was money we didnt need to spend if we were at GR anyway after all the waste of time  shows is good by the way  and alot of complaining the hotel manager agreed to refund us and offered a free nights stay    with that she was really helpful and understanding  We took the nights stay up in  and were put in the executive room  it was nice and clean  a bit small and not very executive  what do you expect in central London for the price   we had a good time tho  The view was a bit rubbish and bathroom a bit dark but we couldnt moan as it was free  The   men on reception were brilliant  and friendly  they must have beentod to be extra nice to us after  and we had a ful compimentary breakfast whch was quite nice and pretty good for vegiterians too  all in all if your not messed about its alright  pretty budget   and not recommended for more than a night  
N =>   ent hotel in a decent location This hotel is nothing special  but a decent hotel in a decent location  not too far from Earls Court  about     miles to Earls Court Station  but a little closer to Gloucester Road  station   Have in mind that there aren t a lot of restaurants or shops near the hotel  but Earls Court are  as mentioned  not too far away The rooms are small  though clean  and the continental breakfast  which is included  is also decent  though  if you re planning to stay for more than two or three days  you ll probably rather buy breakfast somewhere else  just to try something different But as I booked a room for this hotel  all I was looking for was a room with a good bed and a bathroom at a fair price  and that s what I got  and I had no problem with the staff  But that being said  there are other hotels I would rather recommend  especially if yoy re staying for longer  
N =>   Basic but Good Value Rooms   small    very small if you are american    basic but clean  Kettle   coffee etc Windows didnt shut properly   not a problem as need air in small room but someone decided to play loud  disco loud  music in the street at  am and the windows wouldn t shut to reduce noise No blanket provided for bed   ok as weather good Bathroom tiny   door just misses toilet pan but again clean and great shower The coridors could do with being redecorated but they do not smell or anything Didn t have breakfast but it looked OK   very busy  people queueing reception staff were courteous and friendly  as were bar staff Location of hotel was excellent     mins from underground although if I had followed the map on the website i would have been near Euston   Overall i would recommend the hotel   great value for money   convenient location and staff were friendly A lot of people have moaned but if you accept you are not actually in a   star hotel and you have not paid the earth it is more than fine  
N =>  Worse hotel ever been Me and my boss booked   single rooms to stay during the WTM  We arrived very late in the night very tired from a long day and wantet to get some rest  It was almost immosible as the room was cold     outeside temp   and the heating was off  The window was not properly closed as it was damaged and the most important       the bed was very small    It was made for people no taller than     m  I am      normal built   The next morning I asked from them to move in an other room but the hotel was fully booked  I asked them to check the window so at least I could sleep without freezing and the noise of the road but nothing was done during the   days we stayed there  although I was asking for a solution every day  The  quot room quot  was tiny and the furnitire was made of the cheapest material existing  The cleaning staff was just covering the bed every day without even trying to make it proper  The bathroom was dirty and the shower curtin in a very bad condition  There was a notice about enviroment and not to give the towels away if there was no need but as I was always hanging them in order not to be taken away  I was finding new towels every day There was a small boiler for coffee in the  quot room quot  but was not ever cleaned since it was bought  Full of remains from previous uses    I work in hotels for more than    years and travel a lot due to my work and I can tell that this is by far the worse hotel I ve ever been       Avoid it            
N =>  not great I suppose for what you pay it s not bad  But not great either The smaller independant hotels offer better value and are  if you get the right ones much nicer Felt a bit like student halls  and I was at uni    years ago  so I m probably doing Halls a diservice the worst thing was the minute shower  I m reasonably tall  just under six foot but not fat and it was a real squeeze  the flippin shower curtain kept sticking to me and you couldn t even turn around in the shower Try somwhere else if you canrodge 
N =>   Awful     I attended London on business and used an agency to find this hotel It would have been far better ataying in the YMCA or some other hostel  than stay in this place  My room was a single with enough room for a single bed with unpainted MDF carcassing knocked together to form shelves and vanity unit The room door  frame  looked as though it had been broken into by burglars the day before I had a long wait for breakfast  which I hasten to add  did not hang around for Definitely give this hotel a miss  
N =>   Terrible room conditions On the web site the hotel is described as a   stars hotel  However  i would rate   stars hotel  Specifically the carpet was dirty  The room and the toilet was very small  The furniture was more than old and cheap  I would describe them few pieces of wood joined together to make a cupboard  There were no extra blankets to cover up and the heat went off during the night  Definately no airconditioning as they describe it  or a switch to control the heater s temperature  No cutleries available when they were asked to take up in the room  Fot health and safety issues  the boiler and tv available in the room have not had the electric inspection up to date  Finally you could hear the tenants from next door  Very unpleasant stay there 
N =>  Great hotel   considering the bad reviews  I will be honest  I was very worried after I had booked this hotel due to the awful reviews I had read about it  But I was very surprised when I got there  Taking into account  it was probably the cheapest hotel I could find in central London  it was great  A short walk away from Gloucester Road or Earl s Court tube  we used Gloucester Road  as it was on the Picaddily line  you can t knock the great location  As for the hotel  we were welcomed by a very friendly receptionist  The reception is modern  with an internet cafe  Great  as if you spend over     easily done with a drink   you can get    minutes use of the internet free  Our bedroom was on the  nd floor  The corridors were nice  amp  warm  great  considering it was so cold out   The room itself was admittedly small  But as we were only staying the one night  it was perfect to have somewhere central just to sleep  The room was clean  couldn t find any faults  We didn t stop for breakfast  but there is a supermarket at the end of the road     hour  spent the  nd day shopping  They had a luggage store  so we didn t have to hold onto our bags whilst shopping  Overal  I would highly recommend this hotel  Don t listen to these horrible reviews       IT IS GREAT VALUE FOR MONEY   
N =>   Dreadful Stayed in this hotel for two nights recently with my wife We were visiting family and needed a central location in Kensington close to Tube etc In the week in question I had great difficulty finding any hotel but settled for the Ambassadors with some reservations based on reviews The first room allocated to us had a broken window handle which meant the window could not be shut On changing to a room on a lower floor we found that not only did the window not close but the window blinds were broken and did not shut in addition to which the tiny handbasin was severely cracked and had black stains around the cracks A very friendly Duty Manager finally allocated a room which did at least have the basics although seriously run down and dilapidated This is a dirty run down dump masquerading as a hotel and I pity the staff who have to work there I observed several complaints from other residents and I am surprised that the authorities who have responsibility for monitoring standards in the industry have not done something to remedy the problem Billed as a three star hotel this place would not pass muster as a grade E guest house and was the worst experience of my life If I had a choice again I would prefer to sleep on a park bench I strongly urge all who read this review to avoid this hotel like the plague It is truly awful  
N =>  Good Location   Bad Hotel This hotel  for me  was ideally located near the Earl s Court tube station  some cheap and decent dining and pubs  internet cafes  etc  But the hotel was just awful  The room was smaller than ANY room I stayed in throughout Europe  It was  quot spartan quot  to put it mildly  The bed was uncomfortable and the hallway outside was very noisy  I would only stay here again as a last resort  
N =>   Lot of Liars  Stayed here out of desperation after discovering the first hotel I booked was in the middle of nowhere and cancelled before even arriving there  Found this at reasonable price in central location read reviews butas as i say I was desperate  Booked a double twin was given room on  th floor and it was late  Opened the door to what looked like a walk in wardrobe though apparently that was the room with a single bed  Dutifully went downstairs to inform them of mistake and was told that WAS a double room but it was just  small   Partner had to sleep on the floor after trying to sleep in bed unsuccessfully  Again went to complain and was once again told it WAS a double  asked to see single in that case  none available    people told me it was a double although they only had one pillow and one cup for a twin double room  Not great  
N => GOOD DEAL  Other reviews left us feeling nervous  Room was smallish but clean and well set out  For the price we paid  about     per night  I thought it was a really good deal  What do people expect  
N =>   TERRIBLE The rooms are very tiny with thin walls   All the bathroom doors creak  We had hot water but others  we heard  didn t  After asking on day   to fix the TV aerial  which was broken  they didn t so for   days we had a tv but couldn t see it  Not that we wanted to watch it that much but the fact that they couldn t be bothered to repair it is a very bad sign Don t ask at reception to call a taxi  They use their chauffeur  unlicensed  friends and we ended up paying     to Victoria     minutes drive  instead of the    we d paid for a black cab when we arrived No i would NOT recomment it at all  
N =>   When a  family room  is NOT a family room  Firstly  the pictures of the rooms on hotel website are very deceiving  not anything like the spacious  bright and airy rooms you see   We were in a  family  room  i had to climb over one bed to get to the wardrobe  there was no chair to sit down in the room  the bed clothes had cigarette burns in them   there was no smoke alarm in room  mould and rust all over the tiles and shower in the bathroom  The room we requested was non smoking  but on first entering the room the stench of stale cigarettte smoke was dreadful Overall once you left the reception area  the rest of the hotel was very shabby  
N =>   Worse than a hostel   marketed and priced as   star     Avoid like the plague We stayed in this hotel on    e and booked it due to its central location and apparently good value    star  priceTo cut to the chase  this hotel is extremely poor in standards  service and in quality  From our initial check in attempts to our eventual check out the hotel never failed to disappoint I would question the reviews on this site that give it a positive rating The  Star  system    star    star    star  etc   is generally trustedand implies certain standards  and should be applied correctly to hotels advertised on a site to give an honest interpretation of the level of facility and service that can be expected from an establishment This hotel claims to be   star  This is clearly a mark it has given itself  as it does not measure up to the level I would expect from a   star establishment or a hostel for that matter  I hope this review might help to prevent another traveller from being misled in such a manner and might eventually lead to a tightening of the descriptive language used for a hotel on the site to ensure that a traveller is fully aware of what value  gt  gt  gt  gt  gt  Upon arrival when advising that we have a reservation and would like to check in  we were immediately told that check in is not until two pm  The man at reception did not even wait to ask our names and then proceeded to  very rudely  insist that we go away until two o clock  At which point he returned to stapling papers and ignored us  We were not the only guests subjected to this treatment  One guest arrived at     pm and was told to go off and sit somewhere until   o clock   When we eventually checked in  we went up in the elevator  with carpet on all the walls  to a dark  musty corridor that smelled of water damage and the effects of age and neglect  Our room was small  and had a similar sense of age about it   many of the wooden laminatesurfaces had water damage and discoloration  The stale smell was not so pungent here  but was still in the background  We left our bags in the room and went out for the day to a prior appointment for which we were late because our check in must not take place before  pm  When we arrived back to the hotel later that evening  the bathroom floor was covered in water  The pipes in the sink leaked  It was too late to do anything about it and we went to bed  In the morning  the leak was worse and the bathroom floor was flooded  Drying the floor with our towels we went about showering   only to discover that the shower was covered in mould and dampness  Upon starting the shower we discovered why   the extractor fan was not working   This meant that anything left in the bathroom was covered in steam and condensation   absolutely everything  from towels to the walls and floors  that were flooded  to the toilet paper This hotel is far from the standard that anyone should expect  and I would vehemently recommend that people be discouraged from using it  I understand that certain hotels are aimed at a specific price point but certain things should not be excused in the search for this pricepoint  It should be expected that staff at a hotel would be courteousand helpful   This hotel was lacking in so many of the basics and the simple thingsthat it should not be recommended to others until some of the fundamental flaws are removed from it  I also think that it is very misleading to label it a three star hotel is extremely misleading  lt  lt  lt  lt  lt  lt Lesson learned for me     check with TripAdvisor before booking a bargain  
N =>   Please Stay Away Please please stay away from this hotel  I booked this hotel at a very busy weekend for London and struggled to find some where to stay  Having spent a weekend there I now know why they had rooms left when every body else was full  I have stayed at plenty of budget hotels in London over the years and the fact that it is low budget is no excuse at all  The room itself was tiny  we cold not get past the bottom of the bed without catching our legs  I would say that made it difficult to clean  but having located the strange smell in our room as cigar butts and ash under the bed   no smoking in the rooms     I would say that it wasn t cleaned at all  The units were thick with dust and dirt  There was no bath in our room only a shower which only dribbled water  the shower head would go no higher than my shoulder hieght   I m  ft  in   There was plenty of hot water but in truth I was reluctant to stand in the shower at all  The bottom of the shower curtain had some seriously disgusting stain on it  There was no extractor in the bathroom which left it smelling very damp and unpleasant  The bathroom door banged into the toilet so it would not open fully The window would not open properly  the curtain rail was hanging off the wall  the reception on the TV was bad  We had to constantly go to reception to sort out our key card  The pillow on the beds were so flat that I had to roll up bedding to put underneath it  The hotel as a whole was tatty and very well worn  The corrodors and rooms were belting hot which is not funny when you are stood for half an hour with sweat dripping off the end of your nose waiting for your key card sorting out  There was only one small lift which bounced disconcertingly and had grafitti scratched on it Breakfast was standard fare  but the tables were stacked so close to each other you could not get up without sticking your backside in some poor unfortuates face Even the staff were rude and off hand  especially I noticed with poeple who had a language barrier   One member of staff burst into our room without knocking and waiting for an answer in the morning whilst we were changing  The thing that summed up the staff for me was when we were finally called to breakfast from the seating area by a young man who shouted  Hey you  you and you  at us and then pointed at the dinning area I know this sounds like a long winded whining session but I truly feel badly done to by the staff and the hotel  Both me and my partner were left no wanting to go back to the hotel during our stay  Please please do not stay here unless you have no chice  There are much better places in London for less pennies  
N =>   Radiators full blast in hot humid weather When we got to our hotel we were given room      and when we got there there were still dust sheets on the floor and wet paint on the walls   after informing the reception staff we were moved to a family room which was far too cramped  I can understand that not all hotels have air conditioning but during the month of june in london when the air is hot and sticky why on earth would anyone want radiators on full blast        it was VERY difficult to sleep  The lift was rather dodgy and i would advise that if there are allready two people in there DON T GET IN IT   it wouldn t line up properly with the floor  and it was so slow you may as well walk   not easy if you are pregnant   The room was clean but there was little privacy as the blinds didn t work properly and the cleaners insist on letting themselves into your room at      am   now that is a little early   The rooms were clean  the shower was nice  no bugs  but i really wouldn t recomend pregnant women or asthma sufferers to stay there  
N =>   Overpriced   star dump cheated as   star I stayed at the Ambassadors Earls Court in London in        For the price of      a night you wouldn t expect hostel quality from a hotel  But that s exactly what this  quot hotel quot  is  I ve seen student hostels for better value I wouldn t recommend anyone to waste their money on this place  They call themselves    star  which clearly is a self invented title to charge more  Fact is they are more comparative to a   star First  the hotels own photos are highly retouched in photoshop  The lobby itself seem clean and spacious on first appearance but the rooms are several notches below  the hotel seemt to be decorated with the cheapest  second hand Ikea furniture in each room  including the lobby  On my arrival I was given the key to a room that simply left me baffled  carpets were dingy  very old and stained  and the bed was elevated with steps like an old bunkbed  It had an old  dingy mattress that was in such bad shape it was completely lumpy even when  made        a night is not      and I simply could not accept this for the price  I then got what they described as a  good room   It was a      time improvement to the first option  but still hostel like  The mattress at least looked fine but was so uncomfortable I did not sleep properly a single night staying there  The bathroom was small  but the shower took the price  it had a total actual square area of     feet surrounded by a shower curtain that you were suppose to comfortably take your shower in    The shower had been elevated  meaning all water was flowing onto the floor whenever you tried to take a shower  The tiny space made the showercurtain stick to your body like scotchtape  The layout made no sense since the elevated step could have provided ample space for a good sized shower To add to the list of ridicules from this English  quot hotel quot   the soaps were so small they lasted about one day After the first day  the elevator went out of service  Luckily  they at least had a smelly service elevator in the back that one could use  There was no baggage service and when on the last day both elevators were kept unavailable and I asked for assistance with my luggage  and was refused  I think I had enough  Again  I had not paid     a night here I can live in simplicity if I want to save money and don t mind  But this was not cheap for the rate they charge and by cheating people to call it   star when it is clearly not  Of all cities in the world I have visited  and that includes third world countries  London has shown to be the most difficult place for accommodation whether I pay from          a night  That s why I nowadays select a lower range rate since too frequent it had made little difference  Often these hotels are owned by immigrants that have no standard of quality according to a western nation and simply don t care to adapt to the culture of their host country  They want only money and don t feel obligated to have a certain level of quality  even if basic  Second  often the descriptions of facilities are so off they don t even seem to be the same hotel  They don t seem to fall under any kind of regulations or control but can be advertised anyway the owner please  And third  you feel insulted as a client as you know you are being ripped off and treated demeaning from the moment you see what you paid for and what you get And this don t necessarily change if you pay double than at this dump  called Ambassadors Earls Court In London I talked with other travelers and was recommended another hotel which they said was of great standard for the price and located in central Knightsbridge      a night  
N =>  Excellent stay in Ambassadors We have just returned from our holidays I have to say it was magnificent  The hotel has got excellent location  very clean room  nice professional and helpful staff who did not mind t o help us with every single request we had  And i have to admit we had a lot In general very very pleasant stay and good value for money  
N =>   Most awful ever  The room was in the basement and was no bigger than a box room and the double bed was just big enough to fit in  But it was livable for the   dayz until the morning when we was woken up at      in the freezin cold by a load of clattering and bangin which was to do with breakfast  The bathroom was ok though with hot water and a decent shower  Furniture and general presentation was very very poor  We insisted on moving to another room and when we moved was bigger but was a grade mankier but after   mins after ringin reception  we got a tv brought into the room cos it was missin  and after fiddling got the kettle to work  Furniture and carpets look liked they and been outside for a week and the room was grubby  Still water was hot  no bugs to report and the shower worked  Staff were ok and so was breakfast  Overall  if you like to spend a bit of time in your room apart from sleeping then would avoid at all costs  After reading all the other reviews  me and the wife are gonna take a shower  Expect a better room in down town iraq  
N =>   An awful night  When I booked this hotel for one night at Easter I was pleased with the internet deal I had managed to get  but a little worried when I read the reviews  Still  my husband said  quot we only have to sleep there the one night quot   Sleep would have been nice After quite a long wait to book in we managed to find our basement room  It was quite small but adequate for one night  Although the rest of the hotel was overheated  our room was distinctly cool when we walked in as the radiator wasn t working  Also  being in the basement  it was quite gloomy and one of the lightbulbs wasn t working either Although we had reported the heating and lighting faults to reception  nothing was done that evening and we came back to a chilly gloomy room  Fortunately the bathroom was well lit  allowing me to spot the cockroach trying to hide behind the loo  Sadly  for cockroach lovers  we killed it  That night was a cold night  there would have been enough covers for a superheated room  but not enough without heating  By  am I was reaching for my clothes to wear in bed to keep warm  after carefully shaking them first   Finally when checking out I asked for a complaint form and was given a blank sheetof paper on which to write my complaint  The man at reception said he would pass it on  I m still waiting for a reply  
N =>  OK but problems with key card Basement room was quiet and adequate if a little small  Well heated for ruary but could imagine it being overpoweringly hot in summer Included continental breakfast was reasonable  plenty of choice Disappointed no bar  coffee bar serving snacks in foyer but no alcohol   went to Holiday Inn round the corner  pleasant bar here  expensive but not desperately so  Main problem   card key for room didn t work properly  Had to go to reception to let us in room on most occasions which became extremely irritating  Only finally fixed the morning we were leaving Overall  preferred Comfort Inn on other side of Cromwell Road where we stayed previous year Not the best hotel we have stayed in in London and wouldn t be rushing to return but wouldn t rule it out completely if there was a cheap deal available   
N =>  Biggest dump Ive ever been unlucky enough to stay in AVOID this hotel   its similar to Picadilly Backpackers Hostel which is one third the cost of this FAKE   STAR RATED hotel  The only decent hotels to stay in in London if you have a budget are   Comfort Inn Victoria or Comfort Inn Buckingham Palace  Dont dare to saty in any other   star hotel cause they are as bad as any hostel  The Ambassador is one of the worst  Dont be fooled by pictures on the internet   that is wat mislead us  
N =>   Service was really disappointing  We checked into a small triple room and the toilet couldn t flush at first  It worked after trying many times What s worse was when we were sleeping  they woke us up at around  am to tell us that we have to check out   We just checked in that morning and had the reservation for   nights  The hotel staff then asked us why we had gone to that particular room since it was booked by somone else  How were we to know considering they were the ones who gave us the keys in the first place  So anyway  they realised something went wrong with their administration and they let us stayed in our room  Next morning  we went to ask them about it and they tried to shrug it off  Terrible terrible service  Could do better staying at a youth hostel  
N =>   Great Location Not So Great Hotel My girlfriend and I stayed at the Ambassadors Hotel in late  of       I already did my research and understood that we were not staying at a fancy hotel basically I already knew what we were in for  This was fine since we were in London to be out all day and night to explore the city  The location is great  it s in a nice and safe area  We walked about very late at night and never felt threatend or in danger  The hotel is about two blocks from the Earls Court Station  less then   min walk  and you can get everywhere with ease from this station  This was a huge bonus for us  When we first checked in we were suprised since it was not bad at all  for the price   the people behind the desk were friendly and willing to help  When we got to our room the problems arised  The room was very small but was not a problem since this is what we expected  again  we weren t in London to stay in our room  The lights in our Bedroom did not work  the only lights we had was from the bathroom  I went to the front desk and they could not move us to another room since they were all booked up  It was late in the evening and they assured that it would be taken care of by the next day  We stayed at the hotel for a total of   nights and we finally got working lights in our room on the fourth night  Everynight I would complain but nothing would happen  this was very frustrating for us  Luckily  we would not come back to our rooms till very late in the evening so it did not affect us greatly but still  we had no working lights    The breakfast in the morning was OK  nothing to brag about  The only saving grace for this hotel was the location  
N =>   Worst hotel ever I stay in hotels in London most weeks as for business so it is with some experience that I say my stay at this hotel was the worst stay I have encountered in any hotel  For leisure travel I always consult trip advisor but regret at great cost that I did not do the same on this occassion having just read other reviews The problems started when I reached my room which was is an unacceptable state of repair for a   star establishment  It was my first visit to your hotel having found it on the Late rooms website described as  comfortable accommodation    recently undergone major refurbishment   It was evident that the room had not had any refurbishment for about    years   the carpets were filthy  bedcovers stained  furniture was in a bad state of repair covered in stains  The bathroom was also full of stains and silver fish were crawling over the floor  I immediately returned to the desk  the staff were very helpful  and I was shown another room which was slightly better but still very old and shabby and finally I decided on a basement room which at least had been modernised in the recent past despite being very hot and facing a brick wall Even with the air conditioning unit on the room was unbearable and it was difficult to leave the window open being at ground level  I finally managed to get used to the noise of the air conditioning unit and fell asleep  I was woken up at about    am with a strange vibrating noise which sounded like the fridge was malfunctioning  I got up and explored the appliances in the room and could not find where the fault was  tried phoning reception but no answer and finally decided to go outside into the corridor to investigate  You can imagine my shock when I went into the corridor and heard the fire alarm going in the next corridor  In panic I left the room to go outside with the rest of the residents while the fire brigade investigated As you can imagine I was very concerned that had that been a real fire I could have lost my life as was unable to hear the alarm in my room  I phoned the reception to express my concern and finally the person on duty understood my concerns  he initially thought I was worried about the alarm  and I asked him to make a note that the alarm could not be heard in my room as I was concerned to sleep incase there was an emergency I would not hear  Eventually I managed to get about   hours sleep before having to get up for work I left around  am in the morning and went to the reception to ask to speak to the manager and was told that there was no one I could speak to until after  am which was too late as I needed to be in work  I have written a complaint to the hotel and website but I would warn others to avoid this hotel at all costs  
N =>  Stay away  This place will destroy your trip My wife and I expected a basic room  considering we were paying      a night in Knightsbridge for what we were told was a     star hotel  What we got was a room where we could barely fit in two bags  The single window opened about   inches    and it was a hot night  The two twin beds were nailed down  so we couldn t move them to squeeze out an extra few inches  This appears to be a former SRO  It is dilapidated  The shower doesn t have stalll  just a curtain  so it s bound to flood  The staff was helpful  But this palce really needs a complete makeover  Until then  I wouldn t stay here again if it was free  
N =>   Do Not Stay Here This hotel is DIRTY  my room honestly looked like it had never been cleaned  The bedding had stains all over it  I slept fully clothed on top of the bed  The rooms are not big enough to swing a mouse in  let alone a cat  There are no proper beds  they are simlpy MDF shelves with mattresses on They charged me for services i didn t use and refused to refund the costs  Do not let them swipe your credit card The lift was permanently out of order  There is a premier travel inn about   mins walk from the hotel  We moved there and it was cheaper  nicer and above all was CLEAN  Stay there  
N =>  Perfectly acceptable We just got home after spending   nights at the Ambassadors  It was a bit of a shock at first  This was our first time abroad and  compared to US hotels for this price range Ambassadors was a disappointment  However  the location was wonderful  the rooms were clean if small  the mattress was adequate and the room cooled quickly with the window open  Linens and towels were worn but clean  and the bathroom was adequate  although the ceiling was quite low in the shower    Plenty of hot water  They also forgot our wakeup call  but the alarm clock worked so it wasn t a problem  Didn t notice any particularly bad smells  We were on the top floor  so had a great view of the church down the street  Our breakfast wasn t complimentary and   pounds per person was too much for us  but Sainsbury s  grocery  was just down the street  They have the best yogurt  There are many restaurants nearby that are not too expensive  The Tube and bus routes are close by  The staff was helpful  if not particularly friendly compared to US average  but I ve run into poor staff at US hotels too The Ambassadors needs some upgrading but all in all it s not a bad little hotel  
N =>  Dishing the dirt This was the dirtiest hotel we have ever stayed in and there was an unpleasant smell in our corridor  I cannot imagine what the kitchens were like although the breakfast was acceptable  I woder what the many foreign visitors thought of our hotels  As a British national I was ashamed  
N =>  This hotel is correct we can t complain  We don t understand why so much criticism  the rooms were clean  and small  but not as much other users said  the breakfast was quite good and there is no reason to complain about it  Lastly the staff was very kind and polite  be it was chance  but we found no bug  no out of date food  no cold water instead of hot water no broken window or bed  and we had no problem with heat    Don t forget it is a    class hotel  so it is absurd to ask for perfection  
N =>  Great location even if the room was a little small My wife and I stayed here on our  nd trip to London  We love the location which is why we pick the Ambassador Contrary to many of the reviews  we had quite a positive experience  OK  the rooms are a little small but you have to remember this is South Kensington and you are paying only     or so for a double room Our room was clean as was the bathroom  We had a room in the basement so it lacked a little natural light but we could still see the street above through the window We have little to complain about  It is in a great location  close to the tube and very easy to get around  Felt safe walking back to the hotel from the tube station even after dark  
N => THIS IS LONDON  Great budget hotel  For this price  we cannot find any reason to complain  Dont forget this is London  and a decent BUDGET hotel is not easy to find Our first impression from outside was that it looked good  The reception and welcoming bar just inside the entrance was also very nice  The staff were friendly and polite at all times  We had room     on the first floor  which is a standard   bedded room  Must admit that there was not much space  but it served its purpose perfectly  We were in London to do some sight seeing  so it was really nice to have a lovely big hot BATH  and not just a shower  in our en suite room  Water was really hot at all times  and the water pressure was also good  Room was clean  and was also KEPT clean by daily room service We were almost put off going here by reading other reveiws before we went  but now realise that any bad reviews must have been written by people from other countries  e g  from USA   who are used to a higher standard hotel for their money and had probably not visited London before    This hotel is perhaps slightly  quot older quot   but that does not mean that just because it may have a couple of slightly cracked bathroonm tiles that it is not clean  AS A BUDGET HOTEL  WE WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ONE  If you want perfection  then book into the RITZ  
N =>  Worst ever  My wife and I booked to see a show at the Albert Hall   the show was great   but the hotel very poor The receptionist didn t know what was going on when the fire alarm went off at  am in the morning   he thought it was the breakfast alarm  whatever that is we still don t know We were told nothing at all after the fire brigade arrived  Went back to our room   a couple of hours later decided to have a shower   water was tepid   receptioist told us we would have to wait for the maintenance man   Perhaps he should fix the tiles hanging off the walls before attending to the water To finish the job off   the receptionist couldn t get my service card to accept payment   the card has never been a problem before or after Telephoned to complain once we were home   managment said they would reply to my complaint     weeks on   nothing The only good thing was the breakfast   fair play it was good   but the rest is not to be recommended   the bedroom was tacky too   holes in the blanket  I apologised to my wife for taking her to this place  the worst in    years of marriage and travelling in many countries  You have been warned  
N =>  Do Not Stay Here No Heat and no hot water  asked for a double bed got a single bed pushed together  The breakfast was not good either  if you need to stay in a cheap hotel  this is the place to go  I would pay the extra money to stay away from here  
N =>   Worst Ever Public areas looked good   breakfast was passable   room was grubby and cold   for   nights the radiator did not heat at all despite complaints to reception   this was during a period when the forecast was minus   degrees centigrade   would not recommend to my worst enemy  
N =>  Ambassador Hotel   average We booked a room at the Ambassador Hotel and then happened to read the Trip Advisor reviews  After reading the comments made by some of the reviewers  we were a little concerned  However  our stay at the hotel was quite pleasant  The staff at the front desk were quite helpful  The rooms are very small  especially when compared to hotel rooms in the US  My husband and I being overseas travellers  travelling for two weeks in Europe  we had two fairly large suitcases  We had to leave the suitcases lying on the floor   there was no closet big enough to hold the two of them  And with the suitcases on the floor  there was barely enough room for us to walk  The bathroom was also quite small  however the shower was good  Hot water and a good showerhead  The blinds also did not function well   we had to take them down just to open the window  On our very first day  the blinds had not been attached properly and landed on our heads as we tried to detach them The breakfast was quite good  though the price was a bit on the higher side  It was a continental breakfast buffet and the wait staff did an excellent job of treating customers politely and keeping the trays well stocked The hotel is a       minute walk from the Earls Court tube station   very convenient  Gloucester station may have been closer   but we did not explore  There is also an internet place near the tube which was very convenient for us Overall  a pleasant experience  I would however stay at a different hotel the next time only because of the size of the room  
N =>  sauna room was moved here from another hotel due to a problem looked very nice in lobby staff friendly got to our room bathroom clean beds seemed clean but the room was very very warm couldnt sleep in the bed sweat poured from us window was opened slighty but nailed shut at bottom  would not stay again there so beware if you get room      cant fault breakfast excellent 
N =>  If only I knew before   DO NOT STAY HERE Fortunately  I had found this website before our stay at Ambassadors for e    thru y          Unfortunately  it was after I booked prepaid  penalty to cancel   So my    year old and I took all the comments in stride and decided to go ahead and give it a try  How bad could it be  I thought  Well  I wasn t disappointed as the room met the low expectation I had set based upon the comments from this website  However  I thought the bed bug comments from some guests were blown out of proportion  Little did I know     The last day I was there  I found   bugs on my pillow when I awoke  These were the same bugs I had previously discovered on the wall behind the bedpost  Not realizing what they were  I  quot removed quot  them and went on with life  so what s a little bug I thought   I am now undergoing steriod treatment in an attempt to rid my reaction to the bed bug bites on my arms  legs  hands  feet and back     days later  the reaction to these bites still persists    every morning I have new bumps to brag about   We just finished bagging of all of our belongings to kill anything that may have hitched a ride from their London breeding grounds   the Ambassadors Hotel  If only I had listened to my gut instinct after reading the reviews  Please don t make the same mistake I did   stay elsewhere and check this site before you book anything  
N => Best Dog Kennel We ve Ever Stayed In   The website we saw  still on line to early e      but now changed  said the hotel had been recently refurbished   well the foyer had been  Also the picture of the front of the hotel on that website was not of the building at Collingham Road On arrival we found they had lost our booking  which had been made about four or five months previously  Our room was not a double as ordered but a twin room  and that given pretty grudgingly  staff a bit grumpy Dirty carpet  beds not properly made up in the morning   just the top sheet pulled up  and the bottom sheet left wrinkled and the pillow was left on the floor  Blankets were thin and obviously very old  Bedspread didn t appear to be very clean  Cheap cardboard type furniture Inadequate lighting for applying make up or for seeing anything  Bathroom fittings were very dirty  However  the shower was good and hot No room to swing a mouse let alone a cat  No storage space   might be fine for locals with an overnight bag but overseas travellers who may be away from home for weeks need space to store luggage Of the items advertised on the website we did have private facilities and there was a hair dryer  There were none of the other advertised features  e g   refrigerator  mini bar  safety deposit boxes  laundry facilities  iron  etc  and no book in the room advising of any facilities or nearby attractions The breakfast wasn t bad but the cutlery didn t appear to be very clean Definitely would not recommend to anyone  Budget accommodation should be budget in price   not budget in quality  
N =>  We cancelled our reservation after seeing the room My wife and I booked for a            stay at this hotel thru hotels  We arrived in the early morning of          hoping that we will be accommodated  despite the very early check in  Of course  we expected that we will be charged extra for the early check in  but never thought that we will be asked to pay an arm and a leg for it My wife s first impression was not quite great due to a fact that what greeted us at the front door we girls smoking and blocking the door  whom my wife thought are hookers During the negotation with the front desk personnel  who was a tad haugthy  he told us that we have no choice but to take his price because  he thought  we have no where else to stay  especially at that time  He also told us that the room he will give us that early morning may or may not be the same room that we will get for the entire stay  Regardless  he told us  we will have to check out later that day and will have to check back in to  quot officially quot  start our stay based on our booked dates  What a hussle  Nonetheless  my wife and I decided to see the room first since it was getting very late  He gave us a room key and was very surprised to learn that it was one of their few basement rooms  We have never been to a hotel with basement rooms before  After briefly seeing the state of that room  my wife vehemently told me that we leave at once  So  we decided to wake up my wife s friend who lives in London to stay there for the night  Afterwards  we arranged a stay in another friend s house for the rest of our brief stay in London We called hotels the next morning to cancel our reservation and file our reasons for cancelling  Yet  hotels deemed it necessary  as policy  to still charge us with a   night stay  Since we abosulutely did not want to be there  we had to sacrifice and lose money to hotels for a hotel that is so terrible  we walked out of there as soon as we got a taste of the impolite staff and the crappy basement hotel room that they have  
N => Lovely I stayed in the Ambassador Hotel from                      I found the staff very friendly  the breakfast was tasty and my room was cosy  I did not find any nasty surprises and my room was kept very clean  Very good location and very close to Earls Court station  It is easy to get to places in London  Highly recommended  
N =>  Rotten Hotel Rotten Hotel  Would rate as a one star On arrivalDried urine all over toilet seatOnly cold tap working in sinkPubic hair in my bed  gross No undersheetsStained mattressChipboard furniture  very scabbyNo curtains  just venetian blindsHorrible condensation problemOne office chair in triple room  beds squashed togetherand yes         I was bitten by something too   Breakfast was fine  staff pleasant  couldn t wait to get out of there  
N =>  it s not so bad  I read the reviews here after I d booked the hotel on another site so I was a little worried about what I d find at the hotel  I m pleased to say that I was surprised by the quality of the hotel  It s not the most luxurious hotel in the world but it s clean and comfortable and in an excellent location  close to tube station  bars and restaurants but in a leafy street with no traffic noise  The breakfast was adequate   mostly cereals and toast but as it was included in our room rate I did not mind  If I had paid the    extra however I d have expected better  The rooms were a little worn and scruffy and our blinds did not work  If you want somewhere cheap to crash after a hard day enjoying all London has to offer then I would have no hesitation in recommending the Ambassadors  I d definitely stay there again  If you are looking for luxury then you might need to pay a bit more and go elsewhere  
N =>  Not good  When walking into the room for the first time there was an awful smell of damp and this was noticable on the walls  Had to keep window open to try and get rid of the smell  Paint flaking off the walls  especially in the bathroom and the room badly needed redecorating  Apart from the awful room the staff were friendly and the breakfast was fine  
N =>  Stay out of the basement rooms  My husband and I were given a basement room and we kept the window open during the night because the weather was warm and the rooms are not air conditioned  On the second night  someone climbed in through the window and stole     British pounds and a credit card while we slept  The police responded to our call promptly and professionally  but the response from the hotel was appalling  Apart from allowing us to move to a room on an upper floor  the hotel staff and manager seemed unconcerned with the theft and our welfare  Perhaps this is a common occurrence at the Ambassadors hotel  Our new room did not have a phone  so we had to place calls at a pay phone in the lobby and go to the reception desk to report any problems  We feel fortunate that we were unharmed and that the thief did not get our passports or wallets  but we will definitely not stay in this hotel again  
N => Did these people stay at the same place I did   Feel badly for the other critics here  but I thought the hotel was totally fine for the price  My room  a double  was clean  albeit very small  No curtains either to really block the light  just blinds   but certainly no insects to speak of  Safe didn t work in the room either and yes  the hotel room card took a few times to work  Thought the staff were pretty friendly too  ent breakfast  I ve travelled extensively too so I know what I m talking about  It was ok  
N =>  One of worsed hotels Iv ever stayed at we booked though a traifinders in Australia on octomber    for a booking in     we requested a double room and got a twin  then on entering the room this is what we found       Mould on the bathroom roofBare light globe in bathroom Two empty light fittings in bedroomNo sink plugNo bath plugHair on shower fittingCracked unstable shower headBathroom floor not cleanVery heavy  constant dripping coming from the bath tap  we had to put a towel under the tap to allow us to sleep Bedroom floor not vacumed  very dirty The single beds were very very uncomfortable and very smallWe had two plastic glasses in the bathroom on arrival  when one split  after two days  I asked for a replacement and was told I could not have one  but I could take a coffee cup from the breakfast room if I liked I have emailed the hotel and the owners with my complaints and have not to date recieved reply  
N =>  Good Value  
N => no hot water and no heating  
N =>   Per un soggiorno tranquillo e piacevole  
N =>   Escribir un buen comentario no tiene precio  
N =>  Small rooms but clean comfortable and good price Was initially offered a room in the centre of the hotel with no windows  but changed when I  falsely  claimed my wife was claustrophobic  Rooms are small  but clean and comfortable and the price was very reasonable via opustravel com Breakfast was very good  I would recommend for short stays  but you might want more room for longer stays  
N =>   Tiny room We stayed one night and that was enough  Any longer and we wouldn t have been able to stand the claustrophobic room or store our clothes in the tiny cupboard  I liked the decor  it was quiet and the location was not bad  but the room was really suitable for a single traveller  I d estimate the space either side of the bed to be under a metre  The breakfast was fine  there were none of those irritating make your own toast machines  and service prompt  but the fire alarm went off during the meal and we had to duck out of the window area very quickly as automatic shutters came down  We had to stand until they re opened and the food was by then cold  A fellow guest told us it had also happened the previous day  I didn t see any Occitane toiletries  We did consider room service but the prices were high and there is a service charge  Potentially a nice hotel but the rooms are really not acceptable  I handed in the feedback form on the first evening and no comment was made on my complaint  
N =>   Good location   room claustrophobic First impression of the hotel was good with bright entrance and welcoming reception  First impression of the room was terrible   room      It really is a box and made me feel quite claustrophobic  No windows and therefore no views  I wish I had been brave enough to go back downstairs and ask to be moved  I don t care if it has a decent wet room  not having enough space to be able to walk around the double bed means it shouldn t be classed as a double room  Breakfast was fine  Space should be used as a store room and not as a standard double  There are better hotels in the area  I stayed at otel last time and would pefer it to this one  
N =>   Good location clean friendly staff great breakfast  This hotel was for us a great location  just round the corner from friends and not far from Kings Cross station and bus stop  Check  in staff very good and quick  We asked for a quiet room and appart from the air conditioning units outside it was  even though we were opposite the lift The room although not huge was big enough  sadly not the case with the wardrobe  hanging space was about   inches deep and no drawers  if you are planning staying longer than two nights take something to clip over the door The only other thing was the bed  comfy enough but very noisy  turning over was not welcomed by my husband  en suite  small but roomy enough for one at a time Breakfast was very good and the service was also very good I would definately stay here again  
N =>   Great hotel  Stayed in the ambassadors bloomsbury in il for three nights  Thought the location was brilliant  just a walk to Regents Park  The wardrobe was very small but adequate  But the bathroom and bedroom in general was lovely and couldn t fault it  Breakfast every morning was delicious  though on Sunday we did have to queue to get into the breakfast room which was unexpected but not that much of a big deal  Overall i would totally recommend it  
N =>   Claen but tiny rooms The website makes the room look big  but they are tiny   We paid high rates and the room was just too small  The room was clean and modern  but tiny  When we checked in we confirmed with the reception staff that upon check out we could get a VAT receipt  When it came to checking out we ended up in a big argument with the reception  We will never go to this hotel again and would advise caution 
N =>  what a find  We were really lucky because we found a deal for this hotel on GTA Hotels com        pounds per night  in a deluxe room  which was really rather large   so previous reports on small rooms must have been with the standard rooms Ihave had to stay in the areamany times for work and nothing has compared  the room was large   flat screen television with many channels and digital movies  a large bathroom withl occiatine products   we stayed for   nights and on some days they were not replaced  but upon mentioning to reception as had ran out of shampoo they sent up a load   breakfast was truly superb and included in the price   room serice menu was super too  We will stay here from now on   no need to look for anywhere else  
N =>   Not enough room to swing a cat  good points  useful location for the West End of London  complimentary wi fi  although this was tempermental bad points  room was so small  there was bearly enough room to fit both me and my suitcase  Bathroom the size of a broom cupboard  
N =>   great hotel brilliant stay really lovely hotel  brilliant location    mins from euston tube  amp  train station  only   stops into oxford circus rooms very small though  not suitable for   people  wardrobe barely enough space for   or   items  breakfast was delish  very fresh  amp  great selection  restaurant food was also delicious  if a little pricey  but overall good spot  amp  would defo use again 
N =>   good hotel Goodthings  free wifi  quiet adequate breakfastNear location to brtish museum  close to a small shopping mall near the Holiday INN bloomsbury Unsatisfactory   too small cabinet  Russel square has no lift and need to bring the luggage via a short satircase   min walk form russel square station Will recommend to others  
N =>  Very Impressed  Only a few minutes from Euston Tube Station  this hotel looks impressive as you approach it  Arrived about   am and there was a room ready for us The staff were friendly and helpful we even had a member of staff show us to our room and point out where everything was The room was very light bright clean and modern I didn t think the room was that small like quite a few of the other reviews have said The bathroom was a little on the small side but nothing to really complain about The wardrobe is tiny but we were there only one night so this didn t matter Had a very comfortable nights stay and was looking forward to the breakfast the next day as quite a few reviews have said how good this was Wasn t disappointed it was yummy  To sum up my stay i haven t got a bad word to say about it  i can t wait to stay again  Definitely recommend it   
N =>   What a find   Perfect   Stayed in the Ambassadors Hotel  Bloomsbury  London just this past weekend  The location is perfect  my daughter is studying in UCL  and the hotel is just close by  directly accross the road from the Hilton Euston I shared with my son  The room was gorgeous  spotless  bright  widescreen TV on wall  ensuite lovely with really decent toiletries  tho had to ask for them the  nd day  amp  was given double the amount  so it must have been an oversight  BUT minialistic  It didnt bother us as we were only there for   nights  but there are only a few hangers  amp  no where else to put your clothes or your suitcases  so we lived out of our bags which we had to step over to get from one side of the room to the other We got a GREAT deal bed and breakfast from     hotels  The breakfast in the dining room was delicious  absolutely anything you could ask for  I did ask for breakfast in our room  nd day and checked to see if it would cost extra and was assured that it would not  however the following morning breakfast arrived with a bill for           Needless to say I disputed this with the manager and won    Loved this hotel and look forward to staying there again  Close to tubes  shopping  Theatres      taxi fare back at     pm Went to see Les Miserables and The Woman in Black  both excellent  Re London  Found London extremely expensive and not great value  ie food expensive and only adequate  Was VERY annoyed at   pc  discretionary service charge  added to ALL food drinks   not the way to do business  as the service fluctuates  am not talking about the hotel   which was excellent  
N =>  Good experience would return Stayed here for   nights  booked by my organisation  Was worried by some of the reviews but it was a good experience  Check in staff were very friendly  although there was a mix up in the booking  and helpful throughout my stay Modern  bright decor which is not to everybody s taste but has a clean and fresh feeling The room was of average size with a very comfortable double bed  small desk  wet room with a reasonable shower and lovely toiletries  The only complaint I have is the size of the  quot wardrobe quot  which was an extremely small cupboard  Not enough room to hang clothes for five days  Free Wi fi a bonus Breakfast was quite good   usual buffet set up with hot food cooked to order  The style was rather pretentious though   fruit was called fruit minestrone  stewed rhubarb called rhubarb soup  and the presentation of full english in individual bowls was unnecessary  We mainly ate out but had a meal in the restaurant on the last evening  It was quite expensive but tasted delicious   I recommend the chocolate mousse for serious chocoholics  Staff friendly and generally efficient Recommend this hotel based on this experience and would stay again 
N =>  Hit or miss I ve stayed here on a few different occasions and I find it a bit hit or miss to honest   sometimes its fine and others have been riddled with problems My stays are always booked through my work  and payed in advance  but last time I stayed they tried to charge me even though I had written confirmation  Also  be warned they like to take a     deposit on arriving and will only credit you when you leave If at all possible do not stay in a single room   they are tiny  I had to open my case on the bed as there wasnt enough floor space and had problems trying to get an ironing board up The rooms are basic but you always get a bottle of water and some me L occtaine products  The bathroom is a wetroom  no bath but a nice hot shower  Single rooms have a small desk and a small wardrobe  double rooms are slightly larger Resteraunt   my last stay was terrible  I couldnt get a seat  then when I got up to use the bathroom they gave my table to someone else  They then got my order wrong and service was slow  Other stays have been very different  excellent service  great food no problems I m still undecided as to whether to return   definatley not if I can only have a single room  The hotel is in a good location with Euston station just a few minutes walk away and I  ve always found the rooms clean and tidy  
N =>  Wouldn t stay again Fairly swanky hotel in a central location  It s a stones throw from Euston mainline station   not a grotty area but it s not exactly posh either  It was the smallest hotel room I ve ever stayed in though the Bathroom  amp  shower were quite good  The decor etc was quite smart but I wouldn t bother staying here again  be my standards are high but this place doesn t come close to the likes of City Apex or even St Gregorys  
N =>  Not impressed   go to otel instead  I stayed   nights at this hotel and was not impressed at all  The hotel itself seems clean  modern and quiet but our room was dreadful  Firstly  the clinical decor leaves alot to be desired and the venetian blinds on the windows let so much light in that  if you are a light sleeper  you will be up at the crack of dawn   not what we wanted for a relaxing long weekend away  The room was so small it was impossible for the   of us to unpack due to the lack of wardobe space  The tea and coffee facilities were packed away in the bedside table to save on space which meant we were making coffee on the floor each morning as we had already put our belongings on the table top  The bathroom lacked hanging space too and was without an expelair and the shower wasn t very powerful compared to other  stars we have stayed in  The sink was situated with a shelf above it so everytime I wanted to wash my face I had to negociate the shelf or else end up with an injury   this led to a constantly wet floor  All in all the room was far too cramped and we will never stay here again  We pay for abit of luxury when we go away not to end up getting frustrated by every minute detail  The breakfast was insufficient  Whilst it tasted nice it was more gourmet than hearty   something you do need for a weekend in london  Next time we will be staying at the otel round the corner   cheaper  bigger rooms  better breakfasts and better views  especially on the   th floor    
N =>  One of the worst hotels I have stayed in I would definately not recommend this hotel at all  It is certainly not a   star hotel that it advertises itself to be Although pleasantly decorated  the rooms are extremely small  I had a number of problems whilst staying for   nights at this hotel for business    When I returned back to the hotel on the second day  my room had not been made up and this was at  pm  I asked the reception why this was  and their response was that the staff had been extremely busy  This is not acceptable at all  I cannot belive that the staff were so busy that the rooms could not be made up by late afternoon   The room was extremely noisy and there was a constant barrage of noise from the worksite  Constant drilling and banging till late in the day was extremely annoying  I complained to reception again who denied that they heard any noise  either extremely ignorant or just plain deaf as it was loud and clear     I ordered room service but had to wait over  hr  min for the food  The food was overpriced anyway  not to mention that the breakfast price in the menu was incorrectly listed   The guest comment card in the room had been completed by the previus guest and obviously not been collected by the hotel staff  I did not request a comments card as I did not want to leave my details in the room for the next guest to find     The TV volume was restricted to a certain volume  This was extremely low and all very well if the noise from the work site below wasn t so annoying     The air conditioning in the room only went to a certain temparature  I was staying at the hotel during the hottest week of the year  and found the temperature unbearable  I didn t bother to complain as the hotel clearly had no clue about standards     The bathroom sink was so small it was unusable  I have no idea who s brilliant idea it was to place a shelf over a tiny sink  but this just it made it unusable   Not designed very ergonomically at all I would not recommend this hotel at all   even if you are desparate for a hotel  avoid this one at all costs   
N =>  Noisy unclean hotel  This hotel looked great and very stylish from the website  However  on arrival  my work colleague and I witnessed a very different picture  There was a huge board covering the front of the hotel as it was undergoing building work  We told the receptionist our concerns about the drilling and general building noise  and they assured us we would not be able to hear the noise from our rooms  However  our rooms were right above the building work  and thus the noise was horrendous  We complained but were told there were no more rooms available  We both booked double rooms  yet my work colleague was presented with a single bed in his room  To top it off  when i arrived back to my room that evening at  am looking forward to going to bed  i pulled back the covers to find a number of hairs in the bed  The sheets were obviously dirty  And at  am the next morning  i was woken up by drilling and banging  I would definitly not stay at this hotel again  Avoid  
N =>  Should have been better The room was clean but that was really all it had going for it  Bed sheets were stained  surely they could have been bleached      Room was tiny  glad we only stayed for   night as not big enough for   adults to live for any longer period of time  Woken up by drilling and other noise from builders on site at  am on Sunday morning  Won t be staying there agin  
N => The Worst Hotel We ve Ever Stayed At In London We have been going to England for over thirty years and we expect   unless one pays an absolute fortune   costly  small  not very good rooms in London  However  The Ambassadors  rooms have to be the worst we have ever encountered  Our one was so small that we had difficulty finding a spot to put our suitcases  Thinking that we might have just have been given a one off room  we were shown another one  It was even smaller  The service also left a lot to be desired  We had to ask for two days before we received extra pillows and they were taken away the next day because the hotel was supposedly  quot fully booked quot   It then took another day before we again received extra pillows  When we attempted to use the in room safe we found it was broken  Again  it took a number of calls before anyone came   and  in the end  it could not be repaired  Our first night was disturbed when we were awakened because someone was trying to open our door  When I confronted the people  I was shown the details that they also had been given our room  In summary  I would certainly NOT recommend this hotel  
N =>  Do not stay at this hotel     This was without doubt the worst hotel I have ever stayed at in my entire life  Disgusting  Filthy  Smelt awful  Stained pillows  The bathroom was like a fridge   the shower comprised of a lead from the tiny bathroom basin in the  bathroom    After complaining I was moved to another room   equally appauling   albeit slightly bigger but still smelled terrible   stale cigarette smoke  amp  musty  The third room was again slightly bigger and didn t smell just as bad   the only reason I didn t go somewhere else was my dad had already paid for it  amp  they wouldn t refund him  The Manager refused to speak with me   when I highlighted that the rooms hotel advertised on web was nothing like it in reality I was told that they stated on website that the hotel was being refurbished  amp  that the rooms advertised were  premier  rooms   they did not state any other this   the rooms at the front as extremely noisy  amp  the workmen arrive at     am with their alarm call   Awful awful awful   I only wish I had seen the other reviews on your website before we booked  
N =>  What a letdown We have just returned from a   night stay at this hotel  We had to change rooms after the first night because we couldn t shut the window which had been opened by the cleaners during the day  This was after   phone calls to tell them of the problem  We also noticed that the toilet was leaking  The second room which was   floors directly below the first had the heating on all night making it impossible to sleep  I would not recommend this hotel  
N => Not too bad We stayed   nights at this hotel and expected worse after reading some of the reviews on this site  Our room was clean enough although we did face the street and the noise was bad   traffice noise  the disco at the hotel opposite and the church bells to name a few meant an almost sleepless night  The bathroom did leave a lot to be desired  the towels where clean although a couple had holes in them but all in all the bathroom really could have done with a refit years ago  The room itself apart from a couple of stains on the carpet and a little paint flaking off the skirting boards was not too bad  Although for      a night I would have expected a LOT better  The breakfast was good and the service of the staff was also fine although all of the staff are foreign and this was a little difficult when attempting a conversation  The location is great for Kings Cross which is a   minute walk and great for buses and the tube  We would not be rushing back to visit again but it was not that bad that we had to complain about anything  
N => Pokey the worst shower bathroom ever experienced  
N =>  Horrible horrible horrible   
N =>  Stay Away   
N => Absolutely Vile  
N =>  ent Value Bad Service  
N => Worth trying if you get a good rate Good location near to Baker Street  Staff very friendly and helpful  Rooms are small but fine if you just need a bed for the night also beware noisy neighbours  Complimentary breakfast included and a decent enough selection to choose from to start yor day  also tea  coffee  chocolate available from machine in lounge all the time we needed it  Room clean and towels changed for our second day there  Not sure if I would pay full rate but I got a good deal so I felt I got good value  
N =>   good value everything we needed nice breakfast  Well it s not posh but for the location and price it s very good  especially if you re just needing a place to shower and sleep  which we were  
N =>   Good location but hotel could improve We only stayed for one night  Arrived on saturday after our long bus trip  and we got a twin bedroom instead of a double room     we did not complain as we wanted to go out and see the sights asap   Room was in the basement and window was opened  good job we noticed as window leads to the outside stairs that go to the street    not very safe The room was not imaculately clean but was ok  same with the bathroom  some dirty bits in the hard to get areas Breakfast was nothing special  it was ok Location was really good  as was very close to Regent Park  Baker St    it was perfect to go to Wembley Stadiun as from the stop in Baker St only took    min  with the Metropolitan line It was fine for the price we paid  
N =>  highly recommend for a city trip We stayed for   days Very close to all important things to see in London  the undergrond only    minutes away  very easy to use  Staff very very friendly  room small but OK and very clean Over all  it was a very very good long weekend Would sertenly come back to the same hotel on a next trip Tumbs up   A lot of thanks to the staff of the hotel  hope you read this reaview to    Belgium greats you all  
N =>   Could be so much better with a little more care Totally agree with all that was said in previous review by Superkev  We had exactly the same experience but were not wise enough to ask for a better room  so were stuck with the miniscule double room on the first floor  enter the room via washroom   If only they cared a bit more about cleanliness the room size wouldn t have mattered  but unfortunately a clean room is the most important aspect for me  Cobwebs  dirty carpets  grubby toilet  and marked walls are not acceptable and therefore I cannot recommend this hotel  It s a shame because breakfast  location and free hot drinks were all excellent  
N =>   The price is right  Booked this Hotel over the internet a couple of weeks ago   after hearing several good reviews about the accommodation  From the outside I must admit it didn t really look much  However stepping into the hotel itself proved to be a pleasant surprise The lounge and reception were clean with a modern touch and the staff were more than helpful    Upon receiving the room keys  my partner and myself made our way up to our room  on the upper floor   Instead of opting to walk the flight of stairs we decided to take the hilariously match boxed sized lift   which added to the character of the hotel if anything  not to mention it also gave us a good laugh Getting into the room was a problem  however this was only because of my inability to use door keys  Luckily a lovely room cleaner came to our aid The room itself was clean  modern and everything you could ask for considering the amount of money being paid   in short it had all the essentials  En Suite  Freeview T V  Landline Phone  Wi Fi  amp  Hair Dryer   Breakfast was simple continental breakfast which served its purpose just fine and offered enough variety  Overall I would highly recommend this hotel anyone looking to go to London on budget   you won t be disappointed  Forgot to also mention it is literally     minutes from ylebone and Baker Street stations with various shopping outlets and food chains scattered around  Would stay again and recommend to friends family  I d also advise anyone to London to grab some tickets to Blood Brothers at the Phoenix Theatre   a fantastic show  
N => Good location   pity about the racket Room was tiny  amp  very basic  but was clean Great location     mins walk to Baker St underground which will get you to most places easily  Oxford Street about    mins walk  For the price  it was fine but beware if you like to lie in of a morning   building work next door was very loud  amp  started about      every morning  Likely to be going on for next few months   
N =>   so so Tiny room  but the toilet was good  I can t understand why they don t have a TV remote controler  To turn TV off  you should move from your bed  The staffs were kind  but not that much bright  Everything was so so  
N =>   Tiny and dirty The room fit the bed with one foot around each side of it  We had trouble fitting our two backpacks somewhere  The shelf above the toilet was covered in hair and there were dustbunnies and a rotting avocado under the bed  When we mentioned it to the front desk and check out he replied  quot Well it s up to YOU to tell us if its dirty  so it s your fault too  quot  That was great to hear  The hotel was very worn  the room was tiny and filthy  Definately would not stay here again  we were very disappointed  
N =>   Pleasant Surprise  We  me and my fianc   stayed in Hotel Americana in London from    to          Hotel room was really small  but tidy and surprisingly modern considering         Reasonably priced hotels in London can be really dodgy and located far away from transport network  Staff was helpful  breakfast was okay and location was great Only a couple of minutes walk from Baker Street tube station and a bus station across the street  So even the tube strike couldn t ruin our stay   Even though hotel was located near main streets of the area  there was no noise I will definitely recommend this hotel to my friends  when they visit London      
N =>   careful  Please don t use a credit card at this hotel  I stay in there for   nights in april        When I did my check in I presented a VISA  just for a PRE authorization  since at that time I was not sure about the method of payment  cash  credit card  When I checked out on april    I decide to use another card  an American express  instead of the VISA  All the debts were charged to that AMEX card Nevertheless  when I checked my cards balance  I verified that THEY BILLED BOTH OF THEM    I had an enormous headache dealing wtih VISA and AMEX trying to cancel the undue debt Therefore  there was a large bad faith and actually robbery My advice  if you had to stay at this hotel  pay cash  
N =>   Friendly and good staff  Two persons stayed four nights in july      in a two bed room downstairs  The room seemed to be newly renovated  everything worked well The staff were more helpful and careful than we are used to from many other hotels and they were so friendly A good experience  
N => Poor hotel despite good postion  Big problems here  Not very clean  Regretfully paid for   nights in advance  Believe me i was prepared for small rooms  as long as the rooms were satisfactory  But they were a genuine health hazrd  The first night we were woken up to a noize of a airconditioning vent just outside our window  Made the noise of a jackhammer  repeatedly went off and on  They changed our room after we complained the next morning  This one was ok but very not clean at all  Shower is ridiculously small to the point where you can t even wash properly  TV didn t work properly and just went off occasionaly for no reason  The staff are nice enough but they themselves admit the manager doesn t look after the place properly  Breakfast is ok  The position is good  but do yourself a favour and give this place a miss  
N =>  Beruit was better Possibly one of the worst hotels  I use that word loosely  i have ever had the misfortune to stay in Booked in for two nights could only manage one The room was filthy  carpets disgusting  bedding alive  light fittings hanging off the walls  wardrobe door was lying next to wardrobe on floor  The bathroom had permanent waterfall from taps and shower did not work  tiles loose with water stains on the roof and walls    we won t mention the toilet  Avoid at all costs   
N =>  Also not impressed Very small but that was expected  But not well maintained  Bed coverings were shabby  carpet dirty  bathroom ok but not especially pleasant  Hot water came and went   you just didn t know when  Sheets directly on the mattress  no pads  But clean towels each day and bed made  Pleasant people at the desk  Excellent location  Great price  All in all  a mixed bag  
N =>  small but convenient Stayed for   nights  Our room was tiny but the location was very convienent and the price was reasonable  
N =>  Not Impressed This hotel was not very impressive  It does have a good location but there were several odd problems  The shower was rusted  the tiles were missing  the room was tiny  the bedspread was very damp  wet  and worst of all bed bugs  If you are willing to put up with that for the price they charge  then its great   On my way back through London  for    pounds more I found a much much much nicer hotel in the Oxford Circus Area  
N =>  Hated this place I stayed in this place one night in tember  I was put in a room which was very  very small and absolutely disgusting  Shower stall was moldy  linens were not clean and the staff told me that management did not really care about upkeep of the hotel Do not stay here Terry 
N =>  Pleasant stay in good area A pleasant place in good area  near the Baker Street Tube Station   Rooms very small but clean with coffee tea  phone  TV  Personnel helpful  Cold complimentary breakfast was just enough  Nothing special  but comfortable and quiet  we were on the back side   Good location for walking to lebone Road  Regents Park  and Baker St  Tube Station  We d stay here again  
N =>   Twas dandy My husband  our one year old son  and I stayed at the Amsterdam Hotel for   days and it was just what we needed  I did a lot of background research on Trip Advisor and other sites in order to find a relatively affordable hotel with a kitchenette and the reviews of this hotel are perfectly accurate  Judith is incredibly helpful  We arrived very early  they have a   pm check in and our plane arrived at      am  getting us to town around       I think she was none too pleased to see us so early  but immediately set about trying to accommodate us  She let us rest in a twin suite until our full sized suite was ready   something she certainly did not have to do  It was so helpful   we were all exhausted and had a very good nap  That suite was suite     two twin beds and small bed  living  and bath rooms  but would be great for a pair of friends  We eventually were put in Suite    a ground floor room facing the back of the building  so quiet and with plenty of room for the baby to play around  It was great for us  While the carpets and draperies should be replaced  the linens  kitchen  and bathroom were very clean and the staff were great about not disrupting if the baby was sleeping  Breakfast was fine   nothing to write home about  but fine  All the staff were very helpful and sweet  Really a perfect place to stay with a baby  Oh  and the location really was great   everything we needed was a block or two away  
N =>   Highly recommend  location   very very good    min walk from earls court tube station which link to numbers of tubes  room   small but welcoming   room was clean rating      decoration was ssimple but nice  the only down side i would say the bed was very hard n wasnt comfartable at all  the hot shower on the other hand was awesome  the water preassure was very very good staff   was helpful at all timebreakfast   was catered in a small room downstair  the room was pretty small but didnt rwally bother us  the food was basic cereals  jmilk  uices  breads and jams overall   locationwise  i would return if its just for short trip due to the location from the tube  but for more days i would probably look out for other options due to uncomfy bed   
N =>  Good Value  My wife and I just got back from London after spending   nights here We found the hotel thru reading reviews in tripadvisor Our expectations were met  It is true that many of the staff are non locals  but it is very seldom that we experience such friendly  helpfull and service minded staff that we did here We booked the room thru booking com an in the cheapest category  Even this category was nice  The room had a compact bathroom  so there was not much space to put your toiletry items  but we made it work  Otherwise the bathroom was modern and convenient The actual hotel room was not large either  but it had a comfortable king sized bed and all in all it was set up tastefully  The best part was that the room was very quiet Continental breakfast was included in our rate  It did not consist of many items  but got the job done  They actually had the option of pre ordering e g  eggs or omeletts for only  pounds extra  but we could not be bothered to do so  We could never be sure in forehand if we would make it for breakfast or not  The location of this hotel  in it s price range  is just great  It s like   minute walk from the Earls Court tube station  We could get to all the major sights in no time  Other things worth mentioning  Free daily news papers  free wireless access in the rooms  two free to use computers and a printer next to the breakfast room  There we also found brochures for many of the towns attractions  In addition the notorious   Judith and her team printed displayed daily weather forecasts and other information sheets for the guest  which we found handy to check out before leaving to explore the town Actually I would have given them a five if they had change the sheets even once  When we arrived I noticed that the bedsheet was clean  but had some dark stains on it   Nothing Major  but still    We could not be bothered to complain of such a small thing so we decided just to wait until the next day that we assumed that they would have changed them anyway  but instead they just made up the bed and didn t change the sheet even once  We stayed   nights  eventhough these stains were located just on top and could have not been missed by anyone  Well they didn t  so four it is  
N => Don t ever think of staying in this hotel  I booked a room in this hotel at the beginning of this year for the month of   but lost afterwards all the messages I had in my Inbox  I therefore sent an email to the hotel asking them to send me all the details of my booking as I had made different bookings at the same time and did not remember all the details  No answer to my message   As they did not answer I changed my plans and cancelled the trip  In spite of everything they have charged me for the first night of my non  quot stay quot  in the hotel  I sent them a new message asking them to release the amount  of course  with no answer or reimbursement of the amount from their part  I think this kind of behaviour cannot be tolerated by anyone as they exist as long as we pay them and in order to pay them they have to render high quality services and this begins with answering emails from existing or would be customers  
N =>  Small hotel with a big heart We stayed in a family room  Bathroom was rather small but otherwise a very comfortable room with all amenities Very close to underground but it is so quite you would not notice  Excellent breakfast  Extremely well located to travel both around and out of London  The hotel staff left an unanounced birthday cake on new year s eve  my wife s birthday   which was an extremely nice and unexpected gesture  Had a slight mishap with credit card but staff was very helpful  This small hotel is surronded by takeaways etc so you have a choice of food  I came to London several times but this is the best I have stayed in so far  
N =>   Good Value For Money Hotel By London Standards Chose the Amsterdam Hotel after reading reviews on Tripadvisor  as required a hotel at a reasonable price that was in close proximity to the Chelsea Flower Show and were not disappointed  Having arrived at Heathrow  it was a simple matter of just catching the Tube  as the hotel is ideally situated on the Picadilly line  hence did not necessitate any train changes  The room was of a good size  nicely furnished and was extremely clean with the only issue being at times the water pressure  toilet   shower  was intermittantly lacking but was not a major concern  All staff were very friendly and helpful A continental breakfast was provided which was basic but adequate  with the option to request a cooked breakfast the night before  if so desired  Note  Breakfast room is on the small side and at times there was a slight wait  although hotel was totally booked out at time of our visit   Hotel also offers free internet service with printer access which was quite beneficial All in all  the Amsterdam Hotel offers good value for money and would certainly stay there when next visiting London  
N =>   fascinated We enjoyed our stay very much and are due to stay again this weekend  I was fascinated that both of the bad reviewers didn t even stay at the Hotel     
N =>  Well located but a tight fit Straight from Heathrow to Earls Court by train  Booked over internet  Generally Good service  Room not ready on arrival  Internet access with free printing   great  Simple but good breakfast  The room was small  One bed we had to climb up over the end because the bed went from wall to wall  Great eating places around the hotel  This was the cheapest of all the hotels in this area  Would use again if I had a tight budget  
N =>   Shocking After reading many positive reviews I was shocked by my experience I tried to book directly on the hotel s website  it was asking for private data  name  address  credit card details etc  without the use of an  https  page  An https is important because it means your data is secure  to some extent  throughout a transaction  Anyway  I decided that because they did not use https it would be safer to call up and book over the phone  little did I know    On my first call I spoke to a foriegn person who could not speak English very well at all  it was completely broken with lots of pauses  erm s and ahh s  I could not understand what he was saying and he seemed to struggle understanding basic words   it was the kind of English I would expect at a foreign hotel  Anyway  I decided it would be easier to email the chap withmy details  he asked that I send my credit card number via email to confirm the booking and I thought this might be a bit dodgy but should be OK so I did it anyway  stupidly   In my email I asked him to call or email me to confirm recipt as it contained card information  I recieved no reply that day so the next day I decided to call and find out whether the booking was confirmed  This time a lady answered the phone and her english was worst then the guy from the previous day  what a joke  I this made it very very difficult to communicate my issue to them  She asked me to email them again and that she would check the email straight away and reply to confirm  So I emailed and again no reply  I waited an   hours and no reply so I called them back  The staff member then proceeded to tell me she was very busy while huffing and grunting down the phone to me and told me she could not check my email had come through or confirm whether they had booked a room for me  I insisted and then she rudely made more noises down the phone and went to check  On return she had found the second email and not the first   however both emails were sent to exactly the same email address  alarm bells started ringing in my head   I asked whether they could search for the first email again then it sounded like another reception member  this time english speaking  snatched the phone from the initial member of staff The new staff member was very abrupt  rude and not willing to help  she said they had not recieved the first email and asked me why I had sent my card number via email to them  when I replied that a staff membr instructed me to she did not have much to stay  I decided I had wasted enough time trying to book this  mickey mouse  organisation s hotel and told the lady on the phone to cancel any reservation etc  She was again very rude and did not once apologise or offer to investigate  If she had  I would have booked    So my advice   be very careful about this place  no one seems to speak proper english and if they do  they are very rude and I would definately not trust them with card details  I cancelled the card straight away  
N =>   Morst luxurious budget hotel in London I read about the Amsterdam hotel on Tripadvisor and thought I would give it a try  All I can say is wow   I was not disapointed  Everything in the room was spotless  had a great nights sleep in the really comfortable bed and the continental breakfast was excellent  Would reccomend this hotel to anyone traveling to London  
N =>   What a treasure  I booked this because of the reviews on Tripadvisor and I wasn t disappointed  It was an absolute treasure  The room was immaculately clean  just the way I like it and location is fantastic  just around the corner from Earls Court Station so you can get to Heathrow very quickly  Free internet was a great service and Judy was so helpful  she was just great  My friends also stayed and their room was just as clean  just slightly smaller but had a step out balcony  Only downside I could see was the lack of ventilation in the bathroom and the shower curtain not quite reaching the floor so it got a little wet and slippery  I probably wouldn t stay in summer as it doesn t have A C  Leaving windows open would be no probs though  not very noisy  
N =>   High expectations So many nice words have been said about this hotel  Our opinion is based on a four nights stay in two quite different room from each other  The other was refurnished and modern  the other not in so perfect condition  Room rate was the same for both of the rooms  The rooms had some problems with the bathroom  Breakfast was boring   more than the toast and marmelade still Okay  but not great experience for our group of four  
N =>  Three argies in London I stayed at the Amsterdam for    days with my two teenage children  and all I ve got to say about it is good  From the begining  I booked my room directly by e mail  and I always had a kind and quick answer to my questions  We arrived early in the morning and we could leave our luggage in the hotel until the check in hour  and when we return  the suitcases were already in our room  The manager  Judi  help us with our notebook to connect us to the wi fi  and she spent more than an hour trying to find how to do it  and she did it  of course   She was always very helpful although our language problems  we don t speak english very well   I have to mention the young man who stays at the evenings  whose name I don t know  but I want to thank him because he always had a kind word to us  and he made us feel a little  quot at home quot   The room was excellent  it was a little hot because we had some really hot days  but as soon as I ask for a fan they gave it to us  and we could sleep very well  The continental breakfast was excellent  the cleanless of the room was spotless  all the room was decorated in a cream colour  even the floor   the wi fi was always perfect  even when we were in the fourth floor  and we spent    great days there The only two tiny things were the bathroom and the elevator  but I already knew it since I have read the reviews at Trip advisor  and I really didn t care about it The neighbourhood  Earl s Court  is great  there is a lot of restaurants  fast foods  supermarkets  and the tube station so near that we didn t have any problem to move to anywhere I recommend this hotel to anyone  it is great and in good price to be in London 
N =>  Good location clean but shower could use some help We stayed at the Amsterdam Hotel in the beginning of e  the first stop on a    day trip  We arrived early at the hotel  around   am  and the hotel staff accommodated the storage of our luggage until our room was ready  The room  The room was small  but very clean and well furbished  the bathroom was a bit small  but you will get used to that in Europe unless you constantly stay at the riott or want to pay heaps of money for your space  My one complaint about the otherwise nice bathroom was the tiny shower with the nearly useless shower curtain  Every time you showered  you could not help but flood the bathroom floor as the shower curtain leaves about   inches of space in between itself and the bottom of the shower  Each time we showered we had to mop up the puddles with towels to avoid slipping on the floor and the otherwise uncomfortable feeling of a constantly wet floor  Not a deal breaker  but that could have been better  Major pro of the hotel was the convenient computers downstairs complete with printers so you could print boarding passes  directions  etc  I m not sure if I d stay here again  as we did pay a pretty penny and I don t feel like it s a must stay  Although most of the staff was pleasant enough  we did have some problems with the efficiency of the check out process and the hotel was insistent on not getting us extra towels to mop up our shower puddles  
N =>   Great location but our room was too noisy Hotel room size was typical size for London rooms  small but not tiny  Bathroom was modern and good size  We had a room overlooking the street  As there is no airconditioning we had to open the balcony doors for air but this meant that we experienced noise from the street and felt slightly unsafe as occupants of adjoining hotel rooms  who share the same common balcony  could enter our room if they were that way inclined  Location of hotel was great  very close to Earls Court tube station  Tube station is also on the same line to Heathrow however we found this line to be unreliable when we were there  we experienced delays of over    minutes and were close to missing our flight  
N =>   Good location We stayed two nights at this hotel  The location was great  being a few minutes walk from the Earl s Court tube  There were many places to eat nearby  and it was easy to either walk or catch the tube to tourist sites  The room in which we stayed was quiet and clean  though small  The bathroom was tiny by international standards  Older travellers may find it the stairs hard to climb if they are more than one floor up and unfit  There is a lift which can be used however  though it is very small   
N =>   Nice but smells This hotel was a very good deal  The location is GREAT  It is very close to the tube  Earls Court  and a couple good restaurants  They also serve a decent free breakfast and have free internet  The room was spacious  or at least our triple was  We had a nice balcony  but it would not open properly  Now to the bad parts  we were constantly annoyed by the fact that there was a heavy smoke smell seeping into our room  I don t know where it was coming from considering the entire floor was a  quot non smoking floor  quot  It was very bad  Not coming from the balcony either  Also  most of the employees did not speak hardly any English  This is what London is turning into  but whatever  Also  the bathrooms were nice  but the showers were a disaster  The stand up shower was TINY and the fabric shower doesn t hold in the water at all  Overall  I would highly recommend staying here in comparison to other places I have stayed at in London  This place was nice  btw  this is NOT a handicap accessible hotel  Book online  directly from the hotel  
N =>   Pretty Good Much as expected from the reviews I d read  Staff were very courteous and helpful  Contrary to what the website said no full English breakfast was available just eggs on toast for another     Wake up call was on time  I was next to the lift which was a bit noisy  Very clean  Good location very close to tube station  
N =>   Perfect place to stay Found this jewel of a hotel at TripAdvisor  and it was a perfect place to stay for me and my boyfriend for our one week holiday in London  We stayed in room number     and had a great view to a quiet little garden  The staff was extremingly helpful with everything from car rentals to restaurant recommendations  The room was spotless  clean and more than spacious enough for the two of us and the wardrobe had at least    hangers  We wil definetely stay here for our next trip to London  
N =>   Almost Perfect   My boyfriend and I stayed at the Amsterdam Hotel for   nights in mid il  It was our first trip to London and after reading     s of hotel reviews I finally chose this hotel  The experience was GREAT    almost perfect   The hotel is literally on top of the picadilly  and district  line which gave us great access to heathrow airport and the city  We arrived at     am but the staff were more than happy to hold on to our luggage during the day  When we returned to check in properly  our luggage was already in our room  small  but nice details    The room was absolutely wonderful   It was very bright  clean and had no carpeting  yippee   and the bathroom was spotless  On top of everything  our standard double contained   VERY comfortable double beds  The only thing that wasn t excellent was the hallway leading to the room    It was stuffy and smokey   BUT    this did not in any way transfer to the room  so who cares    Summary  Great staff  Great service  Great room  Great location  OK breakfast    almost perfect  
N =>  fabulous We loved this hotel  I almost hate to say how good it is to let the  quot secret quot  out  but the staff work so hard I want to send them business  My spouse and I stayed there for four days with our    year old in an absolutely charming and comfortable triple quad  Not a huge room  but VERY well designed  with a great little loft sleeping space  not for tall people   so a little  quot privacy quot  between parents and child  Staff  especially Judi  was absolutely wonderful  Lovely continental breakfast  plus Internet access  Spotlessly clean  Also  great location in Earl s Court    not a  quot posh quot  area  but very safe  felt like a  quot real quot  neighborhood  plenty of budget places to eat  yes  many chains  but many are good  plus plenty of decent  if not gourmet  neighborhood take out spots   and easy access to anywhere in central London by Underground  plus taking the bus was pretty easy too   Also  Oxfam  like a  quot Goodwill quot   shop nearby  if you need an extra sweater or reading material for cheap  
N =>   An Oasis of Calm in London My wife and I have just returned from a holiday in Guernsey  and included a one night stop over in London After much Trip Advisor research  we decided upon the Hotel Amsterdam  in Earls Court  This choice was made mainly due to the positive reviews posted about this hotel  and they were all true  From our on line booking  to the experience itself  everything was very well managed and efficient  I liked the e mail reminder  sent one week before travellng   hoping to see us soon   On finally getting through the  quot wonderful quot  London Underground traffic from Victoria  Gatwick Airport  to Earls Court  complete with luggage       turning into Trebovir Road was like another world of calm and peace    First impressions are often the most important  and the gleaming entrance door and steps set the scene for a very well run little hotel  Our room was very spacious by London standards  although the bathroom was smaller than normal  but perfectly adequate and very clean  The elevator is another experience entirely  and not for the claustrophobic or slightly larger guest   The view over the garden seemed very pleasant  although we could not do it justice over only one night  Breakfast was continental  with full English at a premium  which I think is a very good idea  as many people do not want a cooked breakfast every morning  if at all  Glad to have found the Hotel Amsterdam and will definately return when back in London  
N =>   A comfortable small hotel Our experience in London was wonderful and the Amsterdam Hotel was a perfect place for our reunion  We booked several rooms and stayed a week  The courtyard in the back is very comfortable for conversation  the breakfast room is delightful and the breakfast is delicious  We appreciated the two computers available to us  Judi  the manager  made every effort to be sure that our stay was comfortable and enjoyable  She was responsive to every request we had and went beyond our expectations to ensure a carefree holiday  Although our room was small  it was on the back of the hotel and was quiet  It opened onto a balcony and the breezes were welcomed  The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was small but quite clean  Judi told us that the bathrooms were scheduled to be remodeled in the near future  Earl s Court is a great neighborhood with stores  restaurants  pubs and the tube station within minutes  Judi allowed us to store our suitcase with her when we left for the lake country and had our same room ready for us with the suitcase in it when we returned for our last night in London     it felt like coming home  We will stay here again when we return to London  
N =>  Great Convenient Location Would be Happy To Return   Reading the reviews prior to my visit was a bit scary After having stayed at the hotel  I was very happy with my overall stay  I would definitely return to this place  Perhaps the only negative part of the room was the size of shower as its combined with the toilet and there was only a shower curtain to separate them  I stayed in a single room        but even with this little negative mark  I was happy with my room  Enjoyed the daily continental breakfast  Cereal  Toast  Canned Fruit  Orange Juice  Coffee  Tea  A Hot English Breakfast had to be requested the night before for an additional charge  I remember one day I requested a hot breakfast and this was served to me not long after I sat down  It contained an egg  ham  suages  potato  toast  Coffee  Tea  Orange Juice  The hotel had free wireless internet access if you have a laptop  You could also connect through one of their   computers  which for me where always available as I didn t carry a laptop  The staff was friendly and courteous at all times  Thanks for making my stay pleasant       
N =>  Excellent in every way  Just back from spending   nights at the Amsterdam  Was a bit dubious after reading various reports but nothing to be worried about  Everything brilliant  Location is literally only   minutes walk from Earls Court Tube  just around the corner but still situated in a quiet street  Very well priced   stg per night for double room including continental breakfast  cereal  fruit  juice  tea  croissants  amp  loads of toast   did try the cooked breakfast once but wouldnt recommend it  only     stg extra per person but not great  and plenty of food on offer with continental  The breakfast room was spotless as was the rest of the hotel and all the staff were extremely helpful all the time  When we checked in had requested double room with bath  were shown to room     which had   queen size beds and no bath  On returning to reception was informed that they were double beds  but they are not  and that is the only double beds they have in hotel  Did move to room    which had twin beds but had bath and much bigger bathroom  Very quiet spotless hotel with everything you could need   TV  phone  tea coffee making facilities  hot water and very good shower  Lift is tiny   only really fits   people but it works Thanks for great relaxing couple of days   would definitely have no hesitation recommending to anyone going to London for few days  Enjoy  
N =>  Do not be fooled    My wife and I stayed   nights at the Amsterdam Hotel on our honeymoon and looked forward to a quaint and cozy place to stay  as I was led to believe based on the photos and earlier reviews on this site   When we arrived it was quite the contrary The first sign of trouble was the extremely small lift that took us to our fourth floor room  avoid Room    at all costs   This lift barely holds two adults   nevermind the luggage you will likely have with you  The room itself was very strange  The ceiling had an unusual slope halfway through the middle of it making the room rather small  The absolute worst part was the  quot en suite quot  bathroom  I don t know how brits define  quot en suite  quot  but a normal human being does not take a shower in a bathroom where the toilet is two feet away and the water from said shower fills the entire bathroom because there is no separation between it and the rest of the bathroom   meaning you will be guaranteed a wet bathroom floor after each shower no matter what you do  it honestly felt like being in an RV   THAT SMALL   next was the  quot non smoking quot  facility  this place is touted as being a non smoking facility  but the first morning we were there  we smelled cigarette smoke outside our door  we thought it was some rude guests of the hotel  so i notified the front desk  i got a vague   quot oh really  quot  response  it became clear that we weren t dealing with hotel guests  but the employees of the hotel who were smoking    yes  the cleaning crew maids front desk clerks   all were smoking  unbelievable unfortunately  we already paid for our room in full and had no way out of this mess   otherwise  we would have gone as far away as possible from this place immediately the final straw came when we arrived from a night out and returned to find several people in our room fixing what was apparently a broken light switch or fuse box   that was the other thing   several lights in the room didn t work   because this couldn t be fixed until the next morning  it was a  quot safety hazard quot  and we were forced to stay in a far superior room  yes  even less than this  that reeked of sewage  see review below   it was probably the same room   ROOM      the one saving grace was that we didn t have to pay for that night the only two positive things i can say about the Amsterdam are the location to the earl s court tube station  the neighborhood itself is a bit dodgy   be careful around the station   and the complimentary Internet access  though a bit temperamental at times  it s really unfortunate because we were really looking forward to a pleasant place to stay   and to experience this on our honeymoon of all times was very disappointing  for those of you in the states reading this  i would compare this place to a bad Motel   room  because some Motel   rooms are not bad when you go in knowing what to expect  don t be fooled by the photos reviews on this site or their official site    
N =>  THE Hotel to stay at in London  
N =>  Bad Experience at the Amsterdam Hotel  
N =>   Accanto alla metro  
N =>   Accettabile  Un po  old style   
N =>   Bellissimo soggiorno all Amsterdam Hotel  
N =>   Ottimo hotel in Earls Court  
N =>   excellent hotel experiance  o  Great staff  great service  We chose Andaz due to location  Flying to fm Stansted it was very comfortable to be located so close to Liverpool Street Station  We really enjoyed the Hospitality of the staff  We requested early check in on arrival  No problem  we got our room at         after a few minutes of refreshments and registration  Spacious rooms  nice bars and resturants  We let the sommerliers at      guide us trough dinner with some excellent wines  Highly reccomendable  Thank you  Joris  o  
N => Excellent from check in to check out The hotel was wonderful from checking in to express check out  Our bags were carried in  we were settled into comfortable chairs we were offered drinks  an lovely and very welcome cup of coffee  and then check in came to us   what luxury  We obtained a cheap weekend deal  but the quality of service was unwavering  The rooms were simple  but luxurious  the bathrooms were spotless and the dressing gowns and slippers able to fit my plus size  The only slight down side for the bathroom was the height depth of the bath which made slippy dismounts from the shower a careful affair  We dined in the      restaurant on Saturday night and we haven t had such a lovely meal for a very long time  The service was truely excellent throughout and I cannot commend the staff more than enough   from the chambermaid  friendly and helpful  to the maitre d   far from snooty  we were made welcome  I would recommend the hotel to anyone  
N =>   Fantastic Fantastic service  fantastic room  overall stay   you ve guessed it   fantastic  
N =>   horrible HORRIBLE reception employees upon arrival we were greeted with smiles  But  withing minutes  the reception employee tried to overcharge us for our stay  We had booked a triple room through bookings com  which clearly said all taxes included  still the reception people tried to add taxes to our total  After a lot of  quot polite quot  dispute  they tried to charge us for the  rd person  Once they realised they couldnt  as we had a valid contract with them  we were denied entry to our room  which was previously said to have been ready for us   until noon  the normal check in time   The room was clean but nothing great  Bathroom clean also   rd person had to sleep on a roll away bed  Location is at the FAR END central London  not convinient for shopping or sightseeing  Metro station however was right next to the hotel  so no real problems there  My biggest shock was when I repeatedly asked for a map of the City of London  and was given a tiny A  size map of the area surrounding the hotel  Upon check out  while I was standing next to the reception i noticed that there was a drawer full of large folded maps the kind all hotels around the globe provide their customers with    NICE TOUCH  mini bar was stocked with   bottles of juice  cookies  and choc covered nuts daily  free of charge  
N =>   Fantastic room Really big  nice rooms  we upgraded to a suite  in a super convenient location  Service was a little slow at times and fantastic at other times      block to Liverpool St station  Several pubs and quick food in the area Will stay here again  
N =>   Modern Addition to the London Scene Arrived early morning from a flight from Australia hoping that my room would be available  Alas  although requested  there was nothing available  The clerk at check in was generally helpful and spent some time trying to find me a room  I could pay more to upgrade but I declined  I asked if I could use the showers in the Fitness Centre which he said was an option  why he did not suggest this when all I really wanted was to freshen up is beyond me   Int he end he found me a vacant room which was at a lower rate than I had booked  I had fears of entering the proverbial London shoebox sized room but was pleasantly surprised to find a room comparable in size to other cities  It was internal so the window looked into a central space but I suspect this made the room a lot quieter being near a busy street as well as Liverpool Station The room was modern and tastefully decorated with a comfortable king size bed  The inclusion of a  quot healthy mini bar quot  which has complimentary juices and water is a nice touch  ALso  free internet is also a great bonus  The Fitness Centre was also reasonable well equipped As for gripes  the air conditioning never seemed to make the room cool and the reverse of the hot water which never seemed to get hot Overall the hotel is at a reasonably high standard but there is some room for improvement  I would certainly stay there again  Proximity to the station and central London was excellent  
N =>  Lovely breakfast shame about the customer service Booked this hotel via lastminute com  surprise hotel   star  Paid     queen room with breakfast  but the rack rate wasn t far off this on the hotel s website  Good location  Rooms small  but quite stylish  Free healthy mini bar and internet  but not   hr free  Check in a bit of a free for all   no desk  Breakfast fantastic  lovely surrounds and excellent everything  Check out awful  spoiled by the hotel Line Manager  Alex  trying to charge us for one of our teenage daughters  Held us up for about half an hour  and totally spoiled the whole stay  The room was booked for   adults per room  but he was trying to charge us for a breakfast  We stayed calm  but he had us running around trying to prove this     After he went off to check himself  he grudgingly came back and let us off  Our booking was accurate    adults in each room  BEWARE  
N =>   Excellent hotel for vacation stay We recently returned from our visit to London and a one week stay at the Andaz Hotel  We  two adults and one    year old child  stayed in the open suite plan  The purpose of our stay was for a family vacation  Overall  we really enjoyed our stay at the Andaz  and plan to return during our next stay in London  We highly recommend this hotel Customer service is really important to us and we very pleased with the service provided by each of the Andaz staff members we interacted with  Staff members were quick and responsive whenever we called for assistance  extra towels  etc  The open suite plan is quite spacious  It provides a sleeping area  with a true king size bed   a work desk area  a sitting area  large sofa and ottoman   a small eating area and a nice sized bathroom  The room includes two LCD televisions  one in the sleeping area and one in the sitting area   a safe  a mini refrigerator  and two wardrobes  Our room was on the second floor in the corner  and had extensive windows  overlooking Bishopsgate and Liverpool Street   as well as vaulted  at least    feet  ceilings  The hotel as a whole and the room in particular were very clean  There were absolutely no issues with cleanliness over the period of our one week stay We found our room to be fairly quiet  even with its location on the second floor  While I did hear some outside noise the first Friday night  every other night was very quiet  There is the occasional sound of street traffic and sirens  but these were not very noticeable  The hotel and the rooms do have certain characteristics that might be awkward or unusual to visitors that are not expecting them  But  if you have read this and the other reviews  you should not be at all surprised and there should be no concerns  Additionally  once you are checked in  a hotel staff member should offer to show you the room and demonstrate its  quot unique quot  features  Take advantage of this  Numerous reviewers comment on the greeting check in  the lack of a formal check in desk   We really saw no issues with this  We were promptly greeted and assisted upon arrival  During high traffic times  it is easy to see how it could become difficult for the hotel staff to keep up with who arrived first  But  the Andaz seems to have responded by providing extra staff members  To operate the lights in the room  you do have to insert your key card into an electronic device attached to the wall just inside the entry way  The room s main lighting controls  switches  are also located just inside the door  There are secondary controls in the sleeping area on each side of the bed  A peculiar annoyance  though  is that there are no lighting controls within the bathroom  The bathroom s lights are controlled by the room s main switches  just inside the entry   Peculiar and annoying  but you do get used to it We particularly liked the location of the hotel   immediately next door to Liverpool Street station  Within minutes of leaving the hotel you are able to pick up breakfast inside the station  at one of many choices  and then hop on to one of the major tube lines  Nearby  within quick walking distance  is the Old Spitalfields ket with several options for dinner  One important note  If you plan to arrive before the check in time  I highly recommend that you call to confirm availability with the hotel  After years of travelling in the US  we have never had an issue arriving early and obtaining a room  If you read the Andaz reviews  you will notice that several reviewers  including us  encountered this as an issue  In our case  our flight arrived earlier than expected  our bags were the first off the chute and our shuttle left within    minutes of arrival  As a result  we arrived at the hotel around      AM  The hotel had been booked the night before and the room initially assigned to us was not available  as the current guest had not checked out yet  However  we worked with the hotel agent and he made arrangements to assign us to another room  which was vacant  but not ready  We were offered access to their gym and spa  to freshen up change clothes  and they held our bags  We chose to wait for the room to be made ready  While we waited  we were provided drinks and cookies and the hotel agent came by frequently to give us updates  as it did take awhile for the room to be prepared  While we certainly would have preferred to have rolled straight in to the hotel and into our room  the reality is that we were there earlier than the posted check in time  and we had not confirmed the availability before hand  We were quite pleased with the service we received during check in  despite the delay in obtaining our room We did not eat at any of the restaurants  and so I can not offer any reviews here  We received our express check out information and everything was exactly as it should have been  I always prefer to check out in person and was quickly and pleasantly assisted with this as well  We chose this hotel in part because of its affiliation with Hyatt  which we prefer within the US  I was not sure what to expect based on the mix of previous reviews  The hotel easily met and exceeded our expecations  We really enjoyed our stay here and will easily stay here again in the future  
N =>   Modern hotel with outstanding service My initial review of the hotel was going to be average as I had a couple of issues but the hotel went above and beyond in trying to resolve them and make sure that my stay was a good one  I checked in early morning after a trans Atlantic flight from New York and a room wasn t available  The hotel did give me access to the fitness club that actually had great private shower and changing rooms which was very welcome after my overnight flight  As I was about to head out to my late morning meeting  I was offered a room that had become availabe although it was not on a high floor as I had initially requested in my reservation  Despite my better judgement  I decided to take the second floor room as it gave me a little time to at least unpack and download emails before leaving for the day  I came to regret that decision that night as there was quite a bit of both street noise  people yelling from the bars around Liverpool station  as well as interior noise from people getting in and out of the elevator  the room was two down from the elevator   I asked to switch rooms the next day and the hotel did accomodate me despite being sold out  Unfortunately they moved me to a room where the air conditioning controls were broken and it was sweltering  I called the front desk and they said they d have the engineers fix the room temperature through the central controls and to give it twenty minutes  After thirty minutes  it was still uncomfortabley hot so they sent an engineer to the room to work on the problem while I went to the gym for a work out  I came back to the room an hour later and the room was relatively cool but the lights had stopped working  An engineer came up quickly to try to fix the problem and both he and the front desk was very apologetic  especially since this was my fourth or fifth call to the front desk   The engineer was obviously doing his best to help and he eventually fixed the problem after another fifteem minutes or so  Basically this more or less was a text book case of Murphy s Law but everything was eventually fine The hotel manager came and spoke to me personally the next day at check out to apologize again and gave me her card and told me to contact her directly for my next stay in London and they d be sure to take care of me  So good job overall on service recovery    As for the hotel  the public spaces are great and the rooms are clean and modern  The bathrooms are probably the best feature of the room as they are oversized and well appointed  The location isn t my favorite but it is easy to get around since Liverpool tube and train station is right around the corner  Definitely ask for a room on a high floor though and away from the elevators  
N =>   Nice place shame about the staff and the check in  We arrived fairly hot  amp  bothered after a long car journey to eventually find the unremarkable entrance  There was no doorman  so no help with luggage  The check in arrangements are shambolic  The staff have no I D  just hand held computers which they say help them give you a personal service  This may be true if you are the only person there  but its rubbish when there are several groups waiting to check in  There is no semblance of a queue so you sit  and sit  When we were checking out there was one poor woman who had been waiting for an hour and a half and still couldn t get into her room We had a complaint about our restaurant bill it took an age to find someone who was willing to take some responsibility  She said she was the guest services manager and that she would pass our problem to the day staff  Guess what happened next morning No one had the faintest idea what we were talking about  Check out time again a huge wait then an      quot unknown quot  amount on our bill  Again no manager to be found and when he eventually appeared his idea of dealing with our complaint was to give us a comments form They also want to charge you     per day for valet parking when it is possible to park on street all week end for        Go to Finsbury Circus  about   mins walk Oh  and the shower leaked  
N =>  standard not stylish OK  if you re making a comparison to a Hilton or similar  maybe Andaz has a few chops but it s really not anything to get excited about   our room lacked character and had a bathroom straight out of a suburban new build  There were also some pretty major plumbing issues   any toilet or shower use  in our room or those close by  resulted in a roaring nuclear detonation that made the room shake  Not great for a nights sleep  And dispensing with a front desk in favour of wandering staff with laptops just made check in a farcical  Stick to Threadneedles  Rookery or Zetter  
N =>  Would be great but snooty and rude staff disappoint   also very noisy great beds  great location  a little pricey   but could have been great except I was checked in and strugggling with two heavy bags  it was a hit day and I mist have looked a little frazzled but the bellboy outside did not offer to help  In fact I came in and out   times that day and each time he just looked down his nose at me  Then I wasn t ven shown to my room  just given a key It turned out my room was a long way from the lift and I had no help The next day my key card wasnt working  Again Iw as carrying a very ehavyy bag and ther was no apaolgy for me having to come abck down   twice  The second time the guy didn t seem to beleive I was staying in the hotel as I didn t have picture ID on me only a credit card  I had to wait    miuntes for a manager who then took me to my room  but no apology was offered It s experiences like this where thre s no acknowledgement of one s time hwich make you feel like you re bing ripped off  It s an expensive hotel a nd I felt taken for granted Also its  pretty noisy   take your ear plugs   
N =>   OK but take some ear plugs  A lot of money has been spent on refurbishing this former Railway Terminus Hotel and it s very slick and modern  Unfortunately I would expect to find a bar open at   pm  On returning to the hotel we found the George Pub was closed       bar was also closed and the only bar open was the champagne bar which was so noisy you couldn t hold a conversation  Our room had a vacuum operated toilet  like an aircraft  which was very noisy and the water system drained via a pump operated system which when people started taking showers at      in the morning was also very noisy  Writing this I m looking forward to a decent nights sleep in my own bed  Not what you expect for       
N =>  style over substance It is a beautiful hotel but falls short on a number of levels  Check in was efficient but receptionist did not explain vagaries of  key   Difficult to open door and when one entered the rom was pitch black and difficult to turn on lights   Key had to be inserted into spaecialdevice before lights worked     THe hotel bar was loud and service stopped before   am on a friday night  At one on the dot I was ushered out to a corridor lobby to finish my     cocktail  The next morning there was no available convenient socket to plug in the kettle  Also the hotel guide was overly designed and not easy to follow    On the plus side the bed was fantastically comfortable and the view from my small  room was lovely  
N =>   Pricy and breakfast disappointing  Could do better with special touches Got taken here for a weekend treat and first poor experience was a long wait in the check in queue as they do it on laptops  No doorman to greet and I was concerned that there are so many unguarded exits especially when you remember where it is  CCTV does not make me feel secure  The public areas were beautifully restored however this being a heritage building Room was nice and bed comfy but I was amazed to find few toiletries at this price  ONE bar of soap to share whilst he was in shower and I was in bath and NO bath or shower gel at all  Not very   star or is it meant to be   star  As a member of the baby boomer generation I did not feel very comfortable here although I did not feel like this at trendy W in NYC      was hosting a function so we ate in the other restaurant which was not busy but chefs could not tell us provenance of food or if it was free range even  Meal was not inspring Breakfast a major disaster for me as all from menu as individual orders  No soya milk  low fat spreads  or bread I could eat  crispbread or corn rice cakes  I ended up with a huge bowl of porridge  You should be able to get all this in a major European city these days  they should go to the Radisson in Berlin for ideas  There should be a buffet pick and mix option for guests as the breakfast area is open to the passing public for business meetings  Overall I think they could better unless this is just aimed at younger people and business types  
N => Contemporary stylish clean different but     Nice hotel  very handy for Liverpool tube station  and McDonalds Check in is a bit different  smart dressed staff with wireless laptops while you sit on a sofa  Nice Rooms  reasonable size  clean  smart  free movie channel  bathroom ultra clean and tidy  mind you sink drained slowly Fridge with a few free drinks in it   very good  But no mini bar of coffee facilities Safe in the room was good  lighting and furniture very contemporary  i Liked it Only downsides got back on Sat night at midnight after a show to find no bar was open  no coffee facilitiy in room so had to ask night porter to brew one up  which he did veyr helpfully   Lots of noise from a wedding  which was using best bit of the hotel   Went through an empty champagne bar  and main pub was shut  Looked really nice and was looking forward to ending with a drink so that was disappointing Breakfast was very nice  again hard to find dining room  staff at reception told us to go outside  walk down road and into next cafe which seemed odd but it worked  Excellent service  lots of staff  food was very good and quick  and all included Booked on lastminute com but it wasn t any cheaper than going direct  
N =>  very hip   if you like that sort of thing We stayed one night in this hotel late ust  and found it to be comfortable and user friendly  But its atmosphere leans more to the hip and funky than warm and welcoming  in my opinion  Plenty of positives to report  we arrived early and the staff gave us immediate access to a room  which was spacious enough  breakfast was complimentary and plentiful  location was ideal for walking    mins in most directions to landmarks like St Pauls  Shakespeare s Globe Theatre  amp  Tower of London  Also a few steps from Liverpool Street Tube station  which connects you to anywhere you want to go  But the hotel feels quite  corporate  and a bit dark and shadowy for my liking  By contrast we stayed in the same week at Hotel Threadneedles around the corner  which had a much more traditional  comfy  club like feeling  see my review on that if you like   In the end I think it boils down to personal taste  amp  style   cool  amp  funky versus warm and welcoming  
N =>   Over the top on trendiness and price The entrance to the Andaz is a bit difficult to find  I wandered the streets next to Liverpool station looking for the entrance  wondering if I had the correct address  I came to find out it was just due to very discreet signage  and the hotel is in fact  as indicated  right next to the station  Yes  as other reviewers have indicated  it is a very trendy and non traditional lobby and greeting  The gentleman that checked me in was very friendly  and showed me to my room  The experience as a whole was very nice  the rooms were clean  well equipped  and had some nice extras that you wouldn t find elsewhere  Free internet  free movies  free fruit juice and water in your room    However  all of these things have to be free to come close to justifying the price tag  I stayed here due to proximity to an office building where I was having meetings  but otherwise would have certainly looked elsewhere for a better value  On a Thursday night  they charged     sterling  In my opinion  about double what it was worth  So  while I would highly recommend this hotel if price were not a consideration  the price tag alone would prohibit me from staying here again  In fairness  on the weekends the rate drops significantly as business travelers are no longer the customer base  For the Friday and Saturday nights following my stay  it was only     sterling  Much more worthwhile  So if you re a weekend visitor  definitely check this place out  
N =>   Overall very good though lobby check in a bit different Very modernised lobyby lifts room   not sure that lobby was better for not having a reception desk but worked fairly well   staff were very helpful at all stages Room  bed and bathroom all good size  clean and comfortable Breakfast very good but service fairly slow  even for drinks   to be fair it was very busy but still a bit too slow   probably was    mins for drinks     mins for any food but arrived with US pancakes waffles as well as Englsh options and fresh croissants  Breakfast would have been very expensive   gt      for two  if not included in room rate Difficult to find way from front part of hotel to breakfast room  no signs  had to ask someone and it was very circituous  if we d known we d have walked around outside The old staircases had some great decoration  likewise the bar Valet parking was a very good helpful service Only negative was we asked for early check in  in advance  but they don t offer this as a feature  just said if you turn up early you might get it   as we were on a tight schedule to go to a wedding we couldn t afford to risk delay so had to travel up in our wedding clothes  Think at this level of hotel they should offer it to the extent available  or be clearer about it  
N =>  Andaz   Why oh Why have they spoilt it   Having been a regular patron of the Great Eastern Hotel  I have now stayed in its re incarnation  Andaz  twice  The first time  the hotel was full  so my only option of a room was the somewhat demure  Queen Suite    which didn t even have a bath   I found the new check in procedures OK  if a little  Gimmicky  but there was not the usual sense of  Nothing is too much Trouble  which was one of the Great Eastern s defining strengths I tried again a couple of nights ago   This time in a king suite       inc  tax    which is quite a handsome price   even in London  I had requested a smoking room    Sorry this Room is not a smoking room and we have none available anyway   I ordered a Mojito   and was served a weak Rum  amp  Soda with a sprig   well more acurately a flop of old wilted mint   it was thoroughly awful  The Bed was not kingsize  the bedroom too hot  the lounge too cold  the healthy bar   water and a couple of juices  disappointing And what on earth have they done to the place   The Gugennheim inspired tundra now has pretentious writings adorning  as do the lifts  ceilings   It is cultural vandalism   If this is what Hyatt brings to the party  they will not be getting my invite  I feel this formerly Conran Hotel was one of the best I had stayed in  whilst in its GEH guise  but the new  Hip  Andaz has left me with a bitter  and expensive taste in my mouth   I need to find a new base in London   
N =>   hotel design tr s bien situ    Victoria Station  
N =>   Sch nes Hotel aber schlechter Service  
N =>   Service Style und Special  
N =>   Worst Hotel ever I ve been in London  marvelous city  but I ve had to sleep in that horrible hotel  where everything was absolutly dirty  I could say even disgusting Please  the worst thing you can do is sleep there  It can even ruin your visit to London Why let  a city like London  it be open c  
N =>   Absolutly Disgusting Hotel Dirty  gross decor and generally unpleasant We were moved to this hotel after the one we booked was full  En suite facilities were a shower cubicle in the middle of the room  Would not walk barefoot or sleep in the beds  Only spent about   hours in the room  and that was far too much  Breakfast included  but we declined  The park bench opposite was far more appealing than the hotel itself  We could go on  but    
N =>  Do not go there    
N =>  horrible despreciable hotel  
N =>   Never again Take a leaf out of my book and do not stay in this place  If it wasn t for the fact that I went to London only for three days  ember        I would have taken my stuff and moved to another hotel  Justification    the worst of all   I booked the room via Internet and received no acceptance for two days  so called them again asking for any feedback   they said that my room was booked and that everything was ok  Mind you  I particularly wanted a single en suite  When I came to the hotel  the reception desk was closed although they knew the time of my arrival  Then a little boy came out and said that I was to take the room at Cedar Hotel  which was a part of Annexe  I went there and they told me that the room is ready  however  it was a double room with a sink  not the suite I booked     the room was quite shabby and the window did not close  thank god it was warm    the staff was very unfriendly   the other guests were mostly youths from different countries   so I guess if you want to party  you may have a try  but otherwise don t  
N =>  Do Not Stay Here DO NOT under any circumstances stay at this hotel  I booked a single with no facilities  However what I was given was smaller than my broom cupboard at home  It was also right behind the railway tracks entering Victoria railway station which meant constant noise throughout the night  The toilet was   floors away and the small fridge they provided didn t work  The location is good for Victoria coach station moreso than Victoria rail station  The staff at breakfast were fairly pleasent with a polite good morning  However the room was so dreadful that that these factors paled into significance  So do not be tempted by the price  DO NOT STAY HERE  
N =>   Good place for location and price My boyfriend and I originally booked at the Cedar Guest House through its web site for uary           but it turns out all the small hotels on this street are actually connected  Upon arrival  we were transferred to the Annexe Hotel  We had an ensuite double room  The room was tiny  the decor was ugly  and there wasn t any kind of customer service  But it was clean enough  not sparkling though    as in there weren t bed bugs or any other creatures  breakfast was provided  although we didnt take advantage of this   we got it at an excellent price     pounds night   and the location was close to public transportation and popular tourist sites  right off of Victoria Station   This hotel was adequate for us  but I guess it depends on what is important to you  
N => WARNING  Stay away from this hotel Arrived laden with luggage at the annexe hotel for a long trip the next day  We were greeted by a voice on the intercom who asked us our names  on answering his question we were then told that our room had been taken as we had given him the wrong credit card details and there were no available rooms left for the evening  Fortunately  as i had read some bad reveiws about this hotel and the way it conducts buisness  i had on my person the reservation details that i had printed from the internet  these had all my credit card details on them and woe and behold they were correct  He then proceded to try and tell me that he had tried to email me to let me know  which also happened to be a blatant lie  We had phoned twice to confirm our reservation and were twice told everything was fine  We then had a confrontation with him out the front of his hotel and were then told he had another hotel around the corner that we could stay at   what a shambles that hotel turned out to be  all in all our experience with the hotel annexe got our holiday of to a bad start and if this can stop other travellers from going through the same rubbish we had to then job done  
N =>  Customer Service  Firstly when we got to the reception they made us wait outside in the       cold for   min while they were inside doing who knows what When we finally got inside to the reception desk we were told that the Hotel had cancelled our reservation and had informed us of this via email and telephone  This was far from being true  as we were never informed of this So after being told of this we simply asked for another room  no problem the sign hanging up said Rooms Available  The nice man behind the reception said this was not possible because they were holding this for other customers  at           Anyways finally we left  what can you do if they say they cancelled our reservation without informing us  We proceeded to the Comfort Inn around the corner where they told us that people were turned away constantly from Annexe Hotel with the same problem     thanks Annexe Hotel for a great London stay  
N =>  Bad  will not stay again the room is small with bad smell  even though i booked the ensuit room but actually i have not take bath in the bathroom as it make me feeling not well  the price is not expensive but next time  it is better pay a little more to other B amp B rather than stay in here  
N =>   Service mediocre et chambres horribles  
N =>   Great hotel in a good spot   ideal for sight seeing and more  Booked the night before driving down to London   last minute idea for a long weekend The drive down from the north west was very easy and stress free  The hotel was also very easy to find  Arrived at the hotel at   past   and checked in straight away  Chose to stay in a  quot club room quot  which is just like a double room but with less empty space  More than ideal for what we wanted it for The communal areas and the room were smart and clean and looked to be recently decorated  There was a TV on the wall but we didn t stay in the room long enough to use it for more than as background noise before we went out The bed was good  the sheets clean  Bathroom was great  Clean with a good shower A tray with tea  coffee and hot choc with a kettle was in the room  Towels were fresh and clean  No thing really to detract I could even see my car in the car park from our window  Free parking too  Just what I was after The hotel was just down the road from Wimbledon town centre which had lots of shops of all kinds  So if you get hungry  bored or want a new top for the evening  you needn t worry  And Wimbledon train and tube station was less than    minutes walk from the hotel  Perfect We only stayed one night but could have easily stayed in the same room for a few more days  Storage space  shelves  etc  in the room was good and even a light sleeper like me slept well We checked out the next day without any fuss or faff  I even asked to stay in the car park as it looked very secure to me  An extra     charge was asked for but that was ok as I didn t have to worry about the car until we were ready to leave again All in all I would recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to visit London or Wimbledon especially if you are driving down  
N =>  Perfect Hotel friendly staff The hotel is perfect for me  the free parking was an added bonus  not a huge parking area so those that arrived late would not be able to get a space  it was only a five minute walk in to the main area of Wimbeldon shops and the tube in to town Takes about    minutues on the tube to get in to London on the tube The room was clean and spacious  though we did get given a bigger room than we had paid for  I did see another small double while I was there which looked the size of a shoebox  overall though I thought the hotel was ace and would definitely stay there again  
N =>  Forget it This is a handy hotel in terms of location and free parking  But we were assured our room s en suite would have a bath and it didn t  We were warned there was a wedding on but assured they d find a room for us away from the noise of the wedding   they didn t  and we heard everything  The room was completely basic as well  I can t see how it gets   star  let alone the   they claim it s worth  
N =>   We would suggest you avoid this hotel The rooms at the front of this hotel are on a busy noisy road making sleep impossible  We had booked two nights and when we complained the first morning  the receptionist said we should have asked for a back room  If we wanted a back room  and to sleep that night  we needed to pay a lot extra  If we cancelled  we would lose half the cost of the room  Both rooms were small and basic  The second room was quiet We were told that the attached restaurant had a     discount for hotel patrons  The restaurant also has a     mandatory tip  
N =>   Better after renovation Looking at the previous reviews there seems no doubt that this hotel has benefitted greatly from it s renovation  Everything was clean  fresh and new  The room was good  overlooking the Broadway  with decent air conditioning  the window needed to be closed in order to sleep   Flat screen TV on wall  altogether a decent room  Shower good   take your time to get the temp right because it gets hot  Front desk staff ok  Cleaner knocked and entered room one second later   bad habit  especially at   in morning   but this was the only slight negative during stay I got a     sunday rate for a single room through a website  At this price the hotel is absolutely exceptional  Generally I d say it would be decent value up to about     for a single  Certainly it was a lot better than the previous reviews led me to expect  
N =>  Budget Hotel at Premium Prices Stayed here on business and so glad I wasn t paying the bill  The hotel has been recently refurbished  but obviously on a tight budget  I had exec room with balcony   the room was clean  bed clean and comfortable  new flat screen tv   but generally souless   travelodge style furniture  low quality tea coffee on hospitality tray  no minibar or fridge  Bathroom was clean plenty of hot water but the towels were small and low quality At       the breakfast was a complete rip off  they boast a buffet with    items to choose from   thats a joke  Tinned fruit  no croissants or pain au chocolat  cooked breakfast not that great  This is a hotel which loves to use economy branded products but charge high prices  And don t be tempted to ask for a cafe latte   that ll set you back       for a cup  The staff were friendly and welcoming  Not much choice of hotel in Wimbledon so will be coming back due to business commitments but will buy breakfast offsite and get my coffee from Starbucks   
N =>   Ordinary We decided to select The Antoinette based on cost and the fact that there are very few alternatives in the SW   area  The hotel promised much but delivered very little  Our main difficulty was the communication problems experienced with staff  We know London is a cosmopolitan city but surely we should be able to communicate with each other effectively  Service was brisk and unwelcoming and didn t improve at any time during our two night stay  we thought this was due to language barriers The hotel seems to be undergoing a refurbishment with associated difficulties for guests  Overall a basic experience but our time in Wimbledon was pleasant despite the hotel selection  
N =>   Excellent location in Wimbledon My wife and I recently planed a trip to London  we wanted to stay out side of the centre  mainly due to costs  but also to see a bit of the surrounding areas   We opted to stay in Wimbledon as there is good links to the centre  both mainline and the underground   Having trawled the internet we found the Antoinette Hotel  the prices seemed reasonable and locality to the station seemed ideal Well  we were pleased with our choice  the hotel is undergoing a complete refit  but this did not impact on our stay at all  The room was of a good size  very clean and had everything we needed  It was situated only a    minuet walk to Wimbledon station   and only   minutes from South Wimbledon tube station  The staff were very attentive and there was even on site parking  a bonus so close to London   
N =>  don t go there    staff were friendly and informative  The hotel was of a very poor standard  The first room we were in had mould on the ceilings and windows and all round the bath  The window was broken and it was boiling hot  The toilet was not clean   We changed rooms   and this one was better but the decor was very tired  We were greeted by building work in the reception which was quite noisy in the morning  Even for London standards it was way over priced  Do not believe what you see on the website  I don t know where they got those pictures from but they definitley weren t taken in that hotel    
N =>   enjoyed stay Comfortable bed and staff v  friendly   will be returning as close to work  look forward to eating in the new restaurant 
N =>   Poor but very cheap   so acceptable From the outside it looks good  The location is very good   both for the area around and for excellent access to the tube  In some dim distant past it probably was a good hotel  under different management and a different name  It has clearly had little or no investment in years  though several very large and heavy boxes of something arrived in the lobby during our stay   which may be a good sign   It has also had precious little maintenance down the years   however our room had a sleepable bed  and functioning bathroom  Carpets were stained  some dirt stains  more bleach stains where really stubborn dirt stains had been removed   The phone didn t seem to work  but that was not a concern to us  The room was very small   we had luggage for a short stay  not a long one  so that was OK too Lift was Out of Order   a narrow staircase had to be used  With light luggage and on floor   this was OK  With heavy luggage or limited mobility this would be a nightmare  Other reviewers also say the lift was out of order  so it seems this is a long term thing  unless those boxes are lift machinery  Another reviewer noted that the heat in their room was off and that it was cold  When we arrived our room s heat was off also  but there is a thermostat valve at the end of the radiator   room cleaning probably switch it off when they clean  If you don t recognise it for what it is  then the heat will stay off   UK visitors will recognise it  others will not and will not be told unless they ask  When we turned the valve on  the room rapidly became more than warm enough  but we eventually got the level right Staff were pleasant  amp  helpful   They let us check out an hour late with no problem and no extra charge  Staff also had no problem with us bring back take away food late at night and eating it in the breakfast room  did we mention the rooms are small   provided we cleared up after ourselves No review of breakfast because we slept late In summary  just about adequate for     days   but only because of low price  good location and accommodating staff  
N => Disgusting     The hotel is absolute disaster    Smelly  dirty  Tiny rooms and again very unclean  Bathroom and toilet   well  have no worlds to describe  absolutely below any hygienic standards   Breakfast was served by very unfriendly lady and again lack of cleaning everywhere  So if you don t want to ruin your impression about London  don t even think to stay at this place   I really don t understand how this hotel got even   stars and why authorities who is responsible to look how hotels keep standards don t close it down   
N =>   Forget It Keep looking I had read the reviews before booking this hotel for   nights and thought it couldn t be that bad  I was wrong I was in a room on the  th floor and was advised that the lift was currently out of order  looking at the sign on the elevator it had been out of order for some time  After finally carrying my bags up the   flights of stairs I left the hotel to explore London  I arrived back at the hotel at approx  pm to find that the TV was broken and with no phone in the room to contact reception I decided I would read    minutes after turning on the light I was in darkness and I was sure I was not going to do the stairs again Following morning I reported the problems  light was fixed but the TV was never attended to  I checked out early and found a hotel for the same rate that was  quot The Ritz quot  compared to this disgustingly dirty hotel  On the upside the majority of the staff were very helpful  
N =>   Disaster The receptionists were very kind  Elevator was broken  so we had to climbe the dirty stairs four floors every day  The carpets meet the quality of a zero star hotel in Bombay  We think London authorities should close this hotel  
N =>  NOTfor Americans We arrived there exactly one month to the day from t    th   despite what dates say  Being Americans  this was a clearly Muslim owned hotel  we were the only Christians there  the rooms were complete with little arrows on the ceiling pointing towards Mecca   besides being filthy  very uncomfortable situation and had we been able to change hotels we would have    
N =>   don t expect much When we checked in  receptionist let us choose a room for   from   different types double twin   That was kind of them  The double room was tiny  You could barely walk around a bed  Its bathroom had no tub  Dirty carpet  The next twin room was abit larger    twin beds  One bed blocked a closet doors  so had to push one bed away from the closet everytime     Bathroom had a tub and good hot water pressure  No shampoo conditioner  But its door didn t open all the way  It opened inward and stuck because of a toilet  I was lucky to be slim enough to squeeze myself in and outof the tiny bathroom  Bed linen was worn and shabby  Didn t want to walk barefoot inside that room  noise from next door was sometimes disturbing  Breakfast was nothing but rolls  jam amp butter   cereal with milk  OJ  Coffee and Tea  We didn t eat much during the stay  However very convenient location  Bus stop was   min away    hr bus also runs    Min to Queensway Tube station  Bayswater station is also short walking distance  There were lots of restaurants  pubs and shops around Queensway  
N =>   The worst hotel ever  I stayed their for   nights it was the worst experience ever  I never write any review for hotels  but this  it s not a hotel  Since then I have backacke because the bed it was the most uncomfortable bed  The toilet and everything was dirty  It was a nightmare     
N =>   We wish we had seen this site before we booked All the other reviews truly describe the disgusting state of this  quot hotel quot  It is small and shabby  a double bed in a single room  a bathroom that is really a  wet room  We feel sorry for the staff that work there surely they can get another job at a better hotel The breakfast was so basic  to call it a continental breakfast has to be against the trade description act   roll toast  cereal  diluted fruit juice This type of  quot hotel quot  gives a bad impression to other hotels in the neighbourhood which from the outside look a lot more appealing Under no circumstance would we recommend staying at this DUMP to anyone D and L 
N =>  small and dirty i am not one to moan about hotels  but i feel i ought to give my opinion about this hotel  ok it is cheap  and in a good part of the city  but it was very dirty and very small  all the light fittings were broken  as was the TV  the carpet was filthy and covered in bits  the bed sheets were clean but the top cover was dirty and had cigarette burns in it  the bathroom was also small but fairly clean  but the toilet seat was broken  it cost us     per night for the room  is this filth to expected for that amount of money  i dont know you decide  
N =>   Disgusting What a disgusting dump  Nothing functioned  not even the elevator  everything was old and filthy  no service at all  The matress  springs poked out in the beds  The worst place I have ever stayed in  we left after one night even though we had payed for two  but we were glad to  just to get away  
N =>  Good location for film makers making movies of down and out in London On arrival in London on the evening of the   th e   my girlfriend checked in at the hotel to be told that there was a power fault on the floor our room was situated   and that we would have to move hotels   She was subsequently told that the hotel was undergoing refurbishment  Other people were checking in successfully   notably a large party of Japanese tourists   We were moved to across the road  the Hotel An Nur  This was the grubbiest hotel I have had the misfortune to stay in  The floor our room was located on had a filthy carpet with stains as did our room   The room was extremely small   and had a broken down curtain rail  There were cigarette burns in the curtains  There were no coffee or tea making facilities   and there were stains on the bathroom and shower floor  Really unacceptable    as my girlfriend stated  it was like a film location for intravenous drug users  I went across to the original hotel and asked for alternate accommodation  I was told that the hotel was full  quot  due to Wimbledon  quot    and that no other hotels rooms were available  I asked how other guests were able to receive rooms when my booking was made two weeks earlier  and secondly that no attempt had been made either by email or phone to inform me of the situation  No adequate reponse was given  We had no choice but to stay in the room  then speak to the day manager the following morning The day manager was helpful  in that he apologised   and informed us compensation would be available through your website   We were not the only patrons who had made complaints re the hotel An Nur after being moved Copy of my complaint to the booking website  I received     compensation of my cost for this     My heart goes out to the newly weds in the previous review who had the bad luck to stay there too   
N =>   Would not stay in An Nur again I was travelling in London with a larger group of whom many had stayed in London before so we knew what to expect from the cheap hotel  We chose this hotel since it was advertised in tour operator catalogues and we thought it is at least somekind of guarantee of the Hotel quality  We were wrong   I seriously wonder if this hotel has really been checked by those travel industry people who sell it for tourists  Staff seems to speak many languages  except English  Stairs are hard to climb with suitcases  Rooms are lousy   even by the  quot London standards quot   Yes  the bathroom is really tiny  but I guess you cannot expect anything else with the room of a shoebox size  One colleague of mine even had to sleep with her hat on   the window was broken and could not be closed even for the night  The breakfast deserves hardly to called  quot a breakfast quot   its mainly coffee and bread  not much else  The location is good  but consider paying few pounds more and get a real hotel  
N =>  Nothing to fear  I stayed there with my wife   th   th       my last stay at this hotel was in       The room bathroom was small and a bit worn  but clean and tidy  The breakfast area was nice  and the food OK Our room was at  th floor  and with the elevator out of order we got some good exercise as well  Cheap hotel  to be in London   Good value for money  Helpful staff  
N =>   Great place to stay on business Stayed for two nights nearing the end of a long week working in London  Getting to the hotel was like coming home  The front desk staff couldn t have been friendlier nor more accomodating  My room was available right away  Room was clean  large for UK standards  huge comfortable bed  Lovely large bathroom with modern seperate shower  Two people could easily negotiate this bathroom  Complimentary water in the rooms was nice too  Didn t have dinner in the restaurant  but did have beverages  Bar is open until   am  which is nice since most places close at    pm  Close to tube stop and tower of London  Agree with other reviewers  don t know why this is a   star property as it was easily   in my opinion  Only challenge was getting a taxi in the morning during rush hour  On a side street  so I had to take a quick walk to the tube station   little effort considering all the good things  
N =>   NICE ENOUGH Friends and I stayed at this hotel in tember  had the basic room  Very modern  but rather impersonal I thought  Breakfast was lovely as they come and take your order from the breakfast menu   nice to be looked after by someone rather than the buffet style for a change  Lovely young man on duty the first morning and then it all went a bit pear shaped on the second morning  had to ask a couple of times for someone to take our order and then ask again for tea coffee toast etc  but not that big a deal  What I will say is that the shower was hopeless  It was like a hand held style that I would say at best  dribbled  Not sure I d go back to be honest  not sure why  just didn t bowl me over  That said  I would recommend it as it was a nice  modern hotel and they had a good offer on at the time  which I think has been extended  so worth checking out  
N =>   A lovely hotel I recently stayed at the Apex hotel for my boyfriend s birthday  where we came to London to relax and to see a show I booked online with Late rooms  and got a v  good deal   We arrived in London and after much Tube hopping we left the station to find the hotel was   minutes walk away in an ideal location  brilliant On our arrival checking in was quick and hassle free  We have a choice of which floor and smoking or non smoking then we made our way upto the room  It was small  but cosy  was spotless and very tidy  it was excellent We didn t eat at the restuarant or drink at the bar  as the food was a little pricey  but this was to be expected The hotel had free internet access  The staff was attentive and extremely helpful and even when we asked for directions to the show  they recommended the cheapest way and most convininet way to travel We checked out   days later with a smile on our faces  Again  the checking out was quick and hassle free  and they ll even store your bags for you until you need to depart for home The only that was annying was the location of the plug sockets  They were behind the TV which was a pain when using the iron and also when using the hairdryer as the cord wasn t long enough Other than that it was fantastic  I would definately go again and would recommend it to friends and family  they should visit late rooms first though  
N =>   Pleasant enough hotel shame about the room service This is a nice enough hotel  well situated in a quiet road and close to underground and bus stops  No complaints about the room  again nice enough with a decent size bathroom  although the view was of a huge brick wall  As we were only there for a one night theatre break we weren t too bothered about that  However  on returning to our room after the theatre  we ordered some supper from Room Service  This arrived fairly promptly  but a short while later Room Service rang through and asked my husband if he would go down to Reception and pay for it  as they had failed to ask us for credit card pre authorisation when we checked in  We felt this was an unreasonable request considering it was getting on for midnight and were trying to enjoy our supper  but he reluctantly went and Reception did apologise  but it was pretty annoying all the same  We decided to heed the hotel s warnings that the restaurant gets very busy for breakfast at the weekends  so we pre ordered breakfast in our room for the next morning  and requested for it between              It arrived at        My husband was still in the shower  so by the time he had finished  his breakfast was cold  What is the point of asking what time you would like your breakfast delivered  if Room Service are then not going to take any notice    
N =>   Excellent modern hotel I loved this hotel  Great location    min walk to Tower Hill tube station   friendly  amp  helpful staff  modern  amp  large rooms  The best breakfast   everything from a full fry up to pancakes  amp  waffles  amazing  I could not fault this hotel  The only small thing i didnt like was the bedroom windows are locked and the only way to open them is call reception and someone will come to unlock them but they dont leave the key with you so you have to call them again to lock them  I will definitely stay here again  
N =>  a hidden gem my boyrfiend and I stayed here at the weekend  we thoroughly enjoyed our stay we were upgraded on arrival  greeted by very friendly staff  given directions to anything we needed  room was lovely  with lots of extras  warm  conceriege were so accomodating and friendly  free internet to plan our days activities and print any maps needed it is very close to lots of tourist attractions  there is a tube station outside if you need to travel further afield  very good especially if you are travelling to take the train to the airport we really enjoyed our stay here and will be recommending this to friends  
N =>   Overpriced rabbit hutch After spending a couple of days in London at the Premier Inn County Hall  I had to stay down for one night on business  Thought I d choose a hotel closer to my work venue AND go upmarket   the client was paying  So I went on Laterooms and found the Apex       room only  Queen room   down from a normal price of  gt       Great deal I thought  NOT  The room was     the size of my one at the Premier Inn  OK there was a bar of soap and some smellies  The internet didn t work  I connected reception   no good  I spoke to the techncial support people  no good  I gave up  Apparently    more guests were having the same problem hAll in all  overrated  overpriced and small rooms  AND they wanted to charge me     for a breakfast  I went to a cafe down the road  full English for          
N =>   Very good hotel This is the second time we ve stayed at the Apex and the second time we ve found it to be a very good place to stay  Rooms are fairly spacious  the first time we had  although we didn t realise  a superior room with extra space for a sofa and table  this time we had a standard room which still left enough spacce to move about although the truly enormous bed does take up a fair amount of room  Everywhere was clean  staff were efficient and polite and the bar snacks  amp  continental breakfast we had were nice  There were a few minor gripes  no shampoo in the bathroom on the first day  we had to remind the breakfast staff that we wanted toast each morning and the bar service one afternoon was non existent  But  if that s all I can find to complain about then I consider myself very lucky Location is good and even the   tube lines disrupted by  planned engineering works  didn t inconvience us too much  Highly recommended  
N =>   Clean comfortable good value  Booked this hotel for   nights with     hotels at a great price which included the continental breakfast  We checked in at noon the day we arrived and pleasantly found our room to be available  We had a comfortable and quiet room  looked like this was an expansion that was part of an old church that looked down into a courtyard  with a king size bed  flat screen television  large bathroom with full size shower and separate tub  and most importantly air conditioning as it was very hot and dry during our stay The continental breakfast was very good including deli meats  cheeses  smoked salmon  during the weekday   yogurt  granola  juice  coffee  and a variety of baked goods  A separate menu to order from was available but completely unnecessary The staff bent over backwards to ensure we were happy  Since the Circle line  Underground nearest the hotel  was closed for construction during the weekend  we relied on double decker buses to get around then and the staff was very accommodating to help us find the bus routes that ran    hours to get around town  even calling their information line for us to answer questions The only negative was the tube closure near the hotel over the weekend  However  the hotel is a   minute walk to an alternate stop  Bank  and bus service was extremely convenient as taxis are very expensive in London  
N =>   Beautiful Trendy Central Located and Brilliant Service  accommodating a Coeliac  Travelling from Australia I was in transit for    hours and absolutely exhausted  My flights landed very early in London   am  and by the time I got through immigration I was on the way to my hotel just after  am  hoping desperately that they would allow me to check into my room early as all I needed was a shower and just a little sleep to peep up  note  check in is     pm   The staff was very accommodating and whilst a room wasn t immediately available  I waited in the lounge for a little less than an hour while they made up a room  Initially I thought my  city king  room was a little small  but it was really well fit out and actually quite comfortable meeting all my needs  especially the ensuite having a separate walk in shower and bath  which came in handy when soaking my sore feet after a day of walking around London My main concerns about travelling to Europe this time  was my dietary requirements thinking that I would need to ensure I was carrying some gluten free products at all times  especially touring the other European countries  yet  I was absolutely astounded when I asked the waitress  in the hotel restaurant at breakfast if they had gluten free bread and they did  Providing it to me with no additional charge  Note for other coeliacs  as it was early Sunday in the business district when I got my act together  the local tescos was closed although waitrose supermarket was only a short       min walk was open by   am for me to obtain some gluten free snacks for on the road  They had a small centralized selection of bread  rolls  ready made cakes  muesli  rice cakes  amp  snack bars  I also checked out Tesco s the following day which didn t appear to have as many options  I did quite a bit of research considering where to book my initial accommodation as I joined a tour   days after arriving in London   whether to stay at the hotel where my tour leaves from  which would have been convenient but had mainly terrible reviews or stay central to London and make my way to the set off point on the day of the tour  The reviews won me over with booking this hotel  amp  they were very well justified  I can confirm the pictures of the hotel on the website are very current  My tour departed early Tuesday morning at     am in Victoria and therefore I had the concierge organize my cab to collect me at  am and he was also kind enough to organize my breakfast to be delivered to my room at          mins before they officially start delivering breakfast and    mins before the restaurant is even open for breakfast    Again another brilliant example of the staff going out of their way to accommodate their guest  I was very grateful  amp  very impressed  I ended up booking my accommodation directly through the Apex Hotel website   as a short break package which included a continental breakfast every morning and saved me around    AUD a night compared with booking through either expedia com or wotif com  which didn t have a breakfast inclusion   Overall I have stayed in a lot of different hotels around the world and this one is truly world class without blowing the budget  I would definitely stay here again and recommend all to do so   
N =>   An appalling experience at the Apex City of London This weekend travelled to London with a friend for an event hosted at the Google Headquarters We booked our stay at the Apex City of London on the basis of the excellent reviews it had on Trip Advisor  Unfortunately from the moment we arrived our expectations were wholly subverted and the service just wet downhill We had booked our reservation online in a Superior room but had been promised an upgrade to a Deluxe room due to a mistake in advising us on the size of the room by the hotel s online customer service advisor   my friend and I required separate beds  or at the very least a sofa bed  we had been told the Superior room would fulfil both these needs  but then after double checking via phone I was told this was incorrect  and was eventually offered an upgrade to a deluxe room  On arrival at the hotel we were told that the room had not yet been paid for  despite providing credit card details when initially booking  It turned out that the credit card details were only taken to reserve a room for us  and no payment had been taken  However  if we did not turn up to the hotel  it would be magically possible to bill the card  according to the wonderful lady at reception  This would have not been a major issue  apart from the fact that as the trip was not being paid for by ourselves  we did not have the credit card  We told the lady at reception  initially served by Aga  and then passed onto another female colleague  whose name I do not know  that we had had a visit to Harrods arranged by one of the store manager s and asked whether it would be possible to store our luggage whilst we visit the store  before it closed  as it would be rather pointless for us sitting there waiting for the person paying for the trip to email the hotel with the card details  However  this request was refused  surprising considering the excellent customer service that the hotel s reviews often mention  So as we waited for the card details to be emailed  we sat at the hotel bar  offered no drink or snacks  let alone a glass of tap water  I returned to the reception desk on two occasions to check whether the information had been emailed  to hear the receptionist  the second one that served us  not Aga  talk to someone on the phone she addressed  darling  multiple times  giving me the impression that this was a personal  and inappropriate call  but then what do I know   This happened twice and I was kept waiting each time for her to finish the call before checking the email  Eventually as the email came in  and I complained about the delay once more  I was told that I would have been able to leave the luggage at reception and return later   she forgot to mention this when I originally asked  Well  thanks to this receptionist s utter incompetence we were delayed by an hour and a half Finally as the card details arrived  I checked twice to confirm that our room had been upgraded to a deluxe room  and this was confirmed by the concierge on duty at the time  and both the receptionist s that served me   I thought to myself that at least they had got one thing right  So we went up to our  deluxe  room on the sixth floor    At first glance the room was just  okay   it would do as a standard room  but for a room they describe as  deluxe  it was not up to scratch  On a quick inspection of the review the bathroom counter had marks on it and there was a brown stain on the curtain  Other than this the linen was good  although the pillows were too soft  the TV was very small  surprising as the hotel website described their TVs as being widescreen and with a Bose surround sound system in Deluxe room  Kindly  the hotel had included two bottles of water in the room too   they didn t last long as neither my friend or I had drank anything since arriving at the hotel  put off by the extortionate prices the hotel charged for even water   it would have been nice to have been offered a drink during our delay  Whilst mentioning the room  I want to compliment the lady in housekeeping who cleaned our room on both days   she did an excellent job  and was always polite and friendly when we passed by her However  the room description clearly did not meet that on their website for deluxe rooms  so I contacted reception by phone just to confirm we were put in the right room  which we apparently were After returning that evening the staff at reception had changed  and we were greeted by a gentleman who was very friendly and polite   a nice contrast to the staff I had previously met  When we reached the room  we realised we had forgot toothpaste  and the gentleman at reception said he d bring some up to the room  We also then decided to order a DVD  there is a nice selection  and called reception to order one  the person at reception told me to ask the person who delivered the toothpaste  which I found a bit rude considering he would be sent down   floors and then up again  and thought considering it had only been a minute since requesting the toothpaste  it could have been done in one trip  Anyway  the toothpaste soon arrived and it was personally delivered by the polite gentleman we had earlier met at reception  I mentioned the DVD to him and apologised for making him make a second trip  but he was very polite  and friendly   excellent After spending Saturday at Google  we arrived on Friday evening  on arrival at the hotel the receptionist who first served us  Aga  hurray  I decided to ask her about the room again  because the website clearly said the deluxe room had a Bose surround system  and from what I could see there were no speakers whatsoever  She confirmed this was correct  and then told me that we had not been put in a deluxe room  despite yesterday confirming we had  I told her that she herself had confirmed we were being put in a deluxe room  but she repeatedly told me that she did not remember this  if any hotel manager is reading this perhaps you could check the memory of your staff before hiring them in the future  it always helps   I eventually spoke to another gentleman  Gaurav  who was very apologetic and polite After going up the room I called to speak to Gaurav again and told him about the other problems we had experienced as well   he was again very apologetic and said that as no manager as available he couldn t esculate our complaint till Monday  we were checking out on Sunday morning   He said that he could upgrade us into a deluxe room immediately but we decided there was little point as it was already   PM and we were checking out in the morning  He sent us up two glasses of complimentary wine  which was nice of him  He also offered to upgrade our stay next time we visited  but  quite frankly  I won t be visiting again   but is that really a surprise So there you go  that s my stay at the Apex City of London  It certainly didn t live up to the   stars it has and the many positive reviews it has on this website  I had to deal with several utterly incompetent members of their staff  and other than the housekeeping lady  the gentleman who brought our DVDs up  and Gaurav  the service we experienced was  and on this note will conclude with my opinion of the entire stay  dismal  
N =>   Conveniently located to major sites with lovely accomodations  I was not certain the Apex would live up to it s online photos and praises  however I need not have doubted  It was even more beautiful than I had hoped  I loved it s sleek  minimalist decor throughout  What a lovely new age look amidst the old  historical buildings all around  We did not avail ourselves of the restaurant or room service as we preferred to experience all of the nuances available to us about town  Should we have  I have no doubt the food at the Apex  Addendum  would have been every bit as outstanding as the rest of the hotel  albeit a bit pricey compared to the local pub specials we enjoyed  
N =>   fine but not amazing The hotel was modern  clean and fresh  Breakfast was very good  Staff pleasant and very helpful  A nice hotel but perhaps a little too business orientated the bar area is small and not very atmospheric  Nice room though with some nice touches  Good location  Room service menue was a bit limited  
N =>   No internet access  If you need to stay in touch choose an alternative  The Hotel is ok  Booked through     Hotels and received free breakfast  We used  quot Addison Lee quot  for LimoService for       from Heathrow  clean  amp  fair  Location is a bit off the usual tourist tour  plan an extra       taxi trip to get to the PicCirc  Unreliable  free   Internet Service proved to be very frustrating  They were unable to solve the problem  We need to be in touch around the clock  Too bad  
N =>   Lovely room friendly staff  The hotel is located right by the Tower of London and lots of restaurants  pubs and cafes  The hotel staff were unfailingly helpful and friendly  we arrived too early to check into a room on our first day but were able to leave our bags and when we returned that evening we were told that we had been checked in as soon as a room became available so all we had to do was to take our key and head straight to a room  Breakfast is served in a nice caf    lounge area which looks out onto a small park opposite the hotel  The room we stayed in was spacious  with a huge bath and huge shower and even came equipped with a rubber duck  
N =>  Best hotel in London Arrived early to find very friendly staff welcoming us  Wanted to leave bags  but were told we had been upgraded AND we could get straight into the room  Brilliant And what a fab room it was  Luxuriously decorated with a very large bed and lots of pillows  The luxury carried forward into the bathroom with a HUGE bath and a seperate walk in shower room  and lots of lovely toiletries A large flatscreen TV and a mini fridge completed it all  We did have a hiccup  our fault  when it got to   pm and we realised we d forgotten toothpaste  but a quick call to reception sorted us out and within   minutes they were at the door with a couple of small dental travel kits We didnt have breakfast but with a Wetherspoons so near  we didnt require it  Plus the pub also serves food right up to   pm   good news for us as we didnt get back until     pm Other positives include being   minutes away from a tube station  and about the same again to the open top Bus Tour  Tower of London and London Bridge Brilliant area  superb hotel  fantastic staff  Even my cynical hubby said he wouldnt stay in any other London hotel now  Nuff said  
N =>   Excellent location friendly staff service as it should be  We booked in expecting a windowless room as we d gone for the cheapy rate  We got a room on the  th floor which has access to a balcony with great views over Tower Bridge  The room was clean  nicely finished and had free access to a list of DVDs  We didn t get to use these as we were out all night  Breakfast was attentive  the continental included fruits and yoghurts or you could opt for a menu item  We managed to leave property in the room but one phone call to concierge on our way home got them back in the post to us  There is no parking but this is fairly normal in Central London  Concierge have maps of nearby secure parking  
N =>   Luxury at budget prices We spent a weekend in the Apex in London  we had previously stayed in a sister hotel in Edinburgh and thought it was fabulous so when we decided to go to London it was the obvious choice  The hotel is in a good location a few minutes from Tower Hill tube station  The reception area and staff were both impressive  there was never any trouble helping with luggage or calling a taxi  The rooms are well appointed  slightly smaller than those in Edinburgh but still comfortable  there was also a good selection of toiletries in the bathroom which was unexpected for the room rate we paid  We had some cocktails in the hotel bar  they were delicious though slightly overpriced but nothing too outrageous  just hotel prices I have recommended this hotel to friends  
N =>   Fabulous modern trendy hotel Stayed for   nights with my boyfriend  Booked on a special travel agent s rate  extremely good value for money  We booked a city double room but on arrival were told we were upgraded to a deluxe  Fab  Check in smooth  receptionist was very friendly and helpful Our room was fairly large  double bed  sofa  big tv  fridge  walk in shower and bath  It was made up to excellent standards  We were even given complimentary pringles and jelly beans  The decor was very modern and chic  very clean room and bathroom  only slight negative was didnt like the pillows or duvet cover  pillows very squishy and covers rustled all night  but thats just personal taste  Our room was serviced to high standards  and for a     refundable deposit  you could have a choice of dvds to watch  We didnt use the restaurant but I ordered a sandwich to our room which came quickly  The late night room menu was very limited though  basically a bowl of soup  some sandwiches and ice creams  The hotel is a few minutes walk to Tower Hill tube station and around the corner from various pubs and restaurants  All in all a lovely hotel to stay at 
N =>   Just perfect  Chose this hotel after recommendations on TripAdvisor and was really impressed  We went to London to celebrate my husbands birthday  I had booked a standard room but on arrival we were upgraded to a premium room on the  th floor with a great view of Tower bridge  The room was great  spacious and really clean with comfy beds  our room even had a small terrace The location is in the business district close to the Tower of London and Tower bridge so not centrally located although this was definately not a problem with the Tube station being very close  also the boats running on the Thames are just a short walk from the hotel  We did try the hotel restaurant one night  it was quite OK but I would still recommend a walk to St Katharines dock close to Tower bridge where you ll find a lot of different restaurants  a really cosy area We had booked the full English breakfast but next time we will just have the Continental breakfast  included in price for room  with great yoghurt  lots of fresh fruit  different kinds of bread  ham  cheese  salmon    enough to keep you full for the better part of the day     All in all  a perfect choice with spacious  clean rooms  totally wonderful and friendly staff and a quiet and calm location   we will definately be coming back  
N =>  Very helpful staff My travel agent tried to tell me not to stay here because it is in the business district  I m very happy that we did not take her advice  I is neat the tower of London and since we went to Wimbledon the underground direct line we just up the street  
N =>   First class My partner and I experienced first class service at the Apex City of London Hotel  He booked it for me as a suprise romantic theatre weekend and I was not dissapointed  The service was efficient and friendly  not to mention helpful  The room we had was on the  th floor  It was a coner room and was very spacious and the fit out and decor was very stylish indeed  I wanted to take all the soft furnishings home with me    and I have very discerning taste  The bed was confy and the area is quiet in the evenings so we had a great nites sleep  The bathroom had a very roomy shower cubicle which was big enough for two and a rather nice bath  I would def stay here again  if only to sample the gym downstairs which looked great and very underused   It was empty when I went to check it out   Well done Apex  cant wait to come back  
N =>  Best Budget Hotel Ever   I have just returned from a one night stay at the Apex City of London Hotel  staying in one of their budget rooms  I was a bit worried about what the room might be like as it didn t have a window and was billed very much as a  budget room   I have to say that when I got to my room I was very pleasantly surprized to find the most luxurious budget rooms I have ever stayed in I am one of the fussiest people there are and complain about everything so it is not often I am impressed  so hats off to the Apex  I will def stay there again and will recommend to everyone I know  
N =>   Customer service needs improving   otherwise great hotel My friend and I stayed at this hotel on   occasions in   First  I will describe what I liked about the hotel  On both occasions  the rooms we were given were top notch   spacious room and bathroom with excellent amenities such as iron  amp  board  hairdryer  lux toiletries and even a cute rubber ducky  The beds were so comfortable we had trouble waking up in the morning Now the not so good  As we stayed during the weekends  it was a real hassle getting to West End   Oxford Street as the yellow  circle   line was closed for upgrading on both occasions  We had to walk to Bank station  which was    mins away  Getting food was difficult as most places in that area were closed during the weekends  That being said  the east end attractions  Tower of London  St Pauls  etc  were easy to get to and Old Spitalfields market is a mere       minute walk away Customer service definitely needed some polishing up  I wanted to make some calls to a UK mobile phone and called reception to enquire the charges  as the pamphlet in the room did not specify charges for calling a UK mobile line   Reception said they will check and call me back  but they didn t  I waited    minutes  so I called them again and was transferred to the concierge desk  The guy whom I spoke to was not sure but he said  quot should not be more than    pence quot   So I made a   minute call and upon checkout  I was horrified to see that I was charged      GBP for the calls  That worked out to be   p per minute  After explaining myself  the reception lady agreed to take the charge off my bill  although she did it in a most rude and unfriendly manner All in all  a good hotel if you are coming for business or visiting the east end  Do check the tube schedule for any planned closures on weekends  If we had known that the yellow line was not operational  I doubt we would have chosen to stay at this hotel  It would also be better if the service staff showed more warmth in their smiles and attitude  and go the extra mile to help their guests  
N =>   Excellent base for an excellent weekend Arrived early despite the best attempts of London transport  Very pleasant check in and easy luggage storage  When we arrived back later  we found our room to be everything we expected   very clean  comfortable  really good shower  comfortable bed  no views though  but not expected  Eating locally was not a problem  only      minute walk from St  Katharin s Dock  Other establishments locally as well  Breakfast was good with an wide choice Overall a very good London hotel 
N =>  Once again an excellent stay  We have now stayed at this hotel   times  over the past few years Every time we have had an excellent stay We have never had the same room  or even style decor of room  I like how each has it s own individual feel to it Our rate included continental breakfast  and we had a full english for    supplement The staff were great  and can say no more other than look forward to my return in y  
N =>  An excellent hotel offering  st class customer service I visited this hotel on a theatre break with   friends  We were celebrating a friend s   th birthday and from the moment we arrived at this hotel the service we received was exceptional and professional Rooms are fab comfy bedspristine bed linenlarge walk in shower and bathfridge  safe  hairdryer  ironing board and iron in roomspotlessly clean Breakfast in the hotel was included in our price and this too was exceptional  we were delighted by the service provided by Paul  manager of restaurant    Nothing was too much for him or his staff who made our breakfast a very pleasant and enjoyable experience  Thank you We did not have a view but it did not make a difference to us as we were only in our rooms to bathe or sleep  We had an  quot ouch quot  moment when we purchased a round of   drinks at the bar and the bill was       In all  this is a little gem of a hotel just a few minutes walk to the tube station at Tower Hill  so if you don t mind being a wee bit out of the biz  then try this hotel   you will not be disappointed N B Buy an OYSTER card to travel on London Transport   saved us a fortune Go and see  quot WICKED quot  at The Apollo   a fab show  even  nd time around  
N =>   great hotel had a   night stay at a great hotel with very freindly and polite staff  exellent breakfast  upgraded to a deluxe room  worth every penny  extra room made huge differance    mins from tube  amp  public secure parking would recommend this hotel to any one and would return any time 
N =>   Great Hotel This was my second stay at Apex Hotel  first in London City  Check in was quick  We were given a complimentary upgrade to a Deluxe Bedroom  When we entered the room we could not believe how big the room was  It came with a sofa and a    quot  LCD TV  Luxury comes to mind  Came in handy in watching the football  The bedroom was well docorated and clean  Staff were extremely friendly  Didn t have food at the hotel so cannot comment on that  The location of the hotel was great  A few minutes walk from Tower Hill Tube Station and near to a few well known eating places  The area was quiet at night  The only thing I didn t like was the bed  They were too comfortable  But maybe that is because I am used to a firm bed  If you are used to soft beds then it should be no problem for you  We came for a romantic few days away and got exactly that  I will recommend this hotel to everyone  It is a bit expensive but its well worth it if you want to be away from the hustle of the buzzing city centre  
N =>   Great Location Great Value Just returned after   day City Break at the Apex  Having arrived in the City at       worrying about baggage showers etc we were delighted to have our room available at        how rare is that  A chic modern hotel   minutes walk from Tower Hill underground  Reception staff attentive enough to sort a slight hic in our booking very quickly   Although we didn t spend much time there our room was spacious with huge bed big plasma screen and all mod cons Definitely one to be used again in the future  Only criticism bar prices where we got caught just once but wont get caught again 
N =>  Great hotel would definately recommend  Myself and   female family members stayed here for   nights from the  th of ch for a girly weekend break in London and we absolutely loved this hotel  We had a nightmare of a taxi journey from Gatwick airport as the taxi driver got lost and ended up driving us around in circles which ended up taking a good hour chunk out of our first day in London and we were all pretty grumpy by the time we got to the hotel but our mood was not long in changing once we saw the hotel  The staff at reception were very nice and friendly and we were checked in very quickly and efficiently  We had booked   standard twin rooms  both of which were non smoking  we had to ring down to reception to change one of the rooms to a smoking room as   of our party were smokers but this was done with little hassle  The view was not great but this did not bother us at all and if you want a room with a view you have the option of upgrading  The beds are extremely comfortable and the rooms are spotless  and very modern  The bathroom in our room was lovely and big with a wet room but unfortunately my sister and mother were not so lucky  you had to climb into the bath to take a shower but as they were only given this room at the last minute due to requiring a smoking room we did not complain about this  The location is great  we were delighted to see that we were only a stones throw from Tower Bridge and the Tower of London which look amazing when lit up at night time  It is a bit of walk into the city centre especially if you don t know where you are going so we just hopped into a taxi which was reasonable  We had continental breakfast included in our rate which was lovely  as there was a great choice in the continental option  juice  tea  toast  pastries  cold meat  cheese  yoghurts and fruit  On the  nd morning i paid   pounds extra for the hot breakfast which was nice but quite small  The only thing it would not recommend is eating in the hotel restaurant  the food was only ok and there was not a great choice on the menu  Overall  this is a great comfortable hotel  with lovely friend staff  all of which i must compliment  I would definately stay at this hotel again and would recommend this to anyone looking to book a couple of nights in London  
N =>  Excellent stay This was my second stay at the hotel Got an amazing price from Lastminute com supersale  Towerhill tube stationw as closed so I got train to aldgate which is a      min walk to the hotel  Checked in was a breeze   I was given a room in the new section of the hotel which is accessed to the right of the check in desks The room was really nice   modern     inch huge lcd tv  really nice bathroom  Tv channels inclde sky sports channels Toiletries were really nice   huge bottles of shampo  conditioner  moisteriser and shower gel Free WFI included in room   good fast service and easy to connect to We didn t have brekfast included but the room had a empty fridge to store food The only problem we had was the rooms are fully sound proofed we could hear the neighbours shouting and had to call receiption to ask them to speak to them We got a good night sleep once they had spooken to the noisy neighbours  
N => Location not great but okay  Rooms were clean  modern with hair dryer  iron which was good  There was a CD DVD player if you wanted to bring music  We couldnt figure out the air conditioning so we were cold the whole time which was not good as it was snowing outside so we wanted to come in to a cosy room  There was a power shower but the water was never hot it was only tepid  We informed the reception of this on departure and they said that there was a safety button on the shower  I could not see this and I was sorry I had waited until we left to mention anything because cold showers were not pleasant  The hotel is located in the financial district and everything closes on saturday and sunday  there was no shops  pubs etc open so you had to go on the tube to see any signs of life  Liverpool Station is approx a    minute walk away which isnt too bad  I like this hotel  no major complaints  If I was to return to London I would stay somewhere more central  ie somewhere on the Central line  Staying in this hotel meant we were getting taxis alot  
N =>  Lovely Hotel breakfast rip off We stayed here from Friday   rd til Sunday   th uary  Was really impressed with the hotel  the room was lovely  small   but then we didn t come to London to stay in the room  Bathroom lovely and immaculately clean On check in  our rates were confirmed  and we decided to pay for one morning s breakfast  as I fancied an old school greasy spoon for the sunday morning   Big mistake  For     it really was a joke  The continental breakfast was really disappointing  Choice of cereals almost non existant  only bread  no croissants  and a tray of ham and cheese  The cooked part was ok  but very greasy and included the strangest tasting black pudding i ve ever had The hotel is amazingly quiet for being in the centre of London  beds really comfy so we had   nights of wonderful sleep  Really close to tube stations and bus stops On check out  our bill was a lot more than was quoted to us on check in  The difference in room rates was explained as VAT charges  but strangely the VAT had clearly been added under each night  The receptionist  as polite as she was  was foreign and it was difficult for her to understand us and vice versa  After a lot of to ing and fro ing and us refusing to pay a higher charge  they eventually relented and charged us the proper rate Also  they will preapprove your credit card for hidden extras  Hubby didn t mind this as we had no intention of charging anything to the room  but if you don t have too much left on your credit card it will decline  I had a problem with this as feel it is unfair  if they do not want anything charged to the room it should be clearly marked on your account All in all  would stay here again  perfect location and lovely hotel  but I would definitely NOT pay for breakfast again  there is so much nearby a lot cheaper and probably a lot nicer  
N =>  Good Hotel First time staying at this hotel  usually stay at the London Bridge Hotel but fancied a change  So glad we did  Room was large with a sofa which made it more pleasant to watch tv  The bathroom was a good size  Everything was very clean and comfortable  We got a good deal through Alpha rooms  which included continental breakfast   which was more than adequate  Dining room very pleasant  The tube station is literally a   minute walk away  Overall a good experience  We will definitely return  
N =>   Good hotel but    This is a very nice hotel located next to the Tower of London  Quiet location  central to the city  but not the West End or shopping  Nice area across the river  Shad Thames  for dinner at night  The hotel is priceworthy and nice  but breakfast is not included and is NOT worth the     they charge  They heartily recommended the breakfast so we took it  Disappointment    We came to the breakfastroom    minutes before closing and had to wait    minutes for a table  Don t know why  there were many free tables  but we were told to wait by a rather stressed out waiter  There was hardly anyting left  not even bread  We asked for more bread  and the waiter just looked at us     So not worth the money when you know what kind of breakfast     buys you in London   Otherwise the hotel seemed clean and nice enough  We had an upgraded room and that was nice  Upon arrival they had not put an extra bed in our room as requested in two e mails  Ibrought copies of mails  have had bad experience before    That delayed our check in and they tried to have us pay for upgrade to larger room to accomodate us  but then upgraded for free which was appreciated All in all  very nice but not perfect  
N =>   Our Second Stay at the Apex This was our second stay at the Apex Again  our room was lovely   however slightly smaller than the first room we had  Good spacious bathroom  with separate bath  amp  walk in shower  Our only dissapointment was the breakfast   It was my other half s Birthday  so I treated him to Breakfast  Not impressed by the service   I ordered what was on the menu as Belgian Waffle S  with Banana and Cream  and the other half ordered Porridge with Blueberries  amp  Maple Syrup  We were bought out A Waffle  singular  and Pancakes  By the time that thecorrec dish   Porridge   was bought out I had finished my Waffle  For the cost of the Breakfast   even on London prices   I was extremely dissapointed and felt ripped off  as the waffle was definately not made in house but bought from a supermarket We made a complaint on check out the General Manager  which was resolved to our satisfaction One tip would be to get breakfast outside of the hotel     Even for london prices its very expensive   especially when there is a Wetherspoons a stones throw away  At least there you pay for and expect things to be just microwaved re heated  I must admit that the evening and lunch menu did look good so would be willing to give those a try on our next visit I have also booked the hotel for my parents Anniversary later on in the year  so can only hope that the hotel will continue to deliver the hight standards that I have passed onto them  
N =>   Lovely modern hotel great quiet location  We stayed here on NY Eve  with some friends also in the room next door  We booked cheapest rooms  but were upgraded on arrival  It was only the next level up and the room wasn t big  but the bed was a lovely King Size with a huge    inch LCD TV at the botoom  Room was very quiet  if a little dark unless you angled the bed side lights  but we didn t worry about this too much Hotel is in a nice quiet location close to The City  and close to Tower Hill Tube  I would imagine it gets very busy in the week  but on NY Eve everywhere nearby was closed save for the odd pub  It didn t matter as were off elsewhere for NY celebrations Upon check out we thought our rate was      inclusive  but the rate advertised was ex VAT so beware of this  Perhaps our mistake but we expected       Anyway all in all it was a great hotel  with no problems to report  other than we couldn t get hot water for a bath at  pm  but shower was hot  weird one that Will stay again  in fact we are planning a return for          already  
N =>  Excellent Hotel Stayed in this very plush Hotel for the weekend   st    rd november      for my daughters   st  We went to see a show and loads of sight seeing   The Apex was very convenient to the tube and was two minutes from Tower Bridge  The staff were really friendly and hotel was faultless especially the rooms  We also booked breakfast which again was excellent  We had a brilliant weekend mainly due to this hotel and we will be definately booking it again        Mr J Walmsley 
N =>  Amazing hotel I love this hotel  the chic decor and comfort of the room was fantastic  Located very close to the metro  makes visiting all the sights very easy  A fabulous find and a fantastic place to stay  
N =>  Great bedrooms The room was great  Was a deluxe on top floor  Great views etc  Bathroom looked great but was unheated so a bit too cold  Also the shower leaked on to the bathroom floor  Small problems really  Hotel interior was really well designed and the location was very handy   mins from nearest tube stop  
N =>  Great value Having decided we d extend our annual shopping trip to London into an overnight stay  I was after somewhere representing good value for money  We got three rooms for myself  my wife and the three children  coming to a total of about       including breakfast  The rooms are new  clean modern and stylish  This represents terrific value   I should add it was the weekend  but even so very good for London  The location is good  very near Tower Hill tube  with cheap parking in Minories      overnight Saturday to Sunday  The only gripes are that the room was a bit chilly  the minibar was empty  even though there was a price list  and the shower is pretty half hearted  None of this stops it from being great value though  
N =>   Love this hotel soooo much I previously stayed here in e      and thought it was one of the best hotels so I rebooked in as I thought highly of it before  The staff attitude  nothing is to much of a bother to them  They are polite  well mannered and would go out their way to help you  We had a deluxe king room and was bigger than what I imagined  We paid a good rate for the hotel  we ae re booked in for   weeks time Its in a great location     to catch tube  buses and the thames clipper which I highly recommend rather than tube as you get to see some sites of london   which was recommended by a MET officier   I love this hotel    roll on   weeks  
N =>   Lovely hotel Had a brand new room  in the brand new wing of the hotel  The room was clean  as it should be  being it was brand new  and was quite comfortable  The TV was at kind of a strange angle to the bed  but wasn t that much of a concern  The bathtub was huge  but unfortunately could not get water hot enough for a bath   although the shower was hot  Room service was prompt and prices were reasonable  Located just steps away from Tower Bridge tube station  Great location for a business trip  but might not recommend for someone vacationing in London  
N =>   Quite Good The hotel reception and bar look very nice and modern  The room was very nice as well   It was nice to have a dvd player and plasma screen in the room and also a good hairdryer for once   The hairdryer proved especially useful since we had the following problems    No heating in the bathroom   it was freezing cold  I had the quickest showers ever    When using any towel we ended up covered in white fluff and as wet as before I ended up drying my face with toilet paper and drying the rest with the hairdryer  our friends shared the same problems due to the dodgy towels  The worst part however was breakfast  We just wanted to enjoy a simple English breakfast  Not such a weird request since we were in London  If I had known what a struggle it was going to be  I would have gone down the local pub  We were asked by the person in charge  breakfast room manager perhaps   about   times what our room number was then he showed us to our table we were just left there with no consideration at all After about    minutes we managed to get on of the waiters  attention   after being asked about   more times what our room number was  he left telling us where the buffet was  The buffet  which was not in the same room we were sitting in  didn t have the English cooked breakfast food we wanted   it was a cold buffet He didn t bother telling us that  if we wanted a fry up toast tea coffee  we had to order it from him   so we just waited patiently and finally  another    minutes later  we managed to place our order We asked the breakfast room manager guy to put the bill on our room  by now you would have thought he knew the number by heart   However  when we left the breakfast room he came running after us  waving the bill in the air as if we were trying to do a runner     NO COMMENT   if you want breakfast just head to Starbucks or to a pub  Surely you will find friendlier and more helpful staff  
N =>   Lovely Hotel in a quiet safe area  We were two girlfriends that stayed at the Apex for   nights  The first thing we noticed when we came from the underground was that the hotel was located in a very nice area  the only people we saw was office workers    There are sooo much people everywhere in London it seems  so we thought that the quiet area was great  It s located only   minuits walk from Tower Hill undergroundstation and really close to The Tower We loved the hotel and our room  though the room wasn t big  standard twin room  it was comfortable and it didn t feel small  There was a lot of closet space and a fridge  also an ironing board and a really good hair dryer  in a lot of hotels they have those bad dryers that are attached to the wall that hardly has no power at all   The decor was beautiful  a lot of dark wooden details combined with light colors on the walls  Lovely pictures and nice curtains  The bed was comfy  the only thing that bothered us was that the sheets was TO crisp so everytime you moved the other person heard it  Big TV with DVD and a DVD library in the reception where you could lend films for a deposit of    pounds The bathroom was lovely  all tiled  A big walk in shower AND a bathtub  last bathroom I saw in London was so small that I could hardly move in it at all so this was a nice surprise   The staff was very helpful and nice  and the service good  At arrival we asked for someone to go up to our room to unlock the windows  they are locked for safety reasons and have to be open with a key   The maid service was so fast that they were in our room even before we were      We had booked and pre paid for the continental breakfast  It was ok  but nothing to brag about        Being from Sweden we are used to excellent hotel breakfast that has everyting one could desire  but of course we knew that english hotels has a totally different take on breakfast  Still we would have wished a bigger variety of bread for example  Some boiled eggs would have been nice and some hot food for example bacon  they have a menu to order from so you can get bacon if you pay extra  Another thing that bothered us was the bath towels   It was virtually impossible to get dry by using them  I don t know what they ve done to them  but I suggests that they buy new towels       It s not to nice to get dressed when you are still dripping wet  All in all  we liked the hotel very much and I would definetly stay here again and recommend it to others  
N =>   Great hotel but in the price Good hotel but I am surprised it is so highly rated considering the location and prices  by location I mean it is in the City   convenient for business  but not the most attrative part of town otherwise Everything worked in there  the only thing I found annoying was how hard it was to use the faucets   explained by staff by  quot green quot  considerations  to limit water use  Fun  quot feature quot   if this was on purpose    female staff having kind of similar funky short haircuts  Not that it was useful  just funny to notice Food in the hotel is great  but do not go to the pub they recommended down the road  Assembly I think     poor maintenance and bland foodWith all the positives  I feel the price was well reflecting the hotel s popularity   found it relatively expensive considering it is still   star and not in the best location  I even start suspecting that nice  but  quot not luxury quot  hotels raise their prices as they get rave reviews  than the  quot great value for money quot  is gone  
N =>   fabulous apex hotel we had a fabulous time during our short break in london made even better with our lovely time at the apex hotel the service was impeccable and could not have wished for a better area for the nearby tower of london which was just around the corner the hotel was so nice that we have booked to go to the apex international edinburgh in november and we feel confident that we will experience the same high quality service that we had in london regards malcolm and lorraine west yorkshire 
N =>   Surprised at the price  Myself and boyfriend have just returned from a weekend break in London to celerbrate his birthday and chose after much searching the Apex City of London hotel  Upon searching on the net we did not expect much for the price we paid as this is a   star including Breakfast in central London but we were extremley surprised     In a good way The hotel is in such a good location for Tower Bridhe and the tube is only a few minuetes away  At night it was nice to see all London lit up and the area was actually quiet    Not sure if thats just a weekend thing though Check in to check out everything a dream  Happy helpful staff  clean and modern hotel  great bedrooms with all you need and the Breakfast was nice  We paid the extra    to have a cooked one and it was so worth it  They even serve a scottish breakfast too  The bar serves great cocktails and had a good vibe about it We loved the room  high standard  clean  and modern  Bed was very very comfy  We mentioned being there to celerbrate a birthday and was upgraded free of charge and it was nice having little extras like a extra chair in the room  and robes   We will be coming back in the new year and have recommended at least   friends to stay there when they visit London in the next few weeks The reviews do it justice  its even better in real life though Book because you will not be disappointed  
N =>   Relaxing First visit to London for a while actually staying in the city  Had no idea what to expect but need not have worried  From the moment we entered the hotel until we left the staff were  st class in everything they did from the front desk to the kitchen  On entering our room we were delighted with the spaceious and well equipped facillities including the large walk in shower wetroom  the kingsize bed and the well stocked tea coffee tray tucked neatly away in a cupboard along with a fridge  Everything you need is only a phone call away or just ask at reception as you enter or leave from taxis to breakfast in bed nothing is too much trouble  Has to be one of the best nights sleep for a long time and was completely relaxed throughout the visit  The only way to rate our experience was excellent as anything less would not be fair to the staff who due to their professional approach made our stay complete  
N =>   Awesome Stay We almost can t say enough about our stay here  We booked a deal through a London website similar to Hotwire Travelocity  We got the rooms for more than half off their average rate  Rooms were very large  nice views and fantastic location We didn t get a change to eat at the hotel  but it looked niced  Just across from the London Bridge Rooms are very clean  staff was great  hotel was new and modern  
N =>   Great location   Great location   the only niggle i had was my husband booked this for my birthday and they had no notes on the system  even though he did phone to check  and they didn t seem to really care that they had forgotton   wasn t the best first impression    the standard of english at check in was pretty poor Great room  could do with a plasma   good size  really quiet  nice modern decor   nice walk in shower   toilet was really hard to flush which was a pain but having said that would go back  loads of pubs bars resturants nearby  We got it though last minute secret hotels def worth the money  would recommend  
N =>   Could be better The  quot power shower quot  was not very powerful or hot  The staff at reception  although friendly  could not speak English well enough to explain the check in procedure to me  It took   of them over   mins to explain it to me  If they could speak English well enough i would have understood the first time  I was not told at time of booking my room that a credit card is the best method of payment  I didn t have my credit card with me  only a debit card  when i checked in so i have now paid for my room twice  Once as a deposit which will be refunded to me within   days  then upon departure they take another payment for the correct value of your overall stay  If you pay by credit card you pay the deposit upon arrival and then get an immediate refund and then pay full balance when you check out Other than that the room hotel was clean  amp  tidy and the breakfast was good 
N =>   A Great Find  I was discouraged by the high cost of lodgings in London where our   week stay in UK would end  so Apex was quite a find  Not only was it reasonably priced and well located near the Tower Bridge underground  but it was slick  spotless  roomy and felt very upscale  Their cafe was always disappointing  but I m not sure London is known for its dining experiences  There s a great pizza place not far  and there you ll find great Italian fare  But the hotel itself was terrific and I d go back there in a heartbeat  
N =>   Attention to detail attentive staff We booked a room as part of a package which included admission to a London exhibition and were very pleased we did  A first class room with great attention paid to the small details and friendly  attentive staff made this a very pleasurable part of our weekend in London  Located close to the Tower  it s worth crossing the bridge on foot and strolling down the Queen s Walk     to the Globe  Also recommended is using the quicker river taxis as a tube alternative  
N =>   Loved the Location I booked direct with the hotel after reading reviews  we wanted something central but modern paid      for double room only  Check in was easy  Room was No     and no views just office blocks  cant open windows either and the air con was soo noisey we had to turn off but woke up boiling hot  The room was really clean and bathroom was lovely one of the only hotels ive actually had a bath in and shower was powerful  All mod cons and small fridge was handy for bottles of wine  
N =>  A really friendly hotel We booked this hotel as a  mystery  hotel on Lastminute for a weekend break  paying      for a room on a Saturday night It s in a great location  tucked away but easy walking distance to the Tower It s obviously geared up for business travellers  but at weekends they seem to try really hard to fill the rooms with the likes of us  The reception staff were friendly and gave us a voucher for two drinks in the bar and     off in the restaurant  It almost seemed a bit desperate actually  but we didn t get a chance to use them as we had already arranged to go out  I d have been quite happy to eat there though   it looked fine The rooms were modern and plush  clean and had plenty of nice little touches such as free mineral water and even a rubber duck to take home I d happily go back  preferably at the Lastminute mystery rate  
N =>   Stylish London Hotel with excellent all round service  Excellent proffesional service by all employee s in the hotel  from the reception to the bar  Rooms spotlessly clean with spacious bathroom  Good selection of tv channels available including sport and movies  This hotel is a gem  a real find which i will be returning to stay in the next time I m in London  
N =>   Hello Ducky  A great place to stay in London  quiet  yet near to the tube stations to get around easily  It is right by the Tower  and the river  we walked along the path near the river  as it was a nice day  A great shame about there being engineering works the day we booked in  but there you are The room was spacious  and had a relaxed atmosphere  My freind and I had a room with a huge shower  and bath  As my freind said   I had to run round in the shower to get wet   The bath was enormous  just one criticism was the safety bath mat  that moved and I didn t feel very safe getting out The toiletries were of good quality  and generous sizes  We LOVED the duck placed on the edge of the bath  a great touch The illuminated room numbers outside each room were really helpful  especially when trying to find our way back to our room after a night out The staff were very freindly and helpful  sometimes it can feel intimidating in some hotels  but everyone was professional as well as freindly and looked after one of our senior party members  very well The food was reasonably priced  and very tasty  we had breakfasts  and I thought the room service menus were reasonable too We had a look at the gym facilities  but didn t go in to use the equipment I would agree that it may not suit families very well  but we ranged from aged       in our party  and we still think of London as a different world from where we all come from  Ooop North   We all enjoyed staying  and having some luxury and a great way of starting and ending our recent holiday Thank you to all the staff  and I would like the owners and or managers to know they have a great team of people working there  
N =>  Great place to stay Fantastic hotel  fabulous service and excellent rooms We were lucky enough to obtain a room upgrade when checking in and this made our   th wedding anniversary stay very special indeed  The room was spacious and incredibly clean  the staff were friendly and helpful and overall I have no complaints at all We would definitely stay again and wouldn t hesitate to recommend to our friends and family 
N =>   Really Impressive Value For Money My daughter and I spent two nights at the Apex last week  We had been looking for a decent  convenient cost effective hotel in the center of London  After checking TripAdvisor we decided to try the Apex  We weren t sorry  Being just a five minute walk from the Tower Hill tube station  it was a breeze to get to the Tower of London early in the morning and beat the crowd  The room decor was modern and new  including flat screen TV   the climate control worked great  and free wifi was a bonus  There was no free breakfast  it cost GBP        but the price was right nevertheless  I would definitely stay there again  
N => Great London Hotel Only had a one night stay  but will definitely return to this lovely hotel As stated by other reviewers  the hotel is only a few minutes walk from Tower Hill tube station and whilst not exactly central  is within very easy reach of all major attractions The room although not large was well appointed and the beds very comfortable  The complimentary water was a nice touch especially as there was a fridge to chill it in  ent coffee was also provided as well as tea and hot chocolate The bathroom was the best we ve had in London  the separate power shower especially impressive  Lovely toiletries and a cute rubber duck to welcome us The standard of cleanliness was excellent and all the staff we met were polite friendly and hepful As another reviewer has mentioned  it was also wonderfully quiet and we were not aware of any noise at night  As it was unseasonally warm  it was good that the air conditioning worked well and almost silently I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel  
N =>  Great Find Have just returned having spent   nights at this hotel and our overall stay was absolutely fantastic  Definitely couldn t fault the hotel or the staff on anything The hotel is literally a five minute walk from Tower Hill tube station  Our flight was early  way before check in time  but the front desk staff were more than happy to help and checked us in straight away to their first available room  The room was immaculately clean and as stated before was modern and well equipped  especially the toiletries in the bathroom  The breakfast was fantastic and the quality of the food on offer was superb  The hotel itself is extremely quiet   we never heard a door bang or another guest on our floor the whole weekend  despite the breakfast room being full in the mornings I m glad I researched Tripadvisor before we booked anything  This is definitely a good find and I wouldn t hesitate to stay here again when in London  
N =>   Pleasant surprise    nicely updated well kept modern hotel  I was in London recently on a   day business trip and decided to try out the Apex based on the Tripadvisor rankings  The location was very accessible to the Tower Hill tube station and is walking distance to both the Thames near the Tower Bridge as well as the London Financial district  The check in and check out was prompt and professional  I went up to my room and was really surprised at how updated  clean  and well kept the room was  The room was decorated in a more modern style  had a king size bed as well as a small couch  There seemed to be a real attention to detail given to the room  everything was crisp and there were no signs of wear and tear of any sort  Small touch  but I appreciated that the shampoo  conditioner  and hand lotion were in slightly larger bottles than hotels usually provide  Also loved the Apex branded rubber ducky that they provide in the bathroom as a courtesy Overall the experience was a really positive one  I look forward to returning in the future  The only shortcoming  if I had to be picky  is the hotel bar if you re looking to meet up with friends or colleagues  The hotel is located on a side street that doesn t seem to be well known by the Londoners that I spoke with  and the hotel bar and lobby area doesn t necessarily have a huge wow factor  The night I was there we decided to go to the nearby Gouman Tower hotel bar  walking distance  for after dinner drinks that includes a wonderful panoramic view of the Tower Bridge all lit up at night  
N =>   Lovley Room We stayed at this hotel from   th     th this year  For some reason on arrival our visa card kept getting rejected and so in the end we had to pay cash  We decided on a Deluxe King Room and it was worth the price  the room was spacious and felt very relaxed  which after a hectic day out in london was appreciated  From our window which was at the front of the hotel we could see tower bridge  I dont think the food was worth the price tag though but there is a wetherspoons near by  Overall I think the apex is a charming hotel that I would stay in again  The room was marvellous  the staff polite the only let down was the menu  
N =>   Way too expensive  Go to a hostel instead  This hotel would have been ok if I had payed half the price  I have been in London many times and stayed in hostels as well as five star hotels   This was the worst so far First of all  the tv did not work at all which I did not care all that about since I wasn t in town to watch tv  But still  it is a nice background noice The mattress did not have a bedding mattress meaning I basically slept right on the spirals  ouch  I had to get massage the next day to even be able to stand up  I complained about this and since ther was no other rooms so i could switch they offered me a new mattress  That was ok with me  However  when I finally came home in the evening after a long day in town I found the mattress in the corridor and had to drag the old one out and replace it on my own  NOT ok  When I complained about this the receptionist simply said he did not know which bed I wanted it in  Who cares  After that ordeal I wanted to have a shower but there was no hot water  again  Had asked about that already in the morning and been adviced to let it run for about   min  I know all about how bad showers can be in London so ok  I would try  That didn t work  I called down to ask if he could check it and he said he would  I heard nothing so after   min I went down to have a cigarette and asked  Apparently the boiler had shut off and the water would be fine within   min and it actually was However  the water smelled like rotten eggs and made my eyes bright red The staff in day time was very nice and helpful at night not so helpful but not rude either  be he is shy or something  Unfortuenatly one has to be a bit polite  talkative and friendly when working in a hotel so    Good sides  the location  I don t like to stay in Bayswater but the location is good  Easy to go into town and to various other places with bus or tube  Many restaurants close by and a mall like place with lots of shops  restaurants and cinema Also  the room was clean and new towels every day The few   es doesn t help though  I will never stay here again  I almost feel bad about writing this since i am sure the place could be so much better with only little effort put in   I hope the owners read this and try to do something  
N => look for something else i stayed at the apollo hotel london  bayswater  for   nights last month  as it is a budget hotel i did not expect the ritz but at least an appropriate surrounding for a human being  i start now with the positive aspects  the hotel is close to hyde park    minute from bayswater road where all buses leave direction oxford street etc  there are lots of small restaurants and shops near by as well as some small supermarkets  the hotel staff was friendly  the check in was quick  the breakfast continental  toast  rolls  jam  butter  cheese  tea  coffee  all ok  now the negative point  the room  it was just awful  as it was very very tiny i could only move sideways between my bed and the wall to get into the bathroom  the bathroom was the tiniest i ever saw in my life  and i saw a lot of rooms during my job as a travel agent and frequent traveller   i am not a big person       m  normal weight  but i really felt like getting claustrophobic in this hole  the furniture was flea market style  all very worn out  i had no access to the wardrobe as a chair was placed in front of it  obviously to put some stuff on it but that meant you could not open the wardrobe door   but the worst was the mattress  it caved in and really  i could feel every spring which made sleeping very unpleasant  it was depressing  fortunately i was away at lot  i stayed in other budget hotels before and they were acceptable but this place was bad beyond compare don t go there  
N => Good Location  The only positive thing about the Apollo hotel is the location  amp  price  The rooms are tiny  but that didn t bother me  But what I didn t like was     Musty odor in room     Rarely had hot water     Staff not very friendly  I didn t bother complaining because I knew the staff woulnd t do anything about it  Another issue was that you have to turn in your room key when ever you leave the hotel   not a problem  but it just seems odd  Would be great if they d straighten out these problems  you can t beat the location  But with all the hotels in Bayswater to choose from  the Apollo would be my last choice  
N =>  Dad is this called a hotel  Be warned   never ever visit this hotel  again   When we arrived    pm  we were told  that the toilet had broken down and we had to stay at another hotel for two nights  Once in the Apollo  our room should be a family room  but was actually a double with additional beds   totally small and no place to store things which would be important when travelling with children  The breakfast was absolutely basic   it should be  quot continental quot  but wasn t at all  The first morning they even ran out of jam  the next day the orange juice was diluted  You could not lock the room properly and the staff was kind of unfriendly  As a regular visitor to Youth hostels I can assure you  the standard is the same     
N => EEK I think I am in a college dorm room Where oh where to begin   our stay at the Apollo started off on what we thought to be a sour note only to end up being a blessing in disguise  We arrived to plumbing problems  causing us to be relocated to the Troy Hotel next door  delightful  but thats another review  The next day we had to move our bags back to the Apollo  were given keys that reminded me of a gas station bathroom key which we were told we had to leave when leaving the hotel  little scary and piled into a very small elevator to our floor  After deisgnating a hall with turns every   ft  through  quot fire doors quot   this was a joke  we found our room  My husband and I attempted to enter together which was not possible with luggage  We went in pulled our bags behind and discovered we now took up the ENTIRE room  Trying to stay positive I used the bathroom tucking myself between the toilet and the sink  I am only     quot  mind you  and taking a deep breathe  The bed looked like it was used in a dorm room and I swear I recognized the blanket on the bed which was up against a paneled wall and was a full if that  I sat on the bed causing the ends of the mattress to come up around me  There were no outlets for any of our    adapters thus nothing could be recharged  It was at this point we opted to go back to the Troy and take a loss on the money from our package that went to the hotel    less souvenir was quite worth it   All I can say is SCARY  I didn t expect luxury but clean would have been nice  My advise stay next door at the Troy  Great price nice accomodations  lovely staff  
N =>  Bootleg Hotel I ll start off with a positive note  the tube  bayswater station since queensway is under construction  is fairly close to the hotel which made it easy to get around quickly  The staff was okay  The bathroom that we had was newly remodeled and very clean which was great  The rooms were tough  I felt like they should have paid me to stay there  It s equivelant to a motel   truck stop hotel  We came back to the hotel in the evening after a long day to find our room unlocked  the cleaning staff did not lock our room after they were finished  That was a very uneasy feeling  The lockes on the door are like bedroom door locks in a house  You also have to leave your key at the front desk which is something that you don t do in most hotels  Beware London is incredibly expensive  if your using dollars up against the pound   And the cusine in London is not very tasty  So stick to your mcdonalds  pizza hut  and other things you are familiar with  
N =>  Good location bad hotel The Apollo is in a convenient location  but even for the price I would not stay there again  The staff was rude and our room was so small that we did not have room to open our suitcases on the floor  The breakfast was pretty mediocre  We stayed at this hotel as part of a       package  but I definitely would not stay here again  
N =>  It is cheap This was not a place I would chose to stay again  Our room was clean  small and plain  The ceiling light fixture was a plain bulb  no fixture  Bathtub was huge and dangerous  It was hard to get into and slick on the bottom  Shower curtain didn t cover it  so the floor was always wet  Towels were mostly ok  but I would have loved a wash cloth   Security was a joke  We accidently locked a key in one of our rooms  The hotel said they didn t have an extra and told us  we would have to pay to call a lock company  We used someone elses key and it worked fine  There were no deadbolts or chains  That room also did not get maid service for the week we were there  The staff could hardly speak English  If there was a problem they were talk among themself in another language  I saw them tell people they just had to live with major problems   Breakfast was basically bread  jam  butter and tea  if you could get the attention of the hostess  There was also cornflakes  orange juice and milk  but those were the smallest glasses I have ever seen  Having read previous reviews  we had brought peanut butter and that helped a lot  
N =>  Would never stay here again We knew it would be a budget hotel and expected as much    however  when they could not give us more than one towel or one cup for our   night stay  quot due to occupancy quot  it really added new meaning to the word budget  They adverstised having television  hair dryers  and a safe deposit for valuables  The t v  didn t work  there was no hair dryer  and the front desk attendant could not locate our valuables in the safe deposit box  Our shower door was broken to the point of flooding the bathroom floor  When we reported this to the manager  it seemed to be of no importance  You are required to turn in your room key upon every departure from the hotel  this was no problem   The breaking point came when they accused us of not turning in our key  We used a master and went to the the room to discover that a repair person had entered to remove one half of the broken shower door  We suspect he she used the key and didn t return it to the front desk  After   days with one towel for two of us and no room key  we checked into the hotel across the street for    more euros  It was a relief to go from a    x    room to a suite for so little money  I wouldn t recommend this hotel to anyone I held dear  
N =>  Just fine  
N => it was not as bad as other reviewers described  
N => Not worth it    
N => OK but oculd be better  
N =>  Overbooking in Hotel   
N =>  Not again  
N => comfortable budget hotel  
N =>   se si hanno poche pretese si pu  fare    
N =>   Per chi ha poche pretese  
N =>  Apollo Hotel das schlimmste was ich je erlebt habe  
N =>   the worst hotel in london  Very dirty  unfriendly staff  bad breakfast  without elevator  really small rooms    the worst thing  lots of bugs and ticks everywhere  disgusting  A real nightmare The only good thing is the location I wouldn t suggest it even to my worst enemy  
N =>   Will not be going back Ufrendly  unhelpfull  canclled resevation without notice   E Mail to wrong address    
N =>   Do not stay here Booked this hotel in a rush as needed somewhere to stay after the Oasis gig in Wembley and there were not many hotel rooms left within my budget  Obviously when you pay     for a room for one night in London you don t expect the earth  but I do expect a clean  safe room  When we arrived we had to ring a bell for the receptionist  who kind of grunted at us and pointed at breakfast and check out times  not great customer service We had room   which was opposite the dining room  and I think directly over the tube line as I was awoken at about  am with the sound of trains which continued every    mins    not great for a nights sleep  The main light from the ceiling had no shade and the electrics were exposed on the ceiling  the bathroom was mouldy and made me feel quite sick there was a random grey wire coming out of the wall which was exposed  Overall this hotel was ABSOLUTLY DISGUSTING and there is no way I would ever stay there again  I didn t really want to stay this time unfortunatly we didn t have time to trek around london trying to find another alternative  
N =>   absolutely NOT recommendable   disgusting    Simply disgusting   My boyfriend and I had plans to stay there for   nights  We didn t expect much when we arrived as is was pretty cheap   All we wanted was a place to sleep and a clean    bathroom  but when we saw the room  just a few meters away from the tube  dirty  very uncomfortable atmosphere  unfrienly staff  let alone the bathhroom          we changed our plans very quickly  I mean after we left the so called  quot hotel quot    in Germany you would never get offered a place like this as a hotel   we went through London to find something else to stay for the night and we saw many youth hostels and hotels but none of those were as ugly as this We would NEVER EVER come back to this place  
N =>  Disgusting   Dont stay here  My family and I stayed here the week before Christmas in       We were so looking forward to seeing London  we were half way thru our   week time of England and Europe  so we had big suitcases and being winter they weren t lightOur arrival we were greeted by either indian or pakistani gentleman  and given keys to our room     flights up  narrow stairs and hard work with heavy bags  I have to say we rarely saw any females and only assume this is the reason for the cleaniness of the place Apon our arrival in the family room  my own bedroom is bigger   which is would be a big a normal   bedroom hotel room  we found one double and   single CRAMMED in  with the   suitcases and   adults basically it was really tight Sleeping was a night mare  Whilst it was freezing outside we were wearing summer PJ s because it was so hot  we kept our window open with an empty coke bottle to allow fresh air and had the joy of constant trains going past to keep us awake  The beds were terrible and springs stuck out in places  so needless to say we didnt get much sleep over the   days we stuck it out here  There was a TV which was a   cm and at least it worked  and a the best thing was the microwave which allowed us to have a few heated dinners instead of going out  There wasnt a kettle  we asked and got one or any tea making facitlies so we bought some ourselvesThe bathroom also was putrid  thongs were worn always  it looked like it had never been cleaned  and if wasnt for the fact we need to have a shower we probably we have avoided it all together  Breakfast was toast and coffee or tea  we had taken our own vegeimite  we are aussies of course  and my daughter left it on the table and they threw it out   a brand new jar and it was gone I only wish I had known this site existed before going to stay at this place and had taken photos to show how bad this place was  I didnt take any to try and forget our stay here 
N =>  Absolute Hovel  Terrible  Upon arrival at this hotel I was greeted by a reception behind a glass pane   like a bank  as if I was trying to rob the place  not a great start  Next I was directed down to my basement room by rude impatient staff  It was cramped  stuffy and small enough to be most hotels bathroom  A winodw led out onto a yard of some sort  and sincehalf the room was underground anyone could jump in if the window was left open  I did NOT feel safe here  The en suite bathroom and carpet were ridiculously dirty and the toilet was broken  Streaks of scum actually covered the shower wall and floor  It was disgusting  I ve stayed in hostels before and this place made them look like   star accomodation  It couldn t have been worse  
N => BASIS Unterkunft zu vern nftigem Preis in Toplage  
N =>  non andate in questo hotel      
N =>   Horrible horrible einfach nur grausames Hotel    NIEMALS Buchen  
N =>  I will definitively come back This hotel had it all   perfect location  pleasant staff  nice room  we had a family room   cool lounge where we could write home on the free PC with internet  good breakfast and good beeds  We had a friend staying in a single room  His room was small  but the hotel was really good in all other ways so he didn t bother  The bathroom was small  but to this price in London   it s really the best place to stay  I have tried a lot of hotels in London  and this is the best so far  
N =>  fantastic friendly home from home stayed at this lovely small hotel in august and could not have picked a better hotel and location   We was treated like family from the moment we arrived by richard jackie and kyle  Our bags was carried to our rooms which was not ready but jakie offered to make us a coffee while the rooms was being cleaned  breakfast was very good   good choice and great english breakfast offered  service was quick and efficiant  Rooms very clean my only complaint was the very small bathroom which we got use to  Location was great easy to get to places with at least   underground stations close by  lovely lounge for guests to use and bonuse FREE internet use   in short amazing stay at this hotel great staff helpful friendly and always ready for a chat i have already recommended this hotel to family and friends a big thanks for making our stay perfect 
N =>   COULDN T BE BETTER Myself  amp    daughters      amp      stayed for   nights       to        We crammed in   theatre trips  Dirty Dancing  Oliver  Les MIserables  Hairspray  in   days  and for this the location was excellent  We travelled from Liverpool to Euston  and didn t have to set foot on the tube once  which was a bonus   The breakfast was great  even for   vegetarians  and the staff were friendly without being intrusive  The room was very clean and larger than expected  even the bathroom    I would definitely stay again  and would recommend it to anyone visiting London  
N =>   London   Arosfa We stayed at Arosfa Hotel from   ust till   ust       and we really enjoyed to stay in this nice hotel  We  re four friends who love London and for our forth time in the capital we  ve chosen Arosfa  Good choice  Arosfa will be our hotel in London  The rooms are small  but it doesn t matter  people comes to London to live the city and not to stay in rooms  I said small rooms but they re very comfortable and clean as well The hotel s staff is very gentle and kind  I recommend Arosfa Hotel because Arosfa feels like home   Arosfa  you miss us yet  
N =>   Small spotless  We wanted somewhere central to stay with our daughter when on a flying visit to London to see a show  We were very happy with our triple room at the Arofsa for an overnight stay  even though the bathroom was very small  which they told us about in advance   Lovely welcome from Kyle  the fact that this is a family run place shows in the standard of cleanliness  amp  small touches like the fresh fruit in the room  The english breakfast was fine  with decent coffee  They even looked after our cases after we d checked out as we wanted to do a spot of sightseeing We have stayed in a lot of hotels in London on business  amp  leisure trips over the years  most of which were a lot more costly   and would recommend this to anyone on a budget who wants a decent  friendly place to stay  
N =>   Welcome Back   My friend and I returned to stay at the Arosfa to visit exibitions at the British Museum and the V amp A What a lovely surprise to be welcomed by Richard and Jackie Our stay was fab as usual We discovered that the No    bus which stops just across the road takes you to the Royal Academy on Picadilly  and stops right outside the V amp A How convienient is that Will be returning when we plan our next trip  
N =>  Very Small Room English Breakfast Included Clean I booked Arosfa Hotel after reading the mostly good comments here on TripAdvisor I stayed at Arosfa for   nights  When we first arrived  I was shocked to see the room  It was extremely small and we hardly had space to walk about in the room  The bathroom was very clean but again  very small  Perhaps it was just the room we were assigned We did not interact much with the staff  so  no comments on that Breakfast was included in the price we paid  It was alright and every morning  we were so full that some days  we could just skip lunch  A very clean hotel       and conveniently located too  
N =>  LOVED THIS HOTEL We split our London stay into   parts  with a week in Paris in between  This was the first hotel of our trip and we LOVED it most of all  Everything was so great   the accommodations  location  and staff   the whole experience The rooms were clean and a nice size   definitely enough room for us and our luggage to fit comfortably  The bathroom WAS tiny  but not a problem   it was fine  and clean   There was a tv and alarm clock in our room   both very handy and which we used  The lounge area was very comfortable   my two friends would head down and use the computer to touch base with family and friends Staff was nice and helpful I really enjoyed the neighborhood  A couple of tube stations are nearby  Lots of good pubs close by as well  Beautiful neighborhood   close to a university and the British museum We were able to get to the hotel from Heathrow via the tube We wished we could have stayed here the second leg of the London stay  Unfortunately  room was not available  Next time we know to DEFINITELY book in advance     
N => great find found this on the internet chose it as recommended as top hotel under         and it had good reviews on TA  We were not disappointed  we had a twin room on top floor overlooking rear  As other reviewers have remarked the room was small and the bathroom compact  However  it was spotlessly clean  the staff owners were friendly and welcoming and the breakfast was good and included  Well located within short walk to all central locations and in a clearly safe area  Will definately use again  we have paid a lot more at other hotels and not been as satisfied or felt as welcome  
N =>  Great Place Great Hosts We loved the hotel  The staff was pleasant and helpful and the breakfasts were delicious  We stayed in this area because it was close to where our son was going to school in London  The hotel is just a few blocks from the incredible subway system in London so the location was not an issue  The room was very clean  hotel is well maintained and tastefully decorated  The bathroom is extemely small  can barely turn around but this was not an issue  I would recommend this hotel to anyone  
N =>   A Great Hotel My friend and I just returned from spending a week at the Arosfa Hotel  and we can t say enough about it  The location is wonderful  just a few blocks from the Goodge Street underground station  on the Northern Line   in the heart of Bloomsbury  The staff is helpful and friendly  The hotel doesn t have a lift  however  the staff brought our bags up to the room for us  The room was small  it was a twin   and it had the world s smallest bathroom  but that didn t phase us in the least  We weren t in London to stay in our hotel  and while the bathroom was small  it contained a functional shower where the water was hot enough to enjoy showering  We were offered a full English breakfast each morning  but to be honest  it was more food than we could eat  The full breakfast included   eggs  bacon  sausage  tomato  beans  toast  yogurt  cereal  fresh fruit  juice and coffee or tea  While the hotel offers Wi fi  they also have a computer that guests can use as desired  Having access to the internet was a wonderful plus  Best of all  the hotel was immaculately clean  The only concern we had was that we were in a room at the front of the hotel  we were in Room      and the noise from the street was definitely noticeable  we had the windows open since the weather was just about perfect   Overall  we can t say enough about the Arosfa  
N =>   Good value for London We agree mostly with the other reviewsGood location  rooms clean  quiet if room faces the backyard  standard breakfast We were however in a small room with a very tiny bathroom  not suitable for bigger persons  It will be dificult however to find a bigger  clean room in a good location for the same price in London Staff could be friendlier  
N =>  Mmm    I think the best thing to do is a list of positives and negatives Positives   very clean  good location  pleasant decor  adequate breakfast  cooked English  yogurts  juice  cereals  fruit   Negatives   male staff should have been friendlier  especially at breakfast    our twin room was incredibly small  pack light    the en suite was minute  anyone tall or with a larger build would have struggled to shower   it was uncomfortably warm  but noisy with the window open  All in all I can t really fault the place for the price  but I can t rave about it either  It served a purpose  I wouldn t hurry to go back and stay in a twin room  although doubles and singles may not be as cramped   
N =>   Average The staff was fine but the hotel was average in my opinion  We had a room       that was on the top and it was tiring having to lift our luggages   breakfast was not exceptionnal 
N =>   Great Hotel We stayed at the Arosfa Hotel in mid ch for three nights  It s very convenient for Euston station  we walked to the hotel in about ten minutes  Richard greeted us when we arrived  took our bags to our room whilst we had a cup of tea in the comfortable lounge which is equipped not only by a flat screen T V  and free internet access  but also tea and coffee facilities  Our room which had recently received a face lift was spotless  as was the bathroom small but adequate   The breakfasts were excellent as was the housekeeping  Richard  Jackie and the staff are doing a tremendous job  nothing was too much trouble  We shall certainly stay again next time we are in London  
N =>   Just what we expected Hotel Arosfa LondonWe selected this hotel  based on the review  on Tripadvisor I must say  it was just what we expected  a very nice little hotel  with very friendly atmosphere  very nice staff and very cosy Every day when we return after being in the city the whole day  we came home to a clean room and after a few day  we felt very much this was  quot our home quot  We have already recommended it to our friends  and we will stay here next time in London  
N =>  Highly recommended We decided to stay at Arosfa hotel as it was recommended in a travel guide that we d read prior to our visit to London  What a wonderful place with welcoming staff and a real home from home atmosphere  The quad room we stayed in was truly spotless with ample room for   adults  The en suite was small but adequate and the cleanliness first rate  The location of Arosfa hotel is excellent  very near to Goodge St underground station and Euston St  A thoroughly enjoyable stay  
N =>  good experience would recommend I chose Arofsa based solely on the good reviews from Trip Advisor  Thought I should return the favor by giving my honest assessment to fellow travelers Pros    minute walk British Museum  minute walk from Goodge stationWalking distant to many pubs shops   college sceneClean  bathroom was spotless Good water pressure  Believe me  that is important  Fair honest friendly ownersHigh speed internet in loungeFree instant coffee tea in loungeLots of travel books in lounge for referenceNegatives Definitely not a page from Elle D cor  but hey  it s    pound per night En suite bathroom size was same size as airplane bathroom  but it s very cleanNo elevators  owner Dorta was there to lend a hand with heavy luggage Mattress was smaller than North American twin sizeBring your own shampoo  they only give soap Everything the other recent reviews said are true  Have fun in London    
N =>   English Charm at a good price We stayed   nights at the Arosfa and enjoyed our stay  We thought it was a good value for the location  a short walk to Goodge St  Tube station  and a manageable walk to Soho and the Theatre District  The breakfast is hearty and gives a good start to your day  There is a very nice common area where you can help yourself to hot coffee or tea  use the computer to check e mail or access the internet  browse their excellent collection of travel books  or just chat with other guests  We were lucky to have met some other nice travelers in this hotel during our stay  The rooms were small  but we expected this from the prior reviews that we read  The bathroom was also small  but efficient in design  The mattresses in our room were not the most comfortable I have slept on  but probably not the worst either   we were able to sleep and that was all that was important  I did think the owners could be more generous with soap  there was only the smallest of bars in the bathroom when we checked in  and I was glad that we had brought our own soap and shampoo  Our room was at the very top of a long flight of stairs  no lift   and rather exhausting to get up  especially with luggage  but we did have assistance from the owner when we checked in  You should also know that they have a policy of not allowing you to bring guests to your room  but to be honest  the rooms are too small for entertaining anyways  
N => There must be a lot better than this   
N =>  Small but perfectly formed  if you get a room at the back   
N => tiny but clean  
N => Size sometimes matters  
N =>   Un gioiellino per qualit  prezzo  
N =>   Close to Chunnell train A   star hotel which had a tiny room walking distance to KIngs Cross and St  Pancreus Station  The Bathroom was fairly new  and clean  No telephone  Breakfast was fine  Bed covers a little worn  Not enough light   A internet rate that was very resonable for London  The tube is at KIngs Cross  The man at desk at night was quite helpful  
N =>   Run AWAAAAAAAAY  Really  It is THAT BAD  If you simply cannot find another place to stay    then  change your travel dates until somewhere else is available Honestly  We stayed here four years ago for our wedding anniversary  and the experience was so bad that we feel the need to write a review so others do not make the same mistake we did  We wanted somewhere near Kings Cross  this  quot hotel s quot  only positive feature   though the hotel is fairly inexpensive  it is still a waste of money  The breakfast was basic  The service was almost non existent  The room was dirtier than any we have seen  Take our advice  and the advice of hundreds of others    pay a bit extra to stay in a hotel that is not damp  dingy  and dirty  we had to request    ie  demand     quot new quot  bedding upon arrival     you don t want to know the filth we found   Happy travels   And by the way  happy travels do NOT involve the ARRIVA   
N =>  DON T EVER HERE STAY Following a late event  I booked a room at Arriva Hotel which was already supposed to be paid for by the company credit card before my stay  My collague had emailed confirmation of payment before hand to ensure this was taken care of so I didn t have to worry  I turned up at the hotel to be greeted  or not  by a very angry and quite aggresive male receptionist who demanded my payment there and then to stay the night  Even after I explained the details and showed him confirmation  he still wanted payment and made me feeling really uncomfortable and I bit scared to be honest  I therefore paid the money but I really didn  t want to stay here that night but because it was late  I thought I would just try to sleep and leave as early as possible  I phoned the hotel in the morning to tell the other receptionist about my experience and although she was apologetic  it didn t make much of a differece  I just wanted to warn people before they book a room here  not to  Never ever had such bad customer service in my life    
N =>   the worst  hotel  I have ever had the misfortune to stay in To start with the  only  positives  the Arriva was somewhere handy  for King s Cross   Euston  to lay our heads overnight  was reasonably clean  and was unfazed by our late arrival  after midnight   That said  it was a Fawlty Towers type experience  without the humour  which I do not wish to repeat  I had emphasised in the booking that it was conditional on there being a functioning lift as stairs would be a problem to us  and asked that if there was no functioning lift the management contact us  No contact received other than a confirmation of the booking   and when we arrived we found we were in a basement room  down stairs   On enquiring about the lift we were told  offhandedly  that it was  out of order   No apology  When I said that this posed a problem I was told  Oh  it s only one or two stairs   maybe three   Actually  it was more than     The  male  receptionist did not offer to carry our heavy luggage down said stairs and initially stared at me when I requested help with it  Fortunately I can be assertive when required and eventually he did help  On arrival in our room we found that the advertised tea making facilities consisted of cups and saucers but no kettle  The man on reception was unapologetic about this omission but agreed to  see whether he could find us one   and brought it to our room half an hour later  By that time we had discovered the unbelievably uncomfortable mattresses  which appeared to have no padding between the springs and the fabric cover  Fortunately it was a hot night so we could lie on top of the duvets  which insulated us slightly from the springs  On trying to turn the light off we discovered the next problem  which was that it continued to flash on and off for the next half hour   but by this time we had realised that if we asked for anything to be done about it we would be likely to be up for a lot longer  waiting for something to be done  so we closed our eyes and tried to ignore it In the morning  after an extremely uncomfortable night  we were foolish enough to go to breakfast  cornflakes  milk  white toast  they said they didn t have any brown  despite my having asked for that on the booking too   jam  and tea or coffee  served in a dingy  windowless basement room  When the  waitress  said they had no brown bread to toast I asked whether anyone had read my booking request  and she unapologetically said  no   To be fair  the reception man did  on being asked  help us back up the stairs with our luggage None of the staff seemed to have the slightest notion of customer care  hospitality  looking after people or even basic courtesy  and I was truly embarrassed that the many overseas visitors there would have this as part of their experience of Britain  If you had a category for  attitude  I would rate that as  terrible  too Thare must be better places than this for the money    
N =>  Mice  The location is great only a few minutes walk from Kings Cross tube and train stations  and the front desk guy was very helpful and efficient  I checked in to a room on the street which was noisy  but it was O K overall with a TV and a fridge  But that night I saw a mouse that did not look too scared of me as it eyed me for a few secinds then walked casually and disappeared into the bathroom  I complained and got moved to another room looking at the back  which was quieter  but I saw another mouse which was even bigger than the first  I forced myself to ignore it and slept  then checked out the next morning cancelling three more days I originally intended to stay  
N =>   Never Stay Here First ov all we arrived at the hotel from outside and the reception was ok but that was the only thing what was  the guy on recepion looked like he didnt have a clue what he was on about he wanted cash up front and tried to over charge us until we pulled him up that he hadnt give us our change  He said the lift was out of order for that night which was a lie as we read reviews before we went there an someone said back then the lift was out of order and that was in feb      so it wasnt just for a night  we was on the top floor and had to carry several luggage up there a pram and an old woman who can hardly walk  when we was there a woman came down to ask for an extra pillow and he said no not tonight he had no intentions to provide her with one at all  When we finally got up to the rooms they were not small but miniture and disgustingly dirty the curtains had brown damp and mould stains all over it and the wooden window banged all night with the wind as it was broken we had a back alley view of the ruffest flats in london and all drunks outside shouting  we also had to pass them to get to the hotel which was scary as it was like      pm at night in the dark  also round the corner was oubs and nightlife which you can also hear threw the night  The bed for a double was tiny we only just fitted our luggage in the room it was that small  My parents room had all damp brown stains running down the wall right above their bed  The beds themselves were dirty and old  Only thing i can say positve about this hotel was they had a shower and toilet in your tiny room but they only could fit one in at a time its that small  The carpets in the room and hall way were sticky and your feet stuck to the floor it was absolutly vile  Then at breakfast they had one tiny basement room with about   tables and you had to queue up for a table u got some toast and that was it i heard a man ask for more ham what had gone and the waiting staff woman said no not today  The whole service was disgusting and rude you pay        for a mancy dirty damp room and a rack off toast  They made you sit with anyone in the room with strangers and not together with your family  When we left the next morning we asked the reception guy could they get us a taxi for   he ordered a mini cab for only four to get in  so my dad and fiance had to walk to the station with heavy luggage and my mum nan brother myself and daughter had to leave them to walk threw hes stupidity as we all cudnt fit in and my nan cud hardly walk  The best thing about that hotel and experience was handing them keys back when we were leaving and getting out off that horrible smelly hotel  Overall rating is extremly poor take my advice dont go  
N =>   There are better Tiny room  not the cleanest  Very low pressure in the shower  Had to queue up for the breakfast  the dining room was too small to fit all guests   poor breakfast anyway  We had to call the police one night due to violent action in a nearby room  
N =>   Horrible  don t stay here I didn t book this hotel  but had I read the reviews on this site first  I wouldn t have  A friend of mine gave me the bad news after I had said where I was saying  and in most cases  the reality was equal or slightly worse than the reviews  I didn t experience rodents in the room as other users seem to have  but the room was just horrible  small  poorly decorated  uncomfortable bed  an array of bizarre wall mounted phone equipment hooked together with trunking runnning up and down the walls  There was a  quot modern quot  wardrobe there  but it was a token gesture  given the rest of the room  The miniscule shower room was tiled  didn t take many floor tiles to achieve this  obviously   The shower itself was OK  but underpowered  So underwelmed  didn t try breakfast  
N =>  Dreadful place please think very hard before you book  Badly needs overhauling and renovating  reception not very helpful  Definately do not take children with you  
N =>   Wont go back Four of us arrived after short walk from Kings cross station  Hotel looked nice from outside   Receptionist was not very friendly and did not seem to care   All rooms were pretty cramped although they did have a fridge in them  In one room friend got woken up every so often with fridge vibrating against the bed  Two of the rooms were front facing    onto the street and could be noisy with traffic  The two rear facing rooms were a delight    If you like to watch drunks fighting and throwing their empty cans about  Two rooms were damp with water running down the walls  Two of the phones in the rooms didnt work as the wires were cut through   I had an unwelcome visitor in the room in the form of a small brown furry friend yes it was a mouse  It would appear that this is common as when I spoke to reception they shrugged and said things are in place to catch them  One of my friends had two of the same type visitors in his room  The fire alarm in one of the rooms had been disconnected which did not fill me with confidence and some of the lights did not work  We complained but as there were no more rooms available we made do for one night  Breakfast was cereal and toast  the toast was freshly made but the cereal was soft and tasted as if it was out of date  On a plus the bathrooms were nice  I think they were newly installed although the showers were a little cramped  Short walk from Kings cross which was okay  However I would have walked further had I known what to expect   
N =>   The worsed hotel experience i ever had in my life My first morning i woke up here a mouse ran across the floor in front of me I ve been to London before but if this was my first visit I would never go back This hotel should not be open I told the receptionist and he acted like it happens often  never said sorry just gave us another room across from the same one  When we walked into the first room the first thing i saw was dust on everything it was filthy  the walls were filthy  one was no better than the other  I had to check out the breakfast much to my husbands dissapproval  What can I say  Before you stay here read the other reviews you re better off paying a little extra and having a nice hotel  
N =>   hot water please   and a lick of paint the hotel is located near to kings cross station  a good ten minute walk  The hotel is small and on a back street  Our room was available before the advised time so we checked in  The bathroom was nice except their was no hot water most of the time  Two sachets of body gel shamppo were available  We had clean hand towels every day  There was a remote controlled tv  There were tea makiing facillities but the kettle lead wouldn t reach the socket so the kettle had to stay on the floor  We couldn t fill the kettle very well as the sink was shallow  The bedroom itself was VERY basic  The bedding was clean but marked  The furniture was old fashioned  We had   pillows between us  I asked for another pillow on the phone  He sounded unsure  I was given two old thin pillows in the same case  Breakfast facilities are cramped  We had to share a table  Breakfast was toast  hot drink  juice  cereal  Doors banged constantly  Bulb shoved into reading lamp above the bed head  No shade  
N =>   Unwelcoming front office guy I did not arrive at Arriva with great expectations but going by the website  did expect it to be a decent stay  To begin with  the front office person was extremely inhospitable  read rude   I booked a double bedroom and was taken by surprise with the size of the room  There was hardly any space left  to move around  if I put   suitcases flat  It really looked like a single room turned into a double one  The breakfast was bad and the TV in the room never worked The good things about the hotel was its proximity to Kings Cross tube and to St Pancreas station and yeah  the hotel was clean  
N =>   Cramped and lacking After reading agreeable reviews about the Arriva Hotel on Tripadvisor I was looking forward to a pleasant nights stay  However  I was soon to be disappointed when I arrived and was told that my room was on the third floor and that the lift was broken  It then got worse when we went into the room and found it to be cramped due to a double bed and single bed into a room that should only have had two singles and was only set up for two people    cups    small wardrobe    chair    towels etc   Due to their attempt to cram an extra bed you could not get to the small wardrobe to hang anything up  forget trying to get the chair out to use and you were literally falling over yourselves to get anywhere in the room  including the window  which did not open so no air  The bathroom was clean and serviceable but there was a lack of decent towels  The hotel also offers a TV  it is such a pity that it did not work properly  although we were not there to watch telly  it is nice to have on as you are getting ready to go out bed breakfast  and when reported the problem was told that nothing would be done until we left  They also offer a refrigerator in the room  but only one plug so it was a choice of a fridge which would have taken at least our day s stay to start up or a telly that did not work  The breakfast was ok  cereal and toast was fine however the room was so small that if you got a table  not enough of them compared to guests  you could not get out and you were encouraged to leave ASAP Overall  the hotel was clean  but very small and did not provide the services that they offer  Would I stay there again or recommend it to anyone else   no  
N =>   dont be fulled by the cancelation policy i am warning others not to book this hotel  i have been charged for a room that i did not stop in and the managment are refusing to give me a refund  they are unhelpfull and agressive  I was stuck in france as the chanel tunnel had a fire and could not stop in the hotel booked  i rang the hotel the minuite i found out  two days later after checing my account i noticed they had charged me  I phoned the manager and they said they would not help me and are not interested  
N =>   great location We were   adults and one child staying at the hotel for   nights  We arrived at   am  check in time is at  pm but they have a luggageroom  However  our room was ready so we could actually check in   hours early  no extra charge  The rooms are quite small  all different  there is a lift  important if you have heavy suitcases  We found one of the rooms we got too small  but asked in the reception if we could change it for a bigger and it was no problem at all  The bathrooms had showers  small but clean and quite new  the rooms basic but clean  and with fridge  coffee tea and hairdryer  all I need  There was a small tv as well  but only with a few channels  anyway we didn t go to London to watch tv  Best of all  the location  A quiet street in the citycentre  A short walkingdistance to King s Cross  The breakfastroom is very small  you might have to wait for a table and you might have to share the table  Don t expect full English breakfast  you get coffee  tea  juice  cereals  milk  plenty of toast  jam  butter  cheese  ham  that s it  Friendly staff with lot of work  even though in some reviews there were complaints  but we were really treated well by the staff  The only complaint we have is when we were leaving and asked the receptionist to call a taxi and to ask how much the price would for a big cab   persons suitcases   He told us a price and we agreed  When the car came it wasn t a taxi but a carhire  We were a bit surprised but we found the price reasonable  however when we got to the station he wanted to charge us extra because we were   and he said the price that was agreed was for   even though we had ordered a big taxi  Of course we didn t pay more than the price that was agreed from the beginning  then he should have told us when we got in  We think the driver was a friend of the receptionist and were quite annoyed even though it really doesn t have anything to do with the hotel itself  
N =>  Cheap but not cheerful   The hotel on the outside doesnt look too bad  quite nice really  but the room we stayed in was rather unpleasent  I expected it to be small  but there wasnt even a bedside table and the tv was nearly on the ceiling  There was one very flat pillow and a nasty looking stain on the bed  The bathroom was clean at least  but the noise of the traffic outside and two different men snoring kept me awake for most of the night  I wont be going back there  
N =>   Good budget accommodation Me and my husband decided to stay at this hotel due to the budget price it offered  I had read reviews beforehand therefore knew roughly what to expect  We were offered a front or back room and chose the latter  thinking that is may be quieter after reading some of the reviews  regarding traffic noise  It was quiet  although the window rattled with the wind  and I had to wedge a  many times   folded peice of paper into the gap to stop this from happening  which did the trick  The double room was adequate  the bed was comfy enough  The bathroom was clean  and the towels were changed both days  The small fridge made a loud whirring noise  annoying when your trying to sleep  so we unplugged it  Breakfast is included in the price but beware german gestapo is in charge of the breakfast room   The first morning we were heading to a table that was free  and was politely   ordered to sit on a table that someone else was occupying  This was obviously to save the gestapo staff the trouble of tidying the other one up  The second morning the minute the clock struck     am  the breakfast room door was locked  What you see is what you get here  Would return due to budget price and locality  
N =>   Careless treatment of reservation problems The hotel has no frills  Rooms was mostly clean  although I saw a shoe stain on the wall  and the bed comfortable  My no   problem with the hotel is that when I arrived  I was told that I have no reservation because my credit card was declined  However  nobody notified me about it  When I told the hotel staff that I should have been notified about it  they told me that they are  quot too busy to notify everyone quot   They didn t look  that  busy  Luckily  they had a room for me  The breakfast was OK  
N =>  Creepy feeling in the basement   I stayed here whilst in London for one night as a lone female traveller  It was cheap but certainly not cheerful  On arrival at      pm  after being told by the taxi driver what a dodgy area it was   and was greeted  or shall I say ignored  by a man who could win the Rudest Man in London award  I was stood at the desk and he was watching TV and I had to get his attention  We then had a short kerfuffle about payment but it turned out this was because I hadn t understood his English  My room was in the basement and had dirt on the walls  There was a TV but no hair dryer as I was told previously  Bathroom was tiny but clean  No hot water though which was infuriating There was only a small lock on the door and to be frankI didn t feel very safe  Being in basement felt dodgy and I didn t sleep very well  partly because of the traffic noise too as I was at the front Room had fridge  sink and wardobe but was VERY basic and felt more like a hostel  I didn t go to breakfast as it was only between      and     am and I wanted a lie in Check out was at   am and the man at desk was friendly and was very helpful in ordering me a taxi to the station  I am sure some rooms are nice as I am not exactly used to staying at the likes of the Ritz  But if you re going  ask for a room above basement level   
N =>  Twice but no more Even though this hotel is not in the best area  we choose to book it for a second time as it was ok value the first time  However  this time it was very different than the first one  The standard is obviously very different from room to room as the room we got this time was terrible  Both dirty and almost falling apart  We tried to switch room but that was not possible Also  comming home in the middle of the night the night receptionist become irritated because we called the bell several times to get in  as he was asleep Only thing positive it that it is cheap but I would rather sleep in the park next time 
N =>  Avoid this place     The booking was made by the office staff online using the M Ds credit card  I then discovered that payment was NOT taken from the card it was simply used to hold the room  The M D had to go to the office on Saturday and fax a letter with his signature etc and the details of the credit card  The hotel then decided that this wasn t good enough and the M D should call the hotel  The Hotel had a problem processing the card as the address on the credit card did not have a house number    The Manager of the hotel insisted that I pay for the room myself  I explained that my company was the client and that I did not have the facilities to pay for the hotel  I was told that if I did not hand over cash I would not be allowed back into my room nor would I have access to my belongings  At this point my boss went back to the office  called the credit card company and confirmed that there was obviously something wrong with the new credit card system in the hotel  The Credit Card Company and merchant verification centre offered to deal with the Hotel directly but the manager of the hotel refused to take the call In the end my boss had to use his girlfriends  credit card  Strangely enough neither her address details  nor expiry date were required   I can safely say that this is the worst hotel service I and the company have ever experienced  I would advice potential guests to avoid this particular hotel  
N =>   Barely a step up from a hostel I was just not impressed at all  The rooms were very small  cheap  hardly maintained  We had a room on the ground floor next to the street   This is very noisy  and doesn t help that the window needed to stay cracked since there is no AC  You best take your shower early in the morning or at night else there will be no hot water by      AM  The drains were so slow you had to shower at     throttle to avoid flooding the bathroom  The clerk at the front desk wasn t exactly friendly  but not terribly rude either    Overall  my advice is stay here only if you can t afford somewhere better  
N =>  Rubbish Just returned from a night in this place   what a dump  Cheap but certainly not cheerful  As a group of   women  we booked   triple rooms only to be told these were not available on checking in  Bathrooms are tiny and have a lot to be desired  If you want a hot warm shower  be sure to be up before  am  Staff are not particularly friendly   I don t believe I saw a smile and certainly did not hear any pleasantries from them  Triple room had leak throughout the night  with water dripping down the wall  After a night out in Leicester Sq  only   of    taxis we flagged were willing to take us to Kings Cross  The area did not seem particularly safe either   my advice  Avoid this place  especially if its for more than   night    
N =>  Worst hotel in London This place is terrible  I read the reviews before I went so was not expecting much  but it is the worst hotel I have stayed in ever  When we arrived they did not have the rooms we booked and would do nothing about it  rude people  dirty and sleazy  pay more and go to something that is actually a hotel  
N => Hated the Arriva The Arriva was one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed at  Only half the amenities offered on some web sites were actually offered and the staff  primarily the manager  had no apologies for their lack of necessities  A few of the things missing were the in room safe  unavailable   hair dryer  available only upon request   restaurant  in the basement there is a room where you are given tea and toast   meeting rooms  never had   When they say  quot kitchenette quot   they should really say  closet type room with a rusty sink  Our bathroom was very dirty had little privacy with it s closet style sliding door  not to mention the broken overhead light which left us with minimal lighting  However  considering that there wasn t even an outlet in the bathroom  I guess adequate lighting wasn t really necessary  Also  their sites state  fully refurbished  which is blatantly false  Our furniture was very used and absolutely not new  Perhaps had the area around the Arriva been a little nicer  we would have just dealt with the issues at the hotel  but to walk through a scary part of King s Cross to a less than satisfactory hotel just wasn t worth it  no matter hot cheap  
N => Arriva decent place to stay We booked this hotel for a week long vacation last year and found it to be rather pleasant  The hotel is located near both the tube and bus so it was very easy to get around the city  We had no problems walking around the neighborhood even late at night and the local pubs had really good food  Breakfast was simple but adequate and we didn t have to wait for a table  Our room was cleaner and larger than most hotels we ve stayed at in Europe  Overall it was a good experience and we d stay there again  
N =>  never again I don t want to stay here ever again  I don t know what it was  but the towels smelt awfull  thank god I always bring one from home  On the site they tell us they have satelite tv  I think we only had a few boring channels  We stayed there for   nights and only the first morning they made our beds  The hotel had like   different people working at the counter everyday  and they just give the key to anyone     doesn t seem very safe to me  You can hear everything trough the walls  it s not very soundproof  They also had a sort of a kitchen  but we stayed out of that  it was so filthy  yuk  To be honest we didn t plan to make food there  but just to warn others who might want to  The sleeping couch  is terrible  it s too small too hard  even for kids  and they didn t want to give us an other bed or a matrass  they told us they didn t have one  On the last they  we put our suitcases in this place  cause we weren t leaving till much later   guess what we saw there      Matrasses    Gosh  why couldn t they have given us one    There is only one good thing about this hotel  and that s that there is a fridge  But if that s the only thing  then I rather stay somewhere else   ARRIVA    NEVER AGAIN         
N => s alright Close to King s Cross station  Very average hotel  Rooms were average  Breakfast was average  Staff was average  Price  however  was very good  No A C made it a little warm  so windows had to be opened which made it kind of noisy  Tough to find decent cheap accomodation in London  This is probably as close as you get  
N =>  This Hotel is a Lie We knew this hotel was a bargain  but they could have at least told us the truth  We were told that the hotel as parking and keeping that in mind  we rented a car  When we arrived  to our shock the man at the reception told us that there was no free parking  but parking around the corner for    pounds a day and you can t park there at night    so what are we suppose to do with the car  We had to take the car to the rental companys parking and were still being charged and no even using the car  We had requested a double and a triple room  The rooms look nothing like the pictures and are extremely dirty  The double room didnt even have a working door in the bathroom and the triple room had   beds   which was no convinient especially when it was   guys sharing the room The man at the reception seemed nervous the whole time and couldnt answer any of our questions  This made our trip to London very stressful and unpleasant  Arrive should be ashamed of themselfs for Lieing     
N => This place rocked  For an econo hotel  this placed totally rocked  It was conveniently located and our room was neat  Our bathroom was clean with a full size tub and a shower with good water pressure  Our room was a little small  but our friends had a room much larger  so I guess the size varies from room to room  There was also a full set of dishes  a mini fridge  and extra sink in the bedroom area  Breakfast was pretty much cereal  they even have Coco Pebbles   white toast  coffee tea  The staff was very pleasant  Overall  I had a great experience at this hotel  and I would definitely stay there again  
N => Adequate but Small Upon arrival we were assigned one of London s smaller  quot double quot  rooms with an even smaller private bathroom  You needed to keep the two sliding shower doors open in order to sit down on the toilet and have a place to put your feet  No wall covered the plumbing pipes under the sink which appeared to have been left exposed since renovation  The room contained two twin beds  a drop leaf table  and small TV which was bolted above a portable wardrobe closet  The hotel advertised satellite TV but was told it was not working for the   weeks prior to and including the week we stayed there  We were amazed how management also fit a sink and refrigerator along with a set of kitchen cabinets with dishes and silverware for two into the room  Daily housekeeping kept the room tidy  Their continental breakfast was adequate  We found the neighborhood surrounding the Arriva traveller friendly with lots of stores  grocery  liquour  news  tobaco  post office  and carryout resterants available as well as an easy walk to King s Cross St  Pancras tube station  We were usually back at the hotel by  pm and felt safe walking in all directions  
N =>  Tutto sommato per i prezzi di londra non male  
N =>   Tr s bon rapport qualit  prix     minutes   pieds de St Pancras  
N =>   buono per un week end mordi e fuggi  
N =>   No limpian ni hacen las camas  
N =>  good appartment great location reasonable price although the appartment was under going some renovation during our stay  not a great breakfast menu though 
N =>   Service with a smile I had to go to London for work recently and was booked into the Ascott fair by our travel department  Must admit to being apprehensive as I generally stay in bigger hotels  but what a surprise  The room was a good size and it came with a washing machine and an oven hob  The bed was a good size also  The breakfast included in the price was pastries  yoghurt  fruit and meats The staff there are really friendly and after a day knew me by name  It was my first time to London  but the front desk were helpful in pointing out how to get around the City I would really recommend this place to people who are looking for good value and good service 
N =>   Love the Ascott It was much better then I tought  It s very nice hotel I had been there during Christmas time  Room were spacious but not very clean and it need some maintenece work to be done but apart from that everything was good  Staff was very friendly and management very halpfull  Weekend after Christmas  when nothing works in England  I asked for Mangaer to have a word with  Not only was she there for me in a minute but she also solve my problem very quickly and with a big smile I would recomande this place because its good value for the money  
N =>  Not worth the price for me For the price I paid  I don t think I got the quality I was expecting  I paid      per night for a studio and stayed for   nights The hotel is supposed to advertise free high speed internet connection  wired  and also a wi fi  wireless  connection  However  there was no wireless signal in my room on the  th floor  The the wired internet in my room did not work  I made a complain but the wanted me to be in the room to fix it  I was here for work  I did not have time to sit around in the room during normal business hours  I ended up coming down to the lobby to use their really slow wireless connection   For one morning  Wednesday  the shower failed to produce hot water    The hotel controls heat AC centrally  and has no ability to adjust the temprature if the temparature outside changes  For e g if today it is   C  they will call a technician to change the thermostat centrally to start the heater  Say  in two days the teparature rises to    C  the heater keeps running  and you end up sweating in your room  Then they recommend you open the windows  which I did  and had to cope with the street noise from passing traffic The place is about    min walk from nearest Tube station Green Park or Bond street  I prefer to walk to Bond street in my case The area is expensive  so I will not complain about smaller room size  Staff is polite but not much use and were unable to fix my problems mentioned above The shower gel ran out but they did not bother to replace it  I called it to their attention  Good hotels make sure they replenish that  I did not like the towel quality either  The shower runs nice and hot  but difficult to operate Room was clean Had this place cost me      I would say it was good hotel  But for the price  you need to get quality which was missing My previous stay at      per night at Langham was very pleasant  That place is more professional and well managed  But they do charge     extra for the internet  So thats extra     per day  I saved here  which I guess makes it all worth it I would try Club Quarters at St  Paul next time  Its only       For that price  I can live with slightly poor quality  if at all  
N =>   Has gone downhill fast  A year ago  I had a great experience at the Ascott  This year was anything but  The front desk staff were incompetent  at best  and I thought dismissed my concerns in part because I was a woman travelling alone  After seeing three rooms either at street level and or full of cigarette smoke  I finally agreed to stay one night in the third  with the understanding that I would be moved to another room the next day  I was assured that this new room would have a dining table and be non smoking  Neither was true  Basically  they lied  The hotel was full  so switching to yet another room was not possible  I had had it by then anyhow   The rugs were badly spotted  the duvet was well past its toss by date  the shower sometimes worked and sometimes didn t  the kitchen was ill equipped and some of the dishes not clean  and I was aghast to discover they charged for teabags and biscuits provided in the room  these routinely are complimentary in even the cheapest British hotel  The staff in the breakfast room appeared to be equally incompetent  claiming that the coffee hot water machine was broken and would not work  quot for several days  quot  but making no attempt to provide an alternative  Another member of the staff later fixed this  quot broken quot  machine in about    seconds  This has gone from a classy  clean  well appointed and pleasant apartment hotel to a dump  
N =>   Great Location My husband  teenage son and I stayed in a   bedroom superior  corner room on the first floor   In general  we were happy with all aspects of this apartment and the service  The kitchen was well appointed  although small  and we made use of it nearly every evening  after two weeks on the road    staying in at night was a welcome change   The TVs were a bit small and certainly not up to premium hotel standards but this is England after all and there in not much to watch anyway  I agree with others that the breakfast room is crowded but if you adjust your schedule so as not to arrive when everyone else does    finding a table is relatively easy  i e  don t eat at   am   The sofa bed was not up to the standards of many extended stay hotels    our    year old son sunk to the support rails    but we did not find the main bed to be hard or uncomfortable  as some others have noted  The bathtub shower is very  very slick  had to put a towel down after I almost fell    no mat provided  and about every two minutes a    second shot of cold water was  provided  The air conditioning in the living area worked quite well but the bedroom unit was putting out only slightly cooled air  We asked them to look at it but they said nothing could be done on the weekend and by the time Monday rolled around the weather had cooled a bit You cannot beat the area    our son was happy just walking around and looking at the very expensive cars parked on the street  The walk to the Green Park tube station was less than    minutes Lastly  the front desk help was knowledgeable  friendly and willing to help  We accidently left our souvenirs from St  Andrews in a drawer under the TV in the lounge  I called less than    hours after we checked out and was told that the room had not yet been occupied but that there was nothing in the drawer  Three days and multiple phone calls later  the golf towel was found but the golf ball and ball markers were not with it  We were thankful for what they did find and just received our package in the mail All in all  we would return to this property but would make sure the a c worked in all rooms before we unpacked  
N =>  Perfect Home Away from Home We just returned from a wonderful   night stay at the Ascott fair y            This is a lovely full serviced apartment hotel  I travelled with my husband and two young children  ages   and    We had booked a standard   bdrm apt but they upgraded us to the superior which was bigger and had an added pull out sofa  The apartment was beautifully decorated  It felt very homey and spacious  The kitchen had everything we needed included a washer dryer which came in handy  I thought the beds were fine  unlike a previous reviewer  Our two bathrooms were also very nice  Because we booked with our citibank card  each child received a welcome teddy bear and we received a box of chocolates and a bottle of wine upon arrival  Also  there was a HUGE fruit basket waiting for us in our room  After   days  we hardly made a dent in it The location could not be beat  It s in an upscale  quiet neighborhood but just an   min walk to Green Park Tube which is a very central line  Also  just   blocks from Hyde Park     min walk to Kensington  Since we had   strollers  we walked more than we took the tube  This hotel is very conveniently located The service of this hotel was impeccable  I thought the staff was very attentive and helpful  The breakfast buffet had a nice selection  fruits  breads  yogurt  cereal  juice  coffee  meat and cheese  Loved the coffee cappucino machine  I wanted one in my home until the server told me it cost  K  The only problem was that the size of the breakfast room was just not big enough  There were only about   tables and only   waitstaff to help clear the tables and refill the buffet  Every morning we had to wait about    min just to sit down  But don t let this small detail keep you away from this lovely hotel  This was not a deal breaker for us  We would definitely return to the Ascott fair  
N =>  Too bad really   but beds are important Beautiful place  great location  good breakfasts  quiet area  fantastic bathrooms   have nothing bad to say except it has the HARDEST beds known to man  I actually hurt my elbow from leaning on it for too long  it s that hard  A slab of marble is softer  
N => Wonderful place  My husband and I stayed at the Ascott fair in il     and loved it  The location can not be beat  Close walk to   tube stations and great resturants  shopping  and pubs all in the neighborhood  We orginally were booked in a studio apt but they upgraded us to a one bedroom at no extra charge  Our apt  was big and nicely decorated  What I liked most was that we felt like we were staying in our own flat in London  compared to a hotel room  so we felt more like locals then tourists  Overall  would highly recommend the Ascott for anyone traveling to London  
N =>   not   star treatment Stayed   nights with my wife as short break  Initial impression quite good as staff pleasant   room tastefully decorated   clean  Mild disappointment as room showed some signs of wear   tear     curtain wouldn t close   also breakfast tables absurdly small  However the main issue was that on first morning we were unable to get any warm water   we phoned down to reception to be told that the boiler had broken   this was not fixed until  pm that evening which was too late for either of us as we had an early evening appointment   Admittedly this was an unforeseen occurrence BUT there was no apology from the management   the general manager was nowhere to be found  Furthermore no reduction in the bill on leaving     star prices but not   star treatment I m afraid 
N =>   The Ashburn was all that I expected and more after reading all the reviews on Trip Advisor I researched this hotel on Trip Advisor before booking the room on line myself  All transaction was done via email and it couldn t have gone more smoothly   arriving there early Sunday morning was an issue as we had to wait for our room  but they kindly checked our bags and off we went to Kensington Palace for some sightseeing and tea at L Orangerie  When we got back  our bags were in our rooms and a quick phone call to the front desk to inquire about the power   and how to keep it engaged   left us feeling like dumb Americans  but happy ones to have such a lovely room  just as expected requested  Everything about the room was as described in the website  The evening champagne was a treat and a nice prelude to our evening  but we only made it one of the three nights we spent there   The hotel s location was superb for tube access on Cromwell Road and neighboring pubs for that end of evening pint or libation  Actually  the location was a great one overall for seeing London and I would recomend it to anyone looking for a very positive experience and good pivot point for touring London The concierge was always present and always courteous  as was all the staff  Morning breakfast was diverse  delicious and of good quality  We found most of the clientele to be European as most Americans seem to gravitate to the bigger chain hotels  My emailed requests for the type and location of our room were granted  as we booked far enough in advance to do so Just can t say enough about our   days there  except when can we go again  
N =>   Very nice hotel good location We went to London just for a weekend so we were looking for a hotel not far from the Centre not to spend too much time in the Underground  At the same time we wanted to stay in an  quot English style quot  hotel  i e not in a typical modern hotel you can find anywhere in the world  We picked Ashburn based on the reviews we found in Tripadvisor and we were not disappointed at all  What we liked most was  a  nice service  b  good location  c  very nice bathroom with bathrobes available for guests  The only improvement I can think of is the carpets in the rooms and corridors which are a little bit oldish  Definitely next time I go to London I will stay in the Ashburn hotel  
N =>  Lovely quiet hotel  I would have given     for the room if we had the room we were eventually moved to at the start of our stay  Unfortunately the air con didn t work in our initial room so a portable machine with a hose was in use  This meant having the window open which is not only noisy but a bit worrying as we were in the basement  I think the number of the room is     so be warned  However we later discovered that the window was locked at a certain height  for security I assume  which meant that we couldn t open it any further even if we had wanted to  I found it very difficult to sleep the first night because of the noise from the traffic and the air con  However after politely pointing out the problem we were moved to a room on the third floor and this room was lovely  The rooms are absolutely spotless and very comfortable  The staff are very helpful and friendly The breakfast was very pleasant and the breakfast very good  We had our complimentary glass of champagne in the evening which was a nice thought  We were able to park in the Holiday Inn across the literally across  a not very busy  road  I would NOT recommend the italian restaurant across the road which was very expensive for what you get and the service was very poor  The restaurant in the Baileys Hotel  across the road  was providing a very good   couse meal for about        which was very good value with great service I would certainly stay at the Ashburn again  but not that room in the basement with the dodgy air con  
N =>   A little gem on the Cromwell Road My wife surprised me  on my birthday  with a stay in the Ashburn  after a concert at the Albert Hall  And what a pleasant stay it was too  The room was spotless  the bed comfortable and the facilities excellent  The staff went the extra distance to make our stay as comfortable as possible  For instance  they gave us our champagne an hour earlier than scheduled  as we were going out to eat  The breakfast was excellent and the service faultless  Even though our room was at the front of the hotel  on the Cromwell Road  we couldn t hear the traffic  as the double glazing was very efficient All in all a perfect stay  
N =>   Outstanding despite one issue My choice of this hotel was based solely on feedback from tripadvisor and the value  We had one issue which I will address  however compared to all of the positives I would not hesitate to stay here again  We arrived early as all USA flights do so we stored the baggage and hit the streets  When we checked in we were upgraded to a room with a king and large baywindow  this was much larger room than some in photos  We had an issue with the air conditioner  but thank goodness the heat wave that had hit London the week before was gone  as we did not air for the week  The control is a digital unit on wall and it would not come on as per instructions  We told office person about this and she indicated that their maintenance was addressing this issue with some rooms and it would be sorted out  That night upon returning to hotel  we were told that it had been fixed  however when we got to room  digital control would still not come on  We checked with staff again and they could not explain as they were led to believe the problem had been sorted out  at least this is what they were telling us  Finally the second day the concierge came to the room and indicated that our room was no longer connected to main system  in other words the instructions that are on the desk for operating the system are useless  he took these instructions and threw them away  Instead he showed us a breaker on the wall that controls what is essentially a blower mounted in the closet and when you cut this on it blows air out of the vent  but there is not temperature control  He said that room     was unique to the hotel and not part of the system  Essentially it blew out hot air and as he indicated there is not control of the temperature  I wondered how this would be tolerated if say it were in the winter  I am not sure what the straight answer is but it was a little annoying  We managed to be comfortable by leaving our windows open during the day while out and this cooled the room enough so as to keep them closed at night  Daytime temperatures were in high sixties  if hot weather were present we would have had to move rooms  they did offer a portable unit that could go in room and then required leaving windows open  this was unacceptable as street noise was very load constantly  Other than this issue  our stay was outstanding  as earlier people indicated the staff here particularly the concierges are outstanding  They know all restaurants etc  in the area well  By the way there are many  many restaurants within say a     mile of this hotel  every cuisine imaginable from all corners of the world  no other reviews make this clear Breakfast included  very good continental and yes it is the same each day  but more than adequate  Free wireless internet service  Gloucester Tube Station two blocks away and all of London is available quickly and in most cases without changes being made  
N =>   Great hotel with an even better Staff We stayed at this hotel for four nights  The hotel is in a great location  very close to the underground  Get out at Gloucester and you make a left and you are   block away  When we arrived early  we figured we would just have to drop off our bags  but to our surprise a room was ready for us  To make it even better we were upgraded to a superior room  Mind you it was on the bottom floor  but was nice none the less  Did we hear the faint sound of the underground  I guess  but it was barely noticeable and I am a light sleeper and it never woke me up nor kept me up  We also thought being on the same floor as the breakfast room we would get woke up  but again  not an issue at all  The room itself was nice  It wasn t the most fancy room we ever stayed at  But what separates this hotel from the big chains was the staff  Everyone there was beyond helpful  I can honestly say in all my years my wife and I have never been happier staying at a place and sad to leave it  When you asked a question they not only answered it but went into detail and made sure you really understood the answer  Syle who is the concierge  was beyond helpful  He booked our tours so we didn t have to wait in line  told us what stops to get off at on the underground  which was beyond easy to navigate  and gave suggestions for the area we would be in  From the front desk person to the girl serving coffee in the breakfast room everyone was beyond nice  I can say without hesitation that if when we go back to London  I will not even look for another hotel  For a hotel in Europe the room was very big  The bed was comfortable and we had a ton of room the bathroom as well  The little gifts they give you each night are just another added touch that makes this hotel great  Our room was L shaped and had a sitting area with a couch and tv  and an area with a bed and another tv  We had two big suitcases and there was easily enough room to have them out and walk around The breakfast was fine  We had cereal  fruits  cheese  toast  danishes  croissants  and even lunch meats  weird to me   If you wanted to buy food from the hotel  it was very cheap as well  Again I can not recommend this hotel enough  If you are looking for an ultra fancy  shabby sheik hotel  this won t be for you  If you are looking for a very nice hotel  with a great staff and the best bang for your buck  this is your hotel  The hotel made our trip to London extremely enjoyable and we were very glad we booked it  
N =>   definitely not on our  hot  list My wife and I stayed at this hotel on      Starting with the plus points  this is a tastefully decorated hotel and the rooms are nicely appointed with largs LCD TV s  Also  the hotel is close to the Royal Albert Hall where we took in a show However  on arrival in our room  we noticed that the air conditioning had the room at around    degrees   we attempted to remedy this as the room was stiflingly hot but the control panel would not work   we reported this to a rather condescending gentleman on reception   he said  move the controls    we had  repeatedly  We went for a walk and on arrival back at the room  the heat was now    degrees plus  We then reported this again at reception before leaving for our evening show  Guess what  When we got back to the hotel at around   pm the room was still overbearingly hot so we reported this AGAIN    an embarrassed duty manager came to the room and said that the control  or a part  was broken and he could only offer us a fan   We were told on checking out the next day that he should have offered us another room   he didn t We had a terrible night  maybe getting   hours sleep because of the heat   the next morning it was as clear as mud where you went for breakfast  On finding the SMALL room set aside for this  we were astounded that people were queing for seats and my wife was parked near a hot toaster  It was also incredibly hard to get a full English breakfast   they seemed to be wholly geared up just to continental On leaving we expressed our concerns to the lady on reception who gave us some mints  OOH LA LA   and said write to the manager  This we did and have received no reply  Is this any way to treat guests who are paying a lof of money for a stay at this hotel   I THINK NOT  
N =>  Fantastic Location for the Royal Albert Hall I decided to surprise my husband by booking a hotel room  We went to the Royal Albert hall for a concert and then walked home to this fantastic hotel  The hotel room was clean  the mattress was nice and hard  the shower was amazing  the champagne in the room was a good value  and breakfast was good  Over all we were really impressed  Two small issues  One was that the room was on the    level  meaning the basement  This might not bother some people  but we didnt love that  Also the aircon was broken  The very nice desk clerk came down to have a look at it  but he couldnt fix it either  He offered us a fan because the hotel was fully booked and another room couldnt be sourced  This cooled the room down a bit but it was still warm  We didnt want to open the window in the room because we were below street level and we didnt want people looking in  let alone coming in  Even with these issues we would still stay in this hotel again  we would just request a room on an upper level  
N =>   Elegent comfort in convenient location We stayed at the Ashburn for   nights in late ch  It was our delayed honeymoon  delayed by   years  it s about time    We were very happy with our stay overall  Our room was not ready when we arrived at      am  but we were much earlier than anticipated  Tube from Victoria to Gloucester  then walking to the Ashburn  took only a few minutes  The concierge stored our luggage while we went out for a day of sightseeing  We returned around  pm and checked in seamlessly  We were upgraded from a King Standard to a King Deluxe  Our room was just lovely  Nice neutral colors  free easy internet access on both televisions  very nice toiletries  Gilchrist  amp  Soames   heated marble floor in the bathroom  The bed was very comfortable with a nice duvet and soft pillows  We were in room      on the corner with huge windows looking out onto Cromwell Road  The sitting area with loveseat and desk was really nice  Our friend who lives in London visited us in the hotel and was astounded at the size of the room  She said it was very unusual to have such a large room in a London Hotel  Plenty of nearby restaurants to choose from  we ate at the Italian restaurant across the street  which was okay but pricey  and Black and Blue  which was very nice  Tesco Express  Waitrose  and Boots were very nearby  We purchased   pound phone card from across the street so we could call home and check on our kids each night  The breakfast was very nice  with French Press coffee to start with  or a pot of tea  Cold cuts  several varieties of cheese  fresh fruit  cereal  bread  milk  yogurt  toast  and juice were available as part of the complimentary breakfast  with hot items available for very reasonable prices  The last morning we ordered one breakfast platter  and it was added to our hotel bill  We did not have problems finding seats like some previous reviewers have posted We walked from Harrods to the hotel twice  which was about a       minute walk  and the V amp A museum  and the Natural History museum were very convenient  though we didn t have time to go to those  There were just a couple of items that were unpleasant  the telephones in our room were terrible  very static y  The hallways had the smell of cigarette smoke  though it did not drift into our room  We had a roach in our bathroom for   days  Stepping out of the tub required much maneuvering  as the tub is elevated  and without my glasses I nearly fell  so be careful  One morning  when we needed help from the concierge and he wasn t available  the gentleman that was called to help us was rather rude to the girl at the desk when she asked him to help us  He said he was very busy at the moment  that she would have to wait  but she pointed out to him that we were waiting and he reluctantly came out to help us  It made us feel uncomfortable Those few things though were so insignificant that we will definitely book here again on our next trip  My husband was thoroughly impressed  and as a former travel agent  I am thrilled with the hotel  The last place I stayed in London was  to say it as kindly as possible  like staying in a dirty shack next to train tracks for not too much less than we paid for this place  This place was nothing like that one  it was just perfect  
N =>   Lovely gem  My husband stayed at the Ashburn for a work trip in ober      so when we returned to the UK on a leisure trip togetherwe opted to stay there again  On both occasions  it was a brilliant choice  The rooms were very tastefully furnished  extremely comfortable bed and the fresh potted orchids a lovely touch  Bath big enough to splash around in  Staff very accommodating and helpful  Breakfast buffet excellent in a very pleasant street level room  and the food sent up for several room service dinners was superb  Lovely little bar  and to be offered a free glass of champagne each evening was an elegant touch  We have recommended this hotel to friends  and they also enjoyed a very positive experience  and have recommended it to other friends who are coming to London later this year  A lovely gem of a hotel  you feel like a guest and not a number  
N =>   Good hotel conveniently placed for us  We stayed   nights at the end of ruary  The hotel was easy to find  after turning left out of the tube it was about   minutes walk  We were greeted well and checking in was fast and efficient but there was a subsequent problem  see later in review  Our room was on the second floor  we d booked a King room and it was of a decent size with plenty of storage space  The bed was comfortable and we slept well both nights  We didn t hear any noise at all from adjacent rooms  only heard the tube very faintly and the traffic noise from the A  was bearable  The room did show a bit of wear and tear but it had everything we could want and the bathroom was clean and had plenty of toiletries  The only ventilation we had was by opening the windows and if we did then the outside noise was loud  The air conditioning wasn t on working but we managed as it was ruary  not sure if we would if it had been summer Breakfast was ok  the room is small and didn t have enough tables for all guests so if you came down in the rush then you had to wait  not so good  There were not enough implements to help yourself to the food  for instance  there were no spoons tongs to dish up the dried fruits  We saw one guest pick them up with his fingers  lick his fingers and then help himself to some more  yuk  Beware  The champagne in the evening was a very nice touch  it s usually served between   and   but as we had to be at the theatre by   they served us at    nice touch When we checked out we found that our credit card had been charged at check in when they had clearly stated that they only needed an impression so we could charge to our room  We then had to wait while this was cleared up and they gave us a refund  Luckily it was noticed otherwise we d have paid twice and had the hassle of trying to get our money back  So again beware and double check everything Overall we thought that the hotel was ok for what we wanted  clean and reasonably priced  We would stay there again even with the little niggles we had  BTW If you want a nice place to eat in the evening then try Black and Blue in Gloucester Road  it s fab  great food and reasonably priced  
N =>   Excellent   we WILL be back  We booked the Ashburn about   weeks in advance on Expedia  as Expedia showed availability even though the hotel showed as entirely booked on their own website  We got what we felt was a reasonable price  around      night avg   The hotel is less than   mins walk from the tube station  which was a cheap and convenient way to get to the hotel from Heathrow with our Oyster cards   Upon arriving at the hotel and checking in  we found our room to be reeeally small   even by European standards  note  we had room      and I believe the  quot    quot  room on each floor is the smallest   I called and spoke to the front desk and requested a different room  and she agreed to move us the next day when there was availability  The next day we were indeed moved to a larger room which had ample space and a desk  it was MUCH better  The rooms are all lovely and comfortable  I saw what other reviewers have noted  about tattered rug edges and exposed tv cables  but honestly  they didn t bother us a bit  The room felt immaculate and was well appointed  We didn t have any complaints  We were there for   nights over New Years  and had a fabulous time with the Ashburn as a homebase for our explorations  The staff was fantastic   particularly Syle  the concierge  He was always eager to help with recommendations  honest opinions  and tour bookings information  We loved him The surrounding neighborhood is fun to explore  To the west there s a Sainsbury s so that you can stock up on essentials that you can keep in the fridge in your room  To the west were loads of restaurants   The Green Door steak house was good  as was  surprisingly   quot The Patisserie quot     which offered a bunch of different types of entrees  and both things we tried  the curry and the chicken noodle soup and BLT sandwich  were nice   quot Ask quot  near the tube station was also great for an inexpensive but nice meal  We also explored a bit into Fulham     and found an upscale Chinese restaurant called Mao Tai which was fabulous  though pricey    Syle also has plenty of recommendations for local spots that we sadly never got to Three other things to mention  the in room internet available through the TV for free was fantastic for quickly keeping in touch with folks back home and looking up London info  And the free champagne in the evenings was a nice way to unwind at the end of the day  before heading out to dinner  Last but not least  the breakfast in the mornings was excellent  The breakfast room did get a little crowded at peak time  around      to       but the offerings were delicious and you can order hot food for really reasonable prices  The morning staff was also always really nice  OVERALL   this is a fantastic hotel find and we will absolutely be back to the Ashburn on our next visit  
N =>   Great little find As regular visitors to London  we tend to opt for the usual  brand name  hotels  However  when my mum and I decided to plan a mid week shopping trip  I thought it would be a change to try to find a  boutique  hotel as a special treat I came across the Asburn Hotel by chance and read the good reviews on Trip Advisor  so I booked it  We were very plesantly surprised to discover a little gem of a hotel in a great location The staff were lovely  one even recommended an excellant restaurant near by  The rooms were luxurious and comfortable We were delighted when we discovered that a continental breakfast was included  A cooked breakfast is available at an additional cost  but it is very very reasonable Overall  I have kept the details  passed on the information to others  and would plan to book in again on my next trip to London  
N =>   Excellent stay I recently stayed at the Ashburn with my dad and son  The service was outstanding  The concierge was fantastic  he was able to book us tours and tickets that had been hard to get before our trip  knew what was going on around the city  they received our various faxes from our travel agent and got them to us asap  very friendly staff  very good breakfasts  The location was great  just a block from the underground station  there is a grocer nearby and restaurants nearby  The rooms were spotless  I can t wait to go back to London and will definitely make this the hotel I will stay at  
N => The Curate s Egg My wife and I stayed at the Ashburn for two nights in e and found it to be good  but not without it s problems  The room we stayed in was a deluxe for which we paid      per night including continental breakfast  The room was clean and tidy but there were areas of wear and tear to the carpet and furniture  According to their web site the hotel was refurbished only last year  which at fist glance would seem to be true  but unless they keep on top of things standards will start to slip Others have mentioned the small size of the breakfast room  which is true if everyone turns up at once but not a real problem while we were there  The continental breakfast was ok but I have had a better choice while staying at a Holiday Inn The location of the Ashburn is very good for the tube and close to all the museums and the Royal Albert Hall  The staff were very pleasant and helpful One thing you should be aware of is that there was no welcome drink offered when we arrived and no turn down service and gift  both of which were a reason we booked the Ashburn in the first place  When checking out we brought this up with manager and he kindly took     of our billAll in all we did enjoy our stay at the Ashburn  but I m sure there must be better hotels in London for the money we paid  
N =>  Fab hotel  Stayed at this hotel as it was a reasonable location for the Chelsea Flower Show  The hotel was pretty much excellent  only five minutes walk from the Gloucester Road tube and within half an hours walk of the Natural History Museum and V amp A  Kensington Palace and Knightsbridge are also within walking distance  if you don t mind a bit of a walk There s a choice of restaurants in the area  we went to a steakhouse  Black  amp  Blue  near the tube station which was great On to the hotel itself  very good service  efficient check in and a lovely room  nicely decorated and very clean  Lovely toiletries too and a little turn down gift every night  We had complimentary continental breakfast which was good and you could order hot food too  for an extra charge   The breakfast room was tiny but both days we stayed we managed to find a table straight away  We did however see a few people waiting but not for long We would definitely stay here again  
N =>   Lovely find good value Found the Ashburn through  quot TripAdvisor quot  reviews  This is a lovely little gem  Close to the Gloucester Road metro stop  just a   block walk   Comfortable bed with good linens  spotless bathroom  amp  very friendly staff  We arrived early  amp  were happy to find our room not only ready  but were allowed early check in without a fuss  
N =>  AC Still not working Nice amenties such as bathrobes  wireless internet in rooms Disappointed in that the AC was still not working  when you check in they tell you that breakfast is included  They do not tell you that it is only continental and then you have to pay for anthing hot  i e  eggs  bacon  I found that to be a little deceiving Also they were not willing to lower the price for the next day of stay and only wanted to offer a free beer  Lack of guest appreciation Rooms on the small side Breakfast area not very inviting and waitress could not understand a single word of English  
N =>   Stolen Item  On the positive side  the price was reasonable and the staff was pleasant  On the negative side there was no air conditioning for   of   nights  making the room unpleasantly hot  Worse  I accidentally left a jacket in the room at check out  and when I returned three hours later to retrieve it the staff claimed no knowledge of it  Overall  I would not recommend this hotel  Instead I would consider the Radisson  riott  Holiday Inn or Millenium hotels  all of which lie within a few blocks  
N =>   Perfect Place in London Ashburn was perfect  Great location  comfortable  clean  elegant accomodations  The staff couldn t have been more pleasant eager to offer assistance  Thanks to Jerry and Steve

N =>   Hotel piacevole in ottima posizione  
N =>   Bueno pero no tanto  
N =>   Tolles Hotel in London  
N =>   Needs Upgrading One positive is the good location   very easy to get to Paddington Station  My room was on the  rd floor  no elevator and no assistance with luggage  Very narrow stairway  the carpet in the bedroom needed to be cleaned  the wallpaper was peeling off the wall and there was black mould in the shower  I will not stay here again  
N =>  Great location friendly staff but needs refurbishing I stayed   nights her during my first trip to London  With Paddington station sitting a short block away  the Ashley s location is nearly unbeatable  Any of central London s attractions are easily reachable  The staff were helpful  including a dynamite restaurant recommendation   but when I asked for some soap on my last night  they had offer me the used bar from their staff bathroom  The hallway contained some large tears in the wallpaper  and the carpets were in several places threadbare  Breakfast was filling but not really tasty  The tiny room was clean  and the bed was comfortable  Bath facilities were adequate for those sharing baths  but were not available on every floor  For some reason they choose to charge    hour for wifi access  which was mostly reliable  but not always  
N =>  Good budget hotel but a touch grotty Good location  quiet rooms  decent breakfast but getting rather tatty 
N =>   Clean but cramped not good for a long stay We stayed on the ground floor  with a bright floodlight and a street lamp shining into our room at night  where we had to keep the curtains somewhat open in order to get air through the small opening in the window   We later asked for  and got  a decent table fan   The price was lower than at other places  but the room was pretty cramped  with three parallel single beds and barely any space to walk  Blankets and bedspreads were iffy  though sheets were clean  There were also one desk chair at a desk sink  and a wardrobe  The staff varied in friendliness  and we were told different things about the computer in the basement  which was never available to us  even for a fee  Breakfast was in an airless basement room  decent enough  but not special  The bathroom was clean and adequate  though very small  Dailty replenishment of soap and towels was good  as was the location near Paddington tube station  In addition  an all night small grocery was nearby  and the green  and quiet  Norfolk Square was lovely  and the park was open for walking and sitting  
N =>   TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE Before booking a room on line I went through the reviews of this hotel and thought that it would be an averagely good place to stay  I do not know what kind of rooms hotels the people who ve written the positive reviews are used to staying at  but in my experience this has been the worst hotel I have ever stayed at  Except if one believes that  quot budget quot  means having to put up with filth  respiratory problems  and rudeness  This is what I had to go through in the hope that future clients are well warned  We checked in at     pm Saturday  st ust but unfortunately did not check the room and left for a walk around the city  When we went back to the hotel in the evening we were given a room at the basement of the hotel  room     with a window overlooking a dirty yard full of rubbish  Furthermore  the room had not been cleaned from previous occupants  the bed was unmade and there were dirty towels on the floor    Making a complaint and demanding that we are given another room we were faced with a rather rude reception manager who finally agreed to give us a room on the third floor  When we entered this room       we were literally taken aback by a smell combining dampness  dust  and something resembling urine    Being exhausted by the trip and the really long day  we decided not to complain again but get some sleep and try to put up with it  Woke up in the middle of the night because somehow  for some reason  the smell had got even worse and despite the open window  we were unable to breathe properly  I need to say that the wallpaper in this room was torn and dampness could be seen on the walls  the carpet was not only threadbare but also had not been swept for ages and there was filth visible on it and on the furniture  Last but not least  the pillow cases in the bed had not been changed and there were makeup marks on them  Needless to say  in the morning  we asked for yet another change of the room and a different reception manager  less rude and more professional  agreed to give us another room which was on the first floor  and at last stayed there for the rest of our five day holiday  It was again small  with a tiny bathroom and not terribly clean  but tolerable and without a smell      All in all this has been the worst stay I have had in years of travelling  
N =>  Very Unpleasant Stay       Im surprised at the number of average reviews this place has received  I m not sure what kind of accommodation these users below are used to but this hotel certainly does not merit any appraisals  On first glance the hotel does seem neat and fits in with the London  quot low budget quot  travel accommodation  Discouraging was the lack of elevators especially if your room is on the upper floor  but not quintessential unless the guest is elderly  Things started to go downhill when we entered the room as my friend started dry reaching from the moldy odor the room emanated  We opened the windows  rested our heads on the pillows and slept immediately due to lack of sleep  I avoided the blanket altogether as I was sure would contain bugs  and stayed beneath the white sheets  In the morning we noticed the extent of the mould  Mould is a serious heath hazard and this room displayed mould everywhere  walls  ceiling  toilet    As we used the bathroom in the morning for the first time we were absolutely disgusted and had to check out immediately  Hair  A large tuff of blond hair was stuck on one of the shower walls  some in the drain  My friend noticed this while he was in the shower and was on the verge of sickness  We cut our stay by one night  We informed staff about this  They offered us another room but this was not an option  We checked out and kindly requested our second night to be refunded  They claimed that if there was to be a refund it would occur through the website agent we booked through  I have travelled extensively and been to many hotels and I know this is not the case and in fact the website hotline made it clear any refund would have to be issued by the hotel itself  Misleading hotel staff  I would recommend to avoid unless the dozen hotels on the same square are fully booked  
N =>  adequate and convenient on the positive side   it was close to Paddington and a very nice Garfunkels and Litle Venice  The receptionist was very sweet and the staff friendly  The price was cheap and the bed comfortable however  our room       smelt damp and it looked like it should have been a single room not a twin   there was no space between the twin beds  The bathroom was very small but clean ish   I was disappointed by the English breakfast which consisted of a couple rashers of nice bacon but  the sausage was overcooked and the egg was like rubber   no beans or tomato or mushrooms  We actually decided to have our breakfast in Garfunkels which was yummy    The room was also very hot and it was difficult to get to sleep   I did get a fan on request though so not all complaints  To sum up   for what we paid it was more than adequate but I m not sure I would go there again  
N =>   It s fine but don t expect anything fancy This place is conveniently located just a couple of mins walk from Paddington station  It is clean  basic  and good value  I was expecting something basic  comfortable  and functional and that s what I got   nothing more  nothing less  The breakfast is quite good  especially seeing as though it s included in the tariff  and the waitstaff were pleasant  though not very efficient  My experience was tainted by the poor reception service  The man on reception when I was there was completely indifferent  abrupt  and spent all his time on personal phone calls  Everytime I approached the desk  even just to walk past  he was on a personal phone call  It just doesn t do anything for the image of the hotel  especially when it seemed that many of the residents were there on business  as I was  Hauling luggage up the narrow and steep staircases is not fun  and the staff will not offer any help  but fellow patrons will  as they have experienced the hassle for themselves This hotel offered wireless internet access at a fairly cheap price  but my room was so high up I couldn t connect  So I had to set up down in the lounge  which was ok but less than ideal  as I was working The toilet shower was no bigger than a closet  but it was clean and functional  I wouldn t want to have to use it for many days in a row This place is fine if you re a fairly independent  unfussy traveller who just needs somewhere clean to sleep at night  
N =>  Chaos Stayed in the hotel for a few weeks Monday To Friday this y First week in the hotel was average  Room was clean but very hot  I felt comfortable enough staying in hotel so I booked for the next two monday to fridays Now the trouble started  when I arrived on the Monday the room given was a double rather than a twin as specified on confirmation e mail I agreed to stay in double if moved the following day  I was not the only person at reception trying to get sense out of management  A man next to me had gone to work and on his return his room had been let out  The receptionist tried to ring the manager who told him to wait to see in there was a no show  Th ereception told us staff had been going into the bookings and changing his bookings Finally move to very shabby twin room with pull down bunk beds The following Monday I was given a twin which was two singles pushed together with one headboard  The room was fine until I discovered a bedbug in my bed when I got up on Wednesday morning  Slept on top of bedsheets next night camcelled my future booking with The Ashley and told workmates not to stay there ever  
N =>   Simple and clean hotel Last weekend I spent two nights in a single room  I tried to make the booking via hotel s homepage   email but haven t received any reply within a few days therefore I called them directly  consider that they seem not to read emails  After arrival I noticed they have a PC but manage occupancy of rooms within a big paper notebook  Generally I found strange telling them the complete security data of my credit card via phone Location is excellent  very quite and safe also during the night  The single room I stayed in was really small  relatively simple  but nice and most important clean  For sure you haven t seen a smaller bathroom before     but it s clean and there was enough warm water  The window cannot be opened and has low noise insulation  fortunately outside there is normally no bustle  The room can probably get warm during summer since there is no AC  Double bed rooms seem to have reasonable size The staff  at least during my stay  was Asiatic and in the breakfast area not very professional  a lady forgot to bring me promised additional toast  ok  can happen   English breakfast is averagely  beans and tomato are not served by default  Close to window I managed to connect wirelessly to a free internet access point In summary  this is a clean  recommendable place with gut value for money  for London circumstances   
N =>   Things to know befor you go  This hotel was clean and convenient it was good value for money  However there were a few things i wish I had know befor I went  My sister and I had a double room  but the two single bends had been put side by side  this made it difficult for me to get into and it didn t feel like we had any space to our self  Breakfast is only served unitl nine  not great if you want a lie in  There are a range of cereals on offer  which is good but the english breakfast consisted of   sausage    rashes of bacon and a fried egg  This was disappointing  even if there was the option of beans or tomato s it would have been a lot more genrouse  The bathroom in the room was smaller than some caravan bathrooms I ve been in  Realisticly people don t spend the majority of their time in the bathroom  At     quot  and a size    I didn t have any problems with the space but if you need to you can shave your legs in the shower while sitting on the toilet  you would also easily reach the sink to brush your teath if you really want to multi task  but don t expect to be able to streach your arms out to their full length  I couldn t  On the whole the staff were friendly but not always helpful if we needed transport advice  more towels  the towels are small and unabsorbent   The location for this hotel was fantastic  and the area felt safe  If your not going to spend alot of time in your hotel then this would be a great option for you  I wouldn t go out of my way to stay here again  but I would avoid it either  
N =>   Godd value and location We are a family of      teen girls  we needed a place to stay close to Paddington to get an early train to Heathrow the next morning  Picked this hotel based on these reviews at TA  We were not dissapointed  By London standards a good value      GBP for the night  just around the corner from the tube and train station  A decent selection of restaurants right there  A short walk to Hyde park  near ble Arch  we even walked to SOHO  maybe    min walk  took the tube back  ent sized room  friendly staff  full English breakfast included  no lifts though  not a problem for us because we travel light  I would stay there again for sure  
N =>  Great little hotel The Ashley was a perfect location and a good price for London  We stayed for   nights on the top floor which was a bit of a hike  no elevator  but we got a discount on the room  The room was small but clean  The location was great  right next to Paddington station and close to many pubs and cafes  
N =>   A welcome retreat After our initial first night in London at another noisy hotel in the same street  we decided to look for other accommodation  We saw the Ashley and was very pleased to be accommodated for   nights  All the staff were very pleasant and helpful  Although the room was small  it was clean and adequate for us  As we come from Australia the bathroom was exceptionally small but very clean also  Breakfast was good with choice of fruit juices  cereals  bacon  egg sausage  toast  tea and coffee  The price to stay at this hotel was very reasonable and we would stay again if we return to London it was so close to Paddington Station and Hyde Park which is an additional plus  No lift unfortunately and the only other comment I can think of is that maybe the rooms would be better with ceiling fans to circulate the air  There is heating  but the rooms can be quite warm and stuffy even with the windows open  Other than that a good little hotel at a very reasonable price  
N =>  Left Before Staying Reserved this hotel for one night in        Checked in  saw room  immediately had an allergy attack due to dust mildew mold  although room looked clean   Saw another room that was dark  dreary  depressing  and overlooked an air shaft  Immediately checked out and went to stay at another hotel  
N =>   Staff were friendly but suites left a lot to be desired Although the staff were very friendly and the suite was decorated and cleaned to a very high standard there were a number of problems The first being that during my stay the fire alarm went off persistently  It was incredibly loud and went off throughout the day and particurlarly early in the morning     am   When I contacted reception staff there informed me that it was an alarm but could not provide me with any information as to why it was going off or when it would be fixed The second problem I encountered was that my suite was adjacent to a door used frequently by staff  The walls in the suite are thin so everytime someone walked through the door it slammed shut and the whole suite shook  I paid for a suite to sleep in but didn t manage to get much sleep between the piercing alarm and the slamming of doors Lastly I paid for a continental breakfast every morning of my stay but felt that the breakfast provided was poor in choice  By that I mean that if you don t like cornflakes or toast arrange to have your breakfast some place else  
N =>   okay for short stay My husband and I stayed here for four nights in ust  I agree with all that the previous respondent said but found that it didn t detract from the stay  I did have trouble figuring out the washer dryer with no instructions  nothing dried  but overall we found it quite good  Very small rooms but very clean and great location and its good having the extra living space if one wants to go to bed earlier than the other  We didn t find it too noisy  Breakfast was very basic but you could get a full English breakfast for an extra cost  My husband was a bit surprised about the charge for the remote but no problems getting it back  My only complaint came on our last day  We had said to the trainee receptionist the day before that we would need a taxi to Kings Cross station and should we order ahead of time or flag one down in the street  She quoted us       to       if she ordered one for us so we decided to do so  The car was the hotel s own as the driver was in the hotels uniform and I had seen him around there  We were charged   pound which we considered over the top  Consequently no tip for him  
N =>  Room great but staff poor I booked this hotel for our stay in London  There were   couples so the place was nice in that it had a kitchen  The place was okay but the staff needs some work  They didn t tell us that we needed to put the key in a holder by the door in order to get lights  We did figure it out but    Also  I had called the hotel and specifically asked them what I needed to bring for the kitchen  I was told everything was provided  When we got there we found out that dish soap  dishwasher soap and tea towels and cloths were not provided  They told me I could go and buy some at the store and leave the rest   I don t think so  Also they said to make sure you didn t leave anything in the room  but when asked about leaving some things in their safe we were told that they didn t have room  Also  the breakfast left a lot to be desired especially if you can t eat wheat as that was all they provided  Probably would not stay there again although we ended up liking the location  
N =>   Terrible service   The front desk at Aspen Suites have the worst possible attitudes that I have ever encountered  The male trainee that attended to me at check in was cold and rude  My room wasn t ready on arrival  though I was told to check in at  pm  I had a one bedroom apartment which was pretty small but neat and clean  I was actually considering staying here again but such terrible service made me change my mind  The front desk s attitude makes it seem like they don t really care whether you stay with them or not Parking at this hotel is not free  It s a ridiculous     a day even for hotel guests  And you have to leave your car keys with them  When my friend asked for his car keys the next day  the girl at the front desk was rude and asked him loads of questions before handing him his keys  No  Hello  or  Good Morning   Just a sour face for you After checking out  I realised that I d left something in the room so we went back to get it  The same female trainee said that because we d already checked out  we had to wait in the lobby while she called the housekeeper  After a    minute wait  there was still no news so I asked if we could go up and look for it ourselves  It took her   mins to get back to us and another   mins for the housekeeper to take us to our room We found what we were looking for immediately  What could have taken us less than   minutes  took more than half an hour and as a result  we were very late for an appointment we had that afternoon  None of the hotel staff were the least bit apologetic  TERRIBLE  
N =>   Great value and convienant My husband and I stayed here and found the apartment to be very comfortable  I was in London on business  interviewing candidates for positions in my company and needed a place with a seperate sitting room  This worked out perfectly  We asked for a room with a balcony  which we got  and were delighted  The rooms are small and closet space is tight  but it was very convienant  one block from Paddington station  Hard to find  there is no signage for Aspen Suites  but rather Abbey Court  The breakfast included was just OK and the staff not overly friendly  but helpful when asked  We were happy to find a washer dryer  but not sure how to use it properly  There were not instructions and since they run on different power I thought I was going to burn my clothes  Bathroom is tiny  but everything functional and we couldn t beat if for the price  
N =>   Lots of Hot Water I got a single room for     per night   but even at that bargain price it was not worth the money  Luckily the room had a balcony  otherwise it was more like a hermit s cell The kitchen was no real use  For microwaving meals and making tea it was just OK The fridge needed defrosting badly  and woke me up a couple of times in the early hours as it hammered away to keep cold  I was also awoken by the slamming of the main front door several times  despite notices requesting people to close it quietly The bathroom was extremely compact  the hand basin far too small  and the only redeeming point was lots and lots of hot water  
N =>   OK but not worth the money Stayed in the Astons for a week in il  We chose it because of the location and the price  Also  since we were staying a longer time it felt like a good idea to have our own kitchen so that we would not need to eat out every night We like the South Kensington Earls Court Area so the location was good  Quiet residential area    minutes to the tube station  several bus lines to different parts of the city  easy acces to Heathrow by tube Apartment was really basic  Room was small even by London standard  Not the ideal choice when staying for one week  really cramped for two adults when our luggage and shopping filled every available space on the floor and one small table  Bathroom was really tiny  similar as in the cheaper cruise ships  Kitchenette useful for making a sandwich but not much else since there was so little room either to cook or have your dinner  Clumby bed and pillow  sheets were not changed during our seven nights stay which was really disappointing Considering the standard of the room and that there was no breakfast  we did not get the room for good price  In the same area there were rooms available in four star hotels for the same price  
N =>   Room was robbed on the first night of our stay I can honestly say I would not recommend this hotel to anyone  Friend  family  or even foe should steer clear  The first night in London we returned to our apartment to find that the door had been opened  not a forced entry  and items were missing from our room  Astons refunded us for one day and offered to move us to a different room in the building  The circumstances lead me to believe that the person who entered our room had key access  which narrows down any list of suspects  The room itself was in serious need of repair  The bathroom ceiling was heavily water damaged and all the faucets leaked  We also had a problems getting the stove top in the kitchenette to turn off  The next time we visit London we will not even entertain the thought of staying at Astons Apartments  A horrible experience  
N =>   Just right for us My wife and I came down to London for a two day course in the city  We were looking for overnight accommodation with breakfast near the city centre  Although SW  is not a central locality Astons suited us very well indeed  being easy to access on the tube  and not too far to walk from the station  although this was not the original intention we actually preferred provided our own breakfast  There is a Waitrose supermarket right next to the station where one can buy the basics for breakfast  Rosary Gardens is very quiet so we did not mind not having a bedroom at the back  These are very small but v  well fitted out and spotless  We have never seen a kitchen fitted in a cupboard but the novelty interested us   everything needed for a preparing a light meal was provided so we decided not to go out for dinner  I commented to a colleague from the USA that the  kitchenette  and bathroom were not big enough to  swing a cat in   much to his puzzlement  If you wish to have a good night s sleep in a decent clean and quiet environment  we recommend Astons above any low cost centrally located hotel providing breakfast  We paid BPS    for the double  and we would definitely stay there again on short trips to central London 
N =>  Evil management Unsafe Claustrophobic Hotels in central London can be a SHOCK This place was booked online from India  Upon arrival I found that the single rooms are quite claustrophobic    to the point of being unsafe  This is a typical Victorian era building converted into a hotel  In an area less than    x    sq  feet  They have managed to install a bed  a kitchenette  amp  a readymade installable bathroom  Then room had a big window that wasnt airtight    so cold air kept coming in all through the night  There was no air conditiner in the room either  The bathroom is like a candle case    if you have to bath you couldnt come out clean without having to scrub your body against the walls and the curtains  I really wonder if this place is upto fire safety standards and hotel standards of London  Or does the London government allow anything to spring up anywhere without reason or bounds On complaining  I was moved from a depressing basement room to a room on the first floor  This room was lobby shaped with a higher ceiling and the typical french style glass panelled door that opened into a common balcony shared with two other lobby like rooms  Now  this isnt safe either  Also  to be safe from potentially unsafe neighbours  you have to keep the door closed  Again no air conditioner to condition the air I found the management to be shrewd and uncooperative  Their attitude seemed to convey the sentiment     quot Hard luck    we fooled you online  quot I had to curtail my stay in this place and move to a better place  for which I had to give a tall notice of   days  which means I was stuck  Of course I was given the option to move to a larger claustrophobic room at about double the rate  On the day I was leaving  at about      am  I completed the checkout procedure  There was only one person in the office and no concierge facility  While checking me in the same boy at the desk quickly moved my luggage to the room  But when I was leaving he didnt have time for me  There are no lifts in the building  He curtly asked me to request the laundry people to bring my luggage down  Hapless  I did and they politely refused  I went back to the office  and this time he asked me to ask the cab driver to bring the luggage down  The cabbie obliged In having the cabbie bring my luggage down  the hotel official was not present  and the key was left behind in my hand  By the time I checked into the new hotel I was quite late for work  As Astons was farther from the tube station  but only two blocks away from the new hotel  I took a liberty  I left the key with the new hotel and called Astons up on reaching my office with a request to pick up the key  purely as a courtesy on my own behalf  They threatened me    quot Deposit the key personally by   pm or they would charge my credit card with    pounds quot    They had taken a deposit CC authorization from me  quot in case I damaged the TV quot   I had taken it back while checking out  still the threatened   With no choice I returned them the key personally  I asked him how they would have charged my card  He said    quot I couldnt  But this way I got you to bring the key back  Thank you very much quot   So that was my experience  I may have been naive  but the basic point is that the minds of the manager and the staff they have employed are full of malice and extremely uncourteous  And I think the hotel is unsafe  The neighbouring hotel costed only a few pounds higher and had space challenges  but they were very courteous and well managed  I am considering forwarding this to the local municipal authority  even after such a long time has elapsed  One may think why I am doing it now  but the Astons experience is so prominent in my mind  They deserve this  This hotel is cheapskate inside  So be it  But the customer should not be fooled into a cheapskate residence  I even think that I wouldnt have thought so much about this place had I been just passing through London and staying only for a day  but I was there to stay for long  and Astons sold the room to us knowing fully well that they are not equipped to provide for basic services  
N =>  Dirty bathroom basement room  Astons has a decent location near the Gloucester Road tube  and makes an effort to make the decor of their rooms cheerful  Our room had a tiny  recently renovated bathroom  This is where the positive points  however  ended for us  We were assigned a room below ground level  basically in the basement  with a view of a dirty alley  The ground level on the streets is higher than the back of the buildings  so this could be called a  quot garden quot  apartment  but it s depressing and not where I wanted to stay on my vacation  The bathroom sink drain also had hair from an previous resident  I would never stay here again  even if offered a room on a higher floor  They should have told us before we paid that we would be in the basement  
N =>   Very disappointing  Stayed in an  quot Executive quot  double room at the Astons Apartments recently  We arrived full of expectation but were soon to realise that it was not what we hoped for  The check in area was a messy room at the back of the ground floor   no great welcome  The door to our  quot apartment quot  was chipped and had been patched up in a number of places but not repainted   not a good start  Really the only compliments I can think of were the location and that the room was very quiet  looking out onto a pleasant garden The room was tiny   there was hardly room to walk around the end of the bed and defintely not what I would call an apartment  The kitchenette facilities were basic and set up in what was really the only cupboard  There was no plug for the sink and although I asked each morning we never saw one  When we arrived there was a THICK layer of grease in the sink and also on the back ot the dinner plates   obviously the last guests roast dinner  There was virtually no space for clothes or suitcases  There was a tiny cupboard to hang clothes but very awkward to access  We had to leave our suitcase under the table We booked a double room but had   single beds pushed together  The mattresses were very lumpy and the springs could be felt every time you moved  The sheets looked like they had been recycled from the local hospital  in fact one pillow case had a hospital logo on it  The pillows were old and stained and only had one slip over them  Theblankets were synthetic and very worn looking  The carpet was rippledand literally worn through in a number of places The bathroom was miniscule and when the window was opened looked ontoa window sill with paint peeling off in big chunks  There was hardly any grout left between the floor tiles  so to clean the bathroom was impossible  There was also general grottiness in the corners of the bathroom The whole place looked and felt like a hostel except it was nearly      a night We would NEVER stay at the Aston Apartments again  
N => Great area  Not problem solvers Have stayed there in      and again in    Excellent location   well to do area close and safe enough to go for a jog in Hyde park   right in the middle of everything London Very reasonable price for area  Tiny rooms but clean  But no shampoo or conditioner in bathroom   and only   hand towel  no hand towel or face cloth  When problems arose  staff was pleasant but problems not solved  Had confirmed ahead of time there would be wireless in room   Got there and it wasn t working   had to go to room in separate building in day until finally got wireless in room  Room was quiet until house beside had lovely blaring party till      AM   could not obtain help from hotel  
N => Astons Apartments London   not up to expectations We booked a standard double and paid      per night for   night stay  The room was adequate  though small by any standard  Maid service was very good  Cleanliness good  However  having a fitted carpet in a room where you  are supposed to be able to  cook is NOT a sensible choice Cupboard space tiny  and not easily accessible  only one narrow door for a cupboard twice the width   The alarm clock did not work and mentioning this to staff did not get a follow up   I did not expect more of the kitchenette  which did contain all the basics  even a microwave  although I cannot imagine actually preparing even a basic meal  other than reheating something I would not book there again  the main reason being the less than basic bathroom  more of a    m     m cubicle  containing shower  toilet and wash basin  It was impossible to ventilate properly  Only solution   leave the door open     In a caravan this would be acceptable but these are flats   I felt cheated for the price   Review by mother and daugher   frequent London visitors   
N =>  Not worth the trouble and the money you pay    I stayed here during one of my business trips Firstly  the quoted price  and the price charged were different Secondly  The accomopation   it was said that the room I stayed in was a Studio Suite  was less than a standard room you would get in an average   star hotel  The room was old and tired  it desparately needed refubishment  There are no ACs so your garauteed to have sleepless nights in the summer time when the weather is hot  The rooms andthe kitchentte was not very clean   I found someone else s body hair in my sheets     If your going to stay around this area you can find hotels of much higher standards for the same price  
N =>  Great location Astons is easy access from Heathrow by train and easy   mins walk  dragging the cases  from Gloucester Road station  The reception did not open until     am which wasn t a problem for us but maybe a watchpoint for someone else We had booked through British Airways and requested a non smoking room  The terrace where our room was to be reeked of smoke  The standard room was small  dark and depressing  The bathroom and kitchenette little built ins to the room  We had expected small but this was horrible We asked to see a better room and ended up paying an extra    pounds per night for a deluxe room  Well worth it  The room was at rear of the house   rd floor  overlooking gardens  private  very quiet and an adequate size  The bathroom was separate and a good size  The built in kitchenette had kettle  toaster    plate burner  fridge  good sink but no microwave  Although Astons told us they do not provide non smoking rooms  after the initial experience I didn t smell any smoke  I understand the twin standard rooms are larger than the standard doubles and open to small balconies at front of the terraces  Worth checking out From there on the stay was great  Fabulous location  Near to the station and a lovely area to stroll around in the evening  The rooms were well serviced but may be warm in high summer  fans provided   My husband is still raving about what a good supermarket deli Waitrose is  a rare find in England  Great cafes and Pauls  near station  make excellent baguettes and cakes We would recommend Astons but not their standard double rooms  
N => Perfect spot Astons was great  Yes the shower abuts the toilet and it gets slightly wet  yes the room was small  but I m there as a tourist  to sightsee  not to spend the better part of my day in my room  It s in a great location  Tesco and Waitrose are only a few blocks away  so shopping for food was easy  The kitchen is basic  but it gets the job done  I highly recommend it  The room was quiet  even though it was right by the stairs   please note  no elevator  but really not an issue   The staff concierge were great as well  I ll go back if I can  
N =>  Wretched Rooms absolutely tiny  no elevator  and long staircases to drag your luggage up   bathroom facilities beyond basic  beds way past their prime  If you like bedsprings sticking in your back  a bathroom fan that makes more noise than a locomotive  no place to open your suitcase  having to ask several times for every basic request  then stay here  I d recommend staying almost anyplace else  except for the great location  
N => Think small  think miniature I asked the young fellow who checked me in   Why do you call them apartments and not flats  He said   Because they re smaller than flats  Truer words were never spoken My single studio room was     in Building     It was a very small  narrow room with a high ceiling  I had to reach it by stairs  as there was no lift  It took me a good day to adjust to the tightness of the quarters and to shake the P O W  feeling it gave me  The bed was twin size  The closet was twelve inches wide     yes  inches  There was a small rotating fan on the floor  The balcony appeared to be openly shared by two other apartments  I was mindful of keeping my balcony doors locked There was a kitchen sink  a stove top  refrigerator  toaster  and microwave oven all in a compact area in my room  I liked brewing my own tea in the morning and having a tray of ice cubes handy in the refrigerator I couldn t imagine bringing bags of groceries into such a small space and preparing full meals I asked for a wake up call  It never came  I asked for an iron and an ironing board  They never came There was an alarm clock radio in the room  but no place to plug it in unless I unplugged the television  which I did  The bathroom was very tiny  It was impossible to shave or wash my face over the little dollhouse sink without spilling water on the floor and soaking the bathroom tissue  Water pressure in the shower was okay  The water turned cold in the middle of my first shower  The office sent up a maintenance man who immediately fixed the problem  I had hot water for the remainder of my stay One bath towel per day was provided  If you use hand towels or face cloths  bring your own Best not to lose that room key  You ll need it to re enter the building and the office closes at      Rosary Gardens was a very quiet street  The Gloucester Road tube station was an easy walk away  I walked to the Victoria  amp  Albert museum from Astons Although it was clean  my room was small to the point of being too small  Impractical  really  My rate was     per night   VAT  Total charge for my   nights was         USD  My advice  before booking into Astons look at the Priceline and the Bidding for Travel websites  You might be able to book hotel accommodations that are more liveable and perhaps even at a lower rate than what you ll pay at Astons I exchanged currency at Thomas Exchange Global on Victoria Street  The rate was    GBP for     USD  with no commission fees  People were queued up on the street waiting to get in there  
N =>   Astons  Pleasant Quiet Plain We stayed in a standard double  Small  but not as small as we feared  Submarine style bathroom was fine by us  Very quiet residential street was a big plus  Nearby tube  restaurants  shopping  Experimental wireless access in main building only     pounds for entire stay  regardless of length of time  Free access to internet via management s computers during business hours  Helpful  young staff  Only noise problem due to convoluted architecture   we literally could reach out of our window and touch the windowsills of two other apartments  The noise was not bad in our case  Aston s seems to attract a fairly quiet set of people  but you will be at the mercy of your neighbors  especially if it is warm and you have to leave the windows open for air  No A C and no cross ventilation  but small fans provided  Overall  we were pleased and would stay there again  
N => Too tiny  I was visiting friends in London and wanted to stay for a week in a serviced apartment  When I arrived  I was told that a deposit would be required  which I wasn t told about when I made the booking nor was it mentioned in their website    I was truly shocked by the tiny size of the room which therefore made the toilet bathroom the size of a broom cupboard  If you were taking a shower  you would more than likely hit the toilet seat      The sink was tinier than those you see in aeroplanes  Despite the high price of nearly       USD      per night  furnishings were basic and some things were not working e g  light in the room had fused  amongst other things  Don t bother to come here if you have luggage  In fact  just don t bother and go check into a hotel where you will at least get some decent facilities for the price  
N =>  Pleasant stay  
N =>  Home Away From Home   
N =>  Aston s best place to stay in Kensington  
N =>   Ottima posizione tutto il resto da rivedere  
N =>   Never stay here  Am horrified to see that we have had the same experience as other travellers and wish I had read reviews before going to London  Arrived to find our apartment was not available   were informed that this had been communicated to our agent but they have no record of this   apparently at time of booking they were fully booked  It later transpired that it was due to problems in another room and our room had been given to another group who had booked in before us  We were offered   rooms which we had no choice but to take due to travelling with young children and the time we checked in  It definitely meant our break got off to a bad start  Apart from location I can think of nothing else which would make me want to stay here again or recommend to anyone  unless I didn t like them   Old hotel  shabby  poor facilities and massively over priced  
N =>   Not a great place to stay Pros  Proximity to Oxford Street Cons  Everything else   As someone else described  this hotel is a conversion and as a result some of the rooms must be great and some are rubbish  Mine was a strange layout  but of reasonable size   a bit tired to look at  but that seems to be the norm for hotels trying to save a penny or two in refurbishment costs  Unfortunately  long term  and ongoing  building works almost adjacent to the hotel make this one of the noisiest daytime rooms I ever been in  and I was doing some last minute revision for an exam    At night I have to admit it was pleasantly quiet although not having double glazing is a puzzling choice in a city centre hotel Contrary to other reviewers experience  my room was freezing  in the second week of ober  with a barely functional radiator the only source of heat  Reception couldn t provide a standalone heater   quot people normally complain the rooms are too hot quot   so I resorted to using the lights  the trouser press and even the hair dryer at one point to heat the room up The en suite bathroom was old  basic and cold with the poorest excuse for a shower I ve ever witnessed  An interesting puzzle was the television  nice LCD  which provided the   analogue channels as well as a Freview selection  but unfortunately no one s paid the engineers to come round and retune the sets after the recent channel changes so most of them are missing The bed was at least comfortable and the continental breakfast was better presented than most other hotels I ve stayed in recently Overall  if you want a cheap hotel I advise you to stay in a Travelodge or Premier Inn somewhere else in central London and use the money saved to pay for the extra tube fare  Even at     this hotel would be charging too much  
N =>  Terrible experience A group of   of us booked a weekend break in London to celebrate our   th Birthdays  We chose Astor Court Hotel as we wanted an apartment and the hotel was pretty central  The apartment was booked a couple of months in advance via the internet  We turned up at the hotel on friday night to be told that due to a problem with the fire alarm we couldn t stay in our apartment  they had clearly given the accommodation to someone paying more   The only solution they offered was a hotel in a completely different part of London  and we had a table at a local restaurant booked for half an hour later     It also turned out that this alternative accommodation was a hotel room  rather than an apartment  and that it only slept   when there were   of us  We had to trawl round the area looking for an alternative  which meant that we missed our table reservation and had to spend extra money on transport  We found it disgraceful that they left   female travellers at night with no suitable options  The only compensation we got was our deposit back  but no apology and no offer of help with transport costs  Terrible  
N =>  Great location bit over priced perhaps My friends took me to London for my birthday overnight  amp  we stayed here  Our room was lovely it was clean  beds were comfortable  freeview television  seating area   although it was abit cramped it was fine there was only three of us  amp  we generally don t get under each others feet  Bathroom was clean with a shower  bath  amp  sink  the toliet was in a seperate room  only issue with the bathroom for me was the door didn t shut properely  amp  so I found myself taking my suitcase in the bathroom to prop the door shut  Location was brilliant nearby Oxford street  amp  in a quite a posh area   we even saw Paul O Grady walking down the street nearby lol  I can t comment on the breakfast since I didn t have any but my two friends said it was fine All the staff were foreign  amp  so it was difficult to understand them sometimes  amp  they struggled to understand us sometimes too  but the majority of workers in London are foreign anyway so it did nt bother me to be honest All in all I enjoied my stay in the hotel but then again I wasn t picking up the bill when I checked prices online I have to say I was slightly disappointed  amp  feel that they do overcharge you but its London so it can be expected to be pricey anyway If your looking for somewhere pleasant to stay I d recommend it  if you don t mind the price    
N =>  beware this hotel i stayed at this hotel with my daughter and  yr old grandson what a rip  icould not comfirm online booking so rang the hotel direct they said they could do me a better price direct  online it was         for   nights the hotel said they could do it for         i asked if this was all in they said yes   i did not get confirmation in writing or via email when we arrived they tried to charge me        for the   nights they said i misunderstood        was for   night  i was very upset they did reduce it in the end to         but still a lot so make sure you get a price on paper  i asked for a low room and got ground floor which was good but so noisey being right on the pavement  heating could not be turned off the room was like a furness you could not leave your window open being on ground floor the room was very small  when leaving i asked the hotel to order me a taxi to go to the station another big mistake they call a private firm they charged me        when it was only       to get there  so order your own taxi when needed breakfast was busy but ok you were not rushed out  i would not stay here again as i think they were unfair  but good location and take heed to reviews and you might be alright 
N =>   This hotel needs serious renovation  This hotel reminded me a Soviet hotel from an old movie  OK  the room was generously sized  but there was no AC  no ventilation in the loo  old furniture  dilapidated lampshades  missing handles  etc  On top of this the shower did not work the first day  I complained   it was fixed  it barely worked for the next day and then broke again  We requested and got a different room  The service was not good overall  The hotel manager was trying to convince me that the shower worked and somehow  like most Americans I don t really know how to use it  The room was not made one day  The lack of AC forces you to sleep with the window open and it is really noisy outside  there is a construction site next to the hotel   The breakfast is typical English  nothing to be excited The bottom line   stay out of this property  not recommended for anybody  
N =>  Cheap but Basic If you are wanting a cheap place to crash in central London after getting drunk this is it  If you are after high quality   standards in a Hotel look elsewhere Positive  The hotel location in central London is excellentFriendly staffNegative The hotel room  amp  general decor are in bad need of refurbishment  Real      s Fawlty Towers looking  Room was very very noisy all night traffic  amp  general noise   no double glazing  The bathroom was pretty grime  amp  the shower was luke warm Breakfast was a very crowded affair with people packed into one room  Very small glasses for the orange juice  amp  cheap food  
N =>   Astor Court was lovely   Having booked the Hotel online I then read some of the reviews just before we left to go to London on holiday  so felt a wee bit unsure about what to expect after seeing the mixed reviews  We re now back home after a great holiday in London and our stay at the Astor Court was lovely Having travelled from Scotland down to Kings Cross on the train  it was a short taxi ride     mins and under         to the Hotel  We had originally booked a family room so it was a pleasant surprise to be given an apartment  This was comfortable and spacious  The bathroom was fine and it was handy to have the small kitchen  Our   wee boys loved going down for breakfast each morning   there was a great choice of food and the staff were very welcoming and friendly  The location was very central   a short walk down to Oxford Circus and the tube  There were a number of  family friendly  italian  pizza restaurants close by  We were right next to the BBC radio studios   great for  star spotting  Radio   dj s    We weren t disturbed at all with noise from the construction work across the road and the street was very quiet at night  You could hear the rumble of the tube trains but this didn t bother us Our only  gripes  would be that the twin beds were in the living room   realistically where children would sleep    the large tv was also in this room  so not a good idea to put it on when you re settling a   year old  During our stay a small  digital  tv was put into our bedroom which was handy  There was a large wardrobe although not enough hangers and some drawers would have been handy    I also found the bedroom to be so hot and it was hard to turn the radiators down   off  The domestic staff on our floor were lovely   we met Betty   she was friendly without being intrusive We would definitely recommend the Hotel to family and friends  this was our first family trip to London and we hope to return one day  
N =>   Good Location HUGE Rooms This review is a little late   Me and a friend were going to London for a bit of retail therapy  sightseeing and clubbing We picked this hotel becasue of the price and location When we arrived at the hotel we were told that check in isn t until  pm  but we were able to leave our bags in a room so we wouldn t have to carry them around The location of this hotel couldn t have been any better  around a   minute walk from Oxford Street  Topshop  Nike Town etc  The rooms were better than we had expected  With a bathroom  separate toilet  two twin beds  wardrobe and sitting area There were tea  amp  coffee making facilites  TV etc Breakfast is included  but it s only continental  We were late getting up so we missed breakfast  but we looked in the breakfast rooms and there are things like bread  cereal  croussants etc I would go back to this hotel again due to the location and size of the rooms  the only downside was that we had to check out of our rooms at   am  so had to walk around London with our bags  which was bit of a pain   
N =>   Pleasantly surprised  Just got back from London  after staying in the Astor Court Hotel for one night  After reading some of the reviews on TripAdvisor  I was a bit dubious  Arrived late due to coach problems  but when we got there we were told they had overbooked and were being upgraded from a twin room to an apartment  so we were off to a good start  The girl on reception was very friendly and helpful The room was nice and spacious  although the decorating was a little old fashioned  however this was a minor detail  We also found the kitchen a bit grotty  but this didn t matter as my boyfriend and I didn t need to use it  The only thing that could have been a problem was that the hairdryer in the room did not work  but i had bought my own with me  Although our room was lovely  i can imagine that anything other than the apartment would be fairly small and possibly a bit cramped The breakfast was simple  but it did the job  Plenty to choose from with juices and a machine for hot drinks Overall  we were quite impressed with the hotel and wouldnt definitely go there again  The location is great  with easy access to everything  
N =>   Large rooms for families Great place to stay in central London  Close to Oxford street Got a large apartment with plenty of room for our family of four  Room was clean but as in many London hotel the interior was a bit old  Small kitchen that suited our needs  Good service at check in  Was first placed in a family room as booked  but the day after reception called and offered us an apartment  ent breakfast buffet included Only negative thing to mentioned is the noice from the street as windows are not well isolated On the basis of the noice and the pricing I rate it three  Otherwise I would have given it a four 
N =>   Very bad service I booked this hotel based on the fairly good reviews and because they had an apartment room that could sleep     people  A group of my girlfriends and I were going to London for the weekend and loved the idea of a suite that we could all stay in together and have a good old laugh I booked this hotel and even rang the day before to check that they had the booking for   in the apartment room  which they did  When we arrived we were informed that the apartment room was not available and that we were in two twin rooms one of which would have an extra bed put in it I was not very happy about this and when asked why this was the case was given some sob story about the people who were in the room being unable to leave but we could still have the   rooms for the same price of apartment     how kind We did not receive an apology and the staff sniggered behind our backs and were inpolite  they thought it was all highly amusing that they had put a serious dampner on our weekend If I had know the apartment was not available I would have booked elsewhere We asked to speak to the manager and told that  quot he did not liked to be called quot      what kind of manager is that  I then asked why the other people had not been asked to leave and the supervisior claimed they had left the hotel early  any other decent hotel would have told the other people that yes of course they could stay an extra night but not in the only apartment room as this had been booked by another group  but no  this is way to difficult for them After being totally fobbed off we informed the hotel staff that as we had no choice other than to stay in the   other rooms they should give us a discount as compensation  to which they replied we were getting the   rooms cheaper as they would only take payment for the apartment room  I explained to them this was not the point and was hardley compensation aas we would never pay more  They then told us that they could not give a discount as they were not authorised too and needed payment upfront  remember the manager does not like to be called Eventually they did agree to give us a discount  so they lied to us again as they could authorise it without the manager To make things worse the rooms were very small and basic whereas I know the apartment room is of a good size  plus one of the girls had to sleep on a bed that was shoved in any old how I would not recommend this hotel as they were very rude  
N =>   Astor Court Central Location Astor Court was a very central hotel close to regent street and oxford street room was basic but very good  a continental breakfast was included and the staff were friendly Bed was comfortable and got a good sleepwould recommend this hotel to anyone 
N =>   Best bargain in London We booked a quad family room and were delighted when we arrived to a spacious   bedroomed room  It was spotlessly clean  beds were comfortable  ample supply of towels and sufficient cupboard and wardrobe space  Continental breakfast  included in price      prpn   was enough to get us through til lunchtime  Staff both at reception and in dining room were very pleasant and assisted with all enquiries  We chose this hotel because of central location and price and we were not disappointed  Of course decor and furniture could be updated but It was a lovely surprise for a budget hotel and if we return to London we would definitely go back to Astor Court Hotel  
N =>   Great location First impressions after a    hour flight wasnt the best  but the reception guy was very helpful and was able to get us a room when we arrived  Check in is usually at  pm and we arrived at the hotel at around  am  so they were very gracious at being able to check us in straight away without charging an extra night s rate  Kind enough to also offer us breakfast when we arrived All in all an old but charming hotel  a little overheated but cant be too picky   Found that hot water wasnt always on in the early hours of the morning  but a good enough excuse to sleep in  The hotel itself is in a very good location  quiet and central  close to shopping and all transport   Breakfast was rather blah  but that s to be expected with most of the hotels anyway  I wouldnt bat an eyelash if I had to stay there again  
N =>   Top class location Really nice hotel in the central London    minutes walk to Oxford Street  The rooms were clean  We had a little problem with the toilet  We could not flush to often    The breakfast was okay  There was a great selection  The staff was friendly Can only recommend this hotel  
N =>  Not what I Paid For    There were problems with our flight and I phoned the hotel to advise them that we would be arriving late  The Receptionist confirmed the booking    single en suite rooms  and told us it would be fine to check in late  When we arrived at the hotel  at  am  we were advised by the Receptionist that our rooms were gone and that the only thing they had left was an apartment with two rooms but had a shared bathroom  This is not what we had paid for  and as we were work colleagues the situation was not ideal  luckily for us  our respective spouses did not have a problem with this arrangement   However at that time of night there was not much we could do but we were not offered any compensation for this inconvenience  either that night or the next day  I am very annoyed as I had called a number of hours earlier to ensure everything was ok and to turn up at that time of night after a stressful flight to be told or booking had been changed without our permission and with no compensation offered  was completey unacceptable  
N =>   Better than expected   Having read some of the reviews for this hotel I wasnt expecting much but was pleaseantly surprised  My group had two double rooms which were clean and of average size  Toilet and shower are inseperate areas in the room which was weird but both were clean  Building is old so rooms a little dated but nothing too bad The receptionist was very friendly on our arrival and other staff we met were friendly too  Was dreading breakfast due to some of the reviews but again was pretty pleased  Room IS too small but breakfast was plentifuland staff were constantly bringing in fresh supplies of croissants or rolls when they were running low My main negative was the noise  traffic outside  we were on first floor  and then noise of people walking in room above us very creaky floorboards however when i put my earplugs in I fell asleep quickly All in all for the price you get what you pay for  and the location I would recommend this hotel  
N =>  Roomy but Worn My family of   stayed at the Astor Court for   nights in ch  It was the only hotel that would accommodate    but there is not much else positive to say about it   We stayed in one of the two bedroom flats  The room was old  bathrooms small with marginal water pressure  Breakfast was cereal and pastries  Creaky  The front desk staff was not very helpful The only positive was location   good walking distance to the tube and an interesting neighborhood  However  next time in London we will stay somewhere else  For what we paid  or maybe a little more  we could have gotten two rooms in a much nicer hotel  
N =>   Well located but dirty and with a very bad service I booked this hotel after reading a good review in tripadvisor but when I arrived the situation was completelly different  All the employees treats you as if you were invisible  so you have to take care of your self by your own  My room room was really dirty and  personally  it s the place where you are afraid to let your stuffs in the room  It s suposse I would stay   nights and after my first night I departed to another hotel  
N =>   ent Hotel  Location was the important aspect of this hotel for me and it was pretty good  No more than a    minute walk to Oxford Street and Great Portland Street tube station is   minutes away  We found the hotel hard to find on our first day but it was only because we weren t used to the area  it was easy to find every other time Rooms were fine  Furniture may have been a little outdated but that wasn t important to us  Beds were comfortable and the room was clean  thats all we needed Breakfast was complimentary and very enjoyable fruit juices  tea coffee  toast  croissants  cereals  yoghurt etc  Would probably stay here again  
N =>   Noisy Great location  being only   minutes from Oxford Street   shame about the noise from outside as in the middle of a building site  was directly above the underground so every couple of minutes a tube went underneath and very busy road with traffic outside until early morning  neighbours in the next room coming in at  AM banging  shouting  laughing   singing etc  Wouldn t even open their door to talk and listen to our complaints  Staff in the morning not too helpful as the answer when I complained was  quot They are bad men  staying   in a room quot   so the hotel allowed   single guys to stay in one room Strangest thing was the ultra violet light shining outside the entrance throughout the night which shone through the gaps in the curtain making the room look like an extra in an ET movie Breakfast was ok but not enough room  we had to quickly grab a table that had just been vacated while oyhers were told to go away and come back when less busy as no tables were available Room was large but the bed was very hard and pillows like   blocks of concrete Guess I could say I would never  ever stay there again  
N =>  Homely I stayed at this hotel for two nights in London as I was on a weekend course at Westminster University When we arrived I was a bit apprehensive as it looked old fashioned  It took ages to pay as the hotel payment system was not working and would not accept my card  They said it was their fault and after    minutes asked me for another card  There was a language problem which was a pain too  I did not have another card and stood there and eventually my card worked  I was concerned as I thought we might be thrown on to the street  They were meant to take payment as we left  Anyway we had a ground floor room which had a separate lounge and although dated  I liked it  The bathroom was big but grotty although it was clean  The breakfast was average  I would stay there again but I heard they did it up and it might not be the same  
N => average hotel with a decent price we stayed at astor court for four days with   friends  the room was adequate for   persons  clean  and the bathroom also was spacious  tha location of the hotel is very good  only   min from oxford circus the only problem we had is of economic nature  although we decided to pay in front the whole amount when we arrived  as requested by the hotel  on the day we checked out they told us that they had made a mistake and haven t charged us the tax   when we told them we had money only for the train to the airport and that was not our fault  we were told  very impolitely  that the card i had given to make the reservation would be charged  and we didn t even hear a  quot sorry quot  of course that event doesn t characterize the hotel  only that the personnel wasn t very polite other than that the hotel was what we had in mind for a   day trip to london only the breakfast was not satisfying so we decided to eat out every morning although we have paid for it

N =>   Afternoon tea  Could Have Been So Much Better  I booked afternoon tea for me and   of my friends as a treat for my   th birthday Meeting friends for afternoon tea is generally something I only do on special occasions and have had a few in various locations around the country world  After reading a few reviews and hearing about awards that have been won for the teasat this hotel I was expecting high standards but was left feeling very dissapointed  We arrived on time for our booking but was told our table wasn t ready  We were advised that we could sit and wait and was pointed to a lounge area where we then had to organise ourselves extra chairs to fit around a small table  We had to wait    minutes for our table to be ready during which time nobody came to ask us if we would like a drink or take our coats or anything while we was waiting  not a great start  When our table was ready we was escourted to a nice table the ambience  decor and lighting in the area was all very pleasant  Those of us that wanted it were served a glass of Kir Royal  then somebody came to take our coats after we had sat down and started our drinks  we were shown the tea menu which had a substantial selection of teas  The table was layed with blue cups and plates and yellow cups and plates one thing i noted while we were wating was they seemed to have been put down in no particular fashion e g  one persons place setting might have had a yellow plate  blue cup sitting next to someone with a blue cup and plate and so on  not that that bothers me but I would expect a little more attention to detail from such an establishment  You might expect to get odd cups and plates in a greasy spoon cafe   I also had an oyster fork laid in my place setting rather then a cake dessert fork like some of my friends had in their place setting We were then served our sandwiches after a substantial wait  a theme that runs throughout the tea  a little shocked I was expecting tea before sandwiches or at least someone to take our tea order  baring in mind not everyone in my party wanted a Kir Royal and we had a    minute wait for our table   The waiter silver served your chosen sandwiches onto your plate dainty finger sandwiches with the crusts removed  fillings as specified on the menu of the website   Again I felt disappointed the specialty breads tasted like the run of the mill supermarket pre sliced loafs and the fillings were so thin you could barely taste them  The finger sandwiches were also cut to odd sizes and the second round of sandwiches seemed to have a little more filling then the first  which was a good thing but demonstrates the lack of quality control and consistency   The waiter took our tea order between rounds After our sandwich plates were cleared and a little wait our tea finally arrived for me and my rather parched friends  The waiter poured your chosen tea for you and then pots were left on the table  After finishing our first cups and waiting a while we realised nobody would be coming to top us up so we started to pour our own cups some of the pots were quite large  where   people were sharing the same tea  and because the pots were silver the handles were red hot and although little paper napkins were left on teh handles this was not adequate to prevent you getting burnt and the pots were very full and therefore heavy the girls in my group could not pour there own tea safely so I had to do the honours with the additional help of my linen napkin  The warm scones arrived next  plain and fruit  with clotted crem and home made Jams strawberry and raspberry the strawberry jam was far to runny more like a lumpy coulis then a jam A pink cup cake was brought out with a candle in it for my birthday which was a nice touch happy birthday was also printed in chocolate on the plate with pink candy cains  flowers and blackberrys The dessert trolly was brought around next where you were able to choose   cakes each I was happy with the birthday cup cake and a piece of chocolate cake from the trolly however both were very disappointing very dry almost stale tasting was actually hard to swallow like mixing cement in your mouth so only eat a bite of each   My friends were not to impressed with there cakes either one fruit tartlet definatley did not look home made   The tea finished with teacakes  crumpets and butter but our knives had been cleared with our scones so we had to ask for more so we could butter the teacakes and crumpets  by which time both were cold when the knives arrived  I must also mention the dinning room chairs were also very uncomfortable to be sitting in for prolonged periods we all had back pains at the end of our teasBeing my birthday I had reserved an area in a nearby bar for drinks after but because my table was not ready and the extremley slow service I had to phone ahead to advise I would not make my next booking until later   I had not envisaged afternoon tea taking   hours  I requested the bill which arrived but then the lounge seemed to empty of staff after     pm so ending up leaving my friend to settle the bill  when staff were available to pay   so we could dash to our next reservation So in summary a very disappointing experience the service was shabby I have never experienced a service managed in such a manner a different waiter waitress carried out a different task for each course e g  a different waiter served the sandwiches then another for the tea and another for the cake etc  which is why I believe there was such long delays between courses there was not   waiter to look after you throughout the meal and therefore monitor your progress and meet your needs  I m an accomplished cake maker and i could have done a much better job with the cakes then that was on offer at this establishment Theres much better afternoon tea venues out there including the Park Lane hotel next door  
N =>  be My Favorite Hotel Ever We absolutely loved our stay at this hotel  It was quiet luxury without any of the uptightness that can sometimes happen  We were greeted warmly  showed up to our fabulous apartment  an upgrade from the double room we had booked  and treated kindly the entire time we were there  There was so much to appreciate  from the courteous staff  to the cleanliness  to the artistic special touches and the intimate alcoves in the Whiskey Lounge and tea room  Even the ammenities were wonderful  and appreciated the free internet in the business room  Didn t have time to take advantage of the spa or restaurant  but we will next time  We had a fabulous stay All we can say is Thank You  
N =>  Truelly fantastic Wonderful hotel  Great service  Now they can check even you in in the whisky bar  The card was already filled out  luggage disappeared to the room and able to get my emails because they don t charge you for wifi  This hotel is ahead of the game  
N =>   great location comfortable stay Check in was welcoming but the orginial room I was assigned was not  It was at the back of the hotel  very dark  small with a disabled facilites bathroom  When I requested to change rooms  reception were great  They upgraded me to a better room on the side of the hotel which was much more spacious  comfortable and hospitable  Stayed there for   nights  the doorman was very friendly and helpful and I would recommend this hotel to those of you who are looking for a great location in the centre of london  PS  the complimentary soft drinks  snacks and proper coffee in the rooms was a refreshing change  
N =>  Absolutely fantastic venue I attended a business meeting here recently  From the very first enquiry  right through to when we left the Hotel  the service was second to none  The rooms we booked were exactly as described  if not better  I cannot rate The Athenaeum highly enough All  and I mean ALL staff we encountered were the epitome of excellence  
N =>   Fantastic stay can t wait to go back  We wanted a reasonably priced stay because we were going to dinner at Claridges and booked direct with the hotel because they were offering the same price as Laterooms com  I mentioned it was my husband s   th birthday and didn t think anymore of it  They greeted us warmly and then mentioned that they had upgraded us free of charge which was a pleasant surprise  Checking in was super quick and the lady then gave us a quick guided tour of the hotel s facilities then showed us to our lovely bedroom  Soft drinks and snacks were free and there was also a coffee machine  and tea coffee making facilities  with fresh milk in the fridge  So many little thoughful extras that will make us want to go back  The hotel has undergone a major refurbishment and it s gorgeous  The attention to detail is brilliant  my husband went home wanting to change everything in our house  We have stayed in many hotels in London and throughout the country and this is the first time we have bothered to review one  The service was excellent and basically we could not fault our stay  
N =>  Awesome in every way  We were lucky enough to enjoy   nights at the Athenaeum Apartments and enjoyed every aspect of this boutique hotel  amp  apartments  the location is premium  opp  Green Park  a short walk to Buckingham Palace  Hyde Park  Piccadilly  amp  Regent streets  Soho and everything London has to offer Our apartment was one of the older ones with   bedrooms  but still great  as it was full of character  well equipped  amp  fridge stocked with freebies  as well as a good array of free snacks refilled every day  Our friends had a   bed room apartment  this would be good value if you had   couples sharing  amp  split the cost  each apartment had a roomy lounge as well  
N =>   Would definitely return but not to the same room  This is a stunning hotel in an excellent location  Unfortunately  we only stayed one evening which our daughter had booked through an internet site  so I ve no idea of the cost  We were celebrating a joint birthday and anniversary and as such our stay was viewed as a treat  Unfortunately  and as mentioned  our initial impression was overshadowed by the scaffolding to the front and rear of the hotel  But no sooner had we emerged from the taxi  when an attentative doorman opened the door for us   a most welcome gesture and typical of a top hotel  The booking in was efficient and fast  although the site that my daughter had booked it through was mentioned  which we couldn t understand the reason for  unless it was just to clarify the confirmation  Unlike others  we weren t offered an upgrade but this might have been because the rooms were booked at a discounted rate due to the renovations that were taking place A lovely gentleman whipped our suitcases away and deposited them in our rooms  and they d kindly allocated a room next door for our daughter   Unfortunately  the scaffolding work  which I ve since noticed seems to have been removed from the front  came up to our bedroom windows  which were situated at the rear  but there was no problem with any noise   just a barely existent view of a courtyard below  However  we were there to see a show and have a small celebration  so didn t intend doing more than just sleep and bathe etc As our stay was so short  we didn t have time to make use of the hotels excellent facilities  nor did we have breakfast there  The rooms we were allocated were slightly on the tired side for the star rating  and they weren t rooms that you d have wanted to stay in for too long  but again  that was probably due to the renovations  The rooms were of a generous size by London standards  and as expected  clean and comfortable  The bathroom was well stocked with toiletries  and immaculate  The communal areas were immaculate also  but time was so limited we didn t even have time to wander around this excellent hotel Our short stay was enhanced by the excellent and friendly staff who couldn t be faulted  and we d definitely stay again  but only if we paid more for an upgraded room  Would recommend this hotel to friends and family once the renovations are completed  as I m sure that no one would be disappointed by this well located and up market establishment  
N =>   Good location but more like a   star The location near Green Park tube is fantastic   three tube lines go through here  as well as plenty of nearby buses  Size of room not bad for London  quite comfortable   beds were nice  There was no view from my room   it was a quiet room but it looked out on a brick wall of the neighbouring building  Bathroom was small but has nice soap  amp  shower gel etc  The hotel was being renovated which is probably why I got a good rate on lastminute com  Overall not bad  but probably not   star standard   felt more like a   star  
N =>  Great hotel freindly staff My fiance booked this hotel for my   th Birthday  It was not cheap but I think it was worth every penny When we arrived we were quickly checked in and shown to our room by the freindly receptionist  As requested we had a smoking room which was not expected  As it was my   th birthday the hotel had arranged a complementary upgrade which included a bottle of wine and a gift  The room was big and comfortable  The only downside to the accomadation was that the bath was very small although the shower was powerfull  The room came equipt with a large flat screen TV a Bose i pod dock and a coffee machine  Also included were bath robes and slippers which was a nice touch  I didn t try out the spa facilities  but they looked good Overall this was a fantastic luxury place to stay and I really felt pampered  We didn t eat breakfast here as it was     per person  instead we went to Harry s bar just down the road for a great value very tasty breakfast which I would highly recconmend  I would stay here again as is in a great location very comfortable and a real treat  
N =>   Expected a lot more for my money poky tatty room   disappointed I chose this hotel for a relaxing indulgent weekend away by myself  and treated myself to what I thought would be five star luxury  based on the website  The location was great  but my room was really a big let down  It was so small and cramped in there  the furniture was tatty  the bath was not full size  I ve stayed in many better hotel rooms  pretty much any in the US have beaten it for size and quality of decor fittings   It felt like a budget room  but it was very far from being a budget price  Aside from that  the room service was very good and prompt  breakfast was good  though I had to wait a long while as it was too busy to get a table on the Sunday morning  which seemed a bit poor  Front of house seemed a bit cramped  in comparison to other places I ve stayed    not very much of a wow factor  I was unable to get the treatments I required at the health spa as they were overbooked  but after making a fuss  was offered the option to have a massage and pedicure in my room  getting the foldaway table in my room was quite a struggle  and once it was erected the therapist couldn t move around it very well  so it was all a bit comical and not quite the relaxing experience I d hoped for   I paid top whack for the single room I had  which had a small double bed   I m off to London again soon and have chosen a different hotel   very little about the Athenaeum would entice me back  
N =>  Not   star standard but good food Husband and I stayed here for one night last ch  having a much needed night off from our   month old baby  We live in London and wanted to stay in a nice hotel centrally and just have a little break from the rigours of having a new baby  We booked this because it was   stars and we got a good deal on last minute dot com We were disappointed by the quality  we expected more for   stars  Our room was tiny and not particularly luxurious  it was high up and had a partial view of the park though  It was next to the lift shaft and there was constant noise from that so we asked to be moved which they did very promptly  We were moved to a lower floor and I imagine a more expensive room as the nextr room was very big indeed but again  same standard of decor etc The bathroom was standard fare  marble counter tops etc  but the toiletries were awful  synthetic not at all luxurious  not   star We ate in the restaurant which has had a makeover and is a lovely  warm space  approached through a really cosy bar area  It is perfect for a romantic meal  all shades of pink and gold and the tables are not too close together  The food was excellent and good value I would recommend the Athenaeum if you can get a deal on the internet but otherwise there are definitely better   star options in central london  the Dorchester being one or the Churchill on portman Square which is a fantastic place with luxury rooms and a great breakfast  
N =>  Not worth the money friendly service Booked this through lastminute as many ppl have recently as a birthday trip for me and bf We actually walked past the hotel a few times as we couldn t find it through all the refurbishment works going on outside We were in the apartments down the way and so had a lovely view of an office block and had workers watching us The room was a twin  and when the receptionist showed us to the room she commented that oh dear  this is a twin   we ll have it made as a double   and the beds were just pushed together  It was not comfortable The thermostat was set at   c when we got there  so we had to put the aircon on  which was so noisy all night There was some filthy insect in the sink  i think it was a silverfish  in the morning The longlife milk in the frisge was out of date so no tea in the morning Appauling considering it is a   star hotel  
N =>   Brillian birthday Had a brilliant stay here to celebrate my Wife s   th birthday Because of the building work being done to the front of the building the lovely woman on reception upgraded us to an apartment  Needless to say it was out of this world  Grand  charming  spacious and clean We couldn t get over how attentive the staff we  They would bend over backwards for us and we felt well and truly looked after I m sure once the renevation work is complete the Executive rooms at the front would have been more than adequate The spa was also top draw  Not exactly massive but the steam room was very powerful and the jaquzzi is well worth a visit Will definately be coming back   
N =>   Friendly hotel excellent staff  My boyfriend and I have just returned home after spending a week at the Athenaeum Hotel in London  Our stay there was excellent and the staff all amazing  We were treated like special guests and every member of the staff were paying real attention to us and whatever we needed  We had booked through our agent in Greece a standard double room but we were upgraded to a  quot Green Park view quot  one as soon as we checked in  The room was newly refurbished with nice furniture and fresh colours  Everything was brand new and in excellent condition  Our view was a bit obstructed by a scaffold  renovation going on  but this won t last for long I believe  The restaurant and bar were great too  Everyone was polite and eager to offer their services  Even the beauty salon was great too Selim at the reception is the sweetest and friendliest guy we  ve ever met at a    hotel   and we travel a lot  usually staying at hotels like Hilton or Sheraton  The location at Piccadilly is extremely convenient  Not more than    minutes walk to Oxford st   Knightsbridge  right next to Park Lane and Hyde Park I m very glad we selected this hotel and we re definitely going back  It feels as if we made new friends in London  
N =>   Not worth the price My work Christmas party was taking place close to the hotel and as Lastminute com had a wonderful deal for this hotel I thought I would take advantage of it We were not informed about building work taking place in the hotel so were disappointed that the view of Green Park was replaced by plastic sheeting  I also did not expect to come out of the bathroom wearing just a towel to find   work men stood right outside my window In the morning when we really needed to sleep off the party excesses drilling started at around      so we were unable to rest In addition I don t actually think this hotel is worth the discounted rate that I paid for it let alone the full price  The bedroom was on the small side  the tv had a mind of it s own  the bath was so small I sat in in with my legs bent plus there wasn t a great deal of hot water There are far better hotels in London for a fraction of the price  
N =>   Worst    Hotel We ve Ever Had The Displeasure Of Staying In  This was supposed to be a great weekend getaway for my wife and myself  and well  considering that we spent good money on this hotel  to say that we were disappointed to say the least is an understatement The best thing about the Athenaeum hotel is the door man  Jim  this man is a real gentleman  and is a shining example of what a door man should be  If it wasn t for him  I doubt that we would have spent the night  He treated my wife and myself  like we were made of gold  it was amazing On to the hotel room though when we checked in  we were informed that we had been upgraded from a normal room to a newly refurbished executive room  which we thought was great news However once we got to the room we found long black hairs in the bath  and in the bed  considering both my wife and myself are blond  we knew they weren t ours  this was already a bit disturbing  Also  I found stains on my pillowcase  this is not the type of cleanliness that I expected from a   star hotel in the centre of London  The cupboard door wouldn t close properly either  so this was just plain annoying  especially considering that this was a recently refurbished executive room  One of the other issues that we had with the room was that the little porcelain cover on top of the cold tap labelled  quot Cold quot  was chipped and kept falling into the sink  and the underside of the sink was filthy as well There were also renovations going on at the hotel and this was never mentioned when we booked at all  and well as for the timeless  quot Green Park views quot  that were advertised  well these are ruined by all the renovation work that is going on at the moment  so when you look out of your window  all you can see is scaffolding and red netting  not very timeless at all  I also phoned downstairs on the Sunday morning to get a bag retrieved from my car and brought to my room  I was told that this would be with me in    minutes time  Well     minutes came and went  and I even phoned and said that we were going to have some breakfast  and then I would pick the bag up from reception  After breakfast  I went to the reception desk  only to be told that the receptionist went to the wrong persons car  adn couldn t find the bag  and then couldn t remember who we were or which room we were in It seems that others have had great experiences at this hotel  but ours was atrocious  and we will never be going back to this hotel again  I honestly wonder how this hotel received above   stars  To be honest  I ve always had great luck with Last Minute  but on this occasion I feel honestly let down  and feel like we wasted close to      on this occasion  I feel that Last Minute should at least update their listing to reflect that there are renovations going on at present  
N =>  Great place to stay in London We stayed in one of the Apartments attached to the Hotel with our   small children  plus had a single in the Hotel for my mother in law  Fantastic place to stay in London   we ll never stay anywhere else in the future  Loved having a kitchen to fix breakfasts and coffees   several times we went to a local store and brought home prepared foods to heat up in the kitchen  It was all the benefits of having an apartment  but you also get the fantastic doorman to hail a taxi or help with luggage  Awesome stay in London   I recommend it highly  
N =>   Amazing brilliant staff beautiful place I booked this as a  top secret  hotel through Last Minute  Within half an hour of making the booking one of the team from the hotel had called to see if there was anything extra I d like  if it was for an occassion etc  It was a wedding anniversary so I told them this but declined the extras      for a bottle of champagne was more than I could manage  When we got there the hotel exterior was being worked on  but there was no noise  When we checked in we were informed that we had been upgraded to an apartment and were shown to the most beautiful place  with a lounge  kitchenette  diner and huge bedroom beautifully decorated and furnished  The staff member who showed us in was genuinely keen to make sure we were happy and it seemed to make her happy that I was so pleased   a rare thing in hotels I find  There was a card and wine  really nice little touches that meant everything All the staff were helpful  polite and not condescending  something I find very frequently in London hotels  and keen to ensure that we were enjoying ourself and had what we needed etc  They even reminded us about the clocks changing And the cocktails were fabulous    I would love to go back  and maybe try the restaurant I think this is my new favourite hotel  
N =>   Perfections  I booked the Athenaeum for my  rd year anniversary  We arrived early to use the spa facilities and were told our room was ready even though it wasn t check in time  The people behind reception were very helpful and one man kindly showed us to our room  When we got to our room I was just blown away  They had upgraded us to an apartment because I had mentioned it was our anniversary  Later on they amazed us further by bringing complimentary wine  fruit and nuts to our room along with an anniversary card  How thoughtful  We had afternoon tea in the garden room that day and the service was wonderful  Everyone was so attentive and it was great value for money  We will certainly be going back as it was a truly special weekend  
N =>   Fabulous Honeymoon stay My husband and I just spent two very romantic nights at the Athenaeum  The staff went above and beyond in trying to help make our last two nights special  Upon check in  the girls behind the desk were warm  friendly and helpful  Our room was spacious  clean and tastefully decorated  After watching the most fabaulous musical we have every seen  Billy Elliott  we went back to our room to find candles  chocolates  chilled champagne and rose petals in the shape of a heart on the bed  I mean  WOW  It was a wonderful surprise and very much appreciated by us  We have stayed here most every time we ve visited London and we will continue to be loyal guests  Why look further  The service is spectacular Thank you Athenaeum   
N =>   Excellent Room Service The hotel was a pleasant surprise  even taking account of the previous comments  Welcome good  Room good  despite being without a view and not being upgraded like many previous reviewers   Radio has a good selection of channels  Handy location   short walk to Green Park underground  shepherd s market  Hyde Park  The size and position of the bath have something to be desired   I presume things like this are being rectified in the works underway in the hotel  Can t comment on the restaurant as we did not eat in  although the hotel didn t push the restaurant for an evening meal   Also we took advantage of room service to have an excellent breakfast delivered to our room  It is worth taking the advice of an earlier reviewer and booking through a travel website  Luckily I read that after investigating the cost of B amp B direct from the hotel  which would have been significantly more expensive compared to the same offer through a website  This was a little surprising to find out as experience tends to show the opposite  Needless to say we booked through the web and saved some     on the deal  
N =>   Very Enjoyable Stay We stay in London quite regularly and normally stay at one of the Hiltons but  having recently lost the privileges we had from having a Hilton Honours gold card  we no longer see the Hilton chain as being such an attractive proposition so we have been trying out a number of the other   star hotels this year such as The Langham  the Raddisons  The Howard and The Ritz etc This stay       was a last minute decision and we booked using points obtained through our credit card and the booking was made through EBookers and included a standard room and continental breakfast We arrived outside in a taxi  a little disturbed to see the entire exterior covered in scaffolding and sheeting which we were unaware of  but the taxi door was opened and our bags whisked away  We arrived about an hour before official check in time but this was not a problem  Reception staff were amongst the most efficient and friendliest that we have come across in London  We were advised that we had an upgrade to an executive room and the room was almost ready and they called through to house keeping to give our room priority  Meanwhile  after completing the usual paperwork  we were asked if she could help us with any lunch or dinner arrangements and we explained that we had already booked lunch at their restaurant for  pm so she went straight to the Maitre D to re confirm and also let her have our room number  She then escorted us to show us where the lounge  bar and restaurant and spa areas were before escorting us right to our room The room was of a very nice size  in good order and with lots of character   very traditional in style and d cor and great curtains  no light seeping through in the morning   There was scaffolding outside the window but no walkways so privacy was not an issue  Our room overlooked the side street with a side view onto Green Park  There was a table and two chairs  some nice nuts and seeds and complementary bottled water on the table   a mini bar  complementary tea and coffee  with carton milk in the fridge   nice toiletries  dressing gowns  DVD player  good quality TV and quite a small but beautifully presented marble bathroom with heated mirrors  although this did mean it got very hot in there if you left the lights on  If anything  my only criticism would be that there were too many mirrors  all along one wall adjacent to the bed were mirrored doors and two walls of the bathroom    just a personal thing  but I prefer not to see myself from all those angles  We had lunch in their restaurant which was booked through Top Table  lunch   course inc coffee and truffles and a glass of champagne for     each   We loved the restaurant itself   quirky in d cor and quite buzzy in there when we first arrived  The service was good too  We opted for the buffet starter which was good  although probably better if you go earlier in the lunch sitting rather than very late as we did  and this consisted of a selection of cold starters including seafood and meats  salads etc  We then both chose the duck and game main course but they only had one available so they offered the same but cooked with just venison  It may have been due to the lateness of eating but I found the duck and venison a little over cooked   no sign of pink at all and the sauce it was served in was a bit  gloopy    that said  we both ate it all and still enjoyed it   it just could have been a little better  For dessert we both opted for cr me caramel which was good  Coffee and truffles were also lovely  All in all   this came to just over        service so we thought it was excellent value for money considering more than half of that was the bottle of Taittinger we ordered We ordered room service breakfast in the morning and this was delivered promptly and had lovely fresh pastries and excellent hot chocolate  although we did not eat too much as had lunch booked for later  and there was no tray charge for the room service breakfast All in all we really enjoyed our stay here  The location is not as good for us as other hotels we have stayed in as it was really too far to walk to Covent Garden etc but the surrounding area is very nice  The service we received throughout our stay was truly   star  the rooms were lovely and comfortable  although the bed was a little hard for us   the restaurant is excellent value for money and a big issue for us personally is that they did not add compulsory service charges to everything   no tray charges for room service or anything   gratuities were clearly at your own discretion and complementary bottled water   I always begrudge paying extra for this in a five star hotel  I am sure we will return  
N =>   We felt like royality We have just returned from   night stay in the    Athenaeum and it was perfect bliss  On arrival we were upgraded to an apartment  From arriving the service was brilliant from every member of staff  Our bags and coats were taken to our apartment and our car was parked and returned for us parking cost    pn   It was a total surprise for my   th   and my husband had booked a side by side  his n hers  back massage and facial  The girls were extremely professional and experienced and we felt totally relaxed afterwards  The spa facilities are compact but adequate and everything you need  Unhappy we have left and returned to normality  We would just like to say a big thankyou to you all and we hope to see you soon xx 
N =>   Firm Favourite  Hi I m new to tripadvisor but thought I had to write a review of the Athenaeum  My boyfriend and I stay here on average once a year  sometimes more  It s definitely our hotel of choice whenever we re in London It s location is perfect  so close to Buckingham Palace and The Ritz  and it s right on the Piccadilly line so getting to other touristy spots like Covent Garden and Leicester Square are really easy The rooms are always beautiful  The first time we went we were upgraded to an apartment   because we asked for twin beds to be put together  which was out of this world  More flat screen tv s than we knew what to do with and living areas that were bigger than what we had at home  My brother and his girlfriend were also upgraded to an apartment  just because there was a glitch in processing their payment  Rest assured if you are made to feel even a little put out the Athenaeum will go out of their way to make it up to you The last time we stayed         we were upgraded to a park view suite  which I actually preferred to the apartments due to it s amazing view of the Park  with the London Eye slowly moving in the background The food and wine is as good  but as pricey  as you d expect but it s so close to the centre of London you never really have to stay in  The hotel may look expensive at first  but if you shop around you can usually find really good online deals  
N =>   Perfect Stayed here twice in   weeks for business whilst visting trade shows at Olympia and showrooms in central London I booked both times through Travelsupermarket com and got good deals on both occasions  including breakfast which is a huge saving  First time I stated was at the start of ust  When my colleague and I arrived they have mistakenly booked us a double room and told me that they were fully booked  I was beginning to curse my good deal  however the manager told us to have a complimentary drink in the bar whilst they sorted us out  Few glasses of wine later they had sorted out the room and provided a twin and a complimentary bottle of Tattinger in our room which was a very nice gesture   especially a I hadn t booked through them and offered to upgrade us the next night to an apartment Room   clean  roomy and good standard of d corBathroom   very pleasant with a great shower Breakfast   I wouldn t pay the hotel prices   but excellent as it was included  bar a small supplement of    per person to upgrade to the full  Very good selection Service        very pleased with the staff  all very friendly  especially the duty manager and very tall doorman I re booked this when I had to come back to London   weeks later  Very happy on both occasions 
N =>  Delightful stay  We have a wonderfuyl stay at the Athenaeum     We were greeted warmly and given a room upgrade upon arrival  a lovely room  light and spacious  with a view of Green Park  We found the service outstanding and the breakfast was  in my view  the best breakfast I ever had in comparable hotels     We had read reviews commenting on the need for the hotel to be refurbished  and the manager told us they were starting to work on the renovations  But our room was absolutely perfect in every detail  We simply loved the Athenaeum and plan to go back as soon as possible  
N =>   Well   What a pleasant surprise  Last week we managed to obtain a late deal at this hotel Having stayed in many London hotels over countless years  always   or   star  we found this non chain establishment to be a little gem  The Doorman was always helpful  carrying bags getting taxies opening the doors and making sure you did not slip in the rain   So often today the doormen seem to disappear when needed  The gentleman on check in was very helpful  amp  efficient  Unfortunately our room was still being cleaned so we had to wait about    mins during which time we were offered the use of the spa and refreshments  Our room was not huge  but comparable with other London hotels  It was spotlessly clean with a very comfortable bed and good quality bed linen  It had all the normal facilities you would expect from a first class hotel  incuding hangers with hooks those clip in things are my pet hate  plus a useful London information guide to keep  The breakfast dining room was very comfortable with a choice of a buffet and cooked breakfast as well as a good selection of items to order  At first glance the buffet looks quite small  but this is an advantage as everything is freshly topped up  There was a good choice of meats  cheese cereal yoghurt fresh fruit   it even had fresh honeycomb  The cooked breakfast could not be faulted and refills of tea  amp  coffee were always offerered by the attentive  amp  polite staff We did not dine a the hotel but we had an excellent lunch snack in the lounge At this hotel all we can say about  quot Afternoon Tea quot  is just have it and enjoy   Altough we did not use the concierge service it seemed excellent   you actually sit down at a desk unlike other hotels where you stand at a counter  Throughout our stay the Executive Manager always stopped to chat  amp  ask us if everything was OK and if we were enjoying our visit  Indeed all the staff were equally attentive  amp  helpful To sum up  this hotel is what many hotels aspire to but because of limited  amp  untrained staff  nearly always fail  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 
N =>  Allright I can t really say anything too bad about this hotel  The location is superb and so is the staff  However  we found it quite difficult to sleep there due to the noise  We had a room on the seventh floor overlooking the main room and the noise of the cars  sirens and honks at night time was unbearable  I would expect a   star hotel to have proper windows to isolate the noise but unfortunately this was not the case  The pilows were also quite bad  paper thin  so I had to call reception to get new ones  The size of the room and bathroom was quite small for a   star hotel but good enough for London  The overall impression would not be very good if the hotel were not in London  but in this case it was  so i d recomend it  
N =>  nightmare       it was the first time we stayed at the athenaeum and we will never come back again  we will rather advise everyone not to visit your hotel at all    when i called the hotel directly i was  quot welcome quot  by switchboard who didnt even say any name  when i had asked speaker about her name  she said  quot i said it jet  Meg speaking quot  she sounded as she was forced to do so  at last she had transfered me to the resevation department where i had very nice conversation with Kinda who made the booking very efficiently informing about all facilities provided  i thought it was over  but when we got to the hotel  we had been waiting for checkin in for   mins before indian guy who was doing something asked if we would like to check  in fact there was noone else  that was like a nighrmare  very poor customer service  we both work for abn amro and we will inform our department 
N =>   WIll NOT return to the Athenaeum Hotel When I booked this hotel I thought it would be just like any other   star hotel  especially for the price   but I had a rude awakening  Check in went without a problem  When I got to my room  it was dirty  smelled dank and was just not what I had expected  My friend was   rooms away and his room had stains on the carpet  bedspread and curtains  We tried to get him a new room  but the staff told us they were completely booked and offered no solution  I stayed for   weeks with a group of friends  we ended up with a total bill of just under          US    Those who stayed in the apartments absolutely loved their rooms  They were well furnished  very clean  had private entrances  kitchenettes and washing machines in the apartment  Any call to room service was answered immediately  The rest of us who stayed within the hotel building experienced awful room service  Any time we tried to get information from the concierge  the two men at the desk would just joke amongst each other and give us half answers  we didn t know until the last few days of our trip that we were so close to the royal palace  literally a   minute walk   The front desk was also of very little help during our stay  I also mailed a very small box home to the US  it weighed   pounds  and was charged      US by the hotel  They told me that they had to pay for special currier service to get the package to the  international shipping center   I had already sent boxes home from various European cities at this point and knew that this was not the case One good point is that the hotel is located close to great shops and restaurants  The hotel restaurant was also very agreeable  We were in London again just   weeks later and changed all of our reservations from the Athenaeum to the Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park  which was absolutely fabulous    
N =>   Not Good  I cannot tell you how excited I was to stay at the Athenaeum having been there for afternoon tea the year before  but it was not good My husband and I paid for his parents and ourselves to stay over after going to see Spamalot  which was fab  We arrived at noon and our rooms were not ready  not a problem as we knew that check in was not until  pm  As we were booking in the receptionist answered the phone whilst attending to me  I found this very rude as she didn t even say excuse me When we go into our rooms they had very kindly given my Father in law a bottle of wine as it was his birthday  which was a nice touch  That s about the only positive The rooms need decorating now  The paint was peeling off  the wallpaper all marked and the rooms looked very shabby  Our room was better than my in laws but that s not really saying much  I put a cup of tea down on the side and the faux leather  plastic  metled and left lovely ring marks       classy Afternoon tea and cocktails  although pricey  were good When we got back from the Theatre at about   pm we went to my in laws room for a drink  The people next door were having some kind of a rave    not good  and not what I d expect from a    hotel  Aiya Napa  yes  I phoned down and they did send someone up to ask them to turn it down  They did      about    mins later the fire alarm went off  we were on the  th floor   So down we all went  We over heard that it had been set off by the same people next door  We then had to walk back up to the  th floor and then went to bed Air con very noisy but we slept unlike my in laws who were awoken at                    by the club dance music next to them  They did phone and someone did go up to ask them to stop      If they are causing this many problems why allow them to stay in the hotel  They didn t even ask if my in laws wanted to move rooms  the hotel was not full  We checked out early as they couldn t get back to sleep  Breakfast didn t tempt us at     each They did ask us if we enjoyed our stay and we told them what we had gone through  She did say that if we come back that it wouldn t happen again   possibly but at that kind of cost for the room  I ll go and find another    Hotel  
N =>   Rooms need updating I have had several enjoyable stays at this hotel in the past  but sadly this time was not so good We stayed in a Parkview room  which was clearly in need of refurbishment  The chairs were stained  as was the headboard and the room in general was quite grubby We were also unimpressed by the cleaner knocking at the door at      to clean the room  we were only staying one night   The Lobby  Restaurant and Garden Room are all very nice and have been refurbished  We had a lovely evening meal and particularly enjoyed returning from the Theatre to have our dessert served to us in the garden room We would stay again  but only after the refurb  
N =>   Great location OK needs some updating My husband and I took our   kids      and     to London and Paris for spring break and after a ton of internet research settled on this hotel in London  While it s location was great it was sort of just OK as far as looks go  Could use some updating  chairs in room were worn thin on the arms nicked tables in the lobby  etc  That said it wasn t a bad experience just not exactly   star  Room was small which I would expect from UK but it was really small with a tiny bathroom  They had contacted us before we got there to say that we would need to upgrade      to a different room configuration because of the ages of our kids or split up and each stay in a room with them  We ditched the upgrade idea  but did  upon seeing the tiny size of our rooms  look into upgrading to an apt  when we got there  Way too much money so we just made do  Kids stayed in their room and were fine Shower was good  beds were comfortable  I was awoken one night to the sound of some guys business call next door so maybe not the quietest  Breakfast was outrageously priced but I have to blame the value of the US dollar for that one  Starbucks and M amp S foods down the street served us well for breakfast Common areas  bar and breakfast room   again need updating  Staff was pleasant but not altogether eager to please  Asked to see the room service menu while we were in the bar having a drink  to see if that s what the kids wanted to do  and it really threw the front desk girl for a loop as they didn t have any downstairs and she couldn t quite figure out a solution  other than me trotting up to the room to get it  which is what I was trying to avoid   Also asked us it we wanted a free newspapaer each morning  said yes and never got one for the whole stay    days However they did offer to keep the hot tub open longer after we went for a dip late in the day Great location  decent value given the prices in London  just don t expect luxury  
N =>   Great Hotel in Great Location Great Hotel room     on inside of building was very quiet  no traffic noise  Breakfast was beautifully done and perfectly cooked although pricey at      yes  it was worth it  Dinner was very good and reasonably priced     for   courses great value in a small intimate restaurant  Booked Hotel through www cheaperthanhotels co uk   this site seemed to have good value hotels that were a good price  unlike most that claim to do so Good service and welcoming in a small hotel  will be refurbished soon but rooms still to a very good standard  
N =>  Average   not a   star experience I booked a weekend break for myself  amp  my husband on lastminute com  I had originally chosen this as a possible hotel to book directly through their own website  However  having read the description on a top secret deal on last minute  it was blatantly obvious that this was the Athenaeum  There was a considerable difference in price and this was the only reason I booked with last minute com and not with the hotel direct  I phoned the hotel a few days prior to arrival to confirm that we were in fact booked in  I enquired as to whether our room was facing Green Park  I was told that such rooms were available but at a charge of     per night  I declined and took my chances  Our room was overlooking a side street  Down St  not much of a view  I have to say that I generally don t comment on these sites but felt that having read previous reviews  upgrades seem to be dished out in a somewhat haphazard manner  Seems to be the luck of the draw on the day or who shouts the loudest  Our room was a standard double  ok for what we paid I guess  but it had a long way to go to being   star  Our double bed was   single mattresses pushed together  disappointing  The room was pleasant and clean  bathroom also clean  Toiletries are Neutrogena  not   star products  Rooms are cleaned every day which is great  We accepted the offer of a complimetary newspaper which we didn t receive on the first day  I would normally be someone who would voice an opinion when a product or service wasn t up to standard  however  as I booked with last minute at a price lower that the hotel charge  I felt I wouldn t be within my rights as such  Location wise  the hotel is so central which I was delighted with  I didn t eat in the hotel so couldn t comment  We did have a drink in the hotel bar one evening  pricey but pleasant  Staff very courteous in this area but at check in I found lady quite curt  I wouldn t stay again in a standard room  I feel I maybe would have had a vastly different experience had I paid over the odds and booked with the hotel  
N =>  Post Christmas treat ath the Athenaeum I was very excited to find a deal at the Athenaeum hotel which I ve tried to get into for a couple of years  It s location is spot on being just opposite Hyde Park    Check in Rather surprisingly for a private hotel check  in was done in the usual queuing up way and we were served by a pleasant  young lady who unfortunately answered the phone at the  same time which I usually find rather annyoying but I was distracted by a huge jar of jelly babies which took my mind off it    We were given a complimentary upgrade to a room on the  th floor with outstanding views of the park and also as it was my husband s birthday a free bottle of wine from the General Manager  All the staff were extremely gracious    The or is pleasant and light and airy and two comfortable  chairs by the window was a thoughtful additon as we were ablel to relax instantly drinking our wine and watching the  sun go down    The concierge service was reliable and helpful  and we only  have a couple of niggles about the hotel  We were offered a  complimentary newspaper which was not delivered to our room   however we were given one to take home with us when this oversight had been noticed  There was no milk for tea or coffee in the rooms either and when we went to retreive our luggage after a weary morning around the King Tuk exhibition there was a mixup and a long delay before it was found which meant we were in a huge rush to get across London for our  train  Overall we enjoyed the hotel and would stay there again if the price was right   but I wouldn t pay rack rate for it  We usually stay aat the Langham in London  and if you can get an executive room there then I still prefer it  but it made a nice change  
N =>   Falls well short of  star standard I booked a standard double at the The Athenaeum  London through Lastminute com  quot Top Secret quot  deal  This is my   th booking with Lastminute top secret deals and this first time i have been disappointed  and boy did this hotel disappoint  This  star Hotel fell well short of the mark  I d rate it as a run down  star at best  I didn t experience any of the quoted  quot excellent service quot    quot luxury surroundings quot   etc  The rooms are run down and poorly equipped  Service is unhelpful and frosty On arrival i was greeted and allocated room      This was a standard double  the room did not have  quot timeless views of Green Park quot  but rather depressing views of a side street and convenience store  The room was extremely small including a very small bed which was old  lumpy and hard  the hotel web site quotes them as being hypnois beds  The furniture far from being  quot quintessentially English  but distinctly modern in its richness quot  was just old and worn  it couldn t even have passed as being  quot rustic quot   The bathroom although marble and mirrored was tiny as well  the receptionist who was showing me around had to wait outside as there was no room for both of us to fit in  I have never stayed in a  star hotel where the bathroom was equipped with a half size bath with shower over it and a shower curtain  The white towles supplied throughout the stay were old and thread worn  The soft furnishings and carpets are also in need of upgrading  I informed reception that Room     was unsatisfactory and requested they move me to a different room  They offered to show me Room      an executive room  this  quot upgrade quot  would come at an additional charge of     vat  amp  tax per night  On negotiation with the Duty Manager he agreed to waive the fee on this occasion  but did spend   min arguing with me first about my  quot unreasonable quot  expectations of a  star Hotel for the price paid  He insisted Lastminute com must be advertising the wrong description  I was under the impression star ratings are awarded to a Hotel as a whole not to certain  star rooms within a lower grade establishment  I had no choice but to move to Room      This room although larger than the first it was still the same poor standard as the previous  The bath and shower were exactly the same size  The bed size was increased by pushing two single mattresses together and covering with a sheet only a single duvet was on the bed  pulled tightly to cover both mattresses  needless to say we had some fighting for the covers throughout the two nights  There were no Tea or Coffee making facilities in the room  but is does have a tiny extremely overpriced mini bar  which was not re stocked throughout our stay  Budget       for a can of cola  No complementary drinks etc are provided  On the evening of the first night they provided a turn down service  but not on the second evening  The Reception staff  amp  Concierge are unfriendly and did not make our stay anymore pleasant  There was no concierge working on the Saturday night on our return from dinner  On each occasion we asked for a taxi we were informed that there were none available and to  quot flag quot  one down on the main road  We choose to cancel our reservations for dinner and beauty treatments and take our business elsewhere so therefore am unable to provide a review of these services  My advice would be to book with The fair or the Millennium fair for quality and service  I have stayed with these hotels on several occasions in the past  This hotel is NOT reflective of its  star status  
N =>   Expected so much got so little Booked as part of a theatre package from lastminute  The hotel fell far short of being  star   our room was not ready for us some two hours after the check in time  They also demanded      off me before checking in as a deposit  even though i had paid for room already   this is something not advertised at the time of booking  When in the room the private bar was half empty as it had not been restocked and most of the food in the private bar was between    weeks out of date  I tried to complain at the time but the lady who came into the room could not speak a word of english  Got the wrong newspaper  breakfast really was not worth the cost  Definately not a five star      Could write so much more that was wrong with this hotel but cannot be bothered  
N => 	star all the way We booked a theatre break through last minute  The hotel was wonderful  We were initally put in a very small room overlooking the air conditioning vents and I was a little disappointed  We settled into the room but could not work the TV  A quick call to reception and we had someone with us quickly  We were then moved to a different room that had the views I was looking forward to  Room       We were overlooking Green Park and could see the London Eye to our left  Lovely views at night and much bigger than our first room  Overall the staff couldn t do enough for you  the surroundings were luxrious and location was fantastic  Definately recommended for a romantic getaway  
N =>   over all good but some improvements needed We stayed in a  quot classic suite quot  which we had booked through last minute under their top secret hotels  We had already worked out which hotel it was before we booked and had stayed there several years ago before the refurb Because it was a suite it was extremely spacious and even had a seperate dressing room and huge bathroom  We paid     pds for a night  A few things marred the stay though  we arrived early so were happy to go out for a few hours and have some lunch while our room was made ready for us  Unfortunately we still had problems when we arrived back well after the checking in time  We had to wait in reception while it was confirmed whether our room was ready or not still It was a nice suite overall but the coffee table had something sticky on it and the edges were very dusty still  The carpet was also stained in the seating area  Not really what you expect when you are paying     a night  My husband did inform reception as we were also expecting a park view but as the hotel was full they sent up a bottle of champagne which was a nice touch  The room was clean otherwise but some of the furniture seemed a little tired  The lighting was rather confusing too Location is excellent and the door man is very friendly and helpful We were due a complimentary paper but never received it  We only had one bathrobe Overall we enjoyed our stay but will probably try somewhere else next time  
N =>   lovely view from atiny room feels like an old hotel thats been renovated to look trendy  when staying in london i much prefer the soho hotel  
N =>  Very nice Stayed for one night in il  Very helpful and pleasant receptionist who showed us to our room as showed us where everything was  Had a standard room  we were offered an upgrade when we got there but decided to stick with what we had  It didn t have much of a view but we weren t there for that  Room wasn t massive but it was nicely decorated as was the bathroom which had a very powerful shower The spa was small but just what we needed  really powerful jets in the spa pool The door staff friendly and helpful We didn t eat there as we were going to a do  also the breakfast was too expensive for us Its about a five minute walk from Green Park tube station Overall we were very pleased with this hotel as we had spent ages looking at hotels to stay in London that didn t have bad reviews and break the bank  we got a good deal with lastminute com  
N =>   Pleasantly surprised Booked a standard room for one night through Lastminute com for       without breakfast   Upon check in we were offered an upgraded room at an additional cost but chose not to as our standard room was very pleasant and the facilities sufficient for our short stay  Having previously lived in London for years  we didn t care that we did not have a view  The room was modern in decor  the bathroom clean and facilities good although the space was rather small  We enjoyed drinks in the bar during the afternoon and late evening  Pricey as expected  All staff we encountered were very pleasant and professional  Our only gripes would be a lengthy check in  perhaps because of booking through Lastminute com   our double bed made from two singles was uncomfortable in the middle and the unpleasant strong lemon smell on our fourth floor  The location is fantastic  This hotel warrants a good   star  It is certainly not a   star  We would definitely return  
N =>  Disappointed Booked for one night whilst visiting London to see Sound of Music  Was originally going as a couple  but my wife was ill so we changed the booking from one room to two so my Daughter could go with me instead  Changing the booking was great  I had booked on line with Airmiles for our room  I rang the Hotel direct for the second room and they were excellent in helping us out and gave a great rate Arrival was excellent  particularly the porter staff  they took the car away  sorted the bags etc  but the the reception and bar area are so small  We went for a quick drink and were asked to sit down in a very smokey smoking area and left for ages until our drinks were brought  A nice Oriental girl was doing her best but other Staff were disinterested We went to the rooms which were fine but struggling to be five star  we have stayed at the Landmark in London on several occasions and that is what a five star should be Went out to our Show  came back in at    and the bar may as well have been shut  very little ambience or character and this on a Saturday evening Sunday breakfast very disappointing   had to wait a long time for a table  again in the smokey bar area  and then when eventually taken to table had to wait ages for food  Generally service for the whole meal was poor unfortunately and definitely not five star  the staff whilst friendly were struggling to cope  To sum up  we shouldn t have booked this Hotel  knowing the Landmark and how excellent it is  but we got a deal through airmiles and let costs rule us by mistake  We won t make this error again  
N =>  lovely private hotel We were very impressed with our Executive Room we stayed  It was very nicely decorated in blue  The only down side was the toiletries   Neutrogena  yes  Boots sell them   They should change it to more upmarket products  
N =>  Could bit a little better Was taken here by my girlfriend  The location is great  opposite Green Park  I found the room a little small  but it had every thing you could need  It had a few nice touches like a choice of pillows  The bed was very comfortable  I don t think the hotel is really a   star hotel  The staff weren t really up to scratch  our bill was wrong and it took a waitress three attempts to get my bar order right  all I wanted was a large bottle of water   The spa was small  but I thought is was good none the less As with most   star hotels these days  they tell us they really want us to enjoy our stay  but insult us by charging     for a KIt Kat and       for a bottle of water  
N =>   Great rooms Great rooms   excellent afternoon tea   very convenient location A place I have returned to on several occasions Recommend 
N =>   A great choice  We recently stayed here for the first leg of our honeymoon and after a year of hectic planning  were so grateful to stay somewhere we felt not only accommodated  but well taken care of  From the congratulatory welcome gift upon our arrival to the concierge with a wonderful sense of humor and desire to help make our stay in London memorable  we felt as though anything we needed was already anticipated  The hotel s location in close proximity to Buckingham Palace  Green Park and the Underground made for an easy orientation to exploring London  Upon return  we even received a hand written thank you letter from the hotel manager  Definitely recommend  
N =>  Good location but expensive We stayed in two apartments affiliated with the hotel in the building next door  Apartments have all hotel services included with the bonus of kitchenettes and living rooms  We found the hotel location to be good  with many restaurants and interesting shops in walking distance and a bus stop right near the hotel  at the Hard Rock Cafe  which was a convenient way to travel to the South Kensington museums  Most theaters were in walking distance  albeit a long walk  which turned out to be a godsend when finding evening taxis proved impossible one night  The hotel and apartments had good AC  which was wonderful during London s broiling heat wave  We ate several times at the hotel  both room service and dining room  and were pleased with food quality and service  Housekeeping was good  and would even wash any dishes we left in our kitchenette  We also liked the bathroom showers     they worked well  Negatives  Well  the fussy British decor in the apartments was not to my taste  Apartments differ in style and we drew two with Victorian floral drapes and such  Not my cup of tea  But for someone else  that look might be perfect  The elevator in the apartment building was small  able to hold only a handful of passengers  We often chose the stairs  even though we were quite a few flights up  Overall  the hotel seemed awfully expensive  even at the special pound for dollar rate we paid  Also  and this is a minor point  the bathrooms are too small to have towel heaters in them  Several family members had minor burn accidents on the heaters     nothing serious  just annoying  Finally  we were disappointed with the very small size of the kitchenettes  Way too small to do any cooking of consequence  Even breakfast was hard to produce in such cramped quarters  The appliances could be tricky for Americans to figure out too  but to me that s part of the fun of travel    All in all  I would stay here again  especially if I could get a good discounted room rate  
N =>   its ok well  nothing really wrong with the hotel but was bit dissapointed as it was listed as   star  the side view of the hotel is very rundown and looks a bit    s office block  still the room was in good condition but quiet small  it was pleasant but didnt offer the five star polish which was dissapointing  it was our first wedding anniversary and we stayed at the peninsula hotel in new york for our wedding and so i wanted to recreate that glamour for our annivesary and it didnt really come off for us  i think i agree about the lack of true   star hotels in london  the prices are simular though  dont order breaksfast it was awful  presentation was lovely but american pancakes looked and tasted more like burnt hash browns  i got the strong impression it was cooked in lard      for breakfast  for two     for a sandwich      even i have moments of madness and order these things but the quality of food is just not present  bath robes where terrible quality so in conclusion  friendly staff  good location  clean but lousy food and dont expected it to be five star quality 
N => Have to agree with the last opinion on this hotel  it is NOT a five star It is an adding on review on the last review on this hotel  I am writing this  especially for those  who have no idea of this hotel  since it is not well known  but claims to be a five star one  and are sort of made to stay at this hotel with expectation for a five star hotel  If so  I would not recommend this hotel  We did not intend to stay at this hotel at all  but as it was during the easter holiday  and all other hotels we were looking were booked out  Our travel agent recommended this from a catalogue  adding he had never heard of this hotel  as being the only available one at that time  We traveled with our little baby  so class and comfort were very important  We paid about     Euro per room around     BP   stayed five nights there  so at the end it was not that pricy  especially after having known this hotel  If the quality of the hotel in terms of the service  staff etc was up to the claimed level  the money was certainly well spent  but it was not  As described below  it was not that clean  old and shabby  And the staff were   compared with my experiences at Ritz  amp  riott s   far away from the five star  One example from many  our neighbours were quite loud throughout the night  they were fighting all the time  and we found that very disturning  but were so polite  so just hoped that they would calm down  Well  even the last night of our London trip  where we had to get up   a m next morning  they were fighting so loud that we could not sleep  So I called the reception and brielfy explained the situation  Guess what happened  the young lady did not know what to do and asked me instead  quot so what can I do for you  quot   There were some elements of five star hotels  e g  morning newspaper service  but either you are a five star or not  In my opinion  it is not a five star  Perhaps     If you find a real pricy room and do not mind about the class much  then go for it  the location is quite good   but  for me personally  I do not think we would stay there again  even at a much lower price  
N =>  Wonderful Hotel We booked on lastminute and got a very good rate  We knew in advance that the first floor was being refurbished but it did not really affect us  there was work going on at the weekend but very little noise in any case   The room was beautifully decorated and had a stunning view over Green Park We didn t have breakfast but went to the Spa in the morning  Very nice way to start the day  Looking forward to having an excuse to returning to this hotel  
N =>  Lovely  Stayed four nights in ember  and I must say it was a very welcome change to the shabby Bayswater hotels I usually end up staying at in London  Booked through lastminute com  at a great rate  Got free upgrade to executive room because of boyfriend s Birhtday  Lovely spacious room  bed ditto  Adored the heated towels in the bathroom  Spa was gorgeous  though small  but no one seemed to use it  so got it all to ourselves  Great location  central but still quiet at night  Only minus is I never saw anything to the promised Champagne upon check in    
N => Perfect place for elderly and wealthy people My parents sent me to London for five days as a graduation gift  I went there with my boyfriend  I was    years old then and he was     We probably should have picked a more modern hotel like the St  tin s Lane or the Sanderson out of the five star category  because the Atenaeum is rather for older people or just for the upper class  Sure  everything was fine  but we felt wrong in this place cause it was too perfect and posh  First we had to deposit a credit card which we didn t have  so we had to give them lots of cash which we actually took with us for shopping  not for leaving it at the hotel all the time  I think a real   star hotel should treat every guest equally  that s what makes it   star The staff looked at us as if we were strangers because we obviously weren t as wealthy as the other people there Also  the breakfast was so tiny and consisted of only some fruit  anything else we wanted costed a fortune Next time in London  we will definitely go to an other hotel  
N =>   Not bad  Not Great  Stayed at this hotel for a week in e  Friendly staff  Nice location  My room was ok  Bath was small  Bed was comfortable  Elevators are small  This is not a bad choice if the price is right  
N =>  Standards are slipping I have stayed at the Athenaeum many times over the past ten years  I have been a big fan of the hotel  This stay  however  I noticed some significant changes  The front desk staff is now largely foreign  and that leads to some language problems in communicating  They are nice enough  but not as responsive as one would expect  The housekeeping staff  which used to be flawless  is not quite up to snuff either  Some cherry pits which were sitting on a plate in our room were not picked up at turndown  and were left until the next morning  The rooms are well kept  but in the apartments  the kitchen and the bathroom are beginning to show their age   appliances had some problems and the bathroom is looking a little worn  The kitchen and bath have not changed in ten years  Some elements of the Athenaeum are as good as ever   the doormen and bell staff have been there forever  and they are wonderful  especially James  The concierge staff is good  We had problems with the billing for our room  as they attempted to charge a rate fifty percent more than had been quoted on their website  This problem was cleared up  but made for an unpleasant end to our stay  We have loved the Athenaeum  but they need to get on top of some problems which could lead to the loss of their reputation  For these prices  things need to be close to perfect  
N => Not quite   star Spent one night in the Athenaeum  got a good deal from Thomas Cook       per double   Staff was very friendly and on arrival we were upgraded to an Executive room  The room was spacious  not much of a view   th floor  but unfortunately it was not very clean  dust all over the place and hair in the bath  Certainly not acceptable for a    hotel  Breakfast was OK but again nothing special Used to stay in the Royal Park Hotel      and I must say that there is not much of a difference between the Royal Park and the Athenaeum  
N =>   pampered Not cheap  but worth every penny  This is a hotel that really does try to  go the extra mile   We had a very enjoyable week end  in a lovely room overlooking Green Park  made even more pleasurable by the overall welcome  a glass of champagne poured as we checked in    to the friendliness and professionalism of all of the hotel staff we encountered  The hotel itself is very well situated for shopping   near to Bond Street and Jermyn Street  and not too far from Knightsbridge  and also only a relatively short distance from the theatrical ares and other tourist locations such as Buckingham Palace River Thames  Breakfast was not cheap but the quality was excellent and if you want to eat elsewhere there a plenty of good locations nearby  Try it   
N =>  A  Hotel Stayed here over the easter weekend for   nights through a great deal on Last Minute  Upon arrival we was upgraded to a   bedroomed apartment in the adjacent street  wow  amazing apartment  The staff at the hotel were great from start to finish  very friendly Great location across the road from Green Park    mins walk to Buckingham Palace    mins walk to Green Park tube station  and    mins walk to Piccadily Circus  A bit pricey in the hotel itself for food and drink  but not as excessive as other hotels of this standard  Breakfast     but excellent  room service breakfast     as well  Pop into the whiskey bar      different whiskeys to choice from Would certainly reccomend this to anyone  
N =>   Not a   star   star at best Just spent an evening here after much fuss  I was referred by a top executive of a Fortune     firm and told to book their negotiated corporate rate  The reservations staff rebuffed my oral request and demanded a written one  I complied only to be told that such request must be on XYZ s corporate letterhead or from an email ending        My company also has negotiated rates and no hotel we use places such burdens on our guests  After another email to reservations they referred my correspodence to XYZ company s regional travel manager to verify my identity and request  Finally  they reserved me a room  This experience was insulting and I was treated like a second class swindler Check in was polite and gracious allowing me to have a room before noon  The room was small  carpets dirty and worn  and the street noise was both obvious and annoying  The bed was well made but too short for a   foot tall person  The bathroom was small and showed signs of wear  The soundproofing between rooms and the hall was non existent  A housekeeper opened my door without knocking  twice  Later a welcome letter and piece of fruit was delivered  sadly they were addressed to somebody else I utilized the concierge once for a dining reference  he chatted away on the phone without acknowledging my presence for     minutes  The conversation he had was personal and subject matter crude at times  His chirppy voice filled the small lobby and his wannabe snob  quot look at me I am so special quot  attitude was pothetic and irritating  He fancied himself a rich patron not a service provider The only positive I found in this hotel was its location across from Green Park and the service extended by the front desk  Everything else  at these prices and a   star rating  is lacking  
N =>  Prepare yourself   not a rave review   We stayed at the Athenaeum Hotel on a weekend deal with lastminute for      p p  in ruary       We were really looking forward to experiencing the   Star luxury talked about in most of the reviews   I would have to say the hotel was fine for a weekend break but not deserving of such adulation  We obviously got one of the rooms used for cheap deals  described by a previous reviewer  as it was small and had a view over a back alley  The bed was a real feather bed and was so comfortable but it was short and our feet did hang off the bottom  The location is upmarket but dead at weekends  we couldn t get a beer after      pm and there were no shops nearby for a friend to buy cigarettes   Checking out on Sunday morning  the receptionist produced a bill for two breakfasts which was something around      I think  I was so shocked I didn t really look at the actual figure  I was just trying to work out how a hotel of this standard can allow this to happen  We certainly didn t have the breakfasts so someone had given our room number and got free food  I felt I had to defend our integrity and showed my signature was nothing like the squiggle given by the person receiving the food  It was horrible feeling like because we were on a special rate  we would be dishonest  The couple with us stayed in the identical room above us and had their bag rummaged through and left open but thankfully they had used the safe  The hotel did the job for the rate we paid but that is it  Kensington or Knightsbridge is more suited for a shopper s weekend  
N =>  The Only Place You Should Stay Simply wonderful  From the moment of arrival to the moment we left  everything was just how a five star hotel should be We got a fantastic rate of just     through Superbreaks AND this made no difference when we arrived at the hotel We caught the first train to London and arrived at the hotel      on a Saturday morning but we were shown to our room immediately To be honest  because we had booked at a discounted rate  we expected this to be reflected in the standard of our room  How wrong could we have been  The room had views of Green Park  was a good size and most importantly was clean   a rarity in London these days   visit Le Meridien Piccadilly or the Hampshire if you doubt my words As with all hotels its the little details that matter   a nightly turn down service and a card left on your bed with the weather forecast for the following day   If you are looking for a hotel in Central London that dedicates itself to customer service then look no further and book your stay at the Athenaeum and if you re lucky you ll find yourself sharing breakfast with a movie star  We did  From now on  whenever we stay in London  it will be at the Athenaeum  
N =>  Wonderful Staff I stayed at the Athenaeum from      to           The staff made me feel welcome immediately  which I very much appreciated when I arrived in my jet lagged state  My room was on the small side  but had all the comforts I expected and a few little luxuries as well  A terrific experience

N =>  HORRIBLE PLACE We arrived at      paid the full amount for the   rooms we booked  went upstairs see our rooms and god they are bad  our room was meant tobe a   bedded Non smoking room  we arrived and a ash tray and a cigerette buts were all outside  the room smelt damp  but as so hot we went and had a bath  there were no towels when we got out  so my husband went and asked for some  to be told the laundry had not arrived today   saturday  meaning no towels and the beds were not changed  the other rooom  which was a double had a single bed in it  and one small towel  the bed was also stained  we complained and wanted to leave with full refund  But No they charged us         for taking a bath  and we are still waiting for the         extra we paid  Never again  the place should be shut down discusting  
N =>  They let themselves down We arrived at     pm to find our room was not ready  They had  lost  the housekeeping keys and wanted us to depart without our room keys  leaving our possesions behind  We got back around      pm to find we couldn t get to our room the way we d been shown as there was a wedding going on  We were told to go outside and enter through another door which we did not know about  The plumber then showed us right around the building to a completely separate entrance we had not been informed of  Thankfully when we got back to the hotel there was still someone around or we would never have known how to get in  The shower did not work properly  Breakfast was late and was only toast and tea  I had advised of my daughter having a gluten intolerance but there was no acknowledgement of this made  The road noise kept me awake most of the night too  The room was adequate and cheap   we could have enjoyed our stay had the staff been more organised  I really feel that the previous reviews of people going the extra mile and being willing to help gave me a high expectation of customer service that was just not there  I was really disappointed with the experience  
N =>   Just avoid it adent unpleasant filthy with personnel accurately uninterested in customers  The room we got  number   at the ground floor  was so tiny we could barely move The wallpaper was peeling off the wall the heater stincked the carpet full of dirt Noisy for something that seemed to us the underground passage of trains or something similar  We had no shower soap  so I asked the receptionist for some He answered me they don t provide any Can you beleive it   He astonished me more when he candidly advice me to step outside for buying it  in a newsagent     yards away  They sponsor themselves as a three star rating hotel  but they deserve not even one star The breakfast is served in the basement At my first breakfast scramble eggs were served cold  the second time it was ok And advice to whoever is planning to travel to London If you find that all places in London show the  quot no vacancy quot placard except for the Athena hotel  the obvious reason is that hotel has spoiled many travellers  hope  
N =>  Worst Hotel Ever I am a regular traveller to London   I have to say   this is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in The rooms smelt fusty and were dirty  There were dirty stains up the wallpaper and on the outer bedding  Sash Windows did not fully close   heating did not work  Very noisy and cold all night We complained to staff about the rooms  we were shown an alternate room which was just as bad  They offered to move us accross the road   after a phone call this was not possible  When we checked out in the morning the night porter was asleep  we had to wake him to aks for a receipt  No receipts available   provided postage address   still waiting   Full of tradesmen   not suitable for families or anyone else  I would not recomend this hotel to anyone  
N =>   Clean but decor looking tired Made unexpected arrival at reception  we were only staying for one night and wanted to drop our overnight bags  whilst we went out for lunch then on to the theatre  The receptionist made us very welcome and checked on availability  the room was ready so we checked in immediately We paid     for the room which we thought reasonable for London  Yes the decor was a little tired  there was no chair to sit on had we wanted to or bath and washbasin plugs so SHOWER or SHOWER was the order of the day The staff were very pleasant and a tasty English breakfast made and served to order  
N =>  Would never go back We booked this hotel in uary of this year to bring    people with over half being aged between    and     We visited the hotel a week before our stay and the owner was very helpful showing us every room that we would be using  We were very happy when we left with the booking  On arrival the young man at the desk was unsure as to why some of our pupils and staff had been put in the hotel opposite  which was not acceptable for safety reasons  The hotel opposite was of a very poor standard  We then spent nearly two hours trying to find suitable beds for our party  Some of the other guests were having a party in their room which the man on the desk attended  The party kept everyone awake until about  a m  This hotel is a great location for the station but the rooms smelt of smoke  breakfast was very slow and we had to ask for things as they ran out  I would not recommend this hotel for the simple reason that I wouldn t trust that what you have booked  is what you are going to get  
N =>   Will not stay there again  We had actually booked the Gower Hotel opposite  but on arrival we were sent to the Athena Hotel by the unfriendly receptionist  without explanation She assured us the Athena was actually three stars instead of the Gower s two  Having seen the inside of the Gower  we were only too happy to go  So to the Athena we went  where we were greeted by another monosyllabic receptionist and given the key to Room     I know we were only paying     but we expected the room to be clean and it wasn t  I have attached some photos which really don t do it justice  it was much worse than it looks The carpet was absolutely filthy  and had dark grey    quot  wide border of dirt around the skirting board  which blended nicely with the paint blobs and unidentifiable stains the rest of it was patterned with     The wallpaper was peeling off the walls and the net curtains looked as thought they had never been washed  and were the same dark grey as the carpet  The bed was pushed right up against the window so we had to tie the nets in a knot to stop them falling over us in the night  The bedding was actually surprisingly clean considering the rest of the room  it was just a shame the sheets had holes in them  The bathroom however  was fairly clean although the toilet had brown stains in it  We would have complained but the surly receptionist had disappeared when we went back downstairs  and to be honest from the state of the place I m not sure they would have had anything better anyway  When we went down for breakfast in the morning we were studiously ignored by both the serving staff for about   minutes until we managed to corner one of them and ask where we were supposed to sit  The breakfast was ok  no complaints for the money but they didn t come back to see if we wanted tea or coffee  So a hugely disappointing experience and we were always prepared for a very basic room because of the cost but not the dirt or staff attitude  There was no   star rating signage anywhere on view in the Athena nor did the Gower across the road display their supposed two star rating We have friends who run a a three star hotel and they would have their rating taken away if they had the nerve to give customers a room like this  
N =>  zero stars Whe just back in holland from a four day stay in that terrible hotel  bath whas broken  cold water  holes in wooden floor   no ventilation at all sticking hot   bad service in the absurt dining room at the basement level  no stars whe say   
N =>  No hot water We booked   nights  no hotwater from the first day we arrived after    hours on the plane  We were promised it would be fixed  that day we gave them until the  rd day we received no compensation for our stay  fortunately we moved across the road to a wonderful place called the Darlington Don t even consider staying at the Athena Hotel  
N =>  Never again We stayed in this hotel december       We booked a room with a safe  but we did not have any safe in our room  or even at the reception On our first morning during breakfast all our photo equipment was stolen from our room The hotel staff didnot want to provide us with the telephone number of the local police or help us out in any other way  The only thing they did was accuse us  falsely  of not having properly locked our room When we returned to this room some hours later the door was not locked by the hotel personnel and all the lights were turned on  A  nd try for our pasports and money This hotel never ever again After a lot of complaining they offered us a hotel at the other side of the street  We declined after seeing the rooms  closets  and discovering the cockroaches So be warned  
N => not friendly We are just back from London         And we stayed in the Athena hotel  Our room was clean enough to stay there  The carpets were dusty the wallpaper was peeling from the walls  basically the rooms were just given a quick   minute clean per day  we stayed there for five nights the bedding was never changed during that time and the towels only once Upon arrival we were greated by a friendly english speaking guy  But the rest of the time the owner and the rest of the staff were very unfriendly and not at all welcoming  Unless you are there nationality  greek i think  The breakfast is not worth having it consisted of a rasher of bacon  a suasage and an egg all of which was cold There are lots of hotels on the same street to choOse from and if i was you i would choose another making sure it is not from the same owner as this one as they own three hotels here 
N =>  Smaller is Friendlier I ve stayed twice at the Athena   just over a year apart   and they remembered us  and specifics about us   it was like visiting old friends  The rooms are clean and nicely decorated  The breakfast staff was extremely accomodating to our American needs  amp  desires  Overall a great place   to which we hope to return frequently  
N =>  Never again The Athena turned out to be the worst hotel of the at least    different hotels in   different WestEuropean countries  and in all price ranges  in which I stayed in      During the x mas holiday  on the first morning of our stay  while we were having breakfast  our room was burgled  and all our camera equipment stolen  Not a nice experience but it can happen This hotel didnot offer any sign of sympathie  didnot cooperate in any way  were even unwilling to call the local police   accused us of not having our door locked properly  which we showed that had  and when we returned in the evening it turned out that they themselves had even left the door of our hotelroom open and the lights turned on after having it cleaned during this same day They did not take responsibility for this and while we were trying to get another room the night porter let in a lady who didnot have a room there but said she was allowed to stay in this hotel with her husband without paying for    years  and   minutes later he offered the key of a wrong room to another guest We couldnot file a complaint  and were told all kind of tales  E g  the night porter is not allowed to call the manager in the evening  the night porter not having the telephonenumber  nor the mobile phonenumber  but eventually still calling   etc  etc  They couldnot provide us with another room since none were available  but half an hour a lot of rooms were empty  In the end they offered us a choice of three rooms in another hotel  of the same owner   one of which  their so calles suite  was a smokey romm of which the room could be lifted from the outside and one could hop in and out  another one even showed a running cockroach  so not exactly what we had paid for When refusing to stay here  and having found another hotel  with kind personnel and managers  they didnot want to check us out with the argument they did not have anything to do with us  only with our travel agency And so fort  and so fort Should you ever decide to stay at this hotel  make very sure never to leave anything in your rooms since the lockcan be flipped open from the outside very fast and simple  There is no safe in your room and no security system outside  allthough many hotels in the environment do possess such a system  
N =>   WORST NIGHTMARE I have traveled many places and have stayed in all types of accommodations  and the Avalon Hotel was the absolute worst place I have ever stayed in  It was worse than camping in a wet tent and more uncomfortable than sleeping in my car  Upon check in we were asked to pay immediately  I have learned from this experience to always ask to see a room before paying  We were in a room with two twin beds at the very top floor  To get there  we had to climb a very narrow staircase  where duct tape was literally holding one of the railings together  a serious safety issue  especially when climbing up the steep stairs with luggage   As we entered our room s hallway  I realized immediately we had made a terrible mistake  The wallpaper was stained and peeling as though the roof has a serious leaking problem  The ladder to the attic was hanging half way down in the middle of the hallway and we had to go around it so we wouldn t hit our heads and for some reason  there was a coffee pot sitting on the floor  When we stepped into our room  we found even worse things waiting for us  On each bed were two badly worn out towels and a bar of complimentary USED soap  USED    Both bars were unwrapped  with grey and cracking edges    the words imprinted on the soap were also worn down which is what happens to USED soap  The bedspreads were obviously unclean as there were pieces of dirt and other debris on them  The floor of the room was sinking in  and there were even weak places that felt like holes in the floor under the carpet  The carpet was not clean  more debris   and was terribly stained  There were   large mosquitoes flying around the room  The room felt damp and looked moldy  There was mold on the walls  especially toward the ceiling  The furniture had not been dusted or cleaned in sometime  The window would not open or close all the way properly  plus one pane had a huge crack hole in it   For some reason  there was a plate and fork sitting on the dresser    both of which did not look clean  The drinking glasses were also not clean  and one of them had dried toothpaste SPITTLE on it  The toilets  located across the hall  were just as bad    doors wouldn t shut all the way  the linoleum was badly bubbled  and the tile was missing off the walls and the walls were moldy  The room with the tub was even worse  very unclean and stained  Apparently there was a shower somewhere on our floor  but we didn t even bother investigating  When we asked for our money back  we were told that it would not be given back immediately  and the management would decide about giving it back later  through the course of the conversation  we were led to believe no money would be given back   We were told that we should not expect much more than what we got because we were paying budget hotel rates     pounds  which was approx       American dollars   The man was also not concerned about the used soap or unclean appearance of the room    said that he can t help what the housekeepers do or don t do  Bottom line  after a lengthy conversation  we realized it was either stay here or sleep on the streets  there were no other hotels in the entire Russell Square Euston Road area that had any vacancies    we checked  believe me    While all of the above is more than enough to send one running and screaming from an establishment  we were truly stuck  As if all of this isn t bad enough  I am pretty sure the sheets of my bed had not been changed after the last guest    the sheets smelled of cologne which I do not wear  We slept  or tried to sleep  in our clothes so little of our skin would touch the sheets  At daybreak we got up  grabbed our luggage  and got out of there  We left a note for management with our complaints and also asking for at least half of our money back  I doubt very seriously we ll hear anything back from those people  I am embarrassed to say that I even stayed at the Avalon Hotel because it made me feel dirty and itchy  It took me two days to get over the creepy crawly feeling  and I still feel like itching when I think about it  Long story short  don t stay here  I am wondering if London has a government department that declares certain public places  condemned   and if so  I m wondering why this place hasn t been investigated  the Avalon Hotel is dirty and creepy  but more importantly it is very unsafe what with the taped up railing and holey weak floors  
N =>   Roomy but Bizarre The rooms and facilities were much larger than those in other similarly priced London hotels  although the water pressure was sorely lacking and there was an overall neglected look  chipped paint  ripped wallpaper  duct taped carpeting on the stairs   They also somehow lost my reservation  although were able to come up with a room and then change me to another room the next day  The breakfast  while perfectly fine  was served by staff that were rather gloomy and brusque  The front desk was staffed by a revolving number of people  some of which were helpful but many others of whom seemed to be annoyed to have to deal with you instead of watching YouTube videos  For a few days  this is perfectly adequate  Just don t expect happy and attentive staff  as you are highly unlikely to get it  
N =>   avoid the place      worst staff ever I do travel a lot and i m not fussy at all  The hotel which is old and careless  bathroom with holes on the wall and if it rains the water gets inside   no hot water poor breakfast   the staff  beginning from the african lady at the reception who is always bored and rude to end with the head one of the breakfast room  The first one screamed at us once we checked in and asked about seeing our rooms before paying them   she said we could even go away if we didn t like the policy  another day one of us fainted in the room and we had to insist in asking them to call an ambulance as they wanted us to do it ourselves  This is really really bad  i was almost about calling the police as we were so scared and noone wanted to help  this staff couldn t be allowed to treat customers this way  never found any place this bad in our whole lives  AVOID AVOID AVOID                                                            
N =>  Needs Work  Again  looks are deceiving  My sister booked this one for us as well  She got it for    pounds       American Dollars  a night  If she had not booked this online  it would have cost     pounds a night  Not worth it  We had a triple room  which meant   twin beds  The beds were very clean and the bathroom was also very clean  I do have to say that the walls were horrible  the wallpaper was peeling off  There was no A C in the room but good thing we didn t need it because it was kind of chilly at night  We left the windows open and it was just right  This hotel is very old and needs a lot of work  The elevator  lift  was so small that only   person with their luggage could fit  It was my sister  my mom  and I and we all had to take turns going up to our room  I do have to say this room was larger than the Royal Lancaster Hotel Diana   Corpus Christi  TX 
N => the averard   average This motel was average  very old but i thought this added character and charm  The motel is very central  very close to public transport and a short walk to Hyde Park  The staff were always friendly  obliging and approachable  If you needed to know information about sites in London  and the staff were not sure then they would go out of their way to find out for you  nothing was a bother  
N =>   good price but that s it I was satisfied with the price   but that s about it   The carpets in the room was dirty and the room was allways extremely hot  even as the temperature outside was    degrees  and it was allmost impossible to watch the tv as it was so old  The bathroom was strange too as the toilet was crammed very closely between the wall and the bathtub  So close  that I had to be an acrobat to be able to releave myself  It was impossible to sit on the toilet in a proper way  I am an average person   The toilet was not properly screwed to the floor so I also had to make sure that it did not tip over  as it did once and the waterpipe went off   The reception area was ok and the day staff was friendly  I felt  however  that one of the night staff was quite unfriendly and suspicious  This made it quite uncomfortable when I came home late at night  On the good side I would however say that the breakfast was allright and the location is great  close to Hyde park and Paddington station   But  in conclusion  I will never stay at that hotel again  
N =>  It was great for us We had a very large room for   of us  bath was very large also  Newly redecorated and clean  Continental breakfast was good with some choices  full breakfast available for extra  Only complaint was inability to turn off heater  typical in old buildings  so had to have windows open which meant more traffic noise  No noise transfer from other rooms  Staff was mostly pleasant  Location was great  easy walk to Lancaster Gate  Queensway or Bayswater stations  We would definitely stay there again  Paid about   GBP per night for triple  
N => Past its prime Has all the possibilities of being an absolute gem  but this hotel is badly in need of some updating  Carpet on stairway is torn in several places  room we stayed in had very visible damage to wall  mattresses in bad shape  Our room was so warm we had to keep both windows open and put a chair in front of the radiator just to make it bearable  No adjustment valve on radiator  and staff was unable to help  Water in shower very hot also  cold water is a mere trickle  Toilet flush very weak  Staff ranges from very friendly to downright unpleasant  Breakfast ok  but drink the tea  coffee s thick  
N =>   Good hotel Good hotel  clean and recently renewed  Close to metro  
N =>  Awful Hotel in every way I am absolutely disgusted with the hotel it was awful in every way  when I entered in my room it was not only tiny  amp  dirty but was too hot and room location was just next to the elevator  You can imagine the noise level of my room  wall is thin and hotel building looks so old  everytime our room vibrate  We felt unsafe  uncomfortable and had the worst night sleep ever  and about the staff they do nothing but only just watch the televison all the time  Avni is the worst hotel I have ever had the misfortune of staying in 
N => Not worth staying This place is not worth staying in  Service is not existant  Place is reasonably clean but for the cost you can certainly get better  Breakfast is not bad but minimal  
N =>   Possibly the worst hotel ever The web site showed it as a clean contemporary hotel  The reality was far from it  First room that we were sent to had not been made up so allocated another room which had a kitchen of sorts and the smallest bed space imaginable  Smelt of microwave meals and was not clean  Walls patched up with filler in places and toilet dirty  Damp wall in kitchenette  It felt like a DSS hostel rather than a   star hotel No air whatsoever in rooms and windows difficult to open  Wife is asthmatic so in end decided we could not stay there and went round corner looking for alternatives  Found the Montana on Gloucester Road that was same price but clean and a proper   star hotel  
N =>   So So Smallest room I have ever seen in my life  No room for the suitcases  No security on our ground floor window  not that we were robbed but it disturbs your peace of mind  The blinds were broken  We had great warm weather while we were there which was great in general but in the hotel room there was no air conditioning and the front desk did not have any fans  We had to go and buy one   so they should have one now  I will say that the room was kept clean and well stocked  The continental breakfast was great  They had      varieties of cereal  toast  preserves  fruit  cheese  yogourt  croissants or buns  juice  milk  tea and coffee  The room did have a safe which was nice to put our passports in  TV only had   channels  The bathroom was very small with a pedastal sink  stand up shower and toilet  There was no place to keep your toiletries  No internet facilities  Though there was a cheap enough place just up the road  I would stay here again if I was going solo  but not with another person   it is just too small  
N => Pleasant enough  I stayed here with my mother for about a week when we visited London last il  We arrived at about    in the morning from the airport  check in wasn t until two but they tried their best to get us a room as soon as possible    I didn t have a good impression of them then  but it was my first time in London and I was tired and cranky so that s probably why  The room was clean  small but that is probably to be expected in that area of London  Everything seemed up to date  I got a good sleep  had some breakfast  served downstairs  continental  and went off to explore London  The closest tube station to the hotel is Gloucester  literally down the street   and shopping on Oxford street  museums  everything  were only a few minutes away so it was a great location  We would return  and a New Zealander in the lobby let us use his laptop  which was nice and I felt comfortable with the people who worked there as well  Most of the recent reviews so far seem bad  so maybe it has changed  I m not too sure  I m sure that if you are polite and not too uptight with the staff members than they will give you the same treatment  As for the temperature and the lighting and noise  it definitely was not as bad as other people have said  not in my room anyway  We did change rooms though once  because it wasn t smoke free and my mum is sensitive to that stuff  but it didn t seem to be a problem    they even offered us a bigger room later on in the week  
N =>   Not worth the money I booked this hotel thinking it would be a nice  affordable place in a great area  I knew the rooms would be small but I didn t mind I actually stayed here over a two week period  broken up by a brief trip outside of London During the first part of the stay  I was put into a first floor room  The room was roasting hot  even though this was at the end of tember and the weather was starting to cool   The ceiling light above the bed was partly to blame  I think  as it was extremely bright  Unfortunately I had to leave the light on as it was the only one in the room other than a dim Ikea table lamp  The television s cable did not work AT ALL  and they did little to fix it except to wiggle the cable and reset the reception settings for the hotel  It would have been nice to have seen the morning news to find out the weather forecast and Tube delays  The shower would leak onto the floor For the second part of my stay  I was placed into a room on the  rd floor  This room was cool  thankfully  Probably because the light above the bed didn t work  The TV worked fine in here  The shower door would not close properly so either you left it partially open or you managed to jam it so that you had to practically break the door to get out  Horrible layout of bathroom   the shower door kept hitting the toilet  The hot water would sometimes run out if you waited too late in the evening to take a shower  The power went out a couple of times during the evening  without any explanation from the staff  Couldn t get the radiator to work one day when it became very chilly outside  the staff member who came up to fix it didn t really know what he was doing  Requested someone to open the room safe more than once as it wasn t open when we entered the room  but no one ever showed up when we called Staff vary from somewhat helpful to  quot I don t care what your problem is  quot  You can check out and keep your luggage there  but it will be left in an open area of the lobby and unless you lock it to the bannister or a table  there is no guarantee that it will not walk away as someone won t always be there all the time to watch it The positives   fantastic  fantastic location near two tube stations and many restaurants  as well as grocery stores  but I wish I had gone to one of the other hotels nearby like base stay  Neighbourhood is quiet as it s a few blocks away from the noisier main streets  Beds were comfortable  if a bit narrow  Rooms were clean  however there seems to be only one maid for the whole hotel and if the poor woman was busy changing all the rooms for new guests then your room was last on her list  Discovered that she washed our room s dishes in the bathroom sink  without any dishwashing soap  Breakfasts were basic  toast  fruit  juices  tea  coffee  yogurt  horrible croissants   and was a nice way to have a quick bite and save a bit of money before starting the day  Saw people using the wireless internet on their own laptops  but you have to sit in the lobby to do so Basically  this place is one step up from a hostel but not a very far step  
N =>  This hotel is not recommended room      terribleThis hotel doesn t deserve more than   or         a very small room  while a medium sized room is mentioned  on the room door was hanging a floor map where our room is mentioned as a single room   a very hot room     C  even tough the central heating was turned off  impossible to open the window to ventilate the room    Heating is going though walls with no way to control it   no curtain at the window  nice to wake up at  am every day due to the heating and the day light while you are on holiday   the TV cable was cut so impossible to watch TV and the guy at the reception desk just said it won t be possible to fix it before we leave  really small bathroom  impossible to stand next to each other due to the tiny size of the bathroom  small bed      m   no cap in the sink  no view out of the window  opaque window    no light bulb at one side of the bed Some positive things though  rooms are clean  breakfast is good and situation is great  
N =>   Worst hotel I have ever stayed in I stayed at the Avni hotel in ruary      as I thought it was a cheap and convenient way to stay in London and visit friends in the area   however I quickly realised I was mistaken    the room was small  freezing cold and the heating did not work   when I moved the bed    cm to one side to be close to a lamp  only one lamp in the room which was very dark  there was so much dirt under the table  would be to impolite to describe what it was     I could not lock the door to my room  on ground floor so very uncomforting    the front desk staff and the manager  Sunil  were extremely rude and unhelpful when I asked about the possibility of getting another room  which I did not get     I checked out one day in advance and despite giving notice they still charged me All in all a very unpleasant experience which I would not recommend to anyone  Their cancellation charging practices are also unethical and I wish to see them out of business soon  
N =>   Do not stay here  Athough it might seem like an economical choice  I would highly suggest staying somewhere else  Here is a detailed list of the issues   Front desk was highly disorganiized  they were rude  and missed wake up calls  Each person seemed to have a different answer  and were not professional or welcoming  AT ALL    The walls are paper thin and you can hear EVERYTHING that the people staying next to you and above you are doing  Bathroom was dingy  extremely cramped  and toilet was nearly non functional   VERY  VERY SMALL  The safe was  quot running low on battery quot  so we could not store our valuables in it   I cannot stress enough how awful it was to TRY to sleep there  I hear every step the person above us took  every creek of the bed  and heard every word from the tv across the hall I have NOOO idea how this hotel got a review higher than a    and even though our hotel was miserable it couldnt ruin my trip  book another hotel  I recommend the Kensignton Gardens Hotel  which we moved to after a few night as the Avni  
N =>   There s a reason its so cheap     We stayed here for one night and that was more than enough  Our first room       curtain was missing  the TV was wired illegally  The front desk  was rude and disorgansed  Our second room       was a little better but had no key so we had to be let in and out by staff  The heating was far to hot  The bed side lamp was broken  so if you reached for it you cut yourself  We fixed this for them by thowing it out  There was previous occupants hair everywhere and the flooring was not fitted properly  The bed was itchy and uncomfortable  Breakfast room bar was damp  with peeling paint and very poor service  
N =>    day s weekend on london Went to London on a weekend and loved the city We ve stayed at Avni s Hotel and find the hotel very good  Well  it s not the Hilton or the Ritz but if you re gonna stay as much time as possible visiting London and all her monuments  you don t need that kind of hotels to stay The rooms are small but they have all you need  The breakfast is normal  but not Continental one s  with fresh fruit   srcumble eggs ou waffles  well  just enough to stay ok until lunch The service is also ok  On a   minutes walk you have the underground or bus stations  Picadilly circus or Hyde park Corner are   statios away Very nice to stay in london but not within the confusion of the big city  PB  Lisbon  Portugal  
N =>  Definitely would NOT recommend to anyone  Just got back from London and the only disappointment was the hotel   not like the description at all  The room was very small  the sink as well as the shower kept flooding so that you would have to turn off the water between and let it drain  Out of the   days  we were without hot water for    Every fixture in the bathroom was not level  so you could not store anything in there  Staff are not very accomodating  Rooms do not have a clock alarm so you would have to rely on the staff for wake up calls  Every time you left the hotel  you would have to hand in your room key  therefore having to wait for a staff member on your return to give you the key back Only good point  it is close to the underground  
N =>  Excellent location avoid hotel especially room      I have just arrived back after a   night stay at the Avni  Not a good choice  just glad i was out all day and evening  I was visiting my son and girlfriend who had just moved to S  Kensington  but as they only had one bedroom I decided to book into this hotel as it was only a couple of minutes walk away  I was given the key for room     but on entering the heat hit you a bit like stepping off a plane in a hot country   I asked if i could be moved but they said they had no more rooms as they were fully booked  I asked for a fan but they did not have one  not very helpful staff   After a sleepless night I was up and out of my room and the hotel by   a m  each morning  looking rather sweaty just like i had just stepped out of a sauna  Not how you want to look after a shower and putting your make up on   The window only opened a little bit at the top so no air could get in  Even the ceramic tiles on the bathroom floor were warm to walk on and the cold water tap ran hot for ages   definately a problem somewhere  On checking in i wasn t given any information regarding breakfast or where to eat it  so it was just as well i didn t want any   The only   was that it only cost     a night  so on a freezing winter s night the room would have been o k  All in all i would rather have spent      in a decent hotel for one night and slept on my son s sofa for     
N =>  Avoid this hotel like the plague  We have just arrived back from one nights stay at the Avni and were throroughly dissapointed with our experience  On entering our room we were immediatly struck by how hot it was  a bit like opening a piping hot oven door   The only air supply to the room was a window that opened to   quot  at the max  The hotel had provided us with a fan but this failed to do any more then blow hot air arond the room  Needless to say we did not get much sleep that night  Our experience was so bad that we decided not to hang around for breakfast the next day   this was to be served in the basement of the building  Heaven knows how sweaty it was going to me down there The only positive thing about the Avni is its location which was brilliant  There are plenty of bars and restaurants in the vicinity which is good because you ll want to spend as little time as possible in your room  
N =>  Over rated hotel The description sounded too good to be true  and it was  It was clear the hotel has been remodeled and aspires to be a trendy  boutique spot  it has some issues  My single room was clean  but a little hot box  The one window opened merely as a transom at the top and air flow was blocked by the non operational Roman shade  I kept the lights off the entire time to keep the temperature down The ensuite bath  shower  was clean  but the shower didn t drain and i was ankle deep in water  The sink basin faucet was not well attached  and a rubber gasket was clearly out of place on the shower control  The hotel advertised satelitte flat screen TV  but you could only get   channels  The website also features a bar lounge but it was no where in site Hallways are very narrow  even for London This Kensington area is loaded with similar style hotels of all sizes and prices  Not convenient to any tourist locations except V amp A Museum  Is close to Sainsbury s and ks  amp  Spencer if you want to grab fresh food I only stayed here because the price     pounds  was the best i could do on same day s notice  
N =>   Good hotel at reasonable price  I recently stayed at the Avni Courtfield Gardens while on buisness in London  I was really not sure what to expect but was impressed when I arrived at the hotel My room was on the top floor which was fine for me but the lift only goes to the floor below so had to carry my luggage up one flight of stairs  The stairs were narrow and quite steep so would prove a problem for an elderly or less mobile person My room was great  really big room with ample sized shower room  My room was well furnished and comfortable  the only thing I could fault was the lack of air conditioning  It was very warm the night I stayed and even with the windows open it was difficult to sleep  Air con would have made all the difference Breakfast was great  plenty to choose from and staff ensured that everything was replenished regularly Pleasant and helpful reception staff  
N =>  dreadful stay awar this was one of the worst hotel i have ever stayed in  the room was just big enough to house the bed  the breakfast room was in the basement  a dark room with mould on the walls  keep looking there are far better deals in london  
N =>   Good location and clean rooms  Except for    Stayed at the Avni for   nights Room was clean in a quiet and convenient neighborhood    min walk to Gloucester Road tube station There is also a Tesco supermarket across the street from the tube  This can very convenient and useful if you got a room at the Avni with a fridge and microwave There is also another    hour supermarket   mins from the hotel   except on sunday evenings when they close at   Included breakfast was a plus  Serves toast  croissants  juices  milk  cereal and fruits The room can get hot even on a mild day outside  There is no air conditioning  If you plan to stay in the room in the daytime  look for another hotel as this was was just too warm  If you use the room to sleep only then it could be bearable with the window open  hopefully you get a room where a window does open  Now for the except part    For the first   nights we spent it in room      The room was small but very clean In room      there were   guests who refused to sleep The first night I was awoken my   men having a discussion  It would have been fine if it was a normal conversation  But they seemed to be involved in a heated discussion  They were practically screaming The walls between the rooms are not very thick  It was as if they were sitting in my room having the discussion At first I thought they were arguing but they were also laughing so it couldn t have been an argument  Finally around   AM they decided to go to sleep after heated discussions among other unmentionable things that would scar any one for life  I complained to the front desk after the first night  But it turned out to be another sleepless second night  They repeated the same actions as night number one  Do these people sleep A second complaint was made after night number    People at the front desk said they were renting the room for   month so it was a sensitive matter Hotel staff should not be giving preferential treatment just because they are renting for a longer period than I was Does this make me want to stay in the hotel again  Definitely not     Nor would I recommend it to anyone After further complaints and attempting to check out and finding another place to stay  the hotel staff finally moved us to another room  I would have expected this to have been done after night number one or that they at least speak to the guests in room     We did not deserve   sleepless nights If you plan to check into this hotel during the next few weeks  make sure you don t get room      
N =>  Avni was Excellent Hotel was very conveniently located about a     minute walk from the Earl s Court tube station  The room was actually bigger than I was expecting so that was a bonus  The room was clean  trendy and the twin beds were comfortable  although I think they re slightly narrower than north american twins but I m not sure  The breakfast rooms were quite nice and it was a serve yourself situation so you could eat as much as you wanted  There was bread  croissants  jam  cheese  cereal  orange juice  milk  water  coffee tea  fuit and yogurt  People were sitting in the lobby with their laptops using the wireless internet   it was available their but not in the rooms The bathroom was very clean with all new fixtures and fittings but it was very tiny  Still it was completely doable as long as you aren t extremely umm wide  Sorry but the reality is that if you have a really wide backside then getting on the toilet and into the shower will be difficult   you can sort of angle yourself in though  The toilet access is compromised by the large heater towel bar on one side and the shower door on the other  You need to keep the shower door open to be able to get on the toilet and then the towel heater thing keeps you sitting on a bit of an angle  To bad they didn t raise this rack up off the floor a couple of feet to clear the toilet  Access to the sink is great and really  I am by no means small and I was able to manage very well  I d happily stay here again so just be prepared There is a small     person elevator so you don t need to worry about carrying luggage upstairs  so that was wonderful  
N =>  Not Bad stayed at avni in mid   overall  not bad  good location    blocks to subway which connected easily to most parts of London  We were there   days and used the tube a lot  rooms were neat and clean for most part  bring shampoo  they provide little packets that are not much  As mentioned  rooms are small  Bathroom is small too  but workable  daily breakfast was fine  was a little worried about booking this one on line  but after staying there  we were quite pleased  Neighborhood around hotel is nice  walked around the area a few times  nice old church right across the street  Kensington park  hyde park  harrods  and numerous museums in the area too  all in all  not bad  
N =>   Tiny rooms good location The hotel has TINY rooms  It is at the corner of two busier than expected streets  so even my fourth floor room was quite noisy until very late  the window did not entirely close   The breakfast was typically non meat English bed and breakfast fare  On the plus side  the room and en suite bathroom were clean  clean  clean  Maid service was excellent  The staff provided an extra blanket and an iron for our use without charge  And the location  near but not right next to the Gloucester Road tube station  is perfect for getting to all sites without changing tube lines often As London hotels go  the Avni isn t bad  Not three stars  but solid two stars  
N =>   Not great but the price is right We stayed at the Avni for two night in ch  First of all do not expect a large spacious room  The room we had was about the size of a large closet with just enough room to walk to the bathroom and the bed  It has a old charm to it  but that s about it  The hallways are barely large enough to walk with your luggage  The bed were hard and the T V had about five stations  with none of them having good reception  We arrived early and had to leave our luggage until we could check in four hours later  When we finally got our room I was amazed at the size of this closet although I did find it a bit funny  We thought we would make the best of it  until we tried to take a shower and had no hot water  We left to sight see and notified the desk about the water and they assured us it would be fixed  When we returned later that evening they told us the hot water had been fixed  however when we tried to take a shower the next morning  we still had no hot water  so the cold shower did not put us in a good mood  We complained again and they did agree to move us to another room that had hot water  We never tried to breakfast so I can not comment on that  The location is in a nice part of town and walking distance to the tube and tour buses  Also there are several nice restaurants and pubs within walking distance  We asked for a wake up call the first night and never did get one  If you are wanting to stay in this area and the size and creature comforts of the room are important to you  then don t stay here  There are several hotels nearby that are more expensive but also nicer  If you just want a cheap room with nothing special and don t care about the size then you may want to give it a try  I would not stay here again but it did give me something to tell horror stories about  Eat at the Hereford Arms  It is a good restaurant and plus I got engaged there yea  
N =>   Fantastic value for money and really not that bad When i was searching the net for a hotel to stay in for myself and my boyfriend i began to panic that i wouldn t find something nice enough for less than      each  but then i stumbled across the Avni Hotel  The pictures and the information on their web page were impressive and instantly attracted me as well as the amazing price of     per person per night  including breakfast  However  when i read some of the reviews i was quite worried about oing ahead and booking a room  Despite this i decided to book because it was such good value for money and i was not let down  The hotel was easy to find and in a perfect location  with amenities and the tube station just a few minutes walk away  The natural history museum  amongst others  were also just down the road  The entrance was clean and contempary and the staff were extremely helpful and friendly  Initally we were in a double room on the  th floor but moved to the  rd floor   i stress that this had nothing to do with the size of the room it was due to the room being uncomfortably hot  The window was very small so we were unable to get much ventalation  But  when we asked the staff if it was possible to move rooms they did so straight away and although it was a twin room it was perfect in size and comfort  The only problem with the room we found  was that the door to the bedroom caught the bathroom door and this made it difficult to get in and out  But the bathroom was clean and just the right size  Yes there was noise from outside but it is London and is to be expected   We did find that we could hear noise coming from the other rooms but we were so tired from sightseeing all day that we had no problems getting to sleep  especially because the beds were so comfy    Breakfast was good  with a choice of cereals  fruit  crossiants  toast and yoghurts as well as fresh fruit juices and tea and coffee  There was more than enough to fill us up and we couldn t complain becuase of the price Overall  the Avni was very comfortable and in a perfect location that was easy to find  The staff were helpful and friendly  The rooms were contempary and had a very modern feel to them  and were just the right size  Although  the hotel has been recently renovated there was evidence of some damp in the bathrooms and down in the basement where breakfast was served but this should not put anyone off  At the end of the day it is difficult  near impossible to find a good hotel in London  with breakfast that is such a good price  Me and my partner will definately be staying there again and have recommended it to our friends and family  
N =>   Not too bad    honest   
N =>   My worst hotel experience ever  
N =>   first time i ve stayed in a sauna  oh my god  do not stay in this kip  i was put in the smallest room i have ever seen on the  th floor   THE HEAT   i will never forget it  People may have died in these rooms in july and august    the service at reception was dreadful and un helpful  and the breakfast was so bad  i dont want to even think about it  if you do one thing in your life do not stay in this hotel  
N =>  breakfast with mice It was terrible to drink an orange juice glass with two mices in the breakfast room    No comment    
N =>   Horrible  Stay here as last resort ONLY    I stayed here as I had missed my flight and desperatly needed cheap accommodation in central London For    Pounds p  night you can t expect too much  I guess   We were put on the  th floor  and amazingly enough the lift was not working  I had to carry my very heavy bag up   storeys  The stairs itself was in appauling condition  carpet not attached to the floor and it lacked proper lighting  The room itself appeared in OK condition  I stayed in a  quot superior quot  room which was more basic than superior  It had   single beds with the worst matresses ever  It was like sleeping on bare springs  The TV was functional but there was no remote control  The bathroom had hot water  but the shower curtain was in terrible shape  Refer to the photos  orange growth on it  YUcky The only pro for this hotel is its location  It is a few minutes from Gloucester Rd tube Staff at reception were unfriendly and did the bare minimum I would not stay here again  and would definetly not stay here for longer than a night  Think very carefully before staying here  There are better hotels out there for a little bit extra  
N =>   Worst Hotel Ever I travel to London several times a year for business and I always try to stay at a different hotel to check them out  This was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in  The room was musty  the bed sagged and we thought we were going to fall through  The shower was so tiny that only a child could fit in it comfortably  We asked to be moved and were   the new room  although redone with lovely wood floors and a new paint job  still had an older bed in it  There was a smell  although this could be from just replacing the floor   there was a ladder  permanently afixed  to an attic fire escape   not sure which in front of the door to the room  The entire  th floor was ripped apart  the lobby was dreary and the staff was less than helpful  We spent a total of   hours in this hotel before I moved us down the street Do NOT stay at this hotel  
N =>   Apalling Accomodation I know that I only paid just less than a hundred quid  but what an appalling place to stay  I would not recommend this place to any living thing  There were a number of things I complained about but it all fell on deaf ears and nothing was done about it  as soon as i opened the room door  i wanted to go back home  My advice to anyone who is interested in this place   dont go its absolutely appalling  This  Hotel  is very very poor  most of the reviews I have read on trip advisor are spot on  I dont know how it has a rating  
N => Superior room not bad We stayed here in late ch  We upgraded to a superior room for are stay  Yes  it is a european hotel which means it is old and small  The superior rooms are renovated  the bathroom was clean along with the floors  it was cozy and worth the money  It was close to pubs  
N =>  Terrible Good location  but everything else about this  so called  hotel was jest terrible    Watch out  better keep away of this property  
N => Fearful   a good example for the worst example first of all let me confirm I am not a black hearted guy  but what I saw  amp  felt in this hostel that was terrible   even it s location itself is excellent    room small   very uncomfortable for two  you cannot even take your shoes off sitting on the bed as the wall doesn t allow it       there is no wardrobe   ok  for couple of days you can live from your bags  but honestly it s pretty tiring   bathroom lies in ruins   floor is broken  I wanted to set the shower  but it almost fall out from the wall   heat   I understand that     degree is considered very cold in London  but maybe it would be useful to have a xx  century window that does not let the heat out freeze in  At least we could use this opportunity for keeping our drinks cold  as fridge was removed from the room  I do not want to image why        cleanliness   this is the most disappointing  When we arrived to the  clean  room  we found Big Mac papers under the bed  together with some French fries     Lovely  There was a big red blemish on the bedspread  hopefully not blood     Anyhow  we had to sleep in street clothes due to the in house winter  so the manginess of the bed was not so serious  Actually  they felt in our exam  I left a used napkin on the floor before leaving the room in the morning  Probably they did not want to rob us  as the napking was waited for me when we arrived back to the room at night  So  as a summary  I can just strongly recommend you to avoid this place as mach as you can  I was happy to leave the place by knowing I never go back there  
N =>  Scaring I ve just come back from London where I spent   nights at this horrible hotel  We had booked a triple standard room at a very cheap price  but we couldn t imagine what we were going to find  The room was the filthiest and most horrible place I ve ever been  It was small  dirty  awful  ugly  There was a hole in the wall and in the floor  The carpet was disappearing  The sheets and blankets were extremely old  the beds highly uncomfortable  we asked for a change but they told us they were full and that we were staying at the best standard room in the hotel  I d like to see the others then  since ours was dreadful  Please  trust me  don t book a standard room there  
N =>  Amazing Staff OK Hotel I stayed at the hotel a few weeks ago  First of all  it wasn t my first choice of hotel  But I didn t book a hotel and I asked the cabbie to take me to the Kensington Ed  Hotel because I remembered that a friend of mine mentioned the hotel to me a little while ago When I got to the hotel  I was a bit scared  honestly  I was in transil in London for   night and I really didn t expect the hotel to be this way  It wasn t all that bad  but still  it wasn t the Hilton  However  I was extremely charmed by the gentleman at the front desk  He was very warm and welcoming and assured me that I would be safe for the night He was even nice enough to help take my bags to my room  The room wasn t very clean  and he showed me another room which was slightly better  He told me that I can choose which room I wanted  Then after  he also chatted with me about some good places to eat in the area  After dinner  I came back to the hotel and he was still there  so we chatted some more  Honestly  the hotel was a little below average  Yes  it is cheap  but still not up to the standard  A little bit of cleaning up can do good  However  the gentleman at the front desk was so freindly and nice  it made the stay worthwhile  I was thinking that I could be at a far better hotel for the night  sitting alone and watching tv  or here at this hotel  which is not very clean  but having a wonderful laugh with a very educated  and handsome  young man  I think he was from either India or bangladesh  and I must say  freindly staff is the key to a great hotel  
N =>  Not For Most Couples We re a middle aged couple who travel around the world on differnt types of trips from overnight backpacking to luxury cruises  We make the best of our accomodations according to the type of trip we re on and consider it as part of the adventure  Given the centralized location and viewing their web site  I never thought we d be in a hotel this nasty  Their web page doesn t correctly show or state the rooms and ammenities  I would not recommend this place for most couples  The first room shown to us had a double bed  torn curtains  ripped and filthy carpet and the bathroom was moldy  The matress had two deep impressions on it  I won t go into the items that were noticed on the torn carpet  We asked to see another double room and were shown a room with two twin beds as all of the double rooms were taken  We had reserved a double room five months in advance  Needless to say  we didn t want to stay apart or in an unclean place and decided on another hotel around the corner  Not a place where I would want to go barefoot      
N =>  Budget Hotel We Found the hotel on Hostel World but the room type we wanted was not available  so we called the hotel directly and they told us that have availabilty and we booked directly basic room  When we arrived  we did not like the room we were given  quiet old  so we asked to see the Superior room which was much nicer and the price difference was not much  it seems have of the hotel was refurbished    the old rooms dont look clean Excellent location  very attentive and friendly staff  Hotel needs some work on the old rooms   
N => everything said is true when we booked this place on opus travel we booked a double room  i admit we did arrive late however we called ahead to confirm our prepaid booking the day of arrival  When we did arrive we were told that they overbooked  we did book this place   months ahead   and were given a twin bed room which was absolutelyt filthy  Cracked window  mould all over the bathrooms and filthy sheets  I though this was their budget backpacker lodgings however after reading this it seems to be the normal style of room  We were then changed to a new room the next day which was cleaner than the last but i think it must be just the releif from statiying in such a dreadful room the night before  When we did get to our room      just like the other review  there was a ladder leading up to the roof in front of the door  I figured ok there must be maintenance and surely the cleaning staff must have noticed it  Upon returning later in the evening its still there This hotel is totally unprofessional and not worth the money  I ve stayed in private hostel rooms that were cheaper and so much cleaner than here  Thank god its in a nice part of town  Good advantage is that its close to shops and the underground  
N =>  Major Inspections required This was our first trip to the UK  to visit our son who has been living there for the past two years  Instead of sending a picture  I would like you to form one in your head  It took two girls exactly four minutes   we had to step out into the hall  to  quot clean quot  our room  They had a can of spray  a toilet brush  and clean towels  A dry mop was pushed around the floor  the dirty towels were put into a duffel bag in the hall and they were on to the next room  Several times we had to request our sheets to be changed and to leave bath soap and toilet paper  I guess you could say they have an exercise program because the elevator broke twice while we were there so using the steps was a good thing unless you have health problems  There were no phones in the rooms so communication within the city was difficult and they never offered for us to use the phone at the front desk  even the day of the bombings  We found it necessary to leave a day early  thank heaven  due to the bombings to be at the airport to catch a flight  Even though we only wanted a place to sleep  it could have been clean  in working order  and with the ability to communicate within the city This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in and would not recommend it  
N =>  truly harrowing experience Like many of you I had booked a room in this hotel based on the information and photos provided by a major and reputable hotel booking site  When I arrived at the hotel I thought I was in the wrong place because all the signs were in Arabic only  The elevators were blocked off with something that looked like police tape  the desk clerk saying that there was a mechanical problem  and therefore the  quot usual quot  rooms were not available  I was then taken to a room off a hallway  behind  the front desk  What I saw I can t actually remember because I have blocked it out from my memory  It was that bad  Suffice to say that there was dried urine all over the toilet seat and one of the walls in this bathroom sized  quot hotel room quot  was completely covered in brown and green wet mold  The room itself was smaller than my bathroom  No  quot amenities quot   no decor  a twisted old set of blinds that didn t fully close  the flimsiest of a cheap flammable bedcover  and as if to add insult to injury   although there was a television and a plug in kettle  there was no power point anywhere in the room to plug them in I went back to the desk and demanded another room  The girl looked at me like I was crazy and then offered me another room  I was hoping I d be taken to a room like the one seen on the web site but no such luck   same size  same shabby condition  I felt like I was in a prison cell and when I went out that night to buy a few snacks  I actually bought a bottle of disinfectant  Imagine that  being on vacation and wanting to disinfect your own hotel room I didn t sleep much my first and only night in the Kensington Edwardian  A group of the hotel s permanent residents were  I am not making this up  sitting in the hallway outside my room until   in the morning singing  clapping  and playing bongo drums  Needless to say   I checked out of the hotel at      AM  I didn t have another place to stay  but I really didn t care  Between the filth  being kept up all night  and seeing a group of very suspicious looking characters sitting in a  quot business meeting quot  in a room in the lobby that was still going strong at      AM   I was absolutely and honestly terrified for my own safety This was ember      and I m stunned to see this hotel is still operating and hasn t been shut down If you value your personal safety and sanity and don t want to spend your first night in London scared and in tears   avoid this hotel at all costs  
N =>  Get Out While You still can We booked to stay in the hotel via AAAhotels web site in      Upon arrival we were directed to a car park that cost    pounds for the weekend    commission for the desk clerk  So we worked the system with the metres and parked round the corner all weekend Upon entering the hotel we noticed that the carpet was thread bear The room did not have a trouser press as stated on the website we had to ask for a kettle  Our Friends upon entering there room saw that the curtains were hanging off the rail  The mirror was resting up against the wall  The television did not work there was no plug in the bathroom  amp  the tea  amp  coffe making facilties was an absolute joke as there was vending machine cups   white plastic ones    tea bag  amp  plastic spoons The hair dryer was hanging by its flex off the wall Now the breakfast The room had half its ceiling missing it smelt damp and the breakfast consisted of bread rolls  toast and cornflakes orange amp  grapefriut juice tea  amp  coffee no butter for your rolls when we asked for some we were told there is nt any   what kind of hotel is this  Are we expected to eat dry bread  amp  Toast  No lights on the stairways  trip hazzard through out The bar does not exist  Was told it was under refurbishment although there was no sign of this  The balcony was unsafe with broken railings and debris all over it Anyone thinking of using this hotel avoid at all costs there is better for your money  
N =>  Beware of Kensington Edwardian Hotel We found this hotel  Kensington Edwardian Hotel in Kensington near Gloucester Road underground station  through a well known website which we had used before with very good result  Lovely photos of the hotel room and the breakfast room  but really something else in reality  The staff were not that bad and the area in Kensington was superb but the rooms were small and unconvenient  very boaring  no bed lights and nearly impossible to get towels  The only possibility to deposite our valuable things was to hand it over to the staff who just put them under the desk at the reception disk  Do not seem very safe for us  The breakfast room was just a joke  Never seen anything so uncomfortable and untasty before  Although continental breakfast was included in the price we had to eat our breakfast at a breakfast place in the neighbourhood instead  Even the prisoners in our country are better treated  We had paid around GBP      per night for the room in advance  be not that much but we are pretty sure there must be better options in London even for that price  This is for sure the worst we have experienced during our forty years of travelling around the world including around fifteen visits to London  
N =>  We escape  We also had prepaid for   nights at his  quot hotel quot  for the first week of ember       through a reservation service on the internet  I had not researched this site  When we arrived  we were given a key to room     and directed to the working elevator  The light inside was not working  I noticed the threadbare carpet in the elevator and realized that we were in trouble  When the door opened on the fifth floor we were greeted with the sight of dirty laundry on the floor  We then began to wander the floor looking for room      As it turned out that is the only room on the floor without a number on the door  Trial and error led us to the room  It was worse than I had imagined  This was NOT the decor I had seen on the internet  The mattress was thin and the bed squeaky  the closet was too small and the table lamp was on the floor  I told the desk clerk that the room was unacceptable  He offered me another room on the ground floor which was no better  I then decided that hang the prepaid reservation  we would not stay  We left the luggage in our room and set out on foot to find another hotel  We were able to find excellent accomadations at Harrigton Hall  two blocks away from this place  Interestingly  each time we exited the Edwardian  a gentleman sitting in a parked car outside the hotel asked us where we were going The good news for us is that as soon as I returned to the states  I called the internet booking agency and complained  I received a credit for three of the nights that we had booked  This was the  th trip to London for my wife and me  and we have never before experienced such a dismal hotel as the Kensington EdwardianBeware  
N =>    unforgettable nights I stayed here with my   children  age    and       th t     and  th   th oct      the rooms unfortunately booked and payed months ahead This is the kind of place you never ever visit again  There was nearly a total lack of cleanliness  they deliberately seemed to put on  or leave  used and dirty bedclothes  hair and pubic hairs could easily be spotted   The floors   floor carpets were dirty  Mould fungus covered the tile joints in the shower area of the bathroom  The curtains could not be drawn  room no      and       The bed matresses were worn  the matress springs could be felt on your body We totally stayed in   different rooms           and     respectively Breakfast  We went down the first morning  but my children did not want to go down there any more Chosing a   star rated hotel   I wonder where they got them from  you don t expect any luxury  but this was worse than I ever could imagine  I just want to warn other people from having their time spoiled at this place  
N =>  Horrible hotel I stayed   nights            in this hotel primarily due to the fact that they leave one no recourse re  early check out  On the back of the registration form this is stated but to most of us it refers more to the tourist s committment  At this hotel they presume on it and do not provide any of the amenities promised on the internet ad  The place is filthy from top to bottom  the beds are cots made up with one brown blanket  no spread  There is not even handsoap in the bathroom  where the mold is actually dripping off the tile  and the shower so small that when the shower door opens it automatically hits the faucets  One could easily be scalded by trying to reach in to turn it off  The  quot restaurant quot  mentioned in the ad is a room in the dark basement not even an overhead light bulb in the hallway  where breakfast is offered from   to    am  We watched mice running where we were supposed to eat  The floors throughout are sagging and rug color obliterated by dirt  The attitude of the reception people is one of complete indifference  They have heard so many complaints that they do not respond at all  They are firm in that you will not receive any money back whatever   Not only should this be reported to the Fire Dept   but the Tourist Bureau should prevent misrepresentation on the Internet  None of the amenities offered were made available  
N =>  Fire Trap We stayed there for   barely tolerable nights in ust       Our room did not even come close to the picture  When we arrived  the  quot lobby quot  was full of family members of the owner  So no place to sit for us  This went all all three days we were there  Kids running around  men talking and smoking There were two elevators  but only one worked  At least it went up and down  There were no working lights so the only way you knew what floor you were on was when the door opened to a floor  The fire extinguisher had not been serviced for   years  and I doubt that the smoke alarms and fire alarms even worked based on the condition of the hotel  The basement  quot restaurant quot  hahahah had an open tile ceiling with wet stains and exposed wiring  The food was horrible  There were bars on the windows of the room With exposed wiring and bars on windows I felt very nervous  There was no coffee maker in our room  We joked that the hot water in the sink was the coffee maker and laundry facility  The shower was so plugged up our first shower it almost overflowed There were no matress pads on the beds so the beds were lumpy  the sheets although clean had holes and didn t fit the entire bed  It was horrible  a fire trap  noisy  Our telephone only went to the desk and we had to use the desk phone to dial out of the hotel  Do not stay there  
N => Sorry   Rats are cleaner than this  Stayed at the KE in ust of       There was NO furniture except a small night table with one tiny drawer  One hanger in the closet  quot space  quot  Truly Edwardian furnishings   hasn t been updated in     years  The room was about    by      extremely tiny when living out of suitcases  due to lack of drawers and closet   The Bates Motel is more inviting  Attempted to change rooms  but staff played the bait and switch technique    quot You ll have to ask the next shift  quot  All rooms we saw were the same  We dealt with the situation by making it the joke of an otherwise wonderful trip to England  We still laugh at the Little Hotel of Horrors  Cheap  but not worth the price   
N =>  Dirty and in need of repair It s hardly to believe that a hotel can be so run down  The carpet and curtains had not been cleaned for a long time  There was a sort of coffee maker in the room  but don t think of using it  it was so dirty  In the bathroom water was dripping from above Breakfast was very basic  the breakfast room also not cleaned well There is an escalator which did not work Overall a big disappointment  
N => Beware      Dirty        
N => Small Poky Grubby  
N =>  needs a good clean  
N =>  Dirty Rat Hole  
N =>  Fantastic location large room noisy neighbours We stayed at the Avni Apartments in Kensington for a week in ruary     The location was wonderful  a short block away from the Gloucester Rd tube station which has service to   underground lines to get you around the city  Supermarkets  restaurants  amp  pubs  Kensington High Street  Hyde Park and the Natural History Museum and the V amp A were all within easy walking distance We arrived very early before check in and were given a room larger than the one we d paid for  The room hadn t yet been cleaned  but the desk staff and the cleaners themselves were very apologetic and took care of it right away  The room and bathroom were very large and high ceilinged  but since we d arrived so early they gave us the wheelchair accessible room  so I can t say if the others are all so spacious  King sized bed was two twins in the same large frame  they sometimes slid apart but it was no big deal  The bed was quite thick and soft  which I found fine but my partner who has a bad back was sore by the end of the week  Kitchen was well equipped  but the layout was a bit strange   when the door was open  it blocked the fridge  Wireless internet was slow on the first day  but perfect for the rest of the week  fast and reliable  We were required to leave our key at the desk when we left  cleaning was done when our key was available  Overall we had a great  comfortable stay  The main downsides were these    we couldn t figure out the heating cooling system or the cable for the TV  Neither of these were important enough for us to ask the staff  ambient temperature was fine  and we didn t watch much TV  but I m sure they would have explained it if we d needed the help   our room had a door into the adjacent room  It was locked  so we didn t feel unsafe at all  but we could hear EVERYTHING that went on in the neighbours  room  We heard them taking on the phone  their TV  their alarm in the mornings  Luckily they didn t stay up late or get up too early  but if they d been partiers or had a crying baby  we would have had a much worse stay  I don t know if the other rooms were as bad for noise  but it might be worthwhile to ask for a room that doesn t connect to its neighbours  
N =>  probably not again The smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in during more than    years of business travel  Staff was very kind and helpful but the crammed room made for an uncomfortable stay  No space to put my  hand luggage size  suitcase without tripping over it  Ventilator in my bathroom was not working so everything steamed up rapidly after every shower  Location was great and price was low but will look for other options the next time I m in the area  
N =>   Didn t follow through on the price We were promised a triple room at a reasonable rate  then   days before our arrival were told that they couldn t give us that rate anymore  so put us in a double room for the same price  Couldn t find anything else so were stuck there  They said a taxi would cost around         Ameican money  and it cost         Rooms had poor mattresses  food was fair  Staff was not helpful in giving us advice on seeing London  other than giving us some brochures They insisted we pay them with cash  
N =>   Un h tel pour une semaine grand max mais pas plus  
N =>   Per chi interessa restare in zona Russell square  
N =>  A very bad experience We selected this hotel because it received a good writeup in the guidebook I consulted and because it looked and sounded wonderful on the hotel s web site  If the photos and reviews were ever accurate they are certainly not so any more  When we arrived at the hotel we discovered that we could not use the main entrance and had to enter via the basement door which was down a narrow flight of stairs  We then had to carry our suitcases up several flights of very narrow and steep stairs because there is no elevator  The first room we were shown had twin beds when we had ordered a double bed  In addition it looked out over a  quot garden quot  that was overgrown and filled with rubbish  and also overlooked a railway track that appeared to in constant use and was very noisy  There was a patio door that was completely insecure as it did not lock properly  We asked for a room with a double bed as had been originally requested and at first we were told that there were no rooms available  After a while however we were given a different room which was up several more flights of stairs  It did not have a double bed but rather had two single beds pushed together  The room was very small and cramped and was filthy  It looked like the carpets had not been vacuumed in quite some time  and the blankets and bedspreads were dubious as well  The wallpaper was peeling off the walls  The bathroom was dirty and there was mould on the tiling  There were dirty dusty plastic plants in the window boxes  We were very unhappy but decided to stay and make the best of it because we were only staying one night  I could not have stayed in that hotel more than one night  and in fact found staying there even one night an ordeal  We asked the manager for a wake up call and he agreed to this  then later came to our room and informed us that he could not do this for us as the system was not working  We had to get up early the following morning and so we did not have a chance to sample the breakfast but I would have been very reluctant to do so in any event given our overall experience  All in all this was one of the worst experiences I have ever had hotel wise and I would recommend that this hotel be avoided  
N =>   Rubbish    After looking at numerous hotels on the internet we stumbled across the Avonmore hotel  which to be fair from its websites discriptoin and photographs looked exactly what we were looking for   So we booked  I though the prices were a bit steep but i thought i would be staying in a nice luxury hotel  so i was happy to pay When we arrived and got off the tube  i was quite dissopointed about the area which we were in  to me it looked a bit run down to be honest  However we proceeded towards the hotel  As soon as we found the street where the hotel was situated i wanted to walk straight back on the train and go home     quot up market town quot  was how the hotels website discribed the area    more like down market   Anyway i was going to give it the benifit of the doubt We were welcomed by a front door that was locked so had to use the lower entrance good start    After checking in we made the massive trek up   flights of steep staircases  luggage in tow  to our room We opened the door and i my heart sank  it was awful    The beds had seen better days  carpets were dirty  wallpaper peeling of the walls  cobwebs on the light fitting  a huge green sink situated in a corner which was full of limescale and virtually impossible to get to as there was a chest of draws right infront of it   The only modern thing about the room was the card swipe door entry system     Then comes the shared bathroom    which i have always hated It was disgusting    there was still a towel on the floor which was wet through and obviously had been there for some time   The toilet didnt flush properly and the shower was a trailining hose off the hot and cold taps   the water just trickled out All this after the first    mins of arrival We all agreed not to have the breakfast even though they were included in the price Luckilly we were out most of the time and only used the room to shower and sleep There is only one positive thing to say about the hotel  it is close to the tube  I would nt recommend this hotel to anyone    
N =>   living in the past  Regarding the   star status this expired in      We arrived after check in time  as per website to be told website was wrong and the room would be ready in    minutes  Went out for lunch returned to be shown to our room  Room was just about large enough for    not   as there was a  rd bed in the room and we were then told it was a triple floor appeared to have not been vacuumed stool had brown mark on where someone had sat on it undressed soap dish in shower had not been washed and had soap scum from previous occupant stuck to it Then the worst breakfast experience I have ever encountered The  cook  was also the waiter receptionist we were asked to share our table with total strangers I did not order any cooked food as the  cook was wearing no apron or other protective items  he did not attempt to wash his hands between handling raw food and other items Teapot arrived with ONE teabag between FOUR people  When cereal was ordered it arrived with milk already in the bowl  not everybody likes a lot of milk  Do not use the mini bar unless there is a price list   there wasn t  Website stated that nearest tube station was Gloucester Rd Not true  there are   nearer   closest is West Kensington   
N =>   Horrible hotel experience   Avonmore Hotel We booked a reservation for the Avonmore hotel stay from viewing their personal website reservations avonmore hotel co uk  for   nights from     to       The website was very attractive and we were looking forward to our stay based on this We are looking for a hotel to stay in Kensington for a family of   The Avonmore was described on the website as a   diamond hotel  on a quite street in close to local sites and transportation  The description of the hotel mentioned privately owed  mentioned that it had won an award   great care and attention has been dedicated to the furnishings and accessories  One of the most pleasant affordable hotels in central London  We experienced the following issues at the hotel    Bed bug bites    Dirty blankets  bedspreads and overall bedding   Pillows were well used  and uncomfortable beds   Old rotting food in the mini bar from previous client   Floor   sink area visible dirt   Carpeting   evidence of dirt and objects from previous clients on the floor   Noise level high from train tracks located right outside of our window    dead bugs in the walls   dirty curtains and windows    stained upholstered furnitureOverall  we found the housekeeping conditions of this hotel to be completely unsatisfactory and to be a health hazard We could not sleep with the bedding and had to strip bedding off of the beds down to the top sheets  We still ended up with visible bed bugs bites all over our bodies We met a hotel keeper who was basically in charge of the reception desk  the breakfast prep and running the hotel  She mentioned to me that Sunday was a long day for her     a m to    midmight  We spend our first night in the hotel and the following morning  I worked to find another hotel and express my concerns to the hotel management The hotel keeper on site was kind and understanding of my complaints about overall housekeeping nd offered to call the hotel owner who was not on duty on Sunday      She offered to talk to the maid   who she said did not speak any English  and try to have her spend extra time in the rooms cleaning  I insisted on talking to the manager of the hotel  The hotel keeper told me that she did not like to be disturbed on a Sunday and that I could talk to her in person on Monday as she would be there serving the breakfast  I insisted that we needed other rooms or better accomodations immediately that we could not sleep another night in the hotel in this condition  She called the manager   and spoke with her to convey my frustrations about our accomodations   We did not mention bug bites to her  The manager refused to talk to me over the phone  She insisted on communicating through the hotel keeper  She offered to locate new blankets for the room and offered this up  She told the hotel keeper that if we left the hotel  she would charge us for all   nights unless she was able to rebook the rooms  I kept insisting to talk to her with no avail  After the phone call  the hotel keeper said that she was very sorry that we were not satisfied  she told me that she could do very little  only have the maid clean extra long in the rooms  that she understood my complaints  that the owner was Polish  that she was British and that she understood the standards we were expecting  My family and I checked out of the hotel   paid cash for the one night stay   they had originally billed my Visa for this amount and refused to refund it once I paid the cash   We itched our way to our new hotel location  Upon checking in to my hotel  I found out that my Visa card had been billed for the entire   night stay Please know that this hotel is unhealthy  untidy and unprofessional   overpriced and disgusting and should be inspected by the board of health  Execept for the receptionist  the experience was completely disappointing and the worst I have seen in all of my stays in Europe  
N =>   Reservation not honored If you choose to book at Avonmore  be aware that a confirmed  deposit paid reservation will not necessarily be honored We had a twin room reserved for   nights           When we arrived we were told that the room reserved for us had a plumbing problem that would require a week to repair so we were given another room that was available for only   of the   nights reserved  The room was well equipped but had dirty seat covers and shabby  worn and faded drapes and bedspreads  One night we were without cold water  but had hot water that was too hot to bathe in and of course could not drink   The owner does not live on the premises and her night and week end help were inadequate  In addition  the neighborhood is borderline seedy  The owner booked us into another  quot equivalent quot  hotel for the last   nights  This hotel was not equivalent although it was more conveniently located  Although Avonmore s owner paid our cab fare  it did not make up for the lost time in re packing and re locating  resulting in our losing the better part of a day of our vacation  We have visited London at least a dozen times  staying in various small hotels and apartments  Our Avonmore experience was the worst we have encountered  and we certainly won t be staying there again  
N =>  Excellent stay   near Olympia I stayed here   nights  Warm welcome  excellent breakfast All staff members did their best to help  Only one thing   the steps to the entrance  It was difficult with luggage  But I will come back 
N =>   Adequate but not great place to stay in London Much of our visit to Avonmore was fine  The staff was helpful   arranging for a cab  keeping our luggage and going to the extra steps to double check the status of our bill in terms of our correct balance  Location is off the beaten track   but we knew that and found the tube station a quick   minute walk and that you were just stops away from most of what you want to see   West Kensington is on the District line   Neighborhood is not fancy   but we actually kind of liked that  Rooms were fine   but not as lovely as the photography on the website  So  it feels a bit dated   probably time for new fabrics  carpets and draperies  So  from that aspect  we were perhaps a little disappointed  But  for a reasonably priced place in London   we could recommend it  But  clearly a   star average place   not four star  Go in with your eyes open in terms of location etc  
N =>  Highly Recommend the Avonmore Hotel We were six travelers  With a family of four  including two younger daughters  and two grandmothers  we had perfect accommodations  a three room suite  That is  three separate rooms separated from the main hallway by a door  We could leave our doors opened and float freely from room to room without the fear of disturbing or being disturbed by neighbors  The room my husband and I were in had its own in room bathroom  and the other bathroom was outside the suite but was only available to our party and to noone else  The rooms were only slightly smaller than what you d find in the States but were by no means cramped  It did feel like we were in a Holiday Inn or Sheraton  just a bit smaller  It is not cheap  just as any decent accommodations in the UK are not cheap  With the exceptional warmth and considerate spirit of the employees  the great breakfasts  and the superb arrangement of our rooms  the price was worth it completely  This will be the first place we call if and when we return to London  We will be disappointed if they are full  
N =>  Disappointed  After a long trip from the states  we finally arrived at the Avonmore to be informed that shower in our room was broken and we would have to stay one night in a neighboring hotel  That hotel was run down and dirty  We finally checked into the Avonmore the next day  Our room was on the  th floor and it was very warm  There was no air conditioning or elevators  They did manage to bring us a fan  The shower wasn t quite fixed  as you had to turn on the sink faucet to get the shower to work   Weird   The breakfast was good and made to order  Others commented about the neighborhood being  quot seedy quot   We didn t think it was that bad and the location was very convenient  All in all  next time we would choose someplace else  
N =>  Thumbs Up The hotel room and bathroom were more spacious than I had expected and the staff was very friendly  Upon our arrival we were given a detailed map of what was close by and how to get there  There were no ironing facilities but staff offered to iron for us  that was a nice touch  We were assured by a couple of people that this is in a nice neighborhood  but I m still not sure if it is or isn t   it was different to be sure  very busy and diverse   Our room was very clean and there was an awesome sports pub right down the road  Of the several hotels we frequented in London  this was my favorite for the room itself  but not for the location  
N =>  Nice People First time to London  We stayed in   Hotels  as we blanketed a trip to Scotland in the middle of our vacation and couldn t secure a room at the Avonmore when we got back But of the    the Avonmore was by far the most pleasant  The only one of the   that had any room to move While I thought the neighborhood was kind of shady  everybody seemed to deny it  There was grafitti all over  and a lot of younger kids hanging around  but nobody really paid us much attention The tub is within easy walking distance if you don t like the neighborhood  I liked it  as they had plenty of pubs in the vicinity The staff couldn t have been much nicer  Very personable and helpful  Granted  you have to carry your bags to your room as there are no lifts  but I expected it to be small and kind of Londony  I found it to be part of the charm of the place The room was quite  nice  with a large bathroom  I thought it was a perfect kind of place to spend my first trip to London  Of the three places we booked over the internet  it was the closest one to being  quot as advertised  quot  We wanted a quite little place with a touch of London hospitality within easy access of everything  It was that  
N => A total rip off The hotel belongs to very shrewd business people I booked for two nights and had to cancel due to a death in the family  I agreed to the standard policy that they had the right to charge me for   night for  quot no show quot  or  quot late cancellation quot  They charged my credit card for two nights and did not even send me a receipt  A total rip off  
N =>  lovely owner average accomodation The place did not look nearly as charming  or as spacious as it did on the internet  The entryway is cramped  and there is no lobby  The breakfast room bar office is OK  but not a great place to relax  Our room was small  and nothing special  From the size and quality of the bedroom  I was surprised to find the bathroom more than adequate  with a full size bath shower  and enough room to put our things The propietor is extremely nice and friendly  which we really appreciated  but we would probably look for something a bit more physically pleasant next time  
N =>  A nice place to stay  
N =>  Really good hotel  
N =>   Horrible  
N =>   Good Value for Money   of us stayed in the Quad room which was an ok size  Bathroom is an all in one wetroom which is tiny and doesnt have a shower curtain so leave you clothes outside  Shower not very powerful but all very clean  Room was on top floor of about a million stairs  very hard to get up with cases and shopping  There was no luggage room even though it stated on website there was  Breakfast cooked to order and very tasty  We had no problems with the staff  they were very polite  Over all  for under     each for   nights we were very impressed  We were not there to sit in our room  just to sleep and shower  Would recommend for a weekend of shopping sightseeing  
N =>   Horrible We booked a two bed room well in advance but we received a small single bed room  Internet was promised but not available Room was located in   th floor  stairs extremelxy steep and narrow Water supply was leaking and bathroom was coated with water  To  quot resoved quot  problem water supply cut Result  Still water on the floor but in addition no water in the closet To call this a hotel is a crime  
N =>  nice small hotel but where was the litterbin from the toilet Avon hotel was nice in a way that our room was clean and the toilet ok  Location of the hotel was exellent next to the Paddington station  The full english breakfast is probably nice for those    well    english people  I did not really enjoy it  We ate toast for breakfast the whole seven days  With service we had some small difficulties  Some days the cleaners forgot to change our towels even though they were on the floor and wet  because there was no shower curtain in our small toilet so we had to wipe the wet floor with something   One day the cleaner had taken our dirty towels but had left only one clean towel  for   person  At the reception there was a young girl when we arrived and she wasn t very motivated for her duties I think  She did her job but    the older lady and the man were nice and helpful  Sometimes when we came back to the hotel our key wasn t in the reception and then the women or the man from the reception went to the next room to where we were staying and the key was there  WHAT As I said our room was clean but there were somethings I would like a hotel room to have  For example a safety deposit box or a litter bin in our toilet  Or the shower curtain  Or one extra towel to dry the toilet floor with  And some of the lamps in our room didn t have a lampshade  The metro ran every ten minutes just from beneath our room and was somewhat loud  We stayed on the bottom floor Overall our trip was nice  be we will try another hotel next time  And do not go to the Scotch stake house right around the corner  Food was ridiculously overpriced  
N =>   Good Location clean I stayed here for   nights in      The location was great  a   min walk from Paddington Station  and a    min underground subway  ride to everything a tourist wants to see  The room was pretty clean  not to much noise at night  Room was a tad small  but most Europe hotel rooms are a tad small  One shouldnt be hanging out in the room anyway while in London  The breakfast was good and the staff was helpful  The only thing I didnt care for  was as you can see in my bathroom pic  no shower curtain  I asked the front desk for one  and he said they dont use shower curtains             Found that odd  but whatever  so  as you could imagine  the bathroom was a swimming pool when I was done  Over all a decent stay  
N =>  Tiny We booked early and where aware tha   stars Hotel could be quite a suprice  But from reviews it got     average but by experience it should be lower It is very important for guests to know that THERE ARE STAIRS IN the hotel  Like ladders  And you feel the trains   that did however not disturbe us   we used earplugs First room we got had waterproblems  Next room we got tripple room for   and that room was ok  But that was luck  This room had the expectation size of a normal   person room  We felt strange was that they expected the guest to turn toilet water on and off  When we complained  oh yes I teach you how to do this Breakfast is ok  more selection than in low price hotels  But compared to prices at home value for money   we would have got   stars hotel for this price Hot water was good but all was very tiny   Would not even tell my worst enemy  IF you select it anyhow  always select twin for   person  the double bed is only     cm wide    
N =>   nothing special Receptionist gave us a very small room on the first floor  We only went to sleep since we arrived around    pm  We had breakfast in the morning which was ok i guess  but had better elsewhere  For its price i would suppose its a good choice if you want the place just to sleep  
N => The worst service ever We went there and slept in a room with  quot problems quot  in the toilet The smell was awful The next day they asked us to change hotel  because of the smell  saying that they had already reserved a room for us It wasn t true  And the other hotel arranged for us a twin room instead of a double in a dirty basement  We looked for a room in London for hours  And when we asked to the avon hotel to not charge the price for the night we spent there  they say NO  that s crazy  NEVER GO THERE  
N =>  Too small rooms for good price Advantages  good location  nice staff  low price for a room  a lot of restaurants around  really big English breakfasts Disadvantages  very  very small rooms  not enough space to place your luggage   very small bathroom     cm wide   stairs like a ladder  wallpapers and ferniture not very  quot fresh quot  I ve spent in the hotel   nights  The most serious problem was the lack of space in our room  It s a good choice for people who want to have a cheap hotel in first tube zone  You won t find a hairdryer in your room but you can take it from a reception desk  Additional problem generated bathroom  when I was shaving the door had to be open      
N =>   overbooking and terrible aftersales We booked for   nights a quad room for two parents and a daughter of   We first got a small   bed room  when we came in the reception we were told that we would get a bigger room the next day  because it was booked already The next day we got a bigger   bed room  I thought well  lets leave it this way  they are just starting this service  this is ok for us But the problem remained  it was a   bed room  We wanted the bigger room because we have a   year old  and we have t be inside every evening so we wanted a little comfort  and the quad had a seating area  Well  there was one easy sitting chair  but that was also there with the other room No discussion possible afterwards  they charged us a quad room    dispite this Terrible way of handling customers the hotel was ok  
N => good central location we have just arrived back from the avon hotel  we stayed on the top floor which when we got to our room our hearts were racing  we were knackard  the room was freezing in the nights  no shower curtain  so when we took a shower the whole bathroom got very slippery  amp  wet did nt like the breakfast  the staff were real friendly  a good spot for sightseeing  
N =>  Good cheap hotel      
N =>   Do not stay at this hotel These people should be embarrassed to run this establishment as a hotel  It is absolutely horrendous  We arrived at around     pm and were told we had to pay immediately by cash  without any explanation as to why  When we said we had no cash  rather than offer an alternative the guy on reception  who had no customer service skills at all  simply told us where there were some cash points  Half an hour later we  once we had got cash and paid  he told us we weren t actually staying there but at their  sister  hotel around the corner  We then walked around   blocks  the receptionist did not offer to help us     females   with our bags  what a gentleman   We then arrived at another hotel and were shown to our room The room was hideous  filthy carpet  stains on the bed covers  tatty old furniture  The bathroom was absolutely disgusting  i wouldn t bathe my dog in there   stained tiles  rusty shower fitting  The towels were grey  from grime   Worse than this was the feeling that neither we  nor our belongings  were safe  there was a notice on the door saying not to leave valuables in the room   We decided that we really did not want to stay there and walked all the way back to the main reception to ask for a refund as we wouldn t be staying  on the grounds that the room was filthy and nothing like the pictures on the website  We were told that wasn t possible as we hadn t said anything when we first went in the room  even though he had just dumped us in the room and left immediately before we had time to take in the full horror of our accomodation   We weren t prepared to stay in the hotel so we had to walk away minus     as we were refused a refund  The whole experience was horrendous  i cannot warn travellers away from this hotel strongly enough  
N =>    Hotel   You re joking  This is most definitely not a hotel  but a B  amp  B   and a rather cheap and nasty one at that  Where do I start  Well  with the fact that the website I booked the room through makes a point of the fact that the  hotel  is close to Victoria Station it s a good ten minutes walk  and that s if you re fit and healthy and only carrying an overnight bag   I hate to think what it would be like for anyone who was more mature or burdened with heavy luggage  Speaking of heavy luggage  that would be another reason to avoid this place   the stairs are very narrow  almost dangerously so if you have a top floor room   and there s no lift  Now moving on to my room   curtains that were hanging off the rail by two rings  styrofoam cups to make tea and coffee in  a wardrobe with no door that slanted almost thirty degrees away from the wall  taps that were not fastened to the sink and threatened to come off in my hand  and a hairdryer but no soap or towels there was dust on every exposed surface  something had splattered on one wall and not been wiped off   and I was too afraid to look under the bed  It s lucky that all the guy in the next room did was snore  because the walls were so thin you could hear everything  There seemed to be only one communal bathroom  which looked pretty grim by the time I went to use it at eleven p m   needless to say  no soap or towels in there either  I was not given any information as to what time breakfast was served  but to be honest I wouldn t have touched it with a bargepole anyway after seeing the state of my room and the bathroom I left shortly after   a m and went to my favourite caf  in Covent Garden instead  on the way out of the  hotel   I encountered the gentleman who d checked me in the night before   whose customer service skills only extended as far as barking  key  at me when he saw me coming down the stairs  I paid      which was apparently a discounted rate  and I still felt I d been ripped off   I have stayed in London B  amp  Bs for this amount and been perfectly happy  but it s grotty places like Bakers Hotel that give the London hospitality industry a bad name  and I can t advise you to avoid this establishment strongly enough  
N =>   Filthy Hotel Where to start   This hotel has become the ongoing joke of our tales about our month long Europe trip We arrived early in the morning  and were greeted by the surly man  the owner s son  I think  who seems to run the hotel  Despite his unprofessional demeanour  we were appreciative of his willingness to store our luggage whilst we went out exploring Upon checking into our room later in the day  several surprises were awaiting us    The rooms are tiny  Two twin beds  interestingly described as a double on the website   a small tv and a sink which hangs precariously off the wall  Luggage needs to be stratgically placed in the room so that the door is still able to be opened    The shared bathrooms are filthy  We were expecting budget  and have absolutely no problem with shared bathrooms  however they should be  a  heated in the middle of winter   b  clean   c  toilet paper is handy as well    The linen     my bed had an apparently clean bottom sheet  however through the sheet a HUGE blood stain on the mattress protector was clearly visible  I tried not to allow my imagination to run away with me on that one      The complimentary used condoms under my husband s bed     seriously  three used and tied up condoms just sitting there     just another example of the disgraceful hygiene standards of this  quot hotel quot     The very unusual smell     I m thinking it was mould  I came across similar smells in the dungeons of prominent historical landmarks  such as the prison in the basement of Edinburgh castle  The tonnes of lavender airfreshener used by the owners just add some subtle floral notes to the mould    I really could go on  but I think this gives a fair overview of our experience at Baker s  Yes  the place is cheap  but money is not always the most important factor  especially when you re sleeping above someone else s condoms  Spend just a bit extra elsewhere for comfort and peace of mind  
N =>   good value and good location Stayed in Bakers  hotel near Victoria station for   nights  got a sigle room on   st floor  small as I expected but very clean  Bath room just couple stairs down  Good normal breakfast   toast jam  cereal juice milk coffee and tea  Service was good and helpful   and I was allowed to leave my luggages till late afternoon then took a Victoria Coach bus just    min  walk  to Gatwick  Highly recommand if you are on budget  
N =>   ent stay at Bakers II stayed here for   nights at the end of  with two of my friends  We basically picked it because it got good reviews as well as being cheap  we are      year olds on a tight budget   The location was good  right near Victoria Station which made it convenient going places We were in the triple  room   I believe  and it was cramped with just enough room for all of our suitcases  The   beds were pushed together which surprised me but it was fine  Upon arriving we were welcomed by the son and since it was too early to get to our room we were allowed to leave our stuff in the locked lobby area  He was also kind enough to tell us where the bathrooms were so we could freshen up a bit  While the room was simple  it suited us for what we wanted  cheap  kind of centrally located  breakfast  and just a place to sleep at night  In order to enjoy the time spent in this B  amp  B you need to spend the day out of the room  Every day we left around   to sight see and be tourists around London  we didn t need a nice room since we weren t planning on spending time in it My only suggestions if you stay here  ask for a towel  they are not in the room or bathroom  we had to ask for   and we used them for the full week  if you don t like noise bring earplugs  there is traffic outside every night which didn t bother me since I was used to the sounds of Boston but bothered my   friends  bring shoes to walk to and from the bathroom  down a flight of stairs  be prepared for minimal options for breakfast  toast  corn flakes  bran flakes  oj  tea  instant coffeeI would probably stay here again because you can t beat the price and overall I had a good experience  
N =>   Don t stay too long and it s okay  I ll just recap our thoughts    The staff is very courteous and accomodating   We didn t like paying upon arrival  We would have preferred paying when we left   We  two girls in our    s  felt like we needed to follow each other to the bathroom to feel more safe   We wish we would have brought our own sheets   The TV didn t work  neither did a couple of the lights in the room   The doorknob to the room was broken so you had to use the key to get in every time   The closest plug to the sink and mirror is    feet away so you can t really see while getting ready   It doesn t smell the greatest in the whole place  We felt uncomfortable a couple of mornings when we heard two people arguing and fighting while  we assume  cleaning the rooms  Also  if you don t like the idea of sharing a bathroom with people you do not know I would not recommend staying here   It is close to Victoria Station which we thought was really great  For London the price was decentWe stayed at this b and b for   nights and I think it was a little too long of a stay  For one or two nights I think I could have given a better review but after   nights   well  we started to feel like we could no longer be positive  We felt misled by the pictures on the website  We understand that they are trying to show what is nice about this place but they clearly put pictures up of the nicest room and the nicest bathroom  
N => Adequate Accommodations We arrived in London at Victoria Station late at night  From there it was easy to find Bakers  using only an address and a large map on the wall  It is situated down a quiet lane  in a neighborhood exclusively made up of hotels  all of which look identical  We rang the bell  and an old Indian woman answered  grinning widely and beckoning us in  With various gestures  she directed us to our room  in the basement  through a door  and off a long  strange smelling hallway  The room was a quad  large enough  with a window looking up to the street  The beds sported somewhat objectionable purple blankets with small stains  but the sheets were clean and comfortable  Overall  the room was plain and unexciting The bathroom was at the end of the hall  through a door marked Fire Escape  and was large enough to fit two small corpses with a little shoving  The shower was clean  but tall individuals will hit their heads on the shower head  and clumsy individuals will knock off the soap dispenser  Not a pleasant experience  but an educational one Breakfast was served in a small room at the other end of the basement  It was presided over by Sohil  who made toast  Also available were corn flakes  coffee  tea  and orange juice  The meal was bleak but did the job We checked out in the morning but needed a place to leave our luggage till that night  and Sohil was kind enough to keep it past       on the condition that we let him arrange the taxi to take us to LTN that night  We agreed  as we had been wanting to take a classic London cab anyway  We all joked that we would end up getting one of the pink ones  never dreaming that we would end up in a different type of car altogether  The driver tried to take us on tours and charge us extra  and nearly broke down  
N =>   Great stay at Bakers Hotel A group of   of us stayed at the Bakers Hotel this past weekend for two nights  We stayed in a quad room  which was on the top floor so we had tons of stairs to climb with our heavy luggage  That was not a surprise though  and that was the only negative about our stay  The room was clean  and a decent enough size  fairly small  but really all we needed  There were two shared washrooms with showers to use  Although the hotel was at full capacity when we were there we never had to wait to use them  The water pressure was very good and it was hot  The receptionist was very nice and helpful  and we were able to store our luggage with them before we checked in and after we checked out  We never went down for the free breakfast as we aren t really breakfast people so I can t comment on that  The location of the hotel was the main reason for us choosing it  it was an easy walk to Victoria station  and you could also walk to Buckingham Palace  Westminster Abbey  Big Ben etc  Overall we had a great stay and would come back to this hotel if we were in London again  For the price we paid it was excellent  
N =>  Close to Victoria Station The hotel was close to Victoria station    minutes walk   Hotel staff was friendly and room was clean  Linens were only changed once in the week we stayed there  Room was in the basement and HOT  no airconditioning or fan and only a little window   Breakfast was boring  but the coffee was wonderful  
N =>   hotel loin de la station de m tro  
N => Avoid at ALL costs literally like the plague It has been the tradition of our group to stay at Bankside for   nights at the end of y for several years and normally it has not been an issue  However  this past year was the worst experience  When we first arrived it was caotic because the front desk did not seem to know how to handle our size group despite the fact there were about    other groups there as well  My roomate and I walked into our room and were greeted by the stench of urine and a wet carpet  The curtain was only half on the wall and the shower curtain lay in the middle of the floor  We both agreed not to try and take a shower unless necessary  Good thing too  When we did finally use the shower it was on for no longer than    mins before it flooded the whole room  The front desk staff was very unhelpful aside from getting us a new room  They still expected us to move back into the old room in the morning  but we were able to avoid that  They acted like it was our fault for flooding the room when there was no way that it could have been  There were several groups of teenagers middle school children around who were noisy at all hours and they were rude  Also since we were staying during the swine flu issue  and there were several rumored cases in the building  This was by far the worst place to stay in London  
N =>  Pentonville prison would be a better bet Having looked at the LSE website  I was optimistic about our stay  A pity that my optimism was unfounded  Apart from the location  I can find nothing at all positive to say about this accommodation  The room resembled a prison cell and contained a bare table  a plastic chair and two  single  folding beds  I would HATE to be one of the students who has to use this place for a whole term semester There was building work going on next door and a mechanical digger was ripping up concrete from      each morning  We asked to move room to be away from the noise and were told we couldn t as the place was full  We asked to cancel the rest of our stay as we weren t happy and were told that no refunds would be given  How can an operation be allowed to get away with such a shoddy attitude The place was swarming with surly teenagers and the staff had no absolutely control over them  I can t think of enough negatives to describe this place  Avoid it like the plague  If I could give a rating worse than  quot Terrible quot   I would  
N =>  Good location and price bad otherwise Stayed there for nine nights in y  At that time  the hotel was overrun by pre teen and teen school trips making it busy and loud up until curfew    pm and later  depending on whether or not it was a weeknight   We were unfortunate to be facing the same side as the front door and lobby where all the loitering took place The best thing about the place was the location    if you were walking  It was close to many of the city s attractions such as the London Eye  St  Paul s Cathedral  Millenium Bridge  London Aquarium  etc   etc   Most evenings we were able to enjoy strolls along the Thames taking in the sights and sounds  Unfortunately  the hotel was not really close to any subway station    walking briskly it would take about    to    minutes to get there Our room was not so great  It appeared to be single dorm room that was converted to a double when they crammed in a second bed  It was also dirty  see the carpet in the attached picture   The cleaning staff came every day to take the garbage but they didn t clean the room  They changed the paper thin  hand size  towels every three days so if you want to dry yourself after showering I would recommend bringing a larger towel yourself or purchasing one at Harrods  The cleaning staff was generally approachable  so long as they were not busy talking on their cell phones The breakfast was decent as long as you got there early  The cafeteria staff were really cranky and expected you to know all the rules on the first day  be it was having to deal with all the noisy kids  The fire alarm went off several times  including several time on our last night when we had to be up early the next morning  At    GBP a night  you couldn t expect much more given the hotel s location  Would most likely not stay there again  
N => Simple hotel good location Overall the hotel provided exactly what we needed   a base for a   day sighting seeing trip around London  The location was good since it was right near the Earl s Court Station that allowed us to get everywhere we wanted to go  Otherwise there was not much near the hotel The room was actually bigger than anticipated  It was very basic though  Only negative was that the one women at the desk wasn t helpful at all with any of our questions  Would recommend for a basic sightseeing stay  
N =>   Completely satisfied  This hotel was excellent for what we wanted   a real London atmosphere in a great section of the city  at reasonable cost  The room was modest size   no problem for us as we knew what to expect   and charmingly furnished  The bathroom was modern and clean  No problem  The staff was fine  although we had no special requests Someone who wants an American type room may not be as happy as we were  it s just a matter of taste  
N =>   Listen to the bad reviews   trust me this isn t a bearable cheap hotel Seriously  you may see the bad reviews and think   quot They re just being prissy  but I m a real traveler   I can handle a bit of old and in need of renovation  I m just going to be sleeping there  quot Do yourself a favour  Go onto Google  search  quot barkston gardens cockroach quot    quot barkston gardens lice quot    quot barkston gardens bedbugs quot    quot barkston gardens scabbies quot    quot barkston gardens rats quot  and  quot barkston gardens pests quot It s not even that the rooms are that ugly   and don t get me wrong  they are ugly  For the price you re paying  it s unreasonable ugly  They re on par with hostels  but you re paying    pound a night for a single room  Mine had dead cockroaches in the bathroom  The  quot bed quot  is actually two couch things nailed together  It slants to one side and slowly dumps you out of bed As for the location that everyone totes as being so convenient  Earls Court is not a nice part of town by any description  It s close enough to the airport  but to be honest  provided you can carry your bags or pay five quid for a cab  go to the Stratford Hotel Ibis  Yeah it s more expensive  but it s a hotel you can not dread coming back to  
N =>   Not a bad word to say against this hotel  I recently travelled to London with my friend  and we had booked this hotel upon recommendation of her family  When we arrived  the staff were decent  and we were told our room was on the ground floor  which we were happy with  The room was at the end of a maze of corridors  and I was most definitely pleasantly surprised with what awaited us  The room was meant to be a twin room  but it had a double bed  as well as a single  It was clean  quiet and comfortable  We managed to get an excellent deal on the room  so were delighted with the quality  The only small complaint that I would have was that the carpet was worn away in one place  but the next day it had been covered by a mat Breakfast was included in our offer  and it was grand  Location of the hotel was excellent   Earl s Court is a lovely area  honestly have no complaints at all  
N =>   Dirty  Hotel was in a great location because it was a block away from the underground tube BUT I couldn t take the disgusting room  We both got violently ill  although this could have been from food as well   The room  I don t even know where to begin  Dirt grime  not stains  on curtains  windows  floors  coffee pot  everywhere in bathroom  baseboards  etc  I even found clipped pieces of wire in the bed  We asked to move rooms but the next one was even worse  I can take creaky floors  old everything  this hotel desperately needs an update   some dust and dirt but this is worse than any military barracks I have stayed in  This wouldn t even qualify as a one star in the US and the Heath Dept would have shut this hotel down Looks are deceiving  The outside and lobby is gorgeous  We were so happy when we first arrived  until we saw our room   There is no way that the housekeepers vacuum  wash the curtains  dust  etc  I have no idea what they are being paid for except to change the sheets and I am not sure they were changed  If you are homeless  you will enjoy this hotel  especially the location  If you vacuum once a year or wash dishes twice a year  you will still find this place the most gross hotel you have encountered  depending on your room   th floor disgusting but so are the stairs throughout  Staff was pretty bad  There was only one nice one  a gentleman that was nice working at night  There was a snooty  skinny blonde  believe English  that wasn t boasting with cheer and an okay front desk clerk  This hotel ruined our perception of London By the way  free internet but doesn t work on top floors    
N =>   You d have to be barking mad to stay at Barkston Gardens Three star hotels are notoriously Dickensian in London and can t generally be relied upon as they can in Paris and other world capitols  We spent one night in a ground floor room of this  quot hotel quot  if it can be called that   it is more akin to an crumbling old rooming house than to a proper hotel  It wasn t very reassuring to find a rat trap under our bed and when we inquired of the gentleman at reception he couldn t garantee that we wouldn t have a rat as a third guest in the room  The hotel s pipes and wires come through un insulated openings large enough to admit even the largest of vermin because the owners are too cheap to properly renovate this old carcass of a hotel with its rabbit warren like corridors  We were fortunately not visited by rats but  when we had to change rooms the second night due to a previously booked customer  we were shown the only room available   a basement room with a strong odor of mold  We naturally objected and found a proper room for only slightly more and slightly further out in a four star hotel  I don t know how hotels such as the Barkston Gardens gets away with it but no self respecting guest should ever have to opt for a moldy room  even at      per night  It s insulting to be shown such a room and would certainly be unhealthy to have to stay in one  Only London could pass off such a disaster as the Barkston Gardens as a hotel  Any other city in Europe or the US would have it torn down as a health threat  Even four star hotels in London have to be carefully scrutinized by the hapless guest for cleanliness and lack of vermin  If the Barkston Gardens Hotel were a kennel  I would even have reservations about leaving my dog there as it is fit only for mad dogs and Englishmen with no self respect  
N =>   Excellent We stayed at this hotel from  th to   th ust in a double ensuite room  room number     on the  nd floor   The room was quite spacious  if compared to what you usually get in London for      and the bathroom was big as well At the time of booking we decided to have continental breakfast only  but you may also have your breakfast being served in your room if you pay a      extra  The staff was EXTREMELY polite and helpful  On Sunday morning breakfast is available from  am  but we had to leave the hotel very early to participate in a day tour outside London  A member of the staff asked us what time we wanted to have breakfast and the day of the tour he proposed us to prepare our breakfast at  am just to do us a favour  Excellent service and very helpful staff In addition to this  the hotel s location is excellent  Earl s Court tube station is just a stone s throw  less than     metres   there you can decide whether to take a Districy Circle or Piccadilly train to reach the city centre  In this area there are lots of restaurants and pubs which are open until late That was the  th time that I had stayed in a hotel in London and Barkston Gardens Hotel was the best one I would recommend this hotel without hesitation Abbiamo soggiornato al Barkston Gardens Hotel dal   al    di Agosto      in una doppia con servizi in camera  stanza      al secondo piano con ascensore   La stanza era abbastanza larga  soprattutto se si considerano gli standard londinesi Il nostro   stato un ottimo affare perch   prenotando con largo anticipo  abbiamo concordato la tariffa di     a notte per camera con la colazione continentale compresa nel prezzo  Lo staff   stato decisamente gentile e a nostra completa disposizione  Visto che la domenica mattina la colazione viene servita a partire dalle   ma noi dovevamo partire per un tour molto presto  credevamo che quel giorno avremmo perso la nostra colazione  Un membro dello staff ci ha domandato a che ora avessimo bisogno di partire e ci ha proposto di scendere in sala colazioni all ora desiderata anche se il servizio non era ancora ufficialmente disponibile  E  stato molto gentile da parte sua  noi non avevamo insistito ma lui ha voluto farci questo piacere  Assolutamente apprezzabile Per quanto riguarda la posizione dell hotel  bisogna ammettere che   ottima  la stazione della metro di Earl s Court   davvero a due passi  direi a meno di    metri  La zona   tranquilla  piuttosto turistica e infatti ci sono molti pub  ristoranti  super e mini market aperti anche fino a tardi Questa   stata la nostra quarta volta a Londra in hotel di questa categoria e devo ammettere che il Barkston Gardens   stata una piacevole scoperta  il migliore rispetto a tutti quelli visitati fino al momento  Per concludere  ottima posizione  ottimo servizio  grande disponibilit   stanze sufficientemente spaziose  colazione o servizio in camera fino alle    di sera con il supplemento di       a camera   buona la colazione  eccellente rapporto qualit  prezzo Vi torneremo sicuramente Consiglio questo hotel senza esitazioni  
N =>   TERRIBLE customer service rude staff We had booked a four night stay at this hotel via HRS  but decided over a week in advance that we wanted to go to the countryside on the third night  wishing to retain nights      and    HRS does not allow you to amemd your booking to drop a  middle  night  so we called the hotel directly from abroad  at some expense     The receptionist advised us that we would have to re book the fourth night at    pounds higher per night than the rate we had locked in via HRS    She spoke heavily accented english which we could barely understand  and was incredibly rude  at one point calling us stupid   And an email to the manager still has no response    hours later     BEWARE     
N =>   Still A Good Hotel But    Once again we stayed at this hotel  for ease of travel it could not be better  value for money was excellent  a large double room for     pn   booked through expedia  in the heart of London has got to be a good deal we like to stay on the top floor   th  as the floorboards are still squeaking and no one above to annoy you Still a problem with hot water but enough to get a good wash  though the shower on occassions was slower Wrote to the hotel last year about new windows as still using the old wooden sash type but noticed that they were still the same apart from this it ios a little gem and well worth it  after all you only need a bed at night and could not find them more comfortable  
N =>   Great location good value Basic budget hotel  Fab location  just a few yards from Earls Court Tube station  Creaky floors  little insulation  we ended up with room       a bit more secluded than most others   They were doing a bit of work on the electrical wires when we arrived and our room had two electricians in it upon arrival  but seconds later we where on out way to another  and a bit larger  room A bit tired but clean and nice  Perfect when travelling to from London via Heathrow  And at     a night it was well worth it Hotel also has a luggage room for late depratures  like ours  Didn t try the breakfast as we opted to eat at a nearby pub  The Courtfield   cooked English breakfast from        
N =>  average stay I stayed in London at this hotel from e the  nd to e  th on my way to Athens   Hotel is close to Earls Court station so easy to access from Heathrow  had asked a single room but had a double room though did not like the beds at all found them uncomfortable   very hot when in London and the room was unbearable due to hot weather  i did not see any fan in the room  guess should have asked for it   rooms were spacey by London values but basic and tired   Lobby is good and welcoming  breakfast continental and was included but nothing special about it  though for me it was enough I did not find it very clean and that made me kind of uneasy Staff except one dark brown hair one who was nice the rest were totally average in being helpful and in their customer service  I guess for the price i paid it was good but overall i do not like the Earls court area and prefer Knights Bridge so far  was on a budget this time   have decided to try a new area each time in London   will stay there only if it is a short stay and not during the summer and if i do not find a better one  
N =>   No value for money The rooms were hot  no air conditioning or fans  no bar fridge  Furniture was old and falling apart  Had kettle but no lead  Bed cover and carpets were dirty  Had to keep asking where bar staff were when you wanted a drink  Only served breakfast   no other meals as dining room semi closed  
N =>   we found a cockroach in our bed  do not stay in the basement  this hotel was good value for london and in a great location  initially  we stayed in a sixth floor room which was fine  but on the second to last night we were moved to a basement room  long story  and in the morning found a COCKROACH in our bed  IN THE BED   i can only imagine it crawled under the covers with us some time during the night   we freaked  were moved to the sixth floor  and no more cockroaches  but DO NOT stay in the basement  COCKROACHES  
N =>   excellent value close to tube station really clean close to tube station was really easy to find  first impressions from outside was ok but lobby was nice and spacious  We found all the staff really nice and helpful  Our room was small but it was just enough space as we were gone most of the day anyway  Initally the room was warm when we arrived but the fan cooled the room down in no time at all  Our room was really clean and we had maid service and towel change every day  Only thing we weren t really keen on was the continental breckfast appart from that everything was great When we checked out there was a luggage room provided so we could collect it later  It was in a quiet area so it was easy to sleep  appart from the odd noisy guest in the hotel itself  
N =>   It was ok nothing spectacular  Fodor s recommended this budget hotel and from the photos on TA  I thought it would be great for the      I was paying considering everything else I could find in a nice area of London was      or more for   adults  myself and my    and    year old   The Barkston is an old quirky hotel   it was like walking through a maze getting to our room because of all the closed fired doors and listening to the floor creak  but yet it brought you back in time so I didn t really mind that  But there is no air conditioning so I wouldn t stay here in the summer  We had a bottom floor room facing the street so leaving the window open  and only one window opens about   inches  made me a little nervous but it was way too hot otherwise and we were there     when the night temperature was in the    s  A small fan provided helped  but I know it would probably be miserable if it was any hotter outside  And I was a little disappointed that we didn t get a room in the building over the court as pictured  The Barkston is actually on two sides of the street  The one side where you check in  is a pretty white building and then across the street is the huge red brick courtyard building that s in the photos Convenience to the tube is excellent  As soon as you exit Earl s Court tube  turn right  Barkston Gardens is either the first or second street you see  There are no street signs  you must look on the corners of the buildings for the street names    and not all corners have them  unfortunately for the lost  but Barkston Gardens is named The family room we had was a good size room with high ceilings  The single and double bed were comfortable enough but they had set up a pull out couch bed that my daughter slept in  She said it was ok but when I sat on it  I felt it was awful    sinking in the center and lumpy mattress  The staff overall were excellent  Very friendly and helpful  Only one lady should be fired  She was a   ish blond women with glasses at the front desk upon our check in  She was cool towards us which I don t care  but I watched as she was downright rude to her co worker and while the co worker was trying to assist an Asian women who was struggling with english  she told the co worker to just charge the woman  knowing the foreign lady could not understand that she was going to be charged  When the foreign lady was trying to question or understand  the blond woman shoved our key to us  basically we were dismissed   raised her voice and started berating the Asian woman  Later on when we were leaving  I mentioned to her that the toilet in our room didn t flush  She made a face and said she would send someone to fix it  When we got back   hours later  it was clear no one ever came or was in our room  The next morning  a gentleman was behind the desk and I again mentioned the toilet  Because they are old  you have to pump the water in to flush it  He explained to me how to do it and the problem was solved The continental breakfast was ok    cereal  croissants  toast  ham and cheeses  Continental was included in our price but I wouldn t have paid for it otherwise We were only in London for   days so the Barkston was satisfactory  If we had to stay longer  I m not sure this would be my choice and I ve never been to London before so maybe this is typical  
N =>  Pleasantly surprised  I spent a Saturday night here and was pleasantly surprised by this hotel  I wasn t expecting much due to the price  amp  location  which were both very good   but this hotel has everything you need  Yes  decor was generally a bit tired  but if you want sparkling new  amp  modern you will have to pay more  Service was good  I actually booked a single room  but they gave me a double   I guess because it was available  which was good of them as it wasn t necessary  Sheets were clean  bathroom was clean and location was lovely   overlooking a small park and off the main road so was really quiet for central London   and on a Saturday night  so I was expecting the worst  Literally   min walk to earls court tube  One not so good thing   even though it was only   C outside the room was very warm  even with the windows open  However  a free standing fan is provided   another unexpected touch  so this quickly reduced the room temperture  and it ran quietly  so I left it on overnight  However  I don t think this would be a comfortable place to stay in he height of summer  Overall though I would defintely use it again if I needed to stay in a central location in London that was good value for money  Oh yes  and checkout is   noon   so no rush to leave  which is a bonus if the night before was spent in Soho  
N =>   Great location    sour finish You can t ask for better in regards to location  We spent four nights at the end of ch  You also get a decent sized room and bathroom for the price you pay  Unfortunately  the shower was awful and almost unusable  we ended up having to be creative to not burn or freeze  The cooked breakfast was really greasy  deep fried everything  and definitely not recommended  We changed our mind on the last day and ordered only the continental breakfast  which we were told was fine   however  they charged us for two cooked breakfast anyways  When we mentioned it  the man who said he was the day manager was very rude and refused to change our bill before he charged our credit card  When I emailed the main manager  she replied that we would have had to cancel our room booking while at the hotel and then rebook in order not to be charged the extra amount  
N =>   Great location Me and and two friends stayed here friday to sunday   this hotel is great location for underground and lots of places to eat and drink in earls court  The room was clean  the beds were good although I had the sofa bed   not comfy at all but I slept so was okay  Bathroom was large   we had hot water which was good but the shower sprayed water all over the floor   but we didn t care coz we had hot water was the main thing and it was fast hot water  The manager was very friendly when we came for continental breakfast  Staff are friendly  I would recommend this hotel  
N =>   Location is great   Hotel is not  I live in Chicago and am no stranger to tired buildings but this one needs to be retired  The place looked old and worn out but I thought it was at least clean   until the cockroach crawled across the floor  I am sure everybody will not have this same experience but after checking in and dropping off our luggage we left to go check out the neighborhood  When we returned back to the hotel we found that our key did not work nor did the other   keys that were made for us at the front desk  It ended up that the hotel maintenance was not able to get our door open until the next morning at about   am and our luggage was still in the room  We were put up at their sister hotel and given free cab fare to and from there  Seeing as we did not have any of our luggage and were locked out of our room for roughly    hours it was a major inconvenience and I really do not think the situation was handled very well It has been a while but I think they did not even comp that night and were given the excuse that they couldn t because we booked through Expedia  If you stay here keep an open mind and make sure you bring a sense of humor   you will need it  Also  don t take any room on the  st floor   it is the basement   and from my experience that is where the cockroaches live  Last but not least  know that you get what you pay for  Good luck and enjoy your vacation  
N =>   Cheap  Booked this hotel through Alpharooms we had a   night stay for      for the both of us  Hotel is very near Earls Court tube station and shops and pubs but we did not hear any noise at night time  The room we had was done is stairs and was quite gloomy  the heating was not working but they had gave us a small heater which took the chill out of the room and we only had hot water one day  other two days the water was tepid think you have to watch what time you have your shower get up early but it had good pressure to it  The hotel is clean but a bit dated we had clean towels every day and the breakfast was ok We were hardly every in our room so we were not bothered about the down sides  I would recommend this hotel if you are looking for a cheap break in London  Gave above average for the price  
N =>   Enjoyed staying there I spent three nights in the Barkston Gardens Hotel in mid ember  The hotel web page itself seems to be the cheapest way to book a room  I am used to travelling on a budget  and I also stayed at other Earl s Court hotels before  All in all  this hotel turned out to be my best choice in the area so far  I really enjoyed my stay at Barkston Gardens very much  First of all  as many others have already noted  the location is excellent   very     close to Earl s Court Tube station but nevertheless in a quiet street  Besides the many small surrounding shops and pubs  there is also a huge Sainsbury s at just a few minutes distance at Cromwell Road Though others have criticized that the hotel might benefit from refurbishment  I found my room as well as the public area very clean  charming and cozy  The high ceilings  the big windows and the light and warm colours clearly contributed to this impression  The bed was really huge and comfortable  and the whole room was large for a London hotel  Though the heating was a bit difficult to regulate  room temperature was pleasant  There were  however  a few points that might be problematic for travellers who are used to higher standards  though they didn t bother me that much  As was also already mentioned before  water pressure could have been better  though the temperature was warm enough  Moreover  for some reason  the fire alarm turned on a few times in the middle of my first night  Finally  as this is an old building  floors tend to be rather noisy  so it might be a good idea to use earplugs in the night Hotel reception staff was ok  though they could have been a little bit more concerned  Breakfast was a rather hectic experience   though I m convinced that the staff wanted to make everything perfect  they could have been a bit more relaxed  The continental breakfast was included in the price and was really good  In sum  I really liked the place  as it is such a nice house with comfortable rooms in a great location  I will definitely try to stay there again at my next visit to London  
N =>   Dump Cracky floors  very diry carpets  walls in need of paint  dirty bed sheets  water pressure problems at the bathroom  Overall  if you can book this hotel for around   GBP its a fair deal  The facility is very below average  Not worth trying to save the extra bucks  My travel partner s room was worse and he encountered rouches    
N =>   Nice LocationMismanaged Hotel This is actually a very nice location if you want to stay in central london but i have not seen a hotel that has such an advantage but has been so poorly managed Rooms were dirty old paint on all the walls bathroom dirty    am planning to visit london again   i will give you the latest update about this hotel Frank      
N =>   Cockroach towers Well  great location  just a shame about the cockroaches  Two of us stayed here for   nights  each booked singles  and by the end of our stay we had slept in   rooms  Our first single rooms were rather grimy and at about midnight the cockroaches came out  We were given insect spray and then moved  my new room  admittedly it was the only room available and was not meant to be used due to a maintenance problem  had a sink and bath that did not drain  My colleagues room was OK  but for some reason she was moved again  this time to a room without a working shower   Our biggest gripe apart from the additional guests in our initial rooms was the general cleanliness  during our entire stay it did not appear that the stairwells and corridors were vacuumed  with food crumbs trampled into the carpet   no wonder the cockroaches enjoyed their stay  
N =>  Worst Hotel we have ever stayed at please look elsewhere     First of all the hotel receptionist didn t have a clue and she didn t care one single bit    My husband and I and our two young daughters had to get two rooms and we asked for rooms next to each other or even on the same floor   one room was on level   and the other one was level   near the basement   you had to pass   fire exits with all your luggage    we tried telling them we had to have two rooms close together as we had organised it months ago but they didn t care   It only gets worse  the room on the  th floor  i was sure that the room was going to collapse as the floor creaked every time you moved   you could not sleep at all as who the hell knows what the people above us were doing all night  it was so noisy from the creaking that we had a terrible sleepless night   The room we had down on level   was freezing   the carpet smelled like it hadn t been cleaned for   years   The bed was hard as a rock  we would have been better off sleeping on the road and im not joking  The breakfast maitre d  did not give you a chance to sit down before he shouted at you whether you wanted tea or coffee   Not much selection at breakfast at all and the staff at breakfast were so ARROGANT   I have never seen anything like this before in my life  Not one of them had a smile on their face   It really put a damper on our trip and we will be definitely telling everyone we know not to stay there   The only one good thing about that hotel was the location but at the time we stayed there there was a burst water main around the area so there were a few buses operating which made it hard   I hope this helps you and if you really want to have a good stay in London please don t stay at this hotel   
N =>   Loved the King Tut exhibition Stayed here for one night  Hotel was clean  but the room we stayed in was a bit on the small side and the carpet a bit shabby It was continental breakfast but not much choice  Overall though it was not far from the underground and would consider it to be a reasonable hotel for the price paid  
N =>  Bed infested with ticks  We stayed in the Barkston Garden Hotel recently   have to say  it was dire  One of our party had bitemarks all over her legs and arms after sleeping in the beds  the rooms were gloomy and dirty and had a peculiar pong from them Not worth it  even if you re on a budget   there are lots of decent budget hotels in London  this place is just a dump  
N =>   FIND Another hotel Worst Hotel on EARTH  Poor check in and check out service  Basement room is the pits and hard to pull luggage up and down steps  Water pressure in our room was Great at all times but dirty bathroom  
N =>   Water pressure still a problem             We have just returned from a four night stay here  The location is spot on and just across the road from the tube station  There are plenty of pubs and restaurants  Would recommend Mango bar for       cocktails before  pm  turn right out of hotel then left at Earls Court Road  its on right hand side just before O Neills  Almost opposite is the restaurant As Greek as it gets  lovely meal   beware of charming Greek waiter who doesnt speak much English      we thought he was giving us free samples of chef s starters but it turned out we got complete starters  Probably more than we originally wanted  stuffed vine leaves and excellent meat balls  but they were lovely  followed by the mixed meat platter for   at     which was excellent  Dont go to Dinos Italian however  the meal was less than mediocre Our room was      top floor at the back  so the view was not good  The room was a very good size but we have never heard floor boards that creak so much  We pitied the people who were staying in the room below us The room and bathroom could definately do with refurbishing but were passable             However           we were not prepared for the lack of water          Early morning there was no water at all from the hot tap on bathroom sink  The shower NEVER worked  so we just had baths   these did take over    mins to fill   quite a wait  The best time to take a bath we found was early evening   didnt take as long to fill the bath  The hotel reception does have a note up regarding the water pressure but we didnt expect it to be quite so bad Continental breakfast was adequate  but the toast always seemed to be burnt  Overall good  ish  hotel for the price     per room per night incl continental breakfast  booked from the hotel website  especially for London  
N => 	  s chic The welcome to the Barkston Gardens was less than friendly and the rooms don t seem to have been decorated since the   s  The carpet was worn and marked  and the throw on the bed was stained  The bathroom was very large and clean  however the water pressure could not be relied on and the shower did not always work  The location is excellent  just next to the tube station  Which is handy  as you probably won t want to hang around your room too long  
N =>   Look Elsewhere   Please  I ve used this site for many years and this the first time i ve been compelled to write a review Check in was problematic  After checking in  we were told we couldn t have the room key until  pm  at was      pm   When we did get the room key  we found out someone else was already staying in the room Finally got another key  Room itself was ok   good size Real problems started the next day  No water   we couldn t even flush the toilet  Rang reception and they had to send someone to check  We were given a key to another room to have a shower  Key didn t work  When housekeeping let me in  still no water  Luckily had a friend staying in the basement  yes  rooms starting     are in the basement  whose shower did work When we checked out  I asked for the manager  No sign of him her  We were offered     but we demanded a full refund  This was refused and then it turned out we hadn t paid   just pre authorised the amount  We left and will never return I don t like giving bad reviews  but this hotel was a disgrace  I haven t even gone into the number of people we also heard complaining about various things who were virtiually shouted at by the receptionist I was embarrased to be British as it gave such a bad impression of accommodation in this country  
N =>  Don t stay here  Dirty Worn down smelly Apart form location everything here is negative  I paid US     through hotwire  They rate it   star  It is not even   star  Small rooms  Mice in the lobby Stay away from this hotel  
N =>   Needs a renovation We were happy with the location of this hotel  Quiet neighborhood at night  but just around the corner was a bustling street with great pubs  restaurants  markets  bus stop and a subway station We had a room on the top floor  It was spacious but quite shabby  The floor was filthy with stains  We got the impression that the room was being cleaned  it was just aged   it squeaked horribly every step we took  the double bed was so small my  ft tall husbands feet were hanging off the bed  the bathroom fan was noisy  it wouldn t turn off   and the shower water fluctuated from burning hot to icy cold while showering Overall  it was a pretty sad condition for a hotel costing more than one hundred a night  
N =>  How many roaches  The first night I noticed roaches in the bathroom  Went to front desk and asked to switch rooms  The manager on duty asked me  quot How many roaches  quot       That question puzzled me because I typically sent a limit of zero in the number of roaches I wish to see in my hotel room 
N =>   good hotel Excellent location right next to the tube  Had a twin room on the first floor  Check in was excellent  Keycard entry to the rooms The room was large  Beds were good a very good hotel for what u pay will be staying there again  
N =>  Great Location I considered  quot excellent quot   but we asked  when making our reservation  for two twin beds and got a double  Location was excellent   within   blocks a great place for breakfast  a post office  cash machine andbank  Underground also within   blocks  YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY  LOCATION  LOCATION  LOCATION    The room was  interesting  to get to sort of like a maze  but once there  the room was about as spacious as one gets in Europe  I would definitely stay there again  A ks and Spencer was close by  too  for those who might want to buy food to go like fresh fruit cut in bite size pieces  or croissants  individual botted drinks  etc  Sort of a glorified      and much fresher food  My husband thought the bed was lousy  but I was OK withit  This hotel is definitely worth your consideration  
N =>   Over Rated This is a run down hotel   don t be fooled by the pictures  Probably above average for the Earl s Court area   but not much else  Close to the tube stop  Worth spending more to get to Central London  
N =>   The poorest hotel I have ever stayed in  Suggested by Travel agent in Australia and we are reporting back to them not to use Barkston Gardens for future bookings  We had the most run down room  broken bedside lamps  and old shabby dusty overhead drapping swag  lumpy old disgusting mattress and pillows  ill fitting drapes on the windows  My husband slept on the floor for three nights of the week we were booked in  we requested to the Manager for another room with single beds and he said the whole of the hotel was booked out and to ask again in the morning which we did  not to him as he was not there but to his second in charge and was told there were three twin rooms not booked by anybody and we would have to talk to him later which we did and again he insisted this time that because it was a booking through the travel agent in Australia that we could not change the booking even though my husband was very willing to pay any extras  we were not looking for refunds just an enjoyable and restfull time in London  And I will not be recommending any of our friends or those who read this to stay there  
N =>   Glad there are mixed reviews    We just got back from staying in London for   nights  We stayed at another hotel on the same street back in   so I could compare  We paid   pounds more at this hotel     pounds for a twin     people   I was worried when I found out that my son and I would be in a lower level  basement  room   but after going through several  quot Fawlty Tower quot  hallways and firedoors  we found the stair way down to our room  The room was better than I had anticipated on our way down  It was spacious  reasonable light and ventilization  although there wasn t a window in the bathroom  The bathroom and the bedroom were both in good repair  The TV was pretty small   but that s not why we travelled to London  And location   Earl s Court is a terrific compromise between price and convenience  I was concerned about writing too positive of a review  because I know that we will probably return  and I didn t want the hotel to raise their rates  I guess it really comes down to the room you are assigned  And fortunately  we won out this time  
N =>   I have to question everyone who liked it I stayed in this hotel a few years ago and it was a dump  There is no other way to describe it  I was in London for a few days and I changed right away and learned immediately that when it comes to hotels  the terms  Nice  affordable and London or even adequate  affordable and London are oxymorons  Anyway  the Barkston Terrace by any criteria was a dump  When people describe this as great  I have to question their judgment  How do I describe a dump  well  the creaky floors  the window that opened up to some grimy backstreet  an ugly carpet that didn t mask the creaking  a window that had to be forced open and held open by a stick  the tininess of the room  I mean  I could go on and on  I find these places insulting except that they are all like this  I have yet to find an affordable  nice room of a decent size in London  Also the service was totally indifferent  I called the UK expedia number to change the hotel and it cost me eleven pounds  even though it was a local number Who knows  maybe its better now  although I doubt it  
N =>  Good value for London We stayed at the Barkston Gardens in the Earl s Court section of London  the last week of y      I had read many reveiws both on TripAdvisor and other places  so did not have any great preconceived notions  It is a fairly basic hotel  Right around the corner from the Underground  and very convenient to many shops and restaurants  The hotel itself is nothing really special  but  by London standards was more than adequate  We were there during a heat wave  and there is no air conditioning  I knew this going in  and  had taken the time to email the hotel several months in advance  specifically requesting a fan  When we first checked in  we were told there was no way to guarantee a fan until the morning when people checked out  so the maids could find one and bring it to us  The first room we were given was a smoking room  without a fan  and quite small  We switched to another  non smoking  room  which was somewhat larger and had a fan   although it was basically ineffectual  but  better than none at all The bed was full size  and okay  The room was equipped with an electric tea kettle  but the instant coffee was awful  The tea was fine  The bathroom was very roomy  but oddly  had a half glass shower  quot curtain quot   I was with my husband  but  if you are modest about showering  it is a bit odd  not to mention water got all over the floor  The shower pressure was great The hotel has a breakfast  which was good  and a small bar with one computer with internet access  They also have free wireless in the common areas too  The TV in the room only got a few stations  but  we didn t really care  Overall  it was very convenient  and served our purposes fine  With everything so expensive in London  we preferred to spend our money on our experiences  and dinners  rather than a lavish hotel  I would reccomend this hotel to other travelers  It s a good value for the money  
N =>  A good experience We stayed at the Barkston Gardens in Kensington  London at the beginning of e       Apart from the rather unfriendly frontdesk staff  it was a good experience  Our room was clean  the size adequate  and the overall impression fine  We can recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a conveniently situated  minutes from Earl s Court station  hotel at affordable rates M de Villiers  South Africa 
N => Great locationQuaint and Quiet Went to London for Wimbledon tennis but did not want to stay too near to it though Train came in at Euston and it was so easy to use the tube stations  Arrived at Earl s Court tube and Barkston Gardens Hotel was across the road and turn left  Did not have to travel far to find it  A pleasant Hotel  very quaint and quiet  Room was big enough Tea and coffee facilities on hand  Choice of complimentary continental breakfast or English for a couple of pounds more  Bed was very comfortable  Room was hot no air con but they do have a fan in the room which was good  It is probably not usually this hot in England  so it would probably be ok any other time of the year but we did go in between the   day heatwave that they had  It was in the    s  Just got back to the North of England to find that tennis is called off because of rain  Staff where very friendly and at our request they let us put our coolpacks in the freezer overnight  Hotel very close to Restaurants and other eateries  Also foodstores and an open   hr Tesco  Would stop at this Hotel again  
N =>  good customer serviceold hotelnasty bathroom i was in london on summer vacation from august  rd to the  th I decided to go to the barkston hotel because it came up as a three star hotel when i looked on line I noticed that they have a very good customer service  however the rooms are small and too ugly There was something wrong with the bathroom  the hot water does not mix with the cold water which makes it really hard to take a shower You get one side of the tap pouring out water as hot as hell and the otherside of the same tap with cold water The hotel has a nice location but they need to do a whole lot of renovation  
N =>  Filthy Terrible Experience  
N =>   horrible  
N =>   non economico ma semplicemente il prezzo giusto per un ostello con camere doppie  
N =>  No lo recomendar a a nadie  
N =>  No era lo que mes esperaba  
N => Smart comfortable hotel We just returned from a long weekend in London staying at the Place Stay  It was not our first choice but our usual B amp B was fully booked so we had to find someplace else  Very modern and clean  Well run with very comfortable rooms  excellent showers  and efficient elevators  Free WiFi in room  On the downside  it was more expensive than our usual B amp B hotel and did not serve breakfast but the room did have a nicely equipped kitchen nook complete with tableware  complimentary tea and coffee  kettle  microwave and refrigerator  The location too was a bit far away from the Theatre district and Oxford St  Covent Garden Soho  our customary haunts  but very convenient to the Earls Court underground station  Buy an Oyster card for convenient bus and tube travel  For overpriced London  I would say this hotel represents decent value and would not hesitate in recommending it to adults with or without children  
N => Modern clean convenient and affordable  We were pleasantly surprised with base stay Kensington  All staff members were helpful and courteous  Our double room was reasonably priced  but really small  It wasn t a big deal since we really just needed to sleep there  not hang out  Modern decor in a charming old Kensington neighborhood  Good closet space and nice kitchenette with mini fridge all hidden behind closet doors  We received     off coupons to local restaurants from the front desk  The hotel is a very short walk to the Earl s Court tube station and we were able to travel all around London with great ease  We would definitely stay here again on our next visit to London  
N =>   Met  Even exceeded expectations  This was our first trip to London  We were so pleased and impressed with our choice to use Base stay  The hotel is so close to Earl s Court Tube  We quickly became experts at using the Tube for all our excursions in London  There were plenty of fun restaurants and pubs within walking distance of the hotel  We used the recommendations and discount coupons offered to us by the wonderful staff at the hotel and thoroughly enjoyed every meal  We also made use of the lovely  quot kitchen closet quot  for breakfast and snacks  I would recommend strolling over to the nearby ks and Spencer to purchase breakfast items  We loved the variety of interesting juices and excellent instant porridge cups for breakfast each day  The bed was cozy  temperature controls worked well  the shower was heavenly with big  fluffy towels  Free internet access was somewhat clumsy  but we were able to check our e mails  This hotel lived up to all the reviews I read before booking it  The size comfort and ammenities of the room  proximity to Tube  and helpfulness of the staff made it an excellent choice in lodging  So glad we found Base stay  
N =>   Comfy plush clean modern hotel Really nice clean hotel  super staff  very convenient location  easy to get around  cool shower          pay for a room not amenities  who sleeps in a bar or restaurant    
N =>   Great location   modern unclutered and well cleaned rooms base stay is really conveniently located in Kensington which is a nicer part of London and the hotel is therefore not cheap  Close to Earl s Court where there was a good range of meal choices  as the hotel doesn t have a restaurant   We were easily able to get big English breakfasts at local pubs and cafes in addition to meals at other local restaurants  The rooms were smallish but well appointed and tidy  Could have benefited from a luggage stand rack  but there is space under the bed to store luggage when not in use  Staff were friendly and very helpful  The only complaint I d have about this hotel was that they claimed to provide free broadband internet access  in addition to WiFi   But to use it  in a system which uses the TV as a monitor for internet access  without your own laptop was painfully clunky   ended up going to a local Internet cafe  
N =>   Nice Place To Stay The staff were very friendly and helpfull  The rooms were spotless  The mattress was the best one we had on our week long journey  Very close to tube station  We would stay here again    
N =>  Modern budget hotel perfect for anyone who wants a bit of luxury at an affordable price Great location  modern  comfortable room with all amenities at an affordable price  Made several changes to booking prior to stay with no problem from reception staff  Being a group booking we were given two ground floor rooms with adjoining patio which was perfect  The only negative was that although we did arrive early  we were not given access to both our rooms  even though it was obvious from the outside patio area of the one room that the other room was ready for use  Fantastic location and lovely hotel  I would definately stay here again 
N =>  Just fine Base stay is a good place to stay  Friendly staff  very helpful  very clean rooms and bathrooms    minutes walk to the underground  green policy  internet      Like it should be Thanks  
N =>   Excellent hotel for west of London Attending a conference at Kensington Town Hall  I was very fortunate to find base stay  The rooms are well designed and well equipped  Not huge  but this is pretty normal for London  The staff are friendly and helpful  The free WLAN worked just fine  The desk included a European style plug socket in addition to the UK socket  which was a nice touch and let me plug my laptop in without digging the converter out  Not important for everyone  but I live and die by my morning shower  the showers here were great  as compared to some places I ve been where you get a trickle of luke warm water  My only suggestion for improvement  in ober  it s perhaps not the wisest move to leave the air con on and set at   C  on arrival   
N =>   noisy if your room faces road     location   good      staff  all friendly except one lady who wasn t particularly friendly and didn t seem like she liked negative feedback       furnishing   great  my wife particularly like the kitchenette and the heated towel rails      sound proofing   TERRIBLE    Every step made by the occupant above you could be heard i stayed   nights   first night in a standard room  in room L    and the subsequent   nights in a superior room  in room L     the first night was generally ok but the subsequent   nights was far from perfect  the main problem was noise  L   faces the road which was about   meters away  every single vehicle that passed by could be heard clearly and even pedestrians walking was disturbing i  complained  to the front desk but was firmly told that there was nothing they could do since the hotel was fully booked  i would only recommend this hotel if you can get a room that is not facing the road  i was informed that there were about    such rooms in total   
N =>   overhyped and overpriced just returned from a stay in this hotel and slightly disappointed the mini kitchen is no more than a cupboard and nowhere to sit down to eat told when booking that we had connecting rooms for our family but on arrival had been allocated   separate rooms area is ok but nearer to Earls Court than Kensington and didn t feel safe walking back from tube station at night rooms cleaned every day and washing up done which was good  reception staff not that helpful when we wanted a taxi for the station when leaving  
N =>   not as great as everyone makes out   relieved i got a discount price Was expecting amazing things from this hotel as the reviews on here are consistently great  I have to say I came away feeling disappointed  The staff weren t particularly friendly  the room was fine but was at the front of the building in the basement so was horribly noisy about  am and both mornings I stayed  I was woken by the laundry people banging around which was awful  The room could have been cleaner  The bathroom was awesome and the carpet was soft  But apart from that  it was just an average hotel  I got a really good discount so was  satisfied  with my stay  If i had paid full price  I would have been furious about the noise and more disappointed than I am  Wouldn t rush back  
N =>   I would stay there again Hotel was in a good location  Staff were helpful and room was very clean  Nicely decorated  Had TV  wifi  broadband  microwave  fridge and decent china and cutlery  China and cutlery was clean  not chipped or dented  Nice bathroom  decent toiletries Blow dryer was actually decent  a powerful one   they are usually pretty crappy in hotels Room was very small but very compact  Luggage had to be stowed under the bed  I disliked this as I like having my luggage open on those luggage stands  Only other negative was it would have been nice to have a box of tissues instead of a packet of tissues  
N =>   A great location to consider like home After   times  I consider this hotel like my second house  I coudn t think to be in no other hotel in London and everything works fine  
N =>   great place to stay for a short business trip The staff were very friendly and courteous  The room was very clean and tidy  They only need to put directions from the rooms to the elevator as it s not obvious how to find it  especially when you re carrying luggage up or down the stairs  
N =>   The only hotel I will return to on my next London visit  Overall  my experience at Base Stay was impeccable  From the moment I walked in I felt like I was in a   star hotel  and the staff were the most helpful people I met in London throughout my entire stay My friend and I shared a Twin King Room which was more than enough room  and we made great use of the kitchen by microwaving our meals and keeping our groceries ice cold in the handy fridge  The shower was MASSIVE and I loved the temperature control handle   In particular  Ashleigh and Tony were amazing hosts and went above and beyond the call of duty to make our stay comfortable  Ashleigh went to so much effort to assist us and made sight seeing a breeze  The one and ONLY downfall the hotel had was that our beds were not changed for the entire   days that we were there  but that was a small price to pay considering the amazing location  staff  and service We will definitely recommend Base Stay to anyone thinking of going to London and I can t wait to return  
N =>   We hope to stay at Base stay again The hotel was perfect for us  The desk staff was friendly and helpful  the room was very clean and comfortable  it was close to the tube  and the price was right  
N =>   Best place to stay in London I have stayed in London a number of times and have to agree with all the other reviews   this is a GREAT place to stay  Convenient to everything  lovely room  great staff  We had a room on the lower floor and it was SO quiet you wouldn t even know you were in a big city  Air conditioning was very welcome as it was hot in London while we were there  Won t be staying anywhere else on visits to London  
N =>   Everything was as promised You alway wonder  after booking a hotel based on tripadvisor reviews  whether it will live up to your expectations  Well  base stay lived up to all expectations   and more  We arrived at   am  well before check in time   meaning to drop off our bags and check in later  But  we were told that a room was ready for us   and we were immediately  quot at home quot   We had a lovely quiet outlook over green gardens  Everything was just right   the hidden kitchen  the internet  the large bathroom  the comfy bed  And after check out  we left our luggage for safe keeping  then were given a place to freshen up at the end of our day before we left the city  Just wonderful  So  we were able to utilize the services of base stay for about    hours  with a one night stay    quite amazing  Thanks for providing a base for us in London  
N =>   Everything About The Stay Was Wonderful  We found the rooms to be comfortable  the staff to be very accommodating  The location was perfect for our needs  
N =>   One of the best stays I ve ever had in England  I was unfamiliar with the hotel when booking  but just needed a place to stay for one night in London before we caught a flight the next morning back to the states  My wife and I  with   children in tow   yr and  yr  weren t sure what to expect  I ve stayed at some high price places in London previously that would have been condemned in most other cities  Imagine our surprise at Base Stay  From the moment we walked in we were welcomed warmly and thoroughly by the staff  They were all very pleasant and their customer service could have been used for a training seminar The hotel itself was had all of the attributes that we truly value in a place to stay  It was very clean  all the way from reception and through the halls and the room and bathroom  It had a TV that actually worked  as opposed to     of other places we stayed in which the TV is nothing more than a prop  The bathroom was exceptional with a shower large enough for this husky gentleman and water pressure that actually made you feel clean  not just damp  The price was extremely reasonable If I had to throw in a few cons  they are not much different from other hotels in London  The hallways are narrow  and even if you use the elevator  lift  you still might end up navigating a couple of small sets of stairs  The rooms are also quite small  although the way they are arranged  even fitting   adults and   small  or one medium  heh  children does not feel cramped Overall it s the perfect place to stay in London and next time we visit  I ll make sure this is our main stay instead of just a stopover  
N =>   Good location pleasant staff clean but small rooms We were there for   nights    rooms in early ust  Close to underground  nice neighborhood  very pleasant staff  Rooms very small but since we were only there for   nights  it was not an issue   Had rooms on top floor  very quiet  Small issue with rates but was resolved later  in my favor   Would definitely return to this hotel but would book larger room if stay is longer than   nights  
N =>   Great stay  We really enjoyed our week stay at Base Stay  The staff was extremely helpful in helping book a couple of tours and also with providing restaurant recommendations and directions  I would definitely recommend anyone wanting a good experience to stay at Base Stay  
N =>   Great place to stay in central London I would thoroughly recommend Base stay as a stopover in central London  Room was small but had everything I needed  The staff were friendly and nothing was too much trouble  Would definately stay here again  
N =>   base feel comfortable the hotel is a really nice and cosy place to stay  it s stylish but not overdone  just the right style to feel relaxed after a long shopping tour with your best friend  
N =>  Great hotel Terrific location    minute walk from Tube station  clean  neat room  double was not huge but comfortable   great shower  Extremely warm and friendly staff  Highly recommended  
N =>   Excellent hotel Great location within walking distance of Earls Court tube etc  Plenty of good restaurants nearby  Smart clean hotel  maybe a bit pricey but was worth the extra money to stay at a bright and clean place with plenty room 
N =>   Very confortable  base camp  to visit London Well located in Earl s court  Friendly and efficient reception  Confortable and clean bedroom  but bit small  Tiny kitchen and bathroom quite big compared to the bedroom  Internet with TV  not very practical but useable   A good place as base but not to stay all the day  too small   
N =>   Clean and tidy at a sane price My wife and I stayed at Base stay for   nights in y  at the peak of the season  Although we were given a room with a view to the trash area  the rest was just great  The room was of good size  compared to previous experiences at European capitals   It is evident that a lot of effort was given to make the room as comfortable as it was  and to keep the hotel spotless  Would definitely book there again  It must be mentioned that there is no breakfast available  but this was not an issue for us  as we enjoyed looking for a new place to get our espresso at every day  Great stay  
N =>  Fabulous service and staff We went to Base stay after a rather unpleasant experience at another London hotel  Cheerful staff actually brought a tear to my eyes  Nothing was a problem  Room  twin  was clean  modern  a little small but we were happy all the same  Thank you  thoroughly enjoyed and will definitely recommend  
N =>   All that we expected We stayed at base stay for   nights  I had done a lot of research before choosing base stay based on other tripadvisor reviews  I was expecting a lot and the hotel really delivered  The room was well laid out  looked brand new and had relaxing artwork on the walls  The kitchen  with its stainless steel counters  was very serviceable  All of the staff we encountered could not have been more helpful  They were helpful in accomodating our Sabbath needs  opening the electronic doors for us as needed  We would love to stay there again  
N =>   First Rate I wanted to write directly to say that our visit at Base stay was excellent  The  green  rooms were great and very neat and clean The staff was friendly and helped with our train bookings in London and made our transportation go very smoothly I appreciate the assistance  We were at another hotel that just directed us to a computer  needless to say  Base stay will be recommended by us to friends from Chicago who visit London often  
N =>   Perfect for family visit to London Base stay was absolutely perfect for our our family s first visit to London  my husband and I have been many times  especially me on business and a business expense account   but this time we travelled with our    year olf son   Our room was extremely well designed  exceptionally clean and fresh   the bathroom was spacious and new  The Earl s Court neighborhood was a easy to navigate and not too far from all the expected London attractions   nearby restaurants were reasonable  and the hotel provided special discount coupons for some   A ks  amp  Spencer Simply Food was a block away   we filled our kitchenette with juice  muffins and fruit for breakfast and snacks to much on before heading out to dinner  With the costs of travel these days  base stay was a terrific value  I have already recommended it highly to my best friend and her family  
N =>   A Good London Base Staff were helpful  hotel well maintained  amp  in an important enough location that was not too badly affected by the recent tube strike Convenient stores nearby provide surprisingly decent microwavable foods  if you happen to be shocked by London restaurant prices Would especially like to thank the gentleman at the reception who helped us out on transport alternatives during our stay  
N =>  Loved this little friendly hotel   We chose Base stay for our London trip based on Trip Advisor recommendations and were not disappointed  The location was excellent  it felt residential but was only a   minute walk to Earl s Court Tube and close walking to High St  Kensington and local shopping  Our room was very clean and the beds were extremely comfortable  The room noise was minimal and the temperature was perfect  The staff went above the call of duty to meet our requests and needs  We felt the the price was reasonable and were pleased with the quality that we received  We will plan to stay here again on our next trip  we really can t recommend it enough  
N =>  Comfortable hotel with very friendly staff We stayed at this hotel for three days in  and   more in e traveling else where in the middle  We had a delux room to fit all four of us  The location was perfect  We were very close to the tube and many restaurants and a few pubs  Our kids     and     got to go to nearby pubs alone  Anything we needed to do was a tube ride away  It was also convenient to the airport  The room was very comfortable and free wifi a plus  The staff gave us any info or comfort we could ask for  I d recomend this place to anyone  
N =>   An overbooking that destoyed our first day in London    We  me and my wife  stayed at base stay in         th to  th   After    hours in a plane  we arrived at    Courtifield Gardens  A shower  a pinch and a fish and cheeps  No  the crew of base stay informed us that our room  booked since february       had a problem and that we should stay our first night in Premier Inn  a   stars s hotel nearby  we discovered  later  that Premier Inn was a bad hotel  and we have paid     pounds for just one night there      I thought  sincerely  that it was a simple case of overbooking  the crew priorized other guests  not the young couple that came from a very exotic country    I hope that do not become a policy of base stay   After that problem  our stay was perfect  excellent location  perfect room and service  
N =>   Excellent   We went down to London to celebrate my husbands birthday with friends  and I wanted to stay at this hotel as I have been booking lots of my customers into it  I wanted to see it for myself and make up my own mind on how I rated it  Everything you see on this hotel s web pages is refreshingly exactly how you will find it when you get there   It was easy enough to find   we took a taxi from Euston Station as with our bags we couldnt be bothered to catch the tube  The rest of our stay we used the tube   its not far to the nearest station   probably   mins or so walk On arrival we were warmly met  The small reception area is modern and minimal with a window seat   they are happy to look after your bags if your room isnt ready when you get there  One of our two rooms was ready  so we went straight up to have a look  We were in a double on the  th floor   but no problem as there is a lift to all floors Corrridors and communal areas were clean and looked newly decorated The room was bright and airy  Had double bed  wardrobe with hangers  desk  amp  chair  flat screen TV   internet connection    amp  kitchenette in a tidy cupboard  Kitchenette had sink  kettle  cups etc  Even a black binbag had been left out incase of any rubbish whilst catering for yoursleves The bathroom was lovely  shower  no bath  was lovely and very powerful   quite large shower cubicle too Some tolietrees were provided Lovely white fluffy towels All extremely clean The room also had a really good powerful hairdryer  and a plug located near the mirror  Also a plus  but it is amazing how many hotels seem to overlook this Had a very comfy night s sleep  Good pillows and comfy mattress  Hotel was quiet too Absolutely no complaints at all  Very clean  and all the decor looks fresh Lovely calm decor colours  neutrals and browns The staff were helpful  and even though you dont have any breakfast included as there s no restaurant its only a couple of mins walk to get some breakfast  Theres a high street close by with several places to choose from to eat at  Recommend to you  quot  quot Bryons quot  quot  which has really friendly staff and tasty food   also licienced if you fancy lunch there http   www byronhamburgers com story Overall a great hotel that I will      continue to recommend to my customers   in a great and grand part of London  Makes you wish you had been a Victorian    
N =>  a real base I really enjoyed this hotel I did have a slight problem locating the hotel  although it literally is just down the street from the Metro The only room left when I booked last minute was a bunk bed  which was not necessary as a solo traveller  but the kitchen and microwave in the hotel room is a major plus  I felt really comfortable being able to bring back and store food  and or heat it with the microwave  be a bit too comfortable as I looked forward to being in the hotel The shower was really amazing after staying in several european hotels this one ta kes the prize  Free wifi was a great benefit as well  Only downside was no in house food  although the hotel goes out of their way to get you discounts and provide you other options  You feel like home in this hotel  and I would have really liked to have stayed in one of the non bunk bed rooms  
N =>   Clean Simple Friendly and Hip We loved this place  My boyfriend     year old son  and I  middle aged babe   were in a lower floor room with a king bed and a single  Everything had a kind of cheerful  efficient  fresh white feel about it  The beds were very comfy  well  there was a crack in the middle of our king  but honestly it wasn t uncomfortable  and we had a little kitchenette and a FANTASTIC shower  The location  Earls Court tube station  couldn t have been more convenient and there s a lovely park and neighborhood surrounding the hotel  It s not a chic neighborhood but it feels as if real people live there  diverse  busy  working people  There are no frills to this hotel   no coffee or breakfast in the morning  no tea in the afternoon  no sherry at evening   but it doesn t matter  The most outstanding aspect of the hotel was the staff  The people at the front desk couldn t have been nicer or more helpful  going out of their way to secure us tickets to a Chelsea game  to print out boarding passes  to be genuinely  I think  cheerful if we had a question or need  We really really liked them and all decided we would stay in exactly the same place next time  Although our room was on the lower floor  looking out at an alley  it wasn t unpleasant  I imagine there are wonderful rooms to be had on upper floors  Since you won t trust my review unless I think of a few negatives     I wish there had been separate overhead reading lights for each bed  so we didn t have to have the entire room ablaze for my son to stay up studying  And  the doors between hallways shut noisily because of the mechanism making the halls fire safe  But they slam occasionally  But all in all  these were minor infractions that I had to wrack my brain to come up with  Excellent hotel  good rate  I believe  for central London  
N =>  Great place to stay My oldest daughter and I used base stay as our base while visiting my youngest daughter who is studying abroad in London for the semester  We stayed in one of the hotel s bunk bed rooms and found it to be very comfortable  It was so nice to have a refrigerator in our room and there are plenty of places close buy to buy things to stock it with  The location is so convenient to walking to many nearby attractions and restaurants and there are many tube stops close by too  The reception staff was very helpful and allowed us to store our luggage after we checked out so we could do some more sightseeing before catching the tube to the airport  All in all a very nice place to stay  
N =>  GREAT BASE IN LONDON We booked B Stay for   nights and had room       top floor with brick wall view  Whilst the view was not ideal we did enjoy our stay  We found the service to be mostly excellent  Location  as everyone says  is good   we even walked to the V amp A Museum and also to Harrods  yes  took about    minutes so not that close  We also stayed during the power outage and could not fault how they handled this difficult situation  We left to sightsee early in the morning just after the power went off  Unfortunately when we got back at      pm the power was still not on and at that stage it was not expected to come back on before      pm  As my husband was leaving very early the next morning and I was going to be on my own we elected to change hotels  to a more expensive awful hotel in very ordinary location   The staff at Base tried to get us to stay but it was just too risky   however they happily ordered a cab to take us to our new hotel and even picked up the driver s tab  A few minor points  Someone commented on the mini milk containers   yes  I noticed the brown on the top and they were also past their  quot use by quot  date  London water is always a bit  quot scummy quot    if that is a word  My tea looked positively cloudy On the second day we arrived back at the hotel around      to find the room had not been cleaned  About    minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was housekeeping   checking to see if the room had been cleaned  She looked a bit shocked that it hadn t and asked if we would like it done   by that stage we wanted to rest before going out again so declined  They did however bring clean towells up to our room  I asked one of the housekeepers if we could get facewashers and whilst she said our room was not on her list she passed the message on and they were in our room on our return Heated towell racks are brilliant We were expecting a fax and asked twice at reception if it had arrived  It finally turned up under the door and we noticed it had been sent   days before    The decor is very pleasant  the room extremely clean and this must be the best value hotel in London  by far  
N =>  My new place to stay in London I booked this place on account of all the positive feedback here  The only problem we had was they canceled the reservation  Upon arrival  they said they canceled it because the card I had used to make the original reservation would not work  Thanks to Visa fraud protection  this was true  They said they attempted to contact me  however I never received a phone call or email  Thankfully there was room  and we were upgraded to a bigger room  The room was nice  the bed was very comfy and the duvet was nice  Our room had a sink  microwave  and fridge which came in handy  The bathroom was large  bright  and clean  The staff was awesome  very helpful and friendly  The entertainment system in the room was great as well with all the music and movies  They have arrangements made with local restaurants to give discounts which was nice  The hotel is about a four minute walk from the Tube and a    minute walk from a few different grocery stores  Other than the issue at check in  this place absolutely rocked and I d stay here again in a heartbeat   
N =>   ent hotel in a good neighborhood close to the tube We found base stay from TripAdvisor and decided to stay here for our week vacation based on all the excellent reviews  I think I went in having super high expectations since so many people rated it a   so was a bit disappointed at some of the amenities when I entered my room  Having traveled in Europe on several occasions I was expecting a small room  but our twin room was much smaller than I expected  likely b c they pulled a king bed apart so our beds were only an inch apart  our room was facing a wall which I wasn t expecting since many other people had commented that they had had great views from their room  Also after removing the lid of the water kettle after boiling water  found the top of the water to be covered in some residue  I refrained from using the kettle for the rest of the trip  In addition  the tops of the little half and halfs for the tea seemed to be browned  not sure if this is the standard coloring or if it d been sitting out somewhere  It was quite noisy outside a few nights even though we were essentially facing a wall  We slept through it though without any problems My biggest complaint though was that I found a yellowish stain on my bedsheet when I was going to crawl into bed the first night and grey marks all over one of my pillows  As it was late  I put a towel over the stain that night  used the other pillow  and mentioned it to reception the next morning  However  while the pillow sheet was changed  the stain was still there when I got into bed late the next night  It took   inquiries over the course of   days and me personally leaving a note on the bed before it finally got changed  This should ve only taken a day to fix We also had some key mixups as I checked in before my friend  but they had no record of my check in when he checked in so they deactivated my room key when they activated his and we weren t aware we were only allowed to have one key chip key between the two of us  Since they each gave us one  we assumed that it was fine  eventually they switched out one of the key cards for a regular card with a swipe bar after a day of us going back and forth to the front desk trying to get our key cards to work Overall the hotel is in an excellent location    minute walk to the tube  Some restaurants nearby  definitely do not recommend the pub across from the station  busy with bad service   if you re in the hotel at dinner time  I was almost never there then  but the bakery across from the tube station has excellent pastys for breakfast  Safe area  no problems walking alone at night as a female  Staff is courteous  though for me they weren t extremely warm and friendly like other reviewers  experiences  The internet usage from the TV is a bit awkward  but was convenient for doing quick look ups  For anyone checking in for their flights and in depth tourist research  go to the internet cafe across from the tube  super cheap at only    pence per    minutes Not a bad stay  but was disappointed at how long it took to get my sheets changed and the state of the water kettle  Like I said a lot of little things went wrong for me for such a highly rated hotel  Not being told to turn on the breaker switches for the sockets  outside noise  etc  The hotel was accomodating though in letting us split the charges in the amounts we wanted  I would probably stay here again in hopes my experience this time around was a fluke  Note  if you tend to use tissues a lot  I had spring allergies   bring your own  as the hotel doesn t have any  
N =>   Convenient comfortable clean functional I took the advice of a previous reviewer and requested a courtyard room  i e  not one of the rooms facing the main road   When I booked the room by phone I was told that I had been booked into a courtyard room but this did not turn out to be the case and and so felt a little disappointed in the service  but overall very good  
N =>   different from normal hotel stay stayed here two nights in   Place very clean place was small  like an ordinary house  sort of  rooms were all over the place  sort of quaint and charming some might think  very quiet the weekend we were there  we arrived one o clock in morning and took us ages to check in with I presume was the night porter  Would have liked to have been able to have breakfast there  Had to walk to Earls Court and places for breakfast which were not great  Far enough when walking with bags to the tube also  What i would wonder about if a noisy crowd were booked in   would you be able to do anything about it  as there was no evidence of many staff around  even though it was clean  good value and comfortable  I think i would like a hotel when in london next  and more central  
N =>  Brilliant place to stay We spent   days in London to celebrate my husband s birthday so we were out a lot of the time  However this is just the most wonderful place to base yourself  Its quiet but   mins from tube  Small clean rooms  flat screen TV  little kitchen with microwave  great shower in bathroom  in fact everything you could need in a small space  Rooms were cleaned every day to a very high standard  staff were helpful and pleasant Can t wait to stay there again and would recommend to anyone who wants a nice place to base themselves but doesn t want to spend too much time in hotel as rooms are rather small  
N =>  would have been great if the airconditionning heating worked better  wintertime  Back from a   night stay in Base stay end january Great hotel exept the heating  very good first impression    in fact our double room     was a small studio appartment  so practical with its kitchenette  Great value  great decoration  sober but chic  People nice at the desk  Very good location BUT be careful if you are sensitive to air conditioning or if you enjoy  quot plain quot  warm rooms like i do  we had a big problem with the   heating systems and i caught a sorethroat and bronchitus  To begin with  the room is not heated anymore as soon as you leave it because the keycard has to be in the slot     when it s    outside   it s cold when you come back to your room  not pleasant  i told the frontdesk it was cold  they explained the keycard system to me  ok but The heating comes  or should come  in   ways  the air conditioning for the heat in the room  wich kept ventilating  throwing air on us  all night long  even when put on  quot Low quot  fan AND it was noisy  but if you stopped it  it was cold in the room    again  unpleasant   and you had to heat even more the room because it was so cold in the bathroom   where a lot of  freezing  air was coming in from the window  not insulated  and the only heating system is a  quot hanging towels radiator quot    which was not hot enough    and it was  quot on quot   i checked So i got a sorethroat and finally got ill    i didn t want to look too fussy so i didn t go twice at the desk  But i told them when i left and they told me that in the other rooms the heat was enough in the bathrooms      to be checked   but ANYWAY THE FACT THAT THE HEATING SYSTEM TURNS OFF WHEN YOU LEAVE THE ROOM IS VERY BAD  because of course the rooms are gonna be cold at the end of the day in wintertime     check insulation of the bathroom Did other people have the same problem in another room  or no problem like that at all  in which rooms  thank you It s really too bad  because once again  except this  i loved the hotel  
N =>   place stay away We had some problems during check in  nothing major but still inconvenient  Our room had been cancelled because I did not get back in contact with them via email  if it was so important they should of contacted me via telephone as both mobile and home number was provided  but the new girl behind reception was very helpful and understanding  Room The room is clean but small and the shower is not oversized in the slightest  but the room is cleaned daily  towels replenished once during our   night stay  Location Very close to local shops  restaurants and train station  all within walking distance Overall a okay stay ideal   business people but wouldn t stay again  
N =>  Great value in heart of London Finding an inexpensive hotel in London is next to impossible  That s why we were so pleased to find Base Stay  It s near the Earl s Court tube  so the area around it isn t particularly cool  but it has great access to everything in London  The look of the hotel is minimalist chic  which makes the property feel much more upscale than its price tag would indicate  The rooms are very small and might be too confining for longer than a few days  but who spends much time in their room in London anyway It was comfortable  quiet  and enabled us to get around easily without spending a bundle  I highly recommend it  
N =>  Tiny room various technical faults Even considering the price I paid  about     pounds a night  the room was tiny  Worse than this  I suffered constant technical problems  First of all  the internet connection kept breaking down  caused  as usual in hotels  by problems with the charging mechanism  I also kept having problems with my room access card  the heating did not seem to respond to the controls and the television broke down  I reported all these matters to the staff and got a letter from the manager  who acknowledged my  quot issues quot  and said they were being put right but seemed unable to write the words  quot sorry quot  or  quot apologise quot   Disappointing  
N =>   What a BRILLIANT Hotel       th     th ember      We found Base to Stay via the internet and was absolutely delighted by the facilities and staff  We wanted a family break during  quot Twixmas quot  for   adults and a    yearold   who was to celebrate his   th birthday whilst we were away The room was a Superior room  with a large double bed and unusually for a hotel  a VERY comfortable single bed We loved the fact that we had loads of space in our room  Unlike cheaper hotels  the wardrobe had doors  so everything was neatly hidden away  The small kitchenette  also hidden behind doors  had a fridge  sink  kettle and microwave  which enabled us to cook breakfast and an evening meal  The bathroom was spotless and the shower hot and powerful What was quite unique was the interactive TV  with all the free to air digital channels  plus free intenet access  internet radio  its own mini  quot i tunes quot  with all manner of cd s and games pre loaded and free to play  The movies cost just    each  I know London has rather a lot of attractions  but it was nice to come back to our room and have plenty of entertainment whilst we relaxed The other unique feature was the fact that we had    totally uninterrupted nights sleep  No slamming of doors  no shouting down the corridors  no heavy footsteps from the room above  despite the hotel being full during our stay  The area felt safe at night  M amp S and Waitrose were   mins away as was Earls court Station and Harrods was only a    min walk along Cromwell Road We will definitly be returning in the summer for another short break  
N =>   We ll be back to base stay  How lucky we were to find base stay  Our reservation for a room with bunk beds was received and confirmed efficiently via email and our inquiries as to transportation from Heathrow was also handled well When we arrived  we found a clean  well kept building just two minutes from the Earl s Court tube station  The room was clean and exactly what the website promised  A wonderful  quot base quot  location for trips all over London  helpful  efficient staff  thanks Vinny    free internet access  a dreamy shower  and efficient use of a small room   perfect for two adults who don t necessarily want to share a bed  We will definitely stay here again  
N =>  Modern and comfortable in good location Base stay is in a handy location  close to the tube and is very modern and comfortable  Our room  standard  was really a little too small for us  next time would upgrade to a superior  The kitchenette was great and storage adequate  Although little things like shower cap  tissues and face washers would have been appreciated  Staff kindly  quot hunted down quot  our lost expensive spectacles and posted them to us  Our only gripe is they double charged our debit card with a so called  quot blind quot  transaction which took lots of our time and money to sort out  as when we discovered it we were already in Paris  The Manager did apologise but be wary  We use the  quot dot to dot quot  shuttle service from the airport and were very impressed with this  
N =>   Even better than expected  We just returned from a   week trip that included stays in several European cities  Although we paid CONSIDERABLY more for supposedly superior   star hotels in at least two of our other destinations  we felt the Base Stay clearly outshone the competition in price   location   room cleanliness and bathroom quality  The kitchenette was an added bonus  If only Base Stay could expand into some other European countries  I d never have to research where to stay in Europe again  Keep up the great work B S  
N =>  Perfect Place to Stay in London  Just returned from a   day stay at Base Stay with my teen daughter and totally agree with the other reviews that I ve been reading over the last   months  So easy to get to   we got our Oyster Passes  easy cheap way to ride the Underground  at Heathrow  took the tube right to Earls Court  and walked the short block to the hotel  Even though we were early  we immediately got our room  and were very impressed  spotless  nicely furnished  great bathroom facilities  wonderful little  kitchen   and as we found out that night  superb bedding  Staff was wonderful  room was wonderful  neighborhood was convenient  with many interesting places to eat  close to busses and underground   We were extremely pleased  
N =>   Excellent London base Excellent value for price  Beautifully modern  small but so compact and well organized   barely knew there was a good kitchen in that space  central to tubes  close to V and A etc  Will definitely use again   very friendly and helpful personnel  very clean  good ac  not a thing to be negative about  
N =>   Excellent modern hotel Stayed at Base Stay for   nights in       Room was warm and cosy with nice modern decor  Loved having a mini kitchen  esp the microwave and it was great that this was cleaned daily  Bathroom was good too   loved the shower Easy to get to from Earl s Court tube stop  Heaps of places to eat nearby plus supermarkets etc A nice stay in a pleasant  clean hotel in a good location  
N =>  Great hotel Me and my daughter just came back from London and our stay at Base Stay  I have been in London many a time and lived in everything from Hostels to   star hotels  this is the best so far It was my first trip with my daughter and her first abroad which made the choice of hotel more important than ever  I wanted to be on the Piccadilly line with access to other Underground lines to make the whole travelling around thing as easy as possible  I wanted a safe neighbourhood  grocery shops close by  great beds  nice and clean room and most importantly a really good shower  this is harder than expected to find in London   And  we got it all and then some We got a room on the lower ground floor with disappointed us at first but it was nice enough  Very small but then we re talking London here    Also  the space was used in a perfect way and had a bunk bed  daughters choice   one closet  mini kitchen  desk  two chairs and then that fantastic shower  A good thing was that there was enough space under the bed to put the suitcase The staff was friendly professional and helpful The only thing we did not like was the air conditioning  It was either ice cold so we had to turn it off and then it became very hot  So  I had to get out of bed a few times a night to either switch on or off  I was having a horrible cold at the time and sleep was crucial   The folder about how it worked said it had automatic control as to stop when reaching a certain temperature but it did not  I also told the staff about this but they could not help  at least not that day and we were leaving the next day  Anyway  I will go back to London in the autumn with my son and we will stay in the hotel again Oh and another thing  my daughter happened to spill out Coke on the bed linen and the cleaner had just changed side instead of changing the bedding  Not a biggie but still  
N =>   Loved it  We stayed at Base   Stay from    th to   rd in one of the bunk rooms  The room was on the smaller side  but just perfect  Bathroom was large and spotless with modern amenities  The hotel staff was very polite and helpful and it was one of the first times I have stayed somewhere and actually looked forward to going back to the hotel at night  I would recommend this hotel for anyone no matter their age and look forward to my next stay  
N =>   Perfect Stay We had a wonderful stay for   nights at this fantastic hotel  The room was spacious and immaculate  The location was great as it is a short distance to the Earl s Court underground station and many great pubs and restaurants in the area  Also many grocery stores in the area to take advantage of the mini kitchen in the hotel rooms  Best of all  the staff was friendly  courteous  and professional  You don t appreciate the difference this can make until you experience the opposite  We arrived late morning expecting to leave our bags and walk around the area until our room was ready  Our room was not ready  but Manuel found a comparable room that was available to check in immediately  Another gentlemen volunteered information on where the    hour grocery store was located without asking  Can t say enough good things about our stay at Base stay and will definitely stay there on any future visits to London  
N => was waiting for basil faulty to appear after reading the reviews on here i thought it cant be that bad can it  have stayed in hotels that have been slated on here before  boy was i wrong  booked weekend away with friends to see a show  had booked   double rooms  checked in  went to rooms and found we all had twin rooms  went back to recieption to ask for doubles  after long time she came back and said hotel was fully booked so couldnt move rooms no managers to speak to they all finish at   pm   hey lets not it spoil our weekend  back to rooms we go then the list started musty smelly rooms and towels one of our rooms  opened bed side cabinet and live electrical wires all taped together breakfast was a joke dirty tables had to ask waitress   times to clear away the dirty plates  even then some one else did it had full english breakfast all six of us ordered at same time and they came out   at a time  had to wait    mins for last breakfast to appear when you did get your eggs and bacon was stone cold no knifes and forks then joined the que at receiption to complain i ve stayed in much better hostels around the world than this place deffo do not stay here had rooms           amp      have taken pictures of live wires and have forwarded then to H S E 
N =>  Fair Small Cozy hotel  Close to Public Transportation  affordable  Breakfast included but not too good  Clean  small size bed  
N =>   Dump stay clear  Was given a room in the basement on the way to the room the damp smell was terrible On entering the room the smell from the previous occupants earlier meal was still present a small room with a window looking out onto a very small courtyard Was given another room straight away The next room on the top floor was bigger but the state of the room was not good mould in bathroom hairs in the bath rotten windows beds very uncomfortable the need to itch was at times unbearable A word of warning with future visitors if you have dentures do not bite into the bacon quickly  as future dentists bills will be considerable do not pay for a swim anywhere  a dive onto your plate with the amount of oil on it would suffice PLEASE STAY CLEAR OF THIS HOTEL  
N =>   What a DUMP I was given a room on the street level even a MONK would find offensive  They changed my room after one night which was considerably better  but hotel is definitely not   star perhaps no star would be more appropiate  
N =>   Don t stay here      Oh my goodness  Do not stay at this hotel  I ve added photos to support my review  The radiator was hanging off the wall  the bath  mouldy and dirty  the windows were rotting and the beds   well   they just didn t let the terrible state of the place down We ended up leaving as we d booked a  recently refurbished    hotel  and this really is not any of that  
N =>   Bayswater Inn is an  out  Do not stay here  This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in  The room was a triple  The carpet was filthy  The bathroom had black mold around the shower  The bathroom above us dripped into ours  The mattresses were so old  all three had sunk in the middle  We had to pile three duvets on each to make them even sleepable  The pillows were so flat we all had to request more  The hotel staff were rude  with the exception of some of the desk staff  The  quot breakfast nazi quot  that checked the breakfast cards was extremely nasty  making Seinfeld s soup nazi seem like a kitten  No card  no breakfast  room key was not good enough   which was no loss  Breakfast consisted of a cold hard roll  horrible coffee and worse orange juice  The  quot hot chocolate quot  was weak chocolate water  Three boringBT channels on the TV  
N =>   Wonderful location  Although Bayswater Inn is not perfect  I think generally it has gotten a bad rap  First the positives  the location is really great  It s in a residential neighborhood near to two tube stations and several bus stops and some good  not gourmet  but good  restaurants nearby  We also found the staff to be very congenial and helpful  Although the hotel was old and our room was small  our bathroom fixtures appeared to be near new and our sheets were crisp white cotton  my persofnal favorite  OK  some negatives  The hotel in general was  quot tired  quot  The lobby furniture in particular could use replacing  Like others  I didn t like the paper bathmat  The computers in the lobby were out of order about half the time  so don t count of them  The continental breakfast was plentiful and always well stocked when we were there  However  it was pretty much white bread  although we found they were happy to make toast for us  again  white  but always came hot  But there was always plenty of good hot coffee  tea  hot chocolate  and orange juice  For a small additional price we could get eggs  bacon  and or sausage  The eggs came in twos  so we occasionally split an order  The breakfast would benefit by the addition of some whole grains  fruit and yogurt  and when we couldn t stand it any longer  we would go out for just that  It wasn t perfect  but we weren t really hanging around a lot  It was fine  although I m not sure whether or not I would recommend it to a friend  depends on the friend  
N =>   find another place   pay a little more too bare bones    dirty carpet   tiny room    one bbc tv channel   poor reception    wierd shower    continental brkfst was a basketful of hamburger sub sandwich rolls with no tongs to choose  everyone used their hands to dig around to make choices     yuk  Instant coffee and oj  
N =>  dont do it we booked a cheap theatre deal and got this hotel   read reviews after booking and thought cant be that bad oh yes it can   got basement room   smelt of dampness   constant door banging   smells of kithchen  complained and got moved to fourth floor room much better but still not more than one starbrekafast dont bother bread rolls  and coffee fo to bella italia at  am beuatiful breakfast for a fiver 
N =>   Not a good place to stay  A room about the size of a prison cell  below ground  during a heatwave  no a c  and told by reception to keep the window closed because of security concerns  Woken numerous times during the night due to the constant slamming of doors  Glad to leave  Will never stay there again  
N =>   Stay anywhere but here When we arrived at Bayswater Inn  we were given a room in the basement that was hard to find with a very small window  The room was extremely warm and had no air movement  The toilet handle squirted water when it was flushed and took about    minutes to refill  The hardware on the sink spun around when you turned on the water  When we compained to the manager  we were told that was all that it was not their best room but that was all they had available  When we asked them to discount the room  they miraculously came up with another room   in the basement with a toilet that still took    minutes to fill  We were told that that s how the plumbling worked there and there was nothing that could be done We told them that we would be going elsewhere since their plumbing did not work properly and there was no air movement  In the mean time  we were told that the upstairs rooms had airconditioning   Interestingly  they came up with another room upstairs that was much larger and the toilet worked  However  there was no airconditioning as they had said and it had a funnel shaped cloud of swarming insects over the middle bed that we could not shoo out of the window  They refused to refund our money  Keep in mind that I had two daughers with me that had backpacked around Europe and stayed in hostels for   weeks before coming here and that this was the worst place that they had been  Plus one of them is in Peace Corps in a third world country and is used to less than adequate accomodations and she thought that is was unacceptable  We went down the street to a cheaper hotel with working toilets and a better breakfast  
N =>  Thought it was very good After reading recent reviews we were concerned to be staying at the hotel  We were pleasantly surprised  Our room was nice with all we needed and as breakfast is only a complimentary breakfast we helped ourselves to rolls and jam and the waitress brought me   slices of toast when I asked for some  For     everything was very adequate and we could have paid a bit more for a bigger breakfast if we wanted  Altogether a very reasonable place to stay in London with pleasant staff  
N =>   Will Come Back Again Breakfast is ok as I am no bread lover  Room   Bathroom   Corridor are clean  Bathroom got hot water and water pressure is adequate  Towel clean  hair blower  dryer  available and to our surprise  they even have kettle    min from Bayswater Station     from the Hyde Park   Queensway     from Paddington  Good Location  
N => It s not a   star hotel like they say it is I got back from London yesterday and I had to write a review here already  My experience wasn t as bad as the other reviews I ve read  I stayed in Room    with family so we had   single beds  Our window looked out to a wall  If I was told I was staying at a Hostel  I wouldn t have been disappointed  However  I was told this was a   star hotel  so I EXPECT   star hotel amenities  I have no idea how a hotel like the Bayswater Inn can be classified as a   star hotel because I ve stayed in many   star hotels in my lifetime  and Bayswater Inn is THE WORST   STAR hotel I ve ever stayed in To review this hotel as a HOSTEL  I had no issues  This HOSTEL is everything I would ve expected To review this hotel as a   star Hotel  I have many issues  First of all  what the heck was on the beds  Some kind of plastic cover  The TV remote barely worked  The bath mat was a piece of paper with foot prints on it  There were no hand towels  just regular bath towels  The room was so small with the   suitcases we barely had enough room to walk around without pretending we re in an obstacle course On top of that  there was no AC  Luckily it was cold the   nights we were there so AC wasn t required  As for the breakfast  I thought you at least get free eggs in a contintental breakfast  This is the only continental breakfast I ve ever had where all they served were Buns  Orange Juice  Water  Jam and Butter  Everything else you had to pay for  Seriously  who did they pay off to get a   star rating  the nicest part of the whole complex was the freaken Lobby  the rest of the hotel was a dump  There is no way this is a   star hotel  NOT EVEN CLOSE  I stayed in a   star hotel just a week before in Dubai that after staying in Bayswater  the   star hotel in Dubai felt like a   star hotel Absolutely ridiculous  DO NOT stay in this hotel if you expect   star service amenites because you will be thoroughly disappointed and feel ripped off  If you expect Hostel atmosphere amenities service  by all means stay here  It s central to many areas and it s cozy enough that you get what you need out of a hostel  and that s to SLEEP and SHOWER  
N => The breakfast was a big joke  Me and my mom spent   nights at this hotel  When we booked at the travel agency in Sweden we asked not to get a room on the lower ground  souterrain   if possible  Unfortunately  when we arrived  it still turned out to be such a room  At first we couldn t find the room  so we had to ask the staff  It appeared that the room was situated in a corridor with a sign that said  quot Staff only quot   No wonder we couldn t find it  The room was very small and very hot  You could hardly move yourself in there  On top of the mattress there was some kind of plastic cover  That made it rustle and in the morning you woke up totally sweaty  The bath mat was a small piece of paper to no avail  There were no handtowels  only bodytowels  One day when we had become clean towels  there were brown stains on one of them  Disgusting  If they couldn t remove the stains in the laundry  why give them to the guests  There was also a very disturbing buzzing sound from the walls  It seemed as it occurred everytime someone had been to the bathroom  and it lasted around       minutes  Once there was a terrible smell when we passed through the corridor  it was so bad that one of us almost vomited  We re used to many kind of smells  but this was really disgusting  It was NOT from cleaning products The absolute worst thing was the breakfast  We had ordered continental breakfast  It consisted of  coffee  tea  juice  too soft french breads  almost wet inside  and marmalade  That was it  They had some other things too  but not much  AND you had to pay extra for it  It was a big joke  We never were satisfied enough so we had to buy something extra to eat in a store nearby However  the staff was very friendly and helpful  and the hotel is situated in a very nice area  Still we wouldn t recommend this hotel  It s a very low standard for being a   star hotel  It s only worth   stars  Jenny and Eva from Sweden 
N =>   horrible The first night of our stay  we were sent to another hotel   should have stayed there  When we returned  we were given a  basement suite    musty  noisey  cramped  The view from the window was a concrete shaft  The bathroom window had no treatments  No wash clothes  hand towels  the bath mat was paper  and just three towels and two little bars of soap  the continental breakfast consisted of plain rolls  butter   jam  water  OJ  coffee  tea  hot chocolate  Would NEVER stay here again  Thank goodness that this place was booked and we had to find another hotel for the rest of our trip  
N =>   Excellent    After seeing many negative reviews regarding the Bayswater Inn  I wasn t looking forward to my stay one bit  Although as soon as I arrived I was sure my stay was going to be pleasant  The smell of Mildew was non existant  and the bathroom and sleeping quarters were adequately clean  I am a bit of a clean freak myself and I was able to walk around the room with no socks on  this shows i was pretty sorted in the room  The hotel staff were nice enough  although not an English person in sight   The view from our room was lovely and overlooked the square  Clean sheet  radio and TV facilities a bonus The only minor problems I encountered were     Breakfast  not worth getting up for Some people had problems with the toilet paper  not soft enough for my delicate behindNo lock on the bathroom door But on the whole a very good hotel to stay in and we would definately recommend it to a friend   Matt  James and Luke   room     York  UK  
N =>  Do not stay here Me  and my fiance stayed here for  nights and when we arrived we got given a room on the lower ground floor with a view of another room  got   single beds instead of a double bed and all night constantly there was loud footsteps above us backwards and forwards which meant we didnt sleep very well  we were told before we booked that this hotel had recently been refurbished so the rooms had new flat screen tv s and were really nice but we seen no sign of any refurbishments  also our room was right next door to the maids staff room so from about  am all we could hear was them chatting  luckily enough London was fantastic so we didnt let this ruin our weekend but we were not impressed it is more like a hostel not a hotel so i will not be going bk to this hotel  
N =>   Cheap  For what I paid for this hotel I was quite happy with it  The location was fantastic  just a short walk to Bayswater Tube and also from heaps of restaurants  pubs and convenient shopping The room I stayed in had room to move  It was simply furnished but included a television and adequate coffee making facilities  The bathroom was small but warm with it s own radiator  the room had an adjustable one as well  Our room was in the middle of the building and so the view out the window was not exciting  however we were only there to shower and sleep The breakfast was simple with breadrolls  butter and jam but you were able to take as many as you wanted  They also had basic coffee  tea  hot chocolate  juice and water  It was quite adequate and lasted us until lunch time The staff at reception weren t inclinded to say good morning unless you said it first but they weren t outwardly rude  I had no real problem with them All in all this hotel is cheap  basic but was quite adequate when we spent most of the day out sight seeing  I would recommend to anyone on a budget who is in London to see the sights  
N =>  Hideous Hotel  Do not stay here  My family got sucked into this hotel thru Virgin Vacations  airfare  amp  hotel package deal  By the time I looked up the Bayswater on trip advisor  it was too late  So I kinda knew what we were getting into  but here s my  cents anyway As everyone else said    Completely      of them  rude  amp  unhelpful staff  Breakfast was a JOKE  The mildew smell in the rooms  amp  hallways  I can t even describe it  Our toilet seat was not connected to the toilet  but hanging off by a hinge  Windows would not open  The BEDS  Those might have been the most uncomfortable things I have ever slept on  Camping out in the mountains is comfier  The shower clogged and filled up to right below my knees everytime and flooded the bathroom floor  The remote for the television had tape wrapped around it to keep it together  hilarious   The towels smelled dirty  I asked the housekeeping staff NOT to make my bed  as I brought my own sheets and wanted to do it myself everyday  yet they proceeded to take my   lb suitcase off my bed to make it anyway  Yes  the tube was close but that doesn t make up for anything  That s pretty much all I want to get into for right now  Moral of the story      DON T even think about considering this INN for ANY reason  
N =>   Bayswater Inn Hotel Firstly i would advise anyone reading this NOT  to stay at the Baywater Inn Hotel  I am not usually one to write poor reviews however I can definately make an exception as i would like to warn people for their benefit   When looking for a hotel in London I thought this was the best option for me personaly as the price was low         a night  and the reviews where adverage  however when arriving at the hotel the staff where unhelpful  But this wasnt the start of our problems   I stayed at the hotel with my boyfriend and a cople of friends  as the stay was only for one night i didnt make too much of a fuss  however if i would have been there any longer this wouldnt have been the case  When booking we where told that my boyfriend and I would have a double and this wasnt the case as we where given   singles  After asking politely for this to be amended there was a long wait for the room to be changed  Another reason I was unsure of our room was due to the unlockable door as this made me feel unsafe   Once the room was changed I was quite happy as the room was a double and there didnt seem to be any problems  Boy was I wrong   After unpacking our bags we left the hotel for the evening  When returning to our room we where overwelmed with the worst smell you can possibly imagine  this had obviously been covered before we entered our room previously as when first arriving there was a fresh smell of air freshner  The smell was so intense I gagged and nearly vomited  I appologise for being so graffic but i need to warn you of the conditions   After explaining this to the receptionist I was given can of air freshner  barely enough for one spray of the room  and told to use this and open the window  This shocked me as the smell was clearly there to stay  Trying to make do with the smell wasnt the last our problems  The bed covers where dirty and clearly hadnt been changed  As by this point we were tired so to get some rest we slept on top of the covers as there was no way i would have subjected myself to sleeping under the covers  I stayed in the clothes i was wearing as i was concerned about the cleanlyness of the beds  however my legs wernt covered as i was wearing shorts   I was woken up at  am to the sound of someone trying to open our bedroom door  this was alarming to think that people would try to enter your room when your sleeping  At  am the door was opened using a key and closed again   however this could have been someone leaving as I only woke up as the door was closing  It was hard enough trying to sleep after the first time the door was trying to be opened but at this point i couldnt stay any longer  I and my boyfriend left as soon as we could  not staying for the breakfast of a bread roll and orange juce as by this point there wouldnt have been anything to keep us there Also after leaving the hotel I noticed an awful rash had apeared on my legs overnight and was increadibly ichy and sore  This worried me as it had appeared whislt staying at Bayswater Inn hotel  Even now a couple of days after staying there the rash is still on my legs and is still causing me discomfort  Please for your own sake do not stay at The Bayswater Inn Hotel and if you do make sure you take something to block you nose with and a sleeping bag  
N =>   The Worst Hotel I have ever stayed in I have stayed in better hotels located in third world countries  This hotel should be bull dozed I ll sum up      dirty towels  paper floor mats  polystyrene cups  drafty single glazed windows  faulty wiring  dirty walls  poor TV reception  uncomfortable beds       s decor and furniture  dust and dirt caked surfaces  mouldy bathroom suites       I could go on          All in all I would thoroughly recommend you pay a little bit extra and find somewhere else I paid     extra last year and I stayed in the Waldorf       needless to say it was much much better If you do stay there        good luck  
N =>  Get what you pay for  Breakfast wasn t very exciting  The website says breakfast is included but they forget to say what that includes  piece of bread  jam and water  orange juice  tea or coffee  If you want a traditional english breakfast that will be an extra fee  We got stuck in the basement  It wasn t the most satisfying place but we were comfortable  At night you can hear all the noises around you  the toilets flushing  people walking and random doors slamming  The toilet in our room was okay  There was hot water one night but another day there was very little hot water  The toilet also took a couple of attempts to flush    The lift was terrible and we couldn t find the stairs  The lift on one of the occasions actually stopped and wouldn t open  We managed to get out but it s never happened to me  My advice be patient The people were friendly and we didn t have any problems with room service  They made our beds every day  You get what you pay for  
N =>   Average London Hotel It s not that easy to find this hotel because the sign is not very prominent and the direction from their website is not very clear  Just in case you need clearer direction  you can reach this hotel by taking Tube to Bayswater station  take to the direction of Edgeware Road at Platform   of Earl s Court   turn left from the exit  then left again until you reach the square  Alternatively you can go to Queensway station  which is not very far either When we reached there  the lady receptionist was quite rude  but she was helpful enough when we told her that we needed help with our luggage padlock  The male receptionist is much friendlier We have triple room even though we booked a double  so our room was of an adequate size  A bit small  but decent Breakfast was horrible as the other reviewers had pointed out  Just bread roll and coffee or tea All in all  I guess it s quite a decent inn  but I think it s more suitable to get a   star instead of    
N =>   WHAT A DUMP       If I could give this hotel a minus figure I WOULD   first of all   extremely rude staff  who delayed us checking in to shout down the phone at suppliers  asked for more personal information than needed  requested passport number which we refused to give   Second of all extremely small  poorly designed room  the bed slopped to the wall  down the side of oversized headboard  Also had paper thin walls   i was able to listen to the next rooms tv word for word during the night  people checking in rougly      am were laughing and screaming in the corridoors  and countlessly slamming doors  my girlfriends brief stint in halls of residence at uni was quieter   the bathroom was disgusting  nothing you seemed to touch was clean  if me  amp  my partner were not staying just the night and leaving early for a flight we would have found somewhere else to stay  i have never felt so caustrophobic in all my life how this place got   stars I will NEVER know  this hotel is a disgrace        
N =>   Hated this Hotel I booked this hotel through Gate  Travel  I went  quot C quot  class but still expected better  I can tell you first hand that I m not a complainer although this reveiw will make it sound like I am  Staff were rude and gave bad advise  I think they were getting kick backs off tours of London because they told us one particular tour would bring us back to the hotel when they didn t  The Continental Breakfast consisted of rolls and jam  coffee tea and you have to show a card in order to get the pleasure of eating it  One day I forgot my card in my room and the person guarding the  quot continental breakfast quot  acted like I d committed a crime  The lobby was far less impressive than in the pictures  And  the worse part  the toilet in the bathroom we had was so close to the heat air piping that we had to sit sideways to keep from getting burned  We  at first  thought the piping was a towel warmer but was later told it was the heating system  If you are diabetic and have a hard time healing your legs feet do not book this hotel  The tub was a little easier to get in and out of the one we had in London but you could actually see mold on the ceiling around it  Overall  the hotel smelled bad  musty  The only thing I have to say good about this hotel was that the beds were somewhat comfortable and I liked the dressing table in our room  
N =>  Can I Get Some Clean Sheets  So here I was a young girl about to embark on what I thought to be a week with some girlfriends on a school trip  I was quite fooled by the outside of the Bayswater Inn  I really did judge the book by it s cover  I assumed it was going to be a nice  cozy hotel  even the lobby was quite nice  Than we got the key to room     que the horror music   I stood for about    mintues waiting for the elevator to decide to come pick me up  After boarding the elevator  at my stop it made screeching noises  as if it were about to break down  luckily it did not  The rooms weren t organized in order and it seemed as though  I d stepped into a maze  A big pink maze  After a little help from some friends we found our room was closed off to the side in a little area   After leaving the hallway  which smelled disgusting   we arrived in what I thought was going to be my favourite place at night  than we saw the blood on the sheets  the mold on the floor and the window  My ideas were changed immediately After complaining about the sheets  we were told it s ink  Which in    years ink has never quite been that colour  We were left with just one towel for three girls and a faucet named TRICKS  Our facuet just barely worked it spun in circles and rarely gave out the warm or cold water I was looking for  Than we thought why not have a nice warm shower  I found my water to be scolding hot  and the bath wouldn t drain  I was having a shower with water up to my knees  And after the shower being used by three girls the PAPER mat was soaked RIGHT through  the sink was otherflowing  the bath was overflowing and the floor was soaked from the leak in the pipes  Mmmm was that ever a downer on the trip  My trip was absolutly flawless except for the Bayswater Inn  other than it s good location  it was one of te WORST places I ve ever resided in  I do not recomend this hotel to anyone  unless you like men at your windows and doors that only have a dead bolt   The Bayswater Inn  is not a place  I d return to nor send anyone to  so please take my advice and find a better stay  
N =>  If you want to relive Stephen Kings  The Shining   This past ober      I travelled to London England with    other students from my High School and   womderful teachers  Our trip was organized through EF Tours an acredited and very pleasing touring company  This trip was honestly the best experience that I ve ever had as a    year old  England certainly is a beautiful country  Although there are always reminders that perfection cannot exist  that s why swans have black spots under thier wings  For me the black spot was The Bayswater Inn  In order for my review to be understood one must believe that i hold no predujice and that my complaints are not results of high matienence  If you are accustomed to blood on your sheets and tap fossets that do     s then by all means enjoy your stay in the farthest thing form the lap of luxury   I ll start with the entry to the hotel where the elevator has it s own agenda and may make one wait up to   minutes for it to kick into gear  Some of the levels of this hotel had wood borded upon where glass should be in the elevator  Down to the basement i went with two other girls  and others from my group were scattereed throughout all floors of the hotel depite a request to be together  The basement was a maze of pink and when i found our room i turned the key to find our humble home  Yes  this time the key worked but other times the key wasn t even neccessary  jiggle the handle the right way and it was a waste to even need a key for room     The deadbolt was all that held my hope The television did not work  the radio did not work  only     of the lights worked  And the ones that did took   minutes of flickering to settle into a constent glow  One of my teachers rooms had zero electricity  apparently a fuse box had to be played with in order to gain light in her room  There was blood on our blanket  Blood  Is that really easy to be overlooked  I say no  And when we brought it to the reception they claimed it wasn t blood  But as a    year old female i m well aware what blood on blankets looks like  Even if it wasn t blood why were we getting stained blankets  And why were we never brought a new blanket  After   phone calls and a visit to the front desk  One teacher had two beds in there room and gave us the blankets off of it  One was used to give padding between the springs protruding from the mattress  The next day  the bloody blanket was back  Although sheets were not changed and a stain of chocolate became our constent companion throughout the week  The most interesting affair seemed to be when a man watched a girl in another room change through the window  until there was a man at our window  The window that didn t lock  At  am our teachers were all up and showing teh receptionist how easy it was to get into our window from the outside  The receptionist gave my teacher a mop bucket full of rubber bands  plaster and scotch tape with a few scattered screw drivers and screws in the mess  He told my teacher he could fix it if it really bothered him  And so he did  Our teachers weren t sure of what action should be taken  should police be called  The receptionist thought not  so they weren t  But when our tour guide  who had a room at this lovely hotel but didn t saty there for obvious reasons  became aware he called the police the morning after  The next day he requested mateniance to be done on all our rooms  checking the locks on windows and such  It wasn t done  But we did find that the maids had gone through our stuff and found some of the extra towles we had hid in our suitcases  They weren t the most amiable when being asked for towels    towel per person  but some of us girls liked one for our hair  Our teacher and a student stealthly borrowed some extras and the maid had found them when we had put them in our bags for the day  Our bathroom was the biggest of all the ones we saw there  European bathrooms are naturally small and i am aware of that  But the tap wasn t attachted to the sink  it did     s  the toilet was as stubborn as the lights  and the bath tub had a draining issue  Light bulbs fell untouched from their sockets and water ran from the walls to add to the mold plastered along the floors   The lack of safety  cleanliness and the rudeness exhibited by the staff of this establishment show the standard of this hotel  Many people said it was like  quot the shining  quot  I m not sure i would go this far  but it certainly was the black spot in our swan of a vacation  
N =>   Do not stay in the basement  My relatives from Norway are staying at this hotel  I came with them for check in and found the lady on reception to be abrupt and unhelpful  My Aunty is    and my cousin suffers from Asthma so we were alarmed to be shown to damp and smelly basement rooms  When we complained we were informed that these were the only rooms available  However  after threatening to leave and requesting a refund we were shown to some semi  respectable rooms upstairs  
N =>   had to check out pronto on arrival there was a large que to check in only one member off staff in attendance who was unhelpfull  amp  fraught  Whilst waiting to check in my husband went to the bathroom and was horrified to see it in such a run down state   toilet seats broken badly stained grouting  I then went to the bathroom  amp  the sink was cracked  no soap or paper towels  toilet seat broken  amp  this was just the first impression  We were allocated a room on the  th floor  the door key was very difficult to manouver and it took several minutes to open the door  as we entered we sunk into the floor as it was uneven  the bathroom was dirty very dated looked like the taps  plug hole had never been cleaned since installing  the floor tiles were grubby  amp  the grouting was black with grime  bars on the windows which made the room even smaller than it was The furnishings were very dated  amp  broken nothing matched curtains were green bedding orange  amp  red  the throw smelt stale  amp  the cost per night        We were given polestyrene cups  amp  plastic spoons  to drink from  Continental breakfast was included in the price  this consisted of bread roll with a choice of apricot or strawberry jam  a tea urn containing orange juice  amp  choice of tea coffee or hot chocolate  We found alternative accommodation  amp  checked out 
N =>   Just Fine I stayed here with   friends from college  As American  male students  we weren t expecting a whole lot  just a place to sleep and shower during our stay in London and it provided just that  The front desk staff  except the late night man  was extremely friendly  a woman talked to us regularly for     minutes   as was the bartender in the hotel bar  Extremely convienant to the tube as well as Paddington Station for rail trips  would definatly recommend the hotel to like minded travelers  Cleaner than my room at home  comfortable enough  and we were in a basement room which seemed fine to me  
N =>   Worst Value Hotel Avoid this hotel at all costs  Having stayed in hotels from back packers up to    all over the world  this is the worst value hotel we have ever stayed in  Dirty  stuffy rooms with poorly designed shower that wouldn t drain properly  Very noisy despite being in a relatively quiet area  Breakfast is virtually non existent  Would recommend a back packers over this place   less than half the price for the same quality  Other guests were making similar comments  How this place got a     even in London where the   rating system seems pretty random  we ll never know  
N =>   Not recommended Good location close to lively Queensway  Big tripple room although we booked double room  Also stayed here in      but the hotel has been refurbished since then and now has an elevator  Not the cleanest room  Nonchalant staff in reception  Breakfast was ok but not great  
N =>   Would not stay here again The front desk staff were polite  amp  helpful  but other areas of the hotel need alot of help  especially housekeeping  In the   nightsthat we were there  the sheets were never changed  in fact the beds were barely made up  The shower was terrible and very dangerous  as there was nothing to keep you from slipping in the tub  it was very slippery   The hotel was very noisy with guests slamming doors  amp  talking in the hallways all night long  
N =>  Would not stay here again I regret staying at this hotel  I was staying in a hostel previously and it was so much better  My room here was so tiny  the door would not open fully  If anyone who is clausterphobic were to stay here they would go insane  My room was the size of a tuna can  my private room in my hostel was bigger  the washroom too   The breakfest was awful  just bread  juice  tea or coffee  I would not stay here again  
N =>  Cold run down skimpy breakfast My granddaughter and I stayed at the Bayswater Inn in ch of       While the location was great  the hotel itself was a miserable experience  The beds were old and lumpy  There were no extra towels  washcloths or blankets  The window in our room did not close all the way  so it was extremely cold  The breakfast consisted of a large dinner type roll and jams  We asked the hotel staff to arrange for a taxi for us on the day of our depature  which they said they did  but the taxi never showed up  We nearly missed our connection to our next destination  I wouldn t stay there again  
N => Small room Found the room very small and with no view at all  As I had booked last ober I expected a better room  The breakfast for which I was charged       per person was actually only       per person on the menu  The bar was very good but was shut on the Wednesday night  The television reception was rubbish I have written to the hotel twice since last Saturday but  as yet  have had no reply  
N => No No No No First of all we arrived earlier than Check in time     Am THe bad Front Desk Old lady was trying to check us in but she was VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY RUDE OMG why is she even in the front desk       WHY i kindly asked her how many stars is this hotel and she just said   STARS    with a slightly loud Tone of voice     i was like OK fine you win now check us in will ya  then here came the Ops support coz the nice lady couldnt see our reservation apparently    anyways they told us that our room wasnt ready so WE had to store our luggage OURSELVES in their Luggage room  Ok if your a   star WHERE THE Heck is the concierge     they gave us a room in the BAsement  trust me it wasnt a good experience  we didnt manage to complain because we were busy through that time      Continental Breakfast  by that you mean no hot food right  well we had the coldest Bread Rolls and the coldest coffee and the warmest Orange juice    too good to be    hostel i dont even remember how we checked out to be honest  this is a    out of    in terms of rating  
N =>   basic but bearable I was expecting the worst after reading the write ups on this hotel so I guess this prepared me  amp  made my stay quite pleasant  The hotel is basic  amp  rather shabby but our room was clean  amp  the hotel s very near to the tube station    mins walk to bayswater tube on the circle line  amp     mins to paddington  and a reasonable price  The staff are not the most helpful  amp  the breakfast is lame  the bed wasnt comfy but what do you expect for one of the cheapest priced hotels  If it s comfort  amp  style you want book elsewhere  If you re looking for a reasonable priced stay as a base to see london then certainly consider this hotel 
N =>   better than expected Some of the reviews were not very promising but we found the hotel adequate for our needs  There were no directions to get there but it is in fact very close to Bayswater tube station  We had a triple room  there were only two of us  with a large balcony overlooking the park  although access was denied  The road was quiet for London although by  am traffic was beinning to build The room was basic but clean with kettle and hairdrier  The bathroom was the same  some soap and clean towels were provoided but the taps were very stiff making the shower dificult to use  If you are a foodie  DON T stay here  Breakfast was breadrolls with butter and preserves  Very limted but also very fresh and as much as you wanted  Hot drinks and fruit juice too  All in all  for the price we paid I think we bagged a real bargain  
N =>   A bit like Faulty Towers Booked via lastminute com  literally last minute  about   hours before our stay It looked ok from the outside but was entirely different inside  The lobby was quite pleasant  as was the receptionist  We were supposed to be in a double room but ended up with a triple with   single beds     Hardly suitable for a couple  I didn t moan as I heard her turn a customer down on the phone as they were fully booked  so I knew we d not get to change rooms  The entire hotel needs a refurb  its very out of date  No room service  we had to fetch the  broken  iron ourselves  which leaked water everywhere and was somewhat dangerous  Breakfast was a joke  Bread  water  OJ and coffee  Absolutely disgusting  Prison fare would be better      for a night per room  You get what you pay for  Which clearly wasnt a lot  
N =>  We were pleased My husband and I just returned from our trip to London over the New Year s holiday  We stayed at the Bayswater and were truly afraid of what we d find once we got there after reading so many negative reviews  We found this to be a very nice hotel  it s no Ritz Carlton  but for the price it was more than adequate  Our room was clean  comfortable  no mold in the bathroom and everyone on the staff we dealt with was extremely friendly and helpful  Even the rolls and jelly breakfast was good  They had a menu available if you wanted a cooked breakfast  And the location is great  You don t have to be afraid to stay here  
N =>  Dire Experience Booked this hotel through Late Rooms  I selected this hotel because of its reasonable price and location  as it was within    minutes walk from a ridiculously expensive hotel where I was attending an industry dinner On arrival  they claimed that they had a computer problem and did not have a room for me Consequently  they shunted me off to Earls Court to a hotel that was nearly     cheaper and ended up in having taxi rides  which the hotel paid for   I had to wiat    minutes for my taxi back after the dinner Absolute mess of my evening I have made a formal compliant  but have had no response after    days  
N =>   NEVER again  Oh dear  I work in hotels and fully understand that you get what you pay for so when a hotel says  Double bed and continental breakfast  thats what I expect  The problems started the minute we arrived  the receptionist  v nice girl  checked us in  we got to the room and it stank of smoke this is suppose to be a non smoking hotel  some people have no consideration   we requested to move rooms  even thought they were fully booked we were allocated to a second room great  I thought until we found out it was a triple room so we requested a different room  The duty manager  v unhelpful  unfriendly woman  told us they were full and would  sort it tomorrow   By now  Im in the bar  leaving my partner to get us a suitable room  Eventually we get a room and while it was generally clean the bed was rather small  think     bed   and there was dust all over the mirror frames  the lampshades etc  great for allergies   Neither night did I manage more than   hours sleep  total  not continuous  The shower in the morning was great until I saw the size of the towel that was suppose to dry me   hand towel springs to mind spare a thought for my rugby player built South African boyfriend On our second morning we did venture down for breakfast  I have experienced better in a     a night  scummy hotel by a train station  Continental breakfast look it up  Traditionally consists of bread  pastries  croissants and danish  coffee  milk and juice  Hard bread rolls and white toast  no choice  didn t quite live up to it  Service was also appalling not one member of staff smiled or said good morning  despite the fact we did both  A SMILE COST NOTHING Anyway  to sum up this rant up  the hotel will be getting a complaint letter as will the site we booked it through  Don t be fooled by the good location and prices book a Travel Lodge or a hostel you will definately have a better experience  
N =>  Cheap and cheerful I got transferred to this hotel as my orginal hotel changed ownership  Looking at the reviews on here I was quite worried  All in all though our rooms were clean and comfortable and the location was great   mins from tube   I have to say though that the hotel staff were a little rude and breakfast was very limited  For a one night stay it was fine but if we go back to London for a longer break I ll be staying somewhere else  
N =>  Disgusting place Nevermind the disgusting facility  but the staff were rude and they charged me more than I was expected to pay  then refused me a refund  DO NOT EVER STAY HERE  
N =>   WARNING  We checked out the next day  My husband and I took our teenagers to London for our big vacation  Bayswater hotel   stars  was listed in our package via our travel agent  We read the bad reviews but we booked   rooms hoping for the best  When we arrived  I was horrified to see black mold in the shower  the bed unevenly sloped against the wall  mold on the linens   an odor of sour mildew was present in each room   no soaps shampoos and the bath mat was made of paper  The carpet and walls had stains on them  I wouldnt let my kids touch the comforter or floor barefoot  All afternoon I made calls to the U S  hunting for a better hotel via our travel co whom didn t help us at all  At our own expense  we changed hotels the next morningI Since our breakfast was included  we drank the coffee and sour juice but wouldn t touch anything else  There were no smiles from the waitstaff  Who can blame them  We took photos to make our case with our travel co  Our memory of London will begin with a entire wasted day searching for a clean place to stay  There is one positive  The staff were helpful  kind and understood our plight  
N =>   Good location But NOT good hotel  The location of the hotel was superb  as soon as we arrived we walked to Notting Hill and happened upon the Portobello ket  But the room itself was the smallest thing ever  The bed was against the wall and if you have more than one small bag you will find it difficult to find a place for it  But the worst thing of all was that the bed comforter  it was covered in hair  It was disgusting      We removed it and put it in the closet  The sheets and pillows were clean but the comforter was not  I would not stay here again but would find a hotel in the area  
N =>   It s fine This is a good  clean budget hotel   beds slightly hard as were pillows   but bathroom was more than adequate and cleaner than some higher class hotels I have stayed in  You get what you pay for but this was good value for money     for double room on laterooms com  As a place to crash after a party or gig this was great  Close to tube stations and you felt quite safe walking round the area at night  
N =>  be the rooms above ground were better     But I wouldn t know  They put me in a cell in the basement  And I kid you not   the room was smaller than a police holding cell  I took the elevator down  wandered through the maze of corridors to my room  inserted the key  and   walked straight into the nightstand  In order to pull my suitcase into the room  I needed to first open the closet door directly opposite the room door  then step into the closet  open the room door all the way and grab my suitcase before it wandered off  The window lock appeared to be broken  but that apparently didn t matter much  since I had a grand view of   a window well  The bathroom  while it had a nifty heated towel rack  was a tad too narrow for someone larger than a house cat  I m quite small  yet even I discovered one morning that it was possible to simultaneously burn my back on the towel rack and bash my forehead in on the faux marble ledge over the sink as I leaned over to wash my face  The walls appeared to have been made of rice paper  because I could hear every single movement in every room down in the basement  And judging by the number of families I heard  I was only mildly reassured that they didn t just put the solo travellers in the dungeon  I m a very low maintenance traveller  I can deal with just about anything  as long as I m not rooming with rats or roaches  This was the only time I thought seriously about asking for another room  But since the room actually was quite clean  and I was only there for a short time  I decided to suck it up and deal  It s definitely a hotel for the budget traveller  
N =>  Caught by surprise So this hotel was not as bad as we thought it was going to be After reading SO many reviews that did not favor Bayswater  we found nothing wrong with it  Possibly because we had low expectations   and americans tend to be VERY picky The location of Bayswater is excellent  Pubs all around  not far from notting hill market  shops  close to the tube or a walk in hyde park  It was clean  good size  slipped once in the shower  but all was good  Service was complient and helpful Breakfast was decent  rolls in the morning  but as long as I had some coffee  all was good  I have no complaints  the only thing is if you plan on staying in  which I have no idea why you would do this  the beds were a litle springy  but if you were out all day site seeing or whatever  you should be tired enough to sleep on them  We were there for a week  and I found it to be very pleasent  
N =>  rude receptionist I took    of my students  aged    to     to the hotel in ruary  I had stayed in the area   though not at this hotel   before and can only recommend it  the area that is   Pubs  restaurants  supermarkets  a shopping centre  cinemas  the park and two underground stations are all within walking distance  You can also stroll through the park to the museums  Victoria  amp  Albert  Science etc   and end up within walking distance of Harrods If you are into walking you could even walk through the park to Oxford Street The Bayswater Inn was my third choice  a hotel I had stayed at before was being renovated  another didn t take groups  After reading some of the rewievs I was a bit apprehensive but the only really negative experience we had was with the front desk  A woman who called herself the supervisor was extremely rude and unhelpful when two of my students asked to change their room because they had not been able to sleep all night because of a group of Spanish teenagers partying next door  Other members of staff were friendly but seemed disorganised  e  g  they couldn t find our reservations even though we had already filled in all the forms in the morning As other reviewers have pointed out you have to leave your luggage in the luggage room which can be accessed by anyone  On arrival the  quot friendly supervisor quot  even suggested leaving it in the hotel lobby My room was a single on the first floor which had the size of a shoe box and faced a brick wall  Even though it was right next to the elevator it was quiet   the bed was a nightmare though  If I went to the hotel again I would book myself a twin at the same price as the single None of us stayed in the basement but I had the chance to look at one of the rooms and can only underline what previous reviewers have said  it is like living in a hole Breakfast was rolls and jam which was basically what I had expected   it is London after all  At least it was buffet style  I had stayed at a London hotel before where you got two pieces of toast and that was it If you have not been to London before  as a rule you get much less than you pay for  Rooms are tiny  So if you are talking value for money  London style  I would say the hotel is ok  It is a sightseeing trip after all and the time you spend at the hotel is extremely limited Still I would not recommend the hotel to individual travellers  There were three international groups there during our stay  A choir from Norway  a group a Spanish teenagers and us  Surprisingly they did not put me on the same floor as my students which I suppose also happened with the Spanish group thus the excessive noise at night  see above  The hotel offers a bar that is reasonably priced  service was good In a putshell  yes  I would probably take a group there again  no  I would never choose this hotel for a private trip  
N =>  Don t stay at the Bayswater Inn Location of the hotel was quite good  very easy to get to central London however had some some very dodgy experiences in the week I stayed  Stayed as part of a group of    of us   even though we told them who was staying in each room they didn t keep a record  One room was broken into  and locked again  and camera  ipod  and cash were stolen   when the key was left at the front desk  Rooms smelled of cigarette smoke even though smoking is meant to be banned inside  While away on my trip my bank reported that someone had tried to access my credit card account   the only place I had used it was a this hotel   in order to make a local call from my hotel room  Beware   Don t stay here   
N =>   Beware  Hi Everyone We stayed at this hotel as part of our vacation package booked by Gate   Travel  We were there for   nights  amp  just got back  I am the type of traveler who has no problem staying in a   or   star hotel or even a hostel when I vacation in Europe  All I need is a safe neighborhood  a clean bed  amp  I m happy  This hotel was in a safe neighborhood that offered plenty of food choices  amp  was close to public transportation  However the negatives for the hotel outweighed the positives  Our initial response to the room was  quot OK quot  but upon closer observation we found multiple things that needed repair or cleaning  This hotel could be a nice place to stay if the owners put out the money to update the facilities   we decided it s just cheaper to pack the tourist in every few days since a remodel or update would cut into profits   Positives   The reception staff were pleasant to deal with  The room had the basic necessaries   heat  hot water in the shower  hair dryer  hot water maker for soup  amp  tea   amp  a TV for those who need that item  They did offer a free breakfast but choices were very limited    types of rolls  butter  amp  jam  coffee  tea  hot chocolate   amp  watered down orange juice drink  Negatives   This establishment is old  amp  in need of some basic TLC  It has definitely seen better days   The halls  amp  rooms had an odor  Our beds were extremely uncomfortable   we could feel the individual springs poking through  The bathroom was very small   that was OK but I would like to have had a toilet that actually worked  It wouldn t flush unless you took the top off the tank and manually held down the bulb while flushing  I told the front desk but they never responded to my request to have it fixed   I guess it s just easier  amp  cheaper to pretend you will have a repairman fix it but then not follow through   The shower stall was so small that when you went to turn around to rinse off your back you couldn t do so without bumping the on off handle  amp  turning off the water  we re not large people either   There was mold in the shower stall  I couldn t tell if the towels laid out for our last day were stained or possibly dirty  They needed to be replaced  The soap left out for our use had been unwrapped  amp  I couldn t tell if it had been used or not   luckily we had brought our own to use  No shampoo was available   luckily we had brought that too  Bath mat was a piece of paper  No hand towels  just one big bath towel for each adult in the room  Only natural light was a window that looked onto a brick wall several feet away  The luggage room was like others on the site have described it   locked in a room with buzzer access   gave the appearance of security without really being secure   anyone could gain access by simply pressing the buzzer   didn t have to show anything that proved you were guests of the hotel to gain access  The rating above woud really fall between the     dots  Not terrible   but not OK  Would I stay there again   No Way   To many negatives  
N =>  Bayswater Inn ruined my trip to London Sorry  this review is far from complete  This  quot hotel quot  is simply not worth a review  but a severe warning  quot All the extras you would expect in a London   star standard hotel quot  My room was a rat hole in the cellar  smaller than a prison cell  next to a noisy lift motor  almost no natural light  with a door  where light shines though all night  stinky and rotten What a shameless rip off  
N =>   Never Again We arrived in the morning and left our cases in the luggage room  which was not at all secure  Entrance is gained by pressing a buzzer   you do not need to show a ticket or press a code  Anybody could gain entrance and walk out with your suitcase  If you are travelling by train then use the lockers at Paddington Station instead There were always long queues at the reception and the staff were very abrupt  We booked a double room but was given a twin room  Staff not sympathetic helpful at all about this   we were told they would do nothing We were extremely dismayed by the size of the room   at most there was only   foot of space between the beds or the wall wardrobe  The wallpaper was peeling in places  the ceiling sagged down and there were metal bars over the window  The beds were camp beds  the mattresses were extremely uncomfortable   we both felt bruised by the broken springs Tiny bathroom  The bath mat was a piece of paper  orated with blotchy green white brown tiles The walls were very thin   the noise came straight through from the corridor  Every time someone opened their door we thought someone was going to walk into our room  The lift was very slow and make loud groaning noises shuddered  
N =>   Horrible Hotel This place was terrible The beds were awful  the springs would dig into me and wake me up all night   The staff were unfriendly  There was no handtowel and the bathmat was a piece of paper  The rooms were dirty  The breakfast was much worse than a hostel I stayed at for half the price  Do I need to say anymore  For the price I thought this was a terrible place to stay  
N =>   Moldy bathrooms horrible staff Do yourself a favor and do not stay at the Bayswater Inn  I was a guest there for seven nights for Christmas       Moldy bathroom  staff very unhelpful  and the heater was broken in my room  but they would not fix it citing  quot no one is around during the holidays quot   I caught a bad cold due to freezing in my room     they would not move me to another room  But the prize complaint  is that the front desk staff messed up my reservation  and while I was out enjoying London  they went into my room and packed everything up  and gave my room to another person even though I paid in advance and had a confirmation for the entire week  No apologies  and I had to fight with the manager to get a refund  Horrible  horrible  horrible hotel  So if you enjoy mold  broken heaters and people going through your stuff  this is the place for you  
N => Some problems but we survived The Bayswater Inn has a good location in a pretty borough of London  very close to two underground stations and to Queensway  where you can find all you need  from Boots to pubs  The staff is quite kind  no problem with it  That s it for the good comments  Infact  other aspects are very disappointing  First of all  when we arrived we realized that they gave us a room in the basement  It was very wet  dusty  dark  People from the street could see into our room  We found also a beatle into the bathroom lamp  it was fighting for life  then it died  but it was horrible to know that an other host was livinig with us  thinking also to its companions likely hanging into the ceiling gap  We stayed for another week end at the Bayswater  the week later  after a trip to southern England  and we asked for a room in another floor  Finally  the staff gave us what we asked  This other room was better but I found a dirty towel  dirty of the wrost thing you could imagine  Another default that other people have underlined  the breakfast  very poor  almost sad  with a humble bread and a disgusing orange juice  The coffee was coloured water I don t know wether I could find at the same price a better location in London     pounds per night in a twin room with en suite bathroom  but next time I will try to find something better  
N =>  You Just Had To Laugh  This hotel was just pathetic  You just had to laugh   First of all the rooms were tiny and were originally made for   people but they had placed a camp bed in to fit more people in  It was just ridiculous  The T V didn t work  the kettle took ages to boil  the hairdryer nearly blew up and the  tea making facilities  were something to laugh about  The beds were extremely uncomfortable and people resulted in sleeping on the floor  as this was cleaner and more comfy  The shower and toilet did not work which is very unhygienic  The staff were out of order  On the first night they would not give us our keys as we were told that the key cards were for breakfast only  This meant a group of    school children at       at night were sat waiting to go to bed  When trying to explain to the staff that they had made a mistake  in broken English they firstly shouted at me  then one of our teachers  then another pupil and finally me again  The staff were extremely rude and should be sacked  On the second night at about       there were   drunken men shouting and vomiting everywhere  which was not dealt with  One of our group needed a camp bed and so we went down to reception and explained the situation and asked for help  This resulted in once again being shouted at and told that we could have no bed  pillows or quilt    Breakfast  was a joke  You did have a large choice between brown mouldy rolls or white mouldy rolls  On the second day we had no breakfast due to the poor quality  The hotel was disastrous and practically ruined our holiday  So thank you very much to all the staff that went on the trip from Bury Church High School  without you the trip would have gone downhill from start to finish  xx 
N => You get what you pay for We read the reviews on this site and were more than a little nervous about our stay at the Bayswater  but were pleasantly surprised The room was small  but for where we were and the price what else can you expect  We were slightly inconvenienced by having to provide our credit card details and deposits for everything extra we required and the breakfast leaves alot to be desired  we only ate our complimentary breakfast once   The attitude of the staff ranges from courteous to friendly We were not expecting to stay in the hotel room and we didn t  the only time we saw the hotel in daylight was on the day we left  We were out of the hotel from       am untill        pm at night  It is a great location  we even walked from ble Arch  The underground is close enough not to need to walk too far There could be improvements in the quality of the food provided  but that is our only criticism  
N =>  No problems I stayed in the hotel from    to    of ruary and there were no problems whatsoever  The double room   th floor  was small but enough for a quick stay  Everything was clean  towels were replaced everyday and nothing was broken On the room  there was a hairdryer and an electrical water boiler to make coffee or tea  Television was small  but worked without problems The bathroom was a bit small  but everything was very clean  in perfect conditions and there was plenty of hot water The staff was lovely and the breakfast was very simple but good enough for the price The Tube station  bayswater   Circle and District Lines  was two streets away  making the location of the hotel perfect  Very quiet neighborhood with loads of restaurants  Queensway  and shops Fairly decent for the price 
N => Wow   we must have been lucky    We had a triple room  me  husband and daughter  and we have no complaints except for a broken bedside lamp  we paid       for three nights all in all and we were pleasantly surprised by the comfort  service etc Breakfast wasn t fantastic but not bad either  
N =>  Steer Clear       I stayed at the Bayswater Inn as a single guest on              and will definitely not ever return  I was booked into a single room in which I could barely turn around  There was not even enough space to lay my suitecase out   I had to close my suitecase in order to get to the bed  The worse part however was the noise  My room was in the basement and located next to the housekeeping closet  At       AM  I was awakened by bags of bed linens being thrown against my window which just happend to be next to the door which supplied the housekeeping closet  I reported this to the front desk  asked for another room  and was refused  Not even a courteous apology or explanation was provided I also had the honor of listening to the activities of the couple next door well into the night  The walls are very thin Breakfast was strictly bread and coffee  If you want eggs  you will pay        almost        US  My advise is that if you book on line  verify the location of your room within the hotel  More times than not  if you get a good deal on line  you will not get a good room unless you ask  otherwise you will end up in the basement  I am an American who lives in the UK and have grown accustomed to the smaller spaces of the European lifestyle  however  this hotel took the lack of space  excessive noise  and customer service levels to a new low  There are better hotels on the same street which are much better and around the same price  
N =>  Bad Hotel The hotel location is bad   it is difficult to find if you haven t print out the map in the internet  I go to there early so i cannot check in immediately  So that i store my luggage in the room  The room have lock but everybody can also enter to that room to get back the luggage   But there is a risk to lost your luuage as everyone also can go to that room to get the luggage  EVEN you can get the other person  s luggage   It is so Horrabile  I stay in second floor so i think it is better than stay in basement   The room is not bad   But the room service will not change the towel in the toilet even I stay there for   night   HORRIBLE    I also find they also will not change the bed sheet also  At night   it is easy the hear the sound near your room   I heard the childen opposite my room run and run and they run to the room at about  am  Luckily i still can sleep   Hope you will luckily not stay in basement   I you will not stay in that terrible hotel again  
N =>  Never Again Staying here was horrible  and I ve stayed in so called  quot bad quot  places before  I have to agree with most of the comments from the last poster  I was booked for   or   nights  and they tried to put me in the basement near the elevator and I slept one night there  it was the size of the closet and no place to put my suitecase  not enough floor space to even put it on the floor  I felt so tucked  it was a little worrisome    I didn t expect much for the breakfast  buns and coffee  but I m not a morning person so I left to go get a real coffee anyway  When they changed my rooms it wasn t any better  but it was on the ground floor  and SOO cold in the room  there was no door on the bathroom either  probably because it wasn t big enough  I finally apologized for my nuisance and offered to pay for a larger room  that I just could not do one more night without sleep  So they then put me on the  rd floor in a double room facing the front which was much more comfortable  I ve learned my lesson   
N =>  Disappointing and overpriced hotel I booked a single and a twin room under the condition not to have a room in the basement  Otherwise there would not be a booking  When we arrived we learned that for one night the single room was in the basement  near the elevator   and that we would have a double room  although I had sent an extra e mail before to ask for a twin room  My son and I do not prefer a double bed  Although the female administrator was unlikable in handling this case  we got a triple room  On the other hand the receptionist was very polite and kind  Some beds need new mattresses Breakfast is sufficient but not of a good quality  The distance to London city is a    min  walk or you can take the underground  about     m   The price quality ratio is insufficient  
N => Cold water in a cold winter We stayed at the Bayswater Inn for   nights and read the reviews after having booked the room  So  arriving at the hotel we were wondering  quot Would it be true  everything told in those reviews  quot  And the answer is unfortunately  quot Yes  quot  The arrival at the hotel was ok  and the lady at the reception was kind and  english The room was small  but on the  th Floor  so  far from the street noise  and     close to the noise of the elevator  We could also follow all conversations of the people in the room next to us  But hey  the color TV worked well  and with the BBC or ITV  that s it  it was not to difficult to concentrate on something else The first morning we wanted to have a shower    Surprise  there was no hot water  At the reception they explained us that there was a problem with the boilers and that     of the hotel was without hot water  Ok  can happen But on the second morning  no hot water  And so on    Until the last morning  Luckily  some afternoons there d been warm water  However  we filled out a complaint on a blank invoice given by a rude lady claiming she was  quot the Manager today quot   Last but not least  on the  th day we discovered that our towels were never changed    and we had to go to reception to get a pair of fresh ones Conclusion  believe most of the reviews on this hotel ready to become Fawlty Towers n       
N =>  No complaints After having read some reports about this hotel  I almost cancelled my booking  but I m pleased I didn t  Ok  its not the Ritz but the prices aren t either  The room was more than adequate  both in size and cleanliness and maybe I was just lucky but the mattress looked and felt as new  Without doubt I would be more than happy to stay at this hotel again  
N =>  you get what you pay for After having already booked and paid for our room  I then read the reviews and was really worried As I approached the hotel I was really apprehensive  I was told to come back at  pm because the room was not ready  and left our bags in the chicken coup as described in earlier reviews  We returned at  pm and were given the keys to our basement room  oh my god earlier reviews going through my mind again   As I opened the door the cleaner nearly had a heart attack as we came in  Back to reception to wait for another half hour  things were not looking good   Finally got into our room and was relieved to find it very clean and tidy  No bugs running around or mould on the wallThe only problem was that the bed badly needed a new mattress  as it was impossible to sleep on  so we slept on top of the sheets etc  and as it was so warm in the room this was not a problem Woke in the morning  had a tepid shower and discovered I was covered in bites of some description    We went to breakfast really out of curiosity  to see if the previous reviews were right  and regrettably they were However the hotel is well located  and has a busy friendly neighbourhood All in all i d say that if you are looking for cheap clean accommadation for one night only in a well placed location  then give it a go  Remember though you cant really expect   star services if your only paying one star prices  
N =>  sorry but only for deaf persons After a long day trip  I finally reached the Bayswater Inn  Although I booked weeks before  they told me the were overbooked  They told me I have to go to another hotel  I should sit down and wait for the taxi There only excuse were  quot You re not the only one  quot The taxi should come soon  but it took almost   hour and then    min  more to get to the other hotel  Two days later I had to come back  what costs me again   hours The rooms are very noisy  You can hear every word what your neighbours say and every step they make  Not to mention what s going on if you are staying with two classes of spanish students in the hotel The breakfast is pure impudence  rubber bread with burned coffee  a little butter and jam  that s all I could hardly sleep one night  After four nights in Bayswater Inn I need some more days two recover Not recommended    
N =>  The good the bad and the ugly After having already booked this hotel  for late   and then reading the reviews  I must say that I was very worried  My family  mom  aunt  and cousins  we were a group of   women  and I arrived after a very long overnight flight from the US at      am  We were told that our rooms  they don t have rooms to accomodate   people so we had two rooms  would not be ready until  pm  my mom complained and then they said maybe by  pm  So  we were left to wander the streets of London having had no sleep  We were told to leave our luggage in a room that resembled a chicken coop  this was a room that all of the guests had access to and therefore did not seem like a very safe place to leave any thing of value  We put our bags towards the back because it was relatively empty  but by the time we got back  the room was so full that we had to pull out a lot of other luggage just to get to our own  We got in our room at       the rest of the family did not get in until later  We were surprised by a number of things in the room    the bad  very  very small  granted  being from the US I am used to very spacious accomodations   very hot and stuffy  no ac   very hard bed  no washcloths  we had to buy our own   the good  extremely clean room and bathroom  with a clean tub   no bad smell  no bugs  even with the window open all of thge time  working window  nice size closet  not noisy  and an alarm clock  I was very relieved at how clean it was  after having read the reviews  The staff in the hotel were all from non english speaking countries and were very hard to understand  we often just got blank stares when we asked things such as  quot what time does the tube start running  quot  The main concierge  the manager maybe  was extremely flirtatious  much to our aggravation  But he did confirm all of our tours for us  and made one mistake  You have turn in your key everytime you leave  maybe that is standard  I want comment on the breakfast as it is thoroughly covered here  This hotel had a wonderful location as it was just a short walk to the nearest underground  Bayswater Station   Others have said that it is in a bad neighborhood  but we did not have any probelms even when we were returning late at night  Someone on the street even volunteered to take a picture of the whole group so that I could get in the picture and didn t run off with my camera  All in all my stay in London was the best experience of my life and I can not wait to go back  Do not be afraid to ask people on the streets or in shops for directions  everyone is very accomodating  I would probably stay at Bayswater Inn again because it is inexpensive  However  if I had more money I would probably stay somewhere else  Afterall  you probably won t spend much time in your hotel  
N => Absolutly disgraceful  It has to be the worst hotel ive ever been to  we didnt even stay   night  we checked out as soon as seen the rooms  They were musty  smelled of B O and very dark and depressing  We litrally ran out of the hotel  i cant think of anything nice to say about the hotel  it was just a nightmare  You Have Been Warned  
N =>  Good cheap accomodation It s not bad as most of the reviews  The room was small but clean  Good location  Not the best hotel I ve ever seen  but I suggest it for a good  cheap accomodation  
N =>  get earplugs     it was one of the worst hotels I ve ever been to  The worst thing is that you have to wait for your neighbours going asleep   you you cannot sleep because of noise noise noise   get yourself another hotel  if you already booked the hotel  you should definately cancel it  or get the newest earplugs     
N => Enjoy your stay    I don t think so  I don t think I have ever had such an unhappy stay in a hotel  The moment I walked into the Bayswater Inn I wanted to walk out  I was staying in London for   nights  while working  and I should have just bought a sleeping bag and slept under my office desk  I thought people in who worked in hospitality were meant to be hospitable  Check in was a nightmare  the  reception manager  was having an argument with a potential guest and didnt even acknowledge that I was there  and the person who did check me in was extremely rude and was unhelpful when I had questions  I walked into my bedroom and could have cried  what a waste of money  The carpet was dirty  the room was dingy and cramped  the bathroom was a glorified cupboard and the window was non existant  My three nights sleep would have been more beneficial if I stayed awake  The room was not sound proof and the constant banging of the front door and other guest noises kept me awake  The bed was hard and uncomfortable   it was like sleeping on gravel  I did not venture into the dining room after seeing the state of my bedroom   the kitchen cant be all that much better The only good thing about my stay was walking out the front door for the last time  I will never walk back in there again   even if you paid me Being British I feel ashamed that tourists come to visit London and have their stay ruined by staying here  What kind of a friendly  hygienic  lovable image are we portraying to our foreign counterparts with a place like this  Ive lived in London while at university and now work in the city  I love the city and wish that others can feel the same way  How can they if they visit this so called hotel outfit I am so sorry to visitors to London who had to stay here and I would not recommend this for anyone to stay   not even dogs  
N => you get what you pay for We spent   nights at the Bayswater  The room was spacious and clean enough  When I went to take a shower I noticed that there was no curtain on the bathroom window and the glass was clear not opaque  There were other buildings that had windows that looked into the bathroom  On mentioning this at reception the manager instructed a member of staff to show us a specific room  I can t remember the number   This room was no more than a broom cupboard with a window  The bathroom had no window  We decided that we were not giving up the room we were in to move to the alternative offered   I get the feeling the girl was told to show us that room as a way of saying be glad of what you have  In the end I had to ask for another bath towel to use as a screen for the window in our bathroom We had full english breakfast which was adequate The staff were polite enough  After the  nd night we found ants in the bathroom they were crawling all over the bathroom floor The location was good for getting to Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park  There was also plenty of public transport available nearby At the end of the day we really did get what we paid for  except the ants and the lack of curtain in the bathroom  
N =>  Bloody awful Start to finish  it was horrendous  Rude staff  poor quality food  extra cramped room with no towels and leaking toilet  Management were extremely difficult  Never would I ever recommend this place to my worst enemy  Not to mention  overpriced  Awful ruined my trip to London  
N =>  Not Bad I stayed at the Bayswater Inn for   nights  We never had a problem with bugs  in fact the only time I saw them was in Hyde Park   The room was small  but wasn t terrible to be in  I liked that they had internet access in the lobby so that I could email my pictures to my family at home  The breakfast was plain and often the bread was hard  but there is a Starbucks around the corner and a grocery store not too far away  I found the conceirge most helpful when I had a booking problem with transfer to the airport  My only complaints were the hard bed  which I was generally too tired to care about  and the fact that we were right by the door to the hallway and the teenagers up the hall would fling the door open so it slammed up against our wall  But  overall I enjoyed my stay there  I loved London  
N => be warned  Please do yourself a favor and pay the extra money  as I will next time  and stay somewhere else  The rooms are run down  our sink was full of some sort of caulking material to plug a leak  When walking back to the hotel  we were nearly injured when pieces of the building s fascade came crashing on the sidewalk below  Worse then than the noise that came from the other rooms was the COCKROACHES that were found daily and this was in ruary  NO THANKYOU  
N =>  Do not go to this dump First of all  DO NOT GO HERE When we first arrived we were due to check in at   pm  we had to wait until  pm until the rooms were  quot cleaned quot  Staff were unhelpful  amp  unfriendly especially the breakfast staff  The breakfast consisted of a bread roll  watered down orange juice  amp  disgusting tea  The reaction we received when asked for a slice of toast from the waitress was rude  amp  unacceptable  After paying    for scrambled eggs  one of our group got violently ill Even though there was four people staying in our room  they only supplied us with two hand towels and a measley bar of soap for a shower  The bed sheets were not changed  which is unhygienic  The manager was very rude  amp  we would never stay here again even if it was free  
N => Mixed feelings Arriving at the hotel we were unpleasantly surprised to learn that our room had been double booked  and they had arranged for us to be transferred to another hotel for the first night  Obsiously this was very inconvenient and we let them know as much  Once we had recovered from this debacle however  we did in fact enjoy our stay there very much indeed  Had a large  clean room and all was perfectly in order I ve noticed that the reviews on this site are very mixed   people have generally had either very good or very bad experiences at Baywater Inn  I think this may be because of a wide disparity in the quality of the rooms  We were on the top floor  and may have been given one of the better rooms because we complained a lot after the mayhem on the first night  The rooms elsewhere in the hotel may not have been quite as nice  this is just a guess   I have no way of knowing  It kind of explains why peoples  experiences have been so different though   
N => Hated it This hotel is as bad as the reviews  They do have a few nicer rooms but not for singles  but after three stays the rooms keep getting worse  This time round I was given a tiny room right next to the lift machinery room   which would switch on whenever someone used the lift  The room was in the basement even after I requested no basement room when booking  They said they didn t know anything about it and wouldn t move me as I would take up a room someone else could have  Nice  I will steer clear of this hotel in future and any other apparently    ones in Bayswater  In my opinion the hostel down the road is better value and quieter  
N =>  Not as bad as the reviews  Stayed here last weekend  room was very clean  it was basic but what are you wanting for a cheat deal  Not as bad as some of the reviews on here  think some people over react on some things  Very close to underground although I personally didn t think it is walking distance to Oxford St and the likes

N =>   Well located and very friendly We stayed at the Beaver on a Saturday night in y  We drove into London and the hotel could not be easier to get to  it s just off the A   They have a car park at the rear  All the staff were really friendly and helpful  the manager even came around the dining room during breakfast and said hello to everyone  The hotel is a short walk from Earls Court tube station which took us straight into Leicester Square  Room are a little old fashioned but everything was clean  We will definately stay here again on our next trip to London  
N =>   Works well for London As far as London hotels go  you need to fork over a lot of money for something nice  So for the    GBP we payed per night here it was alright  The walls were thin though  I only found that problematic in the morning when everyone is getting up and slamming their doors  We had to use the bathroom down the hall  but that wasn t as annoying as experience as I thought it would be  I have to say that the staff were all very nice  The wireless internet wouldn t work for us  our fault  not theirs  so without our even asking they ran a cable into the lounge and cleared a desk so we could just plug into the internet  Very thoughtful of them  It was definitely small  but manageable  Overall a good experience  
N =>   Not Recommended  Booked this hotel back in       for a one night stay in        Got to the hotel and the receptionist had no record of our booking   But told us that he had managed to find us a double room  we got to the room on the third floor and found it a bit of a mucky hole with stains on the carpet and a fusty smell to the room  They don t go over the top with breakfasts either   Glad it was for only one night    
N =>   hotel from hell After looking on their website  all looked ok  and we assumed at the price we paid it would meet some minimum standards   BUT oh dear    The initial room we were given on the first floor was small  stank and had dirty  tatty bedspreads  on further inspection of the mattresses we found them to be heavily stained with urine  We immediately complained to the man in reception  who apologized profusely and offered us a better room on the ground floor   room number     This room was slightly bigger  and I mean slight   but once again  old shabby furnishings and decor  smelled of smoke  looked unlaundered and lo and behold on inspection of the mattresses we found them to be equally as bad as our first room Money had already been taken from my account for the first night and we were eager to get on with our short visit to London and get out of the hotel  so it seemed pointless complaining again as this seemed to be one of their  better  rooms in an old  shabby hotel   so we decided to grin and bear it  with the help of a large amount of alcohol we managed to sleep on top of the beds with the bedspreads removed and to show what a classy joint it was  the bathroom didn t even have a toilet roll holder  the roll was on the floor  no expense spared obviously  For some reason our beds were not made the next day  Laughing about it now  but I would not wish my worse enemy a stay in a hotel like this  Looking forward to the full English breakfast  my mouth dropped open at being presented with one small skinny sausage and one thin slice of bacon   which England did this breakfast come from    
N =>  what a dirty hole well i went down london with my brother on a spare of the moment thing and we got off the bus at victoria station and it was evening so we didnt want to look round for a hotel all night so we went to hotels stop at station and they suggested the beaver hotel at    english pound for a twin room so i thought it must be ok    quid got given a peice of paper as our booking form and payed    quid there and then whenm we got to earls court it took a while to find it and when we did well what a sight but we payed so we went in got one key card between   of us i asked if we could have another one and he said i dont know where it is i think the last people in the room took it so straight away i asked so someone could get in to the room with the lost key he said no it will be ok i will find it so we payed the other    pound for the other night and went to the room up the stairs went in the room and it was a thin walk way with a sink and   dirty looking beds with stains all over the floor white and brown dont ask me what they was i would not like to know but i was not gonna let it ruin my weekend i slept on top of the covers in some jeans and t shirt got up next day for brekkie went down sat sown said full english and got a tiny peice of bacon a mini sausage and scrambled egg and toast well i went to mc donalds it was crap i plea to people DO NOT STAY THERE ITS A DIRTY HOLE 
N =>   Smokey We booked the hotel through last minute com  We didn t pay much but we got the rank smoking room on the top floor which stank even though we left the windows open all weekend  The bedding also smelt of smoke and so did we by default  The beds were really uncomfy  Didn t bother with breakfast  based on our room we doubted it would be up to much  As we were checking out we walked past a room with an open door it looked lovely  normal room unlike our hideous one  Likely to have been because we booked through last min so check you are not getting the smoking rooms if you are going  even if you are a smoker they re AWFUL  
N =>   Ruined our weekend Awful  On arrival the hotel looked grubby compared to others we had passed  The reception was dowdy and gloomy with an ugly reception counter with sliding glass  We were given a room on the  rd floor which smelt damp and mouldy  The carpet was wet by the bathroom  No tea coffee making facilities  The bed linen  especially the pillows were grubby  The radiator and walls were dirty and splattered  The shower was set too low  I m not tall  and barely trickled  The lounge dining room area when we returned from the show was full of employees smoking  We took drinks to our room  We were woken at      am by employees laughing  joking and banging around  The breakfast was NOT an English breakfast  Small  the size of my little finger  sausage  ham bacon  two eggs and quarter of tomato  When we checked out we were  disturbing  the receptionist speaking french  and no questionnaire was offered  We have stayed in some very poor countries and never experienced anything like it  It really ruined our weekend visit to see a show  
N =>   Typical for London This is what I would consider a typical B amp B hotel for London  Smaller rooms and smaller beds compared to US hotels  but adequate  Breakfast was a couple of eggs  a piece of bacon  a piece of sausage  toast  coffee or tea  and was enough to get you started in the morning  Staff was very friendly  Only a few TV stations       minute walk to Earls Court subway station Just a word of caution though   the elevator  It has a posted weight limit of    kgs  about      pounds   but I don t think that is very accurate since the   of us don t weigh anywhere near that much and we  quot broke quot  it one morning heading back from breakfast  We were all stuck in the elevator for about    minutes while the staff turned off part of the power to the elevator  but thankfully not the lights inside  and tried to find the key to open the door  We were still at the basement level when this occurred  so it was nothing major  but I don t think I would have liked it at any other floor  
N =>  If you like cigarette burns       you ll love this hotel  Everything in our room had at least   cigarette burns  including our blankets and sheets  The room was dirty and I did not want to unpack a single item from my luggage  In fact  I felt like i had to remove my comforter with gloves because I didn t know what was on it  I am not one to worry about the decorating in a hotel  however  the pepto bismol pink wall color made me slightly nauseous  The bathroom shower was growing things  The hotel staff  including the owner  were EXTREMELY unhelpful  They couldn t even tell us the best underground station to use when going to the London Eye  Overall  we felt extremely uncomfortable in this hotel  
N =>  Quite reasonable Safty enough  Room are relatively small  Facilities are common  but clean  Free for tea or coffee  Breakfast is not bad  Reasonable price     GBP I would recommend this pretty small hotel to young travellers  
N =>  G nstig gut und Top Service  
N =>   Worst of the worst     Last time I came to Europe it was june and I went to Hungary for businness I thought the worst part of my experience there was my difficulty to find people who I could communicate with  Since it isn t very easy to find english or portuguese speakers in Hungary     But it s interesting how we don t give the proper value to the positive things  Over there I stayed in a great hotel with a fair price  internet was always working  the breakfast was fantastic and the staff was really really friendly  Now I am in London  naturally surrounded by english speakers    and I couldn t miss Budapest a drop more  At least concerning the hotel  Let s talk about this horrible Bedford Hotel Walls are thin as paper sheets  Breakfast is short of options  but at least the waiter is capable of smiling and offer you coffee more than once  My troubles begun   days before arriving  when I was trying to confirm the previous reservation I did few weeks earlier  The reservation had a mistake and I fixed the dates  When I arrived in London they gave us  me and my wife  a twin room since they were out of double  And they blamed the reservation that THEY did wrong  Fantastic  First night I slept many more inches away of my beloved wife than I would like to  But since we were so tired we tried not keep on that  Internet worked ok  and the room was awfully decorated and the place apart of noisy was smelly due to a lot of old carpet everywhere  Ok I have never been a great complainer  Usually brazilians are not complainers     but they trully deserve it all  When I arrived I paid    nights in advance  And so the nightmares begun Second night internet didn t work  Than it came back to work  Third night the same  On the fourth day  yesterday  it stoped working at all and till now it couldn t come back  Everytime someone calls the reception to ask about it everytime the staff gives a horrible attitude with theirs answers like it s not their problem  I heard literally  quot       since the internet is complementary it doesn t have full obligation to work quot    and the relation  as a guest  and a customer  started to gou really sour Tonight when I came back at  pm I asked in the reception if it came back and they said it was fine by now  When I came to the room you may guess       Nooo  it wasn t working  That was the edge  Came downstairs and asked for the refund of the following nights  Checking out the receptionist was again VERY rude  Asked me to sign a receipt where the reason for the refund was  quot checking out earlier quot   I tried to write the reason concerned the internet  she practly yelled at me saying I couldn t write anything else apart of that  So I said I wouldn t write and she said I wouldn t get a receipt  Like having the p leasure of punishing me as I should be punished more than I was already  Fantastic     Same moment came another guest to ask about the horrible internet service  I said I was checking out earlier because of that reason  the lousy internet  Seemed like I throw holy water in the devil     The receptionist threatened me of forcing me to leave because I approached other guest that they make suffer like they did to me  So  you can imagine that I left and looked for another hotel  Hope I have a better luck now Please  if you had the patience to read this unhappy review  please consider staying in another place  It s the best thing you can do to yourself  I am not a complainer  I am not a difficult guest     this place really deserv my worst consideration  
N =>   The horrid hotel The first room I was shown       was just dreadful  dark  dank and musty  Its prepaid so my heart sank as I realised that I couldn t even just walk away  I looked around this dismal room and decided to call reception  They advised they had no other double rooms available but showed me a twin on the same floor        At least this was brighter without that awful damp musty smell that pervades so many old hotels  Unfortunately  the walls are paper thin so I had to endure endless mobile chat from two americans in the next room  Thankfully I was able to sleep once I had stripped off the nasty blanket and opened the windows wide to let in some air   even though the mattress was hard   plenty of hot water but I just couldn t face the breakfast and made a hasty early retreat in the morning  This hotel epitomises    s hotels that have had zero investment   I wouldn t stay here again for anything  
N =>   good value superb location traveling solo  i was expecting a shoebox of a single  but was pleasantly surprised    even the bath was larger than i expected for the pricehad a room facing the rear  which was very quiet   there are complaints about the noise in rooms facing southampton row  no a c  but was cool enough that it was not an issue  and the windows opened which i prefer anyway  convenient wifi in the room  some noise from family with kids next door later in my stay  buffet breakfast is nothing special  but filling  staff was always pleasant  room and common areas always cleanall in all a good place to land in an excellent location    i try to walk everywhere  and this hotel is so central you can take time out midday to go back to the room for a rest    a real plus  
N =>   Happy with this well situated hotel This really is well situated   we went to two shows and walked back quite safely afterwards   breakfast and evening meal were both above the standard we have experienced previously in more expensive hotels in London  Our room at the back was quiet  clean and the staff more than keen to help   We are getting on a bit so the old fashioned radio didn t bother us    No problem at all booking in and we were luckily allowed into the room well before the alloted time  Only problem was a visitor  from the other side of the Atlantic  who was demanding   continuously   it was obvious that this upset the staff which were being targetted but at no time did this alter their approach to us   they were a credit to the hotel Hope to stay again Activegrans Nottingham 
N =>   good value just returned from weekend theatre break  went to see oliver which was superbhotel location is so convenient to all attractions recommend russell square station more central than holborn  breakfast in hotel very good enjoyed hot full english both morningsif you want a good hotel in bloomsbury area give bedford a try 
N =>  I caught scabies I booked this hotel through a well known hotel booking service  Arrived late evening  so unable to move to another hotel  Staff on reception were surly and unhelpful  Room was the most disgusting I have ever stayed in  The window did not close  room was filthy and there were no sheets or duvet cover on the bed  I felt so intimidated that I did not want to leave my room again  so I slept on top of the covers  luckily it was a very warm night  A week later I came up in bites and awful itching  and my doctor said it was scabies  which she said took a week to come out  When I checked the dates it exactly matched my stay at the Bedford Hotel  I contacted the website immediately and wrote a review but they removed most of the details  
N =>  Awful Hotel booked for   nigts but did not stay The first room we were shown to was tiny and had the most odd and unpleasant smell  The second one was the same  Both rooms had a general feeling of being grimey  The senior person at reception was uncaring and quite unpleasant  We were knowhere near Covent Garden and we had been told in the Superbreak brochure that it was     away  It worked out to be    mins  by taxi  We had booked in for   nights but managed to find other accomodation and left as quickly as possible with the terrible smell in our nose for the rest of the evening  
N =>   So bad  I stayed at this hotel whilst being away from home on a course for my work It claims to be a   star but I cannot imagine how they achieved that rating The hotel reception area is very oldfashioned in decor and is generally quite shabby When I went to my room I unlocked it  through the worn looking tampered with key hole  which was hardly reassuring  When I entered the room I found that it reflected the appearance of the unappealing hotel reception  but I tried to overlook this fact along with the decrepit tv  I tried to hope that at least it was clean  but unfortunately I was let down by this too  There were hairs  clearly not mine   dotted around the room and in fact I found one long dark hair once I unfolded a supposedly freshly laundered towel I then called the porter  followed by reception to arrange for my breakfast to be sent to my room the following morning  however the person that answered both calls just could not hear me Unfortunately my room was located at the end of the corridor so every time somebody entered the corridor from the stairwell I could hear the door slam   it was very difficult to sleep as a result of this  as well as the fact that I just didn t feel safe If your only considerations are cost and location I would still hesitate to recommend this hotel  I m sure a youth hostel would provide better value for money  
N => 	   Great hotel for the price   location      Booked in advance by my sister    wasnt sure what to expect     but everything went to planinc safe car parking  chargable    but worth it     SUPERB LOCATION    short walk to shaftsbury ave   so    mins tops to west end   For the price paid  inc a very good buffet breakfast was      per night double room   The room was quite small but ok   and clean    could have done with more towels and pillows  please note And the staff   in my opinion  where great friendly and efficient    To recap  if you are after a reasonable hotel   in all respects you could do much worse   i have  I wouldnt hesitate to book here again    
N =>   Pleasantly Surprised I was in London for   days  and found that this hotel great  I was told that it was really close to the Russell Square tube station  but had difficulty finding it  and was unable to find anyone who knew where it was  When I arrived I was apprehensive as the external appearance of the hotel is less than attractive  but found the service at check in quick and friendly  My room was small but lovely  clean with a decent bathroom  The continental breakfast that is included in the price is more than adequate  but they are able to serve you the full English breakfast for a small extra charge  The housekeeping staff were effecient  though I was not impressed that although I had left the  quot do not disturb quot  sign on my door so that I could sleep in before my flight that afternoon  and they came in anyway  The porter was great an allowed me to store my bags for no charge after I checked out so that I could go and get a coffee from Starbucks  directly over the street   and then hailed me a cab to take me to the train station I would recommend this to anyone who was looking for a comfortable  no frills stay in central London  
N =>   Terrible experience     We were stolen at the hotel room  When       il    to   Idea  Bed and breakfast Bed  We got a reservation for a double room  my wife and me  but we received a twin room and when we asked for the correct room our complain wasn t well received by the reception staff very rude and full of cinism Breakfast  the worst breakfast we found at our Europe trip  the continental choice is very poor and the English choice was very bad regarding some other guests Main problem  We were stolen at the hotel room  When we arrived from a sight seeing day we found our suitcases and backpack with the padlocks broken  and inside it everything was moved  total mess  So we immediately checked our belongs and somethings were missing  We informed the reception responsibles and we went to the nearest police station The hotel did nothing to help us and it is a very insecure place If you have no other choice to stay  please be careful     
N =>  Very Good Value for Money After reading some of the reviews on Trip Advisor I was a little worried what we might find at the Bedford Hotel  but having been recommended to us by friends in the past  we were sure it would be fine  The hotel is undergoing some refurbishment floor by floor   we could hear drilling noises below our room  but because we were out during the day it didn t bother us  Our room was on the  rd floor overlooking the gardens at the back  It was quiet  clean and appears to have recently been refurbished  The bathroom was small but adequate and beautifully tiled  The TV was old  but worked but we weren t in London to watch TV  The reception  dining room and residents lounge were all modern and bright  as was the hotel bar cafe  which was open to non residents  The staff were polite and efficient  There were complimentary newspapers in reception each morning  Breakfast choice  we chose continental  was more than enough  with plenty of tea and coffee served to your table when requested  This hotel in Southampton Row is in a perfect location to walk to Covent Garden and the Strand area  although there are two tube stations  Russell Square and Holborn  within a short distance if required The hotel does have its own car park which is chargeable In our experience  we couldn t have hoped for more   very good value for money  
N =>   Friendly but not fantastic I stayed here a few nights ago  before an exam  Staff at reception were really helpful and friendly  My room was very small  even for a single  and reeked of paint  Even though it had just been redecorated  the whole decor of the room was very old fashioned  and the windows rattled all night in the wind  Walls were paper thin    I could hear a guy next door in the bathroom     Despite the room not being good  the Bedford isn t that bad  The location was good and the breakfast was quite nice  
N =>  Not bad Check in was not a problem and a room facing the garden was accomodated  Food   ask Yvonne for suggestions  I enjoyed every suggestion that she made  Yvonne is also very helpful  The english breakfast at the hotel was not bad     enough of a selection to start your day off Room   basic and clean but redeeming feature was access to WiFi to catch up on emails Location   was the best feature  Good restaurants nearby  Covent Garden    minute walk  shopping    minutes to Oxford street  Underground close by Value for money   I did receive value for money  
N =>   Truly Awful This is truly the worst place I have ever seen  We booked a double bed and arrived only to have the very rude and dismissive staff tell us we would have a room with two twin beds  The halls had trash in them  the whole place smelled like mildew and smoke and the room was downright horrible  A Motel   was better There was a terrible  loud sound permeating from the room above us and it was absolutely awful  We lasted   minutes before we decided to move to another hotel  Do not stay here  It s not budget  it s bad  and the staff acts as though they do not want you there anyway   
N =>  London s worst I wirtting this review from jail after shooting the travel agent that recommeded this dump         just kidding But staying at the Bedford          the jokes on you I wouldn t even consider this flea hole if they paid me to stay there again   stars my behind        doesn t deserve to be rated Staff   unproffesional and not freindly  the entire hotel and rooms stink of terrbile odors  breakfeast   TG for the Starbucks accross the street  beds   my jail mattress is more comfortable good location               but  abosutly send your mother in law to stay there on a romantic getaway with Osama Bin Laden  
N =>  A well located and most pleasant hotel for a week s stay We enjoyed our first visit to London in the fall of      so much that we planned to return the next year  This time we checked  quot Trip Advisor quot  for reviews of the hotels offered with our airline package  and chose The Bedford with its full included breakfast  From comments on  quot Trip Advisor quot  we requested a rear facing room on a lower floor  As our room faced out to the Garden it was relatively quiet even with the windows open  We appreciated being on a lower floor when the fire alarm went off one morning about      am  After a day or so we got used to our room key being at the end of a long rod that you deposited with front desk when leaving the hotel  We also checked our passports and cash into a depository rental at the front desk  If you lose the safety deposit box key you are charged     pounds  When the fire alarm went off that key was our first concern  Our room was comfortable with a fairly spacious bathroom  A minor annoyance was the flimsy shower curtain that tended to blow in on you when the shower was running  Also  for all the available space  can t understand why they only had one towel rack with four towels squeased onto it  We usually had a hearty breakfast in advance of our sight seeing  We called our Filipina hostess at breakfast  quot Our Lady of the Morning quot  for the friendly way she had of seating everyone  She told us as she had to move     guests through a    seat dining room each morning  she had to be pleasant while really being efficient  On this visit we concentrated on learning the bus routes  Nearly all of the London buses pass within a block or two of the Bedford which was great  As sightseers sitting on the upper deck of a bus we were happy with being slowed down by congestion  My wife enjoyed her shopping on Oxford Street  We usually walked one way  and returned by bus with our shopping in a back pack  A note of caution to fellow travellers     think twice about buying heavy books and shoes as they can easily make your check in luggage overweight when you check in for your return flight  Surcharges can really be expensive for overweights  As Vancouverites we enjoy Chinese  quot Dim Sum quot   London s almost hidden China Town was a twenty minute walk from the Bedford with a reduced price on Dim Sum from      pm to   pm  We also enjoy Japanese and East Indian Food which were available in the many restaurants and pubs within a few blocks of the Bedford  A well stocked Sainsbury super market was also within a few blocks of the Bedford  Being adjacent to London University and the British Museum makes for very interesting surroundings  Just as well as our room TV didn t seem to have many channels  But it did have  quot Coronation Street quot  which runs in Canada   months later  Now it seems like an almost religious experience in knowing the future lives and deaths of Corno so much in advance  While not luxurious  the Bedford completely suited out needs  The front desk people were very helpful  Our room was clean and well maintained  Our package included  quot Hotel Link quot  from Gatwick Airport via the Gatwick Express to Victoria Station and then by mini bus to the hotel  As we listened to our fellow travellers being picked up from other hotels by the mini bus on departure  we seemed to be the only ones with no complaints  Which is not a bad testament as to our week s stay at The Bedford  
N =>  ent value hotel  
N => Nothing Special   But ent Price  
N =>  room okay breakfast disappointing  
N =>   Hotel normal bien ubicado  
N =>   La Colazione all Hotel Bedford   molto meglio fuori  
N =>   Horrible experience will never return The French man at the desk was possibly the most rude human being I have ever encountered on entering the hotel we were told that our room was not ready and would not be ready for another few hours  When we asked to store our luggage their luggage room was  quot full quot  when we asked to leave our bags in the unoccupied office we were rudely dismissed  after about twenty minutes of attitude from the boy behind the desk who continued to blare out some loud music from his computer which he was so fascinated with  I asked to talk to the manager  he wasn t there when I asked when he would be there he said he didn t know  when I asked if the manager could be rung so we could get to the bottom of this his reply was that he wasn t going to ring him because this was his job   I then asked for the managers number and he refused to give it to me  when I asked for a refund he pointed to a sellotaped piece of paper which read something along the lines of no refunds given My boyfriend and I left and booked a hotel accross the road called The Winchester they had one twin bedroom left which we gladly accepted the room was lovely the hotel warm an english fry up was served every morning and best of all after discovering there was no room in their luggage store they said they would find somewhere for our bags and that we could go and come back in the evening and their staff would have our bags in our rooms  this hotel was an extreme of the absolute dive of the belgrave and on principal I would refuse to ever stay there even though we lost our money for th three nights  
N =>  Avoid this spooky little place We stayed at this hotel in uary for a couple of days  It claims there is a lift  but the proprietors have omitted to say that to get to the hotel lounge you have to climb a step of several dozens narrow steps  How one can manage to do this with several suitcases is left to one s imagination  On the other hand the promised breakfast is without any imagination  each day the same staple of rolls and toast  No eggs  no marmalade  Only the packaged cornflakes were of several varieties  Some rusty black crumbs were flouting in the mineral water jug  There never seem to be many guests in there  Hotel charges you at your check in for your entire stay  which was not stated in our booking  This made bad impression  Staff barely speaks English  Some suspicious types       lurking in the lounge  The area of Lambeth where the hostel is located is according to recent stats above average in terms of criminality  Actually we regularly saw tugs assemble not far from the hostel  across the street  We checked out earlier and moved to another hotel in downtown London  This is bad accommodation in insecure area  Better to avoid  
N => A Health Hazard   I would not stay here if paid to do so  We booked this hotel months ago for a pre chirsitmas shopping trip in london  On the web site it looked basic  but clean  I will not trust pictures again On arrival we paid in full  We were told where our room was  There was no lift and we had to lug our cases up and down a maze of filthy corridors and stairways  dodging the bags of rubbish and piles of dirty laundry  Our room was filthy and next door to an emergency exit  that had a yale lock on it  The room consisted of a double bed with bedding that didn t look like it had seen a washing machine in weeks  There was a cooker that was leaning to one side and a fire extinguisher was leaning on the wall on the kitchen counter  with no accompanying type label or apparent last test date  But the best was yet to come  When we opened the door to the  en suite  we found a fility shower cubicle with someone elses show gel still hanging in it and a toilet basin that resembled the scene from Trainspotting  When we voiced our concern we were advised  the cleaner had not had time to clean the room yet    We checked in about    minutes before the advised check in time of  pm  The grime in the toilet bowl and u bend had obviously built up over weeks  We were offered another room  which we refused on the grounds that we were seriously concerned that our health might be affected by staying there  After a heated exhance we were given a full refund This is the first time I have taken the time to rate accommodation on a web site and I m only going it in the hope that it prevents someone elses week end holiday being ruined  
N =>   Smelly dirty over all a dump  The exterior and the reception area were lovely but as soon as you go up the stairs the nasty smells hit you along with the dirty carpets  walls etc  The room was small but bareable  the walls were dirty as was the floor  The worst thing about the room was the bed  it was noisy and so old that the springs were coming out and everytime we turned over they dug in  The location was good  Thats about it  
N =>   More than wrost and nasty It is a prison or grave not a hotel We booked triple room en suite for   adults    child for   nights  I have read negative reviews in this website before I went there but I was optimistic and thougth that I might be get a better room  But after check in I was realise that all negative reviews are correct  Started from very dirty carpet on stairwell  The room was damp and dirty in every ankle I think I got the room that show in the hotel picture because every position is the same but not that clean  toilet floor very dirty  toilet curtian was mouldy like never clean for a year  bed very filtchy  spring nearly come out  my back was hurt not comfortable at all  Cabinet and fridge very bad smell when opened  No kattle available  only one cloth hanger  TV remote didn t work  We complainted to receptionist but that guy said that it was very clean in his view point nothing wrong with the room  We asked for refund but he said that we need to write a complaint letter and leave it until manager come in but do not know when he will come  I could not sleep for the whole night because of noisy both from outside and inside of the hotel  I heard foot step and everything that guest in the room above have done  I wanted to scream  my son   years old  was cried  We decided to check out next morning and stay in at premier inn instead  Very angry they get my money  PLEASE DON T STAY AT THIS HOTEL 
N =>  YUK  DON T STAY HERE  Beds were so uncomfortable that I couldn t sleep   the people that worked there was so rude and told me I could only change rooms  mine was so dirty  if I paid for an upgrade Instead I just went and stayed in my friends room  which to be honest wasn t much better  but at least I wasn t alone in a creepy dirty room  
N =>   My Visa card nr was stolen  The web page of the hotel looks really nice but the rooms aren t  we only stayed for   nights and were out all day so we only slept there  We didn t have it comfortable but it was Ok for the price  we only paid     night for a dubble room   The bad thing was that when I was booking the room and entered my Visa card nr someone  I don t say it was the hotel  took my card nr  On the uari statement from the bank I discovered that my card had been used for several high expenses  several bills was on     eur   Fortunately I got everything back from the bank but it was all very stressful and uncomfortable  I don t use my card on the internet except when I really have to and have not been using my card at all except for that time booking the hotel  I even thought it was strange the whole booking process so maybe a warning bell should have gone on  It didn t work at first so I called the hotel and asked about the booking  The guy was quite rude and said that everything should be ok  I tried again and that time it worked  I even called the hotel again to confirm my reservation and it seemed to be ok  Anyway  maybe I was just unlucky but I just wanted to share my experience  If you want a very cheap hotel with a very good location and don t have high expectations this hotel could be ok for a coupla of nights  If the thing with the card wouldn t have happened maybe I could recommend this hotel  But since you only can book and pay on the internet I wouldn t trust them again If you book this hotel  or any other hotel over the net  check you account statements  
N =>   Only a place to sleep maybe We needed a place to stay for one night between our other hotel and friends  in the country as we were going to a party in the city  I arrived with my wife and     bags and noted the man in reception found it amusing to watch us struggle  but not necessary to help us get through the door or up the very tiny staircase We had our own shower  most other rooms did not  It s fine for a night if you don t need to be in your room for any period  especially at the price  Any longer and you may go mad  Our lights worked  our neighbours  lights did not  Our bed was like a trampoline  but not the nice kind  No aircon  no cleaning and the breakfast amounted to toast Okay for a crash house  nothing more  
N =>  Definitely worth a try  Was just in London this past month  On my way to Lebanon  but stopped over for a few days  Great little hotel     really cheap but has everything you need  Wi fi internet access  breakfast in the morning  VERY close to Victoria station  No complaints  Room was clean and the service was excellent  Certainly recommended  
N =>   do not stay here under any circumstances easily the worst hotel i ever stayed in  the first room I was shown into was basically a dosshouse bedsit   a scruffy  unusable kitchen with a put you up bed  the second bedroom I was given as an alternative  with shared bathroom despite paying for ensuite  lacked the oven but had nose pickings on he wall by the bed to compensate  The matress was stained and broken  and there was a single  brown   blanket on the bed  The hotel is dangerous and must transgress every health and safety regulation going  It  s truly appalling and despite arriving at midnight I was tempted to try to find another hotel   even walking the streets seemed a viable option  Staff however were not unfriendly and seemed to be trying to do their best in appalling circumstances  
N =>  Never go here  Even if you re tempted by the price  Just don t This is the most digusting hotel I have ever had the misfortune to stay in  I was only there one night and that was enough  The room was disgusting and dirty  I was afraid to sleep in the bed it was that disgusting  No one there understood a word of english  We were given the wrong times for breakfast so when we went down there in the morning at      and at       after sitting there for    minutes  were told in an extremely rude mannor that we were not allowed breakfast as it was after the alloted time  We were told       Its was absolutely rediculous  Justy don t go there  Pay the extra money and get a half decent nights sleep  
N =>   Don t go avoid this hotel if you possibly can   it s cheap and very nasty   reception was clean and thats where it ends  rooms were very small we didn t use the bathroom or shower both were very dirty in dire need of a referb   as did the room all very tired looking    beds were awful   felt every spring  no matress or pillow protectors although clean sheets   curtains at windows need re hanging    we stayed one night thank god   breakfast was supposed to be  quot continental quot  on offer corn flakes or bran flakes and toast   the room itself was very small and more like a works canteen   we wanted a glass of water but were given a pot of HOT water     The reception staff were quite rude when we asked if we could leave our luggage after arriving early   basically no was the response   the luggage room itself is a tiny tiny cupboard   One good point    it s close to the theatre s  train and tube   Value for money    absolutely not    please please take this review seriously and STAY away 
N =>   very very bad service       As we came arrived at the hotel at       with our reservation  the hotel told us they cancelled the reservation  withhout letting us know  We had to search for another hotel at night at twice the price  two spoiled days After several complaints the never even get back in contact with us SO PLEASE NEVER BOOK A ROOM IN THIS HOTEL YOU WON T BE SURE TO HAVE IT 
N =>   Cheap  N  Nasty Please  please take notice  I know money is tight for most of us but don t be lured by this so called hotel  I needed a break  amp  thought that this hotel would be ok  as most of the time I would be site seeing  amp  the rooms can t be that bad  WHAT A MISTAKE     I have never experienced anything like it  The room was grubby  the staff unfriendly  the breakfast room appeared ok  Aha I thought good until I tried the coffee  I think they made it the night before  it was more for surfacing the roads   The toast was probably reduced bread from a few days earlier  My window looked onto a roof from downstairs  it was littered with cigarette buts  amp  pigeon crap  I m sure the beds had bugs as I came out in a huge rash which was very painfull  When you went to voice your concerns  don t bother no one understands you  So please fellow travelers  AVOID  AVOID  AVOID           
N =>   Please do not go     Please do not go under any circumstances other than you have only the streets as an alternative i have stayed in budget hotels and know the score  i do expect clean sheets and not curly hairs on them  this is for starters  my friends and i were worried we might fall asleep and wake up in another country after being sold  dirty  grime  skanky everything  odd rooms  NOT LIKE ANY OF THE PICTURES      please believe   we did not sleep here   ended up getting train home   
N =>  Worst Hotel Don t book here  London was our last stop on our sixteen day honeymoon across the United Kingdom  We were looking forward to a nice hotel that we saw in the ad on hotels com The lobby was okay looking  The guy who work in the hotel was not very friendly  Our room was on the fourth floor which was a bit annoying but hey everyone needs the exercise  When we got in to the room we found that we had only one towel for the two of us  A dirty bathroom  Some one had dumped some dark liquid down the sink  But the funny thing was the cleaning crew did come into the room before we enter cause they left their cleaning supplies in the room The bed was uncomfortable  On the bed was just a sheet and a scratchy comforter and two flat pillows  The tea maker worked but they gave us two tea cups one had the handle broken  Towel they gave us were stained  Only good thing about the hotel was the location  It is in a quiet neighborhood near Victoria Station which allowed us easy access around London  Great pubs around it too  But you can choose another hotel on Belgrave Road  
N =>   Worst place i ve ever stayed without a doubt the worst place i have ever stayed in my life       Ok  it was budget prices  but you would at least expect humanitarian conditions to stay in     the boiler broke on the friday when we turned up  and they weren t gettin git fixed until monday  a whole weekend with no hot water and freezing rooms  so much so a group of spanish tourists called the police to try and get their money back    ended up they told us they would give us     per night back  which was rubbish   for the   nights i stayed i got      If you where going to london with pets i wouldn t even reccommend here for them  
N =>  Do not book here     My Husband and i booked after looking at the hotel website through vellousHotels com  Nothing prepared us for what we got  We went for the New Years Eve celebrations and although only for   night we had difficulty persuading ourselves to stay in the room  Tiny  cramped  smelling of damp   One blanket on the bed which had  gaffer  tape round ends of frame  Pest control box under the bedside table and the shower room   cannot descrbe it  only to say we did not shower the next morning  needed a health warning   Must admit only needed one blanket as the heating was on full blast and unable to control it   The tiny TV did not work properley  not even a mug in bathroom for cleaning teeth  The Hotel was full due to time of year so could not get another room  Do not be fooled by the website photos  Yes the outside and reception are great   the rest  well just dont go there This is the worst hotel we have ever stayed in and spoilt what should have been great time 
N =>   A complete dump This hotel is a disgrace  When we arrived  about an hour after  pm  apparent check in time  our  family  room has still not been cleaned  Upon investigation  we found over flowing bins  dirty and stained sheets  mouldy food in the fridge and  much to our disgust  pubic hair all over the bathroom floor We were a group of two young men and two young women  myself being    years old  I marched downstairs to complain  was met with a very unhelpful and arrogant receptionist who informed me I could not speak to a manager as there wasn t one at the weekend  I demanded a refund  was shouted and sworn at  at which we left the hotel and walked up and down the street around the hotel  looking for alternative accomodation  We knew it was not going to be a palace  but what we found was worse than a prison DO NOT STAY AT THE BELGRAVE HOUSE HOTEL  I have stayed in youth hostels which are cleaner and have more helpful staff  
N =>   Prison like Belgrave House Hotel The hotel on first impressions seemed ok  the bedroom was like a prison cell with only a single blanket to keep you warm  The bed was a fold down camp bed  amp  the pillows were so lumpy that I had to support my head with my coat  The mattress had springs coming through which were proding your body  My room was on the main stair well  this meant I was woken up almost on a nightly basis with people having to pass my room  The toilet was smelly  unclean  amp  in a terrible state of repair  The toilet very seldom flushed properly  The staff were unfriendly  almost bodering on untrusting  I would not recommend this youth hostel type of hotel to anybody  
N =>  The  Basic  Belgrave Was dreading what I would find having read reviews  Yes it was basic yes it was a bit  quot youth hostelly quot  but I paid         for   nights with my daughter and that included theatre tickets  Reviewers get over yourselves  V  Cox Oxford  
N =>   Cheap not cheerful  I took my daughter to london for her   th Birthday  On arrival we were greeted by the receptionist who was very friendly  giben our key and directions  well  heavy case and    steps later we got to our room  It was basic  tv and   beds with a pod style ensuite   which was clean  the room was clean although probably could do with a repaint soon  the floor was laminated and clean  The beds were a bit old  matress was cheap but I slept ok  i have back problem and it did not get worse  but the pillow was a joke  I think they forgot to put them in the pillow case  Could not get any more seemed to be a language barrier at this point  Bedding is clean sheets and one doubled over blanket  although warm enough did not look very inviting Breakfast was far too mad  we went down both mornings at about      and could not get in the room  we ended up eating in starbucks On checking out we left cases in luggage cupboard  reclaiming them later with no problem Possibly would use again but will have lighter case  
N =>   sleepless nights Absolute no go  Only the reception area is well decorated  the hotel is run by foreign expats who hardly know english  the reception guy was very rude  even passing wind whilst i was talking to him  to get to my room i had to climb a narrow staircase then go down again  then go through a a narrow corridor  room secured by a padlock  the bed was hopeless with springs going throughthe mattress  the central heating not working  hotel staff provided an electric fan  breakfast consists of hot water coffee and a plain toast  i tried to get out but they would not give a refund  otherwise shower very clean and hotel very well located  
N =>  dont stay here  had booked to stay here for two nights  turned up the first evening to be showed a dirty room  TV did not work and to top it all found bed bugs on the pillow  Went straight back to the reception with one of the bugs  and asked to be moved  only to be told there was no other room available for that night would have to sleep there and would be moved the next day  the man on reception took the bug said he would show the management  i think he just throw it away  I left to find something to eat feeling very down the thought of spending a night with bed bugs was just too much  luckly i found a hotel just down the road  and he had one single left  he showed me the room which was fantastic  they have just been totally refurbished and beautifully done and I was only charged     per night with full english breakfast  So went back to the other hotel to tell them i could not stay  and would like some sort of refund only to be told I would have to come back the next day to speak to the manager who would be there at      am  Went back as told at       only to be treated like dirt by a new girl on the reception  who had been warned i was coming in  she shouted at me and was rude said there was nothing wrong with their rooms and that the manager is never in on a sunday  as if i had made it all up  Anyway she called up the housekeeper  and demanded i went down to the room with her  to be shown there was nothing wrong  the TV still did not work the room still was dirty  as for the bugs well day time they do not come out  I asked her if she would pay to stay in this room  she said no we then went back to the reception  to confront the girl on the desk  her answer was i had to write a letter to the management  to demande a refund  as she could not do so  I get the feeling I will never see my money back  DO NOT STAY HERE it should be closed down  if you are looking for a cheap place to stay thats clean go to the St Georges hotel down the road the normal price for a single is     worth every penny and more  
N =>  We didn t even stay one night  The guy on reception was ignorant on every level  most unpleasant after a long flight from Thailand  When we saw the sub standard dirty room we asked to be moved  amp  were told that no other room was available  So we decided to leave  We asked for the manager s name  amp  were refused it  So we left  amp  found a much nicer hotel  Eventually got the money refunded through lastminute  A bad hotel  
N =>   Don t go there Booked a single room on a website before visiting London Worst hotel i have ever experienced there Though it was mentionned on the website this hotel has been totally refurbished  i ended up in a small single room on the last floor with tricky stairs Room was unclean and damp  with ceiling full of mould which was in a rather scary state  there was a noise of flowing water coming from room s next door al night  tv was not working properly  only one shared bathroom was gloomy and   floor downstairs Staff was awfully rude and unfriendly  from eastern europe with hardly the basis of grammatical english   they also refused to serve me the included in price breakfast at   am in the morning  pretending it was too late  the waitress just made strange signs with her hands to me when i tried to get in the room for breakfast  like she would try to take away a dog that would steal in garbage trashcan I was shocked and complained to management  which didnt pay attention at all and left without having my breakfast without having slept or excuses or refund DO NOT EVER GO THERE  this place is dangerous with electric plugs too and should close down to my opinion     
N =>   I am complaining to trading standards Stayed at the  hotel  a couple of days ago after looking at their misleading website  The website showed a well appointed room and said all others at the hotel were the same  Although I had been caught out before in this part of london I booked it  The room was like something from a kazakhstan brothel  Holes in the window     year old bathroom  camping bed  etc   When I complained to the  probably vietnamese  desk guy he would not change the room or explain why the room did not match the website  Tried to find another hotel nearby but all booked  I am going to spend half a day now writing to trading standards  etc  to see what can be done about it  
N =>  It s cheap Needed a hotel for three nights  relatively close to Central London  This hotel was cheap   compared to the fact that it s pretty centrally located and  in some rooms  had seperat toilet and shower The bed was quite bad  with the madras being almost just a few springs with a thin cloth over them  The toilet and bath were only just clean enough but old and rundown Of course a   hour reception is nice  but the staff were for some reason not even able to provide extra toilet paper  Hair dryer was not in the room but could be borrowed against a deposit  quot Breakfast included quot    don t be fooled  That was the flimsiest excuse of a breakfast serving I have ever seen  Cerial with milk  not suitable for a person allergic to dairy products  and toast served with one small pack of jam and one small pack of butter  again    not suitable for a person allergic to dairy products   I think they served it to ensure that we would not take any more of it  I was hungry when I left this  quot breakfast quot  But then  why two stars    Well  we were in London to see London  The room was only to sleep in  And given the location it seems to be quite cheap compared to other hotels I could find So if you consider booking a room here  my comment to you is  It s cheap  so expect nothing other than a cheap hotel  
N =>  VERY RUDE  We had a deal with last minute com to see The Blue Man Group  amp  to stay here  When we arrived  the exterior and reception looked pleasent but don t be fooled  the receptionist spoke v poor english and when we asked for information he declared that he did not know anything and that we would have to find out else where  Then we go tthe keys for our room from the bottom of the stair case there was a very strong smell of disifectant that made it hard to breath but at least it would be clean    it was not  it was awful the floor  sink and shower look like they have never been cleaned and the bed was basically made of springs it was v uncomfortable to sleep on we didnt put the cover over as it looked v unclean and roughed   it   the night so didn t have to use the shower  The receptionist are very very rude i stood waiting for one of them to acknowledge me which they did not instead they carried on talking in their own language then walked away  We then got a drink from the machine and the nothing came out to which the receptionist replied i will not open it and you may not have your money back then walked away    it was AWFUL  Take my advice do not stay here     a night is disgusting take my advice and stay next door at easyhotel com 
N =>  Rude personell and ridiculous policies I stayed in BHH for a week while looking for a place in London  I was working all day so didn t really bother to change hotels after  I hasd already prepaid   The hotel   I just wouldn t recommend it to anyone  The room  for which I payed     pounds per night  used to be       months ago   was so small i couldn t even leave my luggage on the floor  a standard sized samsonite  and didn t have space for my   shirts and two suits on the available space either   The maitress was so old it actually hurt on my back  and I m not very picky nor have trouble to sleep  The room was dirty and the window could not be closed properly  so it was pretty cold at night  But the last thing that definitely made me rate this place as HORRIBLE is that they have this  quot policy quot  for which if you forget something on the room  they basically keep it for themselves  I forgot my Ipod on my rush to get to work and realized at the end of the day   When I called at night asking if they have found it  they said the had  quot thrown it away quot  beacuse i had left it behind and they cannot keep anything guests forget  After being there for a whole week  The manager said to me  quot Don t come back if you dont like it quot  when I told them over the phone that this policy didn t make any sense   And tryed to make himself clear that they had trown the Ipod to the garbage and that it had already be picken up   Do they really expect me to belive this      Belive me  with so many equally  quot cheap quot  options around   you don t want to be staying in Belgrave House Hotel  
N =>   Absolutely Disgusting  
N =>  Do you like paying for rooms you don t get to stay in      
N =>  Barato pero no volver a  
N =>  una vera presa in giro   evitatelo sul serio     
N =>   Sans plus  Bon qualite prix  
N =>   horrible  
N => Sneaky I reserved a double room through an agent called Terry  He said that our room is in Belmont  when i asked about Astoria he said he has nothing to do with it  though i found that belmont  amp  Astoria are the same chain   to start reservation Mr  Jerry deducted    pounds of my credit card as a deposit            I went to check the hotel  ifound that our reservation was in Astoria Not in Belmont contradicting what mr Jerry said  We did not like the room as it was too small  the bathroom was tooooooooooooo small  so we informed the receptionist to cancel our reservation he never did      hours before checking in we sent an email to the hotel  amp  to Mr  Jerry to confirm cancellation STRANGE ENOUGH   the hotel denied receiving the mail   amp  we found out that they deducted    pounds from our credit card claiming that we did not show up nor did we cancel           The agent denied taking the    pounds for himself  amp said the hotel got them        the hotel said it is Jerry who got the    pounds It ended up that we lost    pounds between unprofessional sneaky people It was a very bad experience  amp  an unfair way to snatch such amount of money for nothing               I have my mails to verify the incident 
N => Portaloo    This hotel looked lovely on the outside  however when you get inside you are greeted by rather miserable looking staff who dont speak much and they dont even show you to your room  Upon entering the room after climbing a very narrow set of stairs  i was shocked to find the room so small that me and my mum could barely move  then there was the bathroom or lack of it i should say  it was the size of a small cupboard  i have seen portaloo s that are bigger  so if you are of a rather large stature i would avoid this place  Noisy  not very well decorated and tiny  
N =>  Appalling I booked for one received a quad room  Musty smell  Carpet certainly not clean would not be safe to walk on in bare feet Shower tiny  ceiling covered in black spots over shower  power weak just one tiny bar of  quot Soap quot  despite saying toiletries are provided  Hair dryer had to be collected at reception  This room was    steps up a narrow stairway next to attic  No assistance offered to bring case up or down  Sheets were white but I woke up  quot itching quot  Reception area had t v  but couches had torn seating  Could not face breakfast having had a sleepless few hours  Certainly would not recommend this to anyone  This building should be checked for Health and Safety  
N =>   Not worth it Way to expensive for this standard  The bathroom looked like a rebuilt oil drum smacked into a corner of a very small room  On the positive side of things  the staff was very nice  I d reccommend them any day    Also  hotels com did not give accurate information on the hotel  seeing as they promised us free broadband connection  We could get broadband connection  but at a price of    a day It might just be that we are not used to the english hotel standard  but I was absolutely expecting higher standard in a three star hotel  
N =>  Good location We were here for a one night stay in e  This hotel is in a good location about   blocks from Paddington Station  The room was small  but not the smallest we have stayed at in London   However  the configuration of the furniture made it very difficult to find a place to put   small medium suitcases where you could open them  The suitcases would either be where you wanted to walk or in front of the door  The room was clean and the bed fairly comfortable  There was a hot pot with tea bags and instant coffee in the room  We were in a ground floor room near the reception so it was a little noisy  but not too bad  Unfortunately the windows to the room did not open so it was a little stuffy but fine since we were so tired from our day  If it were very warm out  it would have been uncomfortable  Full English breakfast  sausage  ham  egg  beans  toast  coffee tea  and juice  were included in the price and it was pretty good  They serve breakfast downstairs which keeps some of the noise away from the rooms  All of the staff were very nice and friendly  This is a fine hotel for a short stay  but may not be comfortable for a longer stay  But  the price was very reasonable for London     pounds per night  and for being so close to the metro  
N =>   per quel che paghi va bene  
N =>  Wow pretty bad  I m not fussy when it comes to hotels but this was falling apart  The bathroom was horrid  Staff were fine  The front door just kept continually beeping and I don t know why  I needed to be in this area at the time and it was dirt cheap so I guess you get what you pay for  Somewhere to rest my head    that s it  
N =>   The worst place I ve seen in my life I can t describe this hotel  Is like a terror movie Everything is horrible   Don t do this Except you d like to record a trash movie in a good vicinty  
N =>  Stinking place   YUK   You cant call this a hotell  It was a stinking  crappy and a dirty hole  Had booked for   days but we leaved immidiately  We stayed at the Arriva Hotel in Swinton instead  MUCH BETTER    
N =>   Avoid This Hotel at All Costs  This hotel may only have   star but it is   star too many  It is absolutely the worst hotel I have ever seen  I had booked to stay there for   night  but after seeing the room I had to leave  I couldn t stay  not even for   night even though I didn t have another hotel at the time  Sleeping in my car was a far better prospect that staying at the Belsize Park hotel from hell   The rooms are supposed to be a basic standard  the room I was shown was far below basic  it was disgustingly filthy  Don t stay there       
N =>   Great situation awful hotel  While this hotel is undoubtably in a wonderful location  close to the tube and on a road containing more than one Aston ton  the place itself is a dive Our bathroom had a sink which was too small even for brushing your teeth  a shower which had been sealed incredibly badly and seemingly patched up  which would explain the huge damp patches and mould on the ceiling in various points throughout the hotel   Oh and the toilet seat wouldn t stay up  The room itself had  quot curtains quot  which were full of holes and falling off the hooks  letting so much light in we couldn t sleep  They genuinely looked moth eaten  Our blanket was full of cigarette burns and the whole room stank of damp To add insult to injury  my husband decided to watch TV while I was in the shower  Yes  there was a TV as we had been told BUT the aerial plug was missing from the end of its cable  having been seemingly pulled off exposing bare wires  This added to the other bare wires and dodgy DIY fix jobs we saw elsewhere in the place We had to wait around    or    minutes in a queue for breakfast  and then I had to wait another    minutes or so for my toast  My husband tells me the fried breakfast was the only good thing about the hotel and was fairly enjoyable  We didn t sleep well during our stay and were glad to leave  
N =>  Unclean unprofessional and not worth a penny Actually didn t end up staying there  made a booking  turned up  some crisis going on at the reception with someone else who had booked a room and no booking found  We were shown the room  changed our minds very quickly as was disgusting  filthy carpet  bedlinen  a box room  not to mention the dirty shower    Don t consider  if you want cheap find a hostel  
N =>   DISGUSTING        Don t do it  There are better places to go  It was genuinely disgusting even for cheap london standards  The room we got was dirty with all kinds of dubious stains  Dirty linens  Holes in the bed  the floors  seriously dodgy English Amateur DIY jobs in the kitchen  Rusty refrigerator  Curtains that did not close at all so the posh neighbors could have a free floorshow   The stains on the walls and floors were   okay   I think they look like someone s menstrual blood  I m sorry  this is gross but I am telling it how it is  so much so that I don t even want to put the photos up as it is gross  Don t do it  For your sanity  When I stayed for all of  hrs in the room before I ran for another hotel  I just bursted out crying from seeing how disgusting the room was  The old man at the frontdesk tried to be helpful  and he was sweet  and tried to give us another room  but it was just as bad  We saw   rooms in all  it was all really disgusting  
N =>   Yuk Yuk YUK Horrible   we reserved two triples for a group and one room was filled with flying insects due to an open window  The other room had dirty linens  including a used condom in the bed    needless to say we left after the first night and found other accomodations nearby  
N =>   Unbelievably Bad we weren t sure about booking after seeing the previous reviews  but since they said they had redecorated we took a chance  On arrival the Room was as filthy as others have described and the net curtains were black  If they have redecorated  they must have sourced the paint  carpets and wallpaper from a demolition site We refused to stay  and told them that as long as they didn t try to charge our card we wouldn t report them to trading standards for the description on their website  
N =>   Stear Clear of this filthy hotel On arriving at this place they call a hotel my wife and I refused to stay as it was filthy and un kept  The manager could not care a dam so I refused to give up my key till I got a complete refund which I relunctanly got  In short STEAR CLEAR OF THE BENTINCK HOTEL  I hope in the near future it will be inspected and shut down 
N =>  Avoid at all costs  Having read several reviews of this hotel  unfortunately afterour return from London  had to let people know that this hotel is still in operation and to be avoided at all costs  General decor dirty net curtains black  carpets thick with dust  bathrom filthy  live wires poking out of wall behind bed etc etc  and this was in two rooms  Having viewed the second one we walked out woman at desk didnt protest and tore up my resevation form  Id better not have been charged so I guess she was used to it happening  A disgrace this place is still running as the bad reviews seem to stretch back years so be warned  again and dont be taken in by the price we wouldnt have stayed even for free      
N =>   Nice location Visited London with   friends of mine in ober      and decided to take a quad room here  the price was quite ok  around    quid per person  and the room was fine as well  VERY warm  great heating  We had one double bed and two single beds  The room was en suite  so we had a bathroom  quite old and not too clean  but it was ok for   nights   Breakfast was included  some basic stuff   coffee  milk  toasts  jam  and the service was ok   the girl on the reception was very nice and let us leave our luggage in the room until        In general  not too bad  considering the price  A very simple family hotel  
N =>  Agree with other reviews Booked this hotel because it was AA listed  which is normally a reliable guide Agree with other reviews  shabby  minimal breakfast Beds OK  amp  convenient location  You probably need to pay a lot more for even an adequate London hotel  
N => Wouldn t let a dog stay there  Absolutely disgusting  unfriendly  unhelpful staff  filthy rooms  facilities definitely not as advertised  Avoid  
N =>  Worst place ever  We booked this hotel through the accomodations kiosk at a train station  When we got there  the desk clerk was pleasant and we headed up to our room  The room was FILTHY    There was blood on the bedspread  ciagarette burns all over the bedding  the TV dial was held on by a hairpin and the bathroom was moldy with pipes all over  The sheets had not been changed and the carpet looked like it had never been cleaned  We went back downstairs and tried to pleasantly say that this wasn t going to work for us  and the clerk did a Jekyl Hyde act  She became surly and refused to give us our money back  We had to go through the accomodation kiosk again who had success on our behalf  You d think a dump like this would at least be cheap but they charged      American  I have travelled extensively and this was the worst hotel I have ever seen  
N =>  It was disgusting We booked the Bentinck House Hotel     Bentinck Street  London over the telephone because it was close to The Heart Hospital which we had to go to  The hotels own web page said there were tea and coffee facilities and hairdryer in the rooms  There were none  We requested a non smoking room  It stank of smoke and there was an ash tray in the room  The worst of all was that it was disgusting  It did not look as if it had been cleaned in months  There were broken electrical sockets that were showing live wires  There was an oil filled heater in the room but the power to it was turned off  The carpets were so dirty we could only walk on them in our shoes  We arrived at     pm and when we went back to the front desk on complain it was closed and the whole of the downstairs area was in darkness  We slept in our clothes on top of the bed  We had to be at the Hospital at     am the next morning  there was still no one about at that time  We had to stay two nights and it was the worst hotel I have ever seen  Do not consider this Hotel  
N =>  Good Location closed to bayswater underground  easy to find halal food  
N =>   good location but not recommended The location is very good being only   min walk from   tubes and    min into the city centre        unfortunately thats the only good thing about it  the rooms are very dated and ridiculously small  the bathroom in particular where its a struggle to even fit into the shower  the wash basin isn t big enough to wash your hands and when brushing your teeth you basically have to leave the door open in order to fit in  The whole place feels very closterphobic  with tiny lifts and seriously narrow corridors  even in the middle of november and with the window open fully all day and night the room was still sickeningly hot  as for the hotel services the breakfast was only ok and even though its included in the price of the room hot breakfast s are extra  We stayed for   nights but our room was only serviced cleaned on the last evening only because we had requested it to be done       twice  Overall i would not recommend this hotel to anyone 
N =>   It does the job   but don t expect anything else  Travelling with two friends our choice of hotel seemed limited to find a triple room in London around the Bayswater area  However this room seemed to fit the bill and cheap enough between us for      room only The tiniest lift you ve ever seen   fits only   people at a squeeze  not for the claustrophobic  However  our room on the  th floor was a good size and the room was clean and tidy  We had trouble with the airconditioning but the hotel sorted this for us  otherwise would have been very warm up there overlooking the rooftops  Also couldn t get the TV to work but we chatted so much it didn t matter to us  had trouble with the shower   it appeared that the taps on the wall worked in a strange fashion and you needed brute force to get them either on or off Having said all of that it was pleasant  Nothing luxurious but then that s not what we paid for either Very close to the tube station and not far from the main road to catch a cab   btw   DO NOT GET THE HOTEL TO CALL YOU A CAB   WE ASKED FOR ONE TO TAKE US TO NEARBY KENSINGTON FOR A FIXED PRICE OF      IT ONLY COST    BY BLACK CAB   
N =>   Great Location   Hotel was literally feet away from two tubes stop makin getting around the city a breeze  Very easy to get to from Heathrow  Heathrow express goes straight to Paddington station and then its only one stop to bayswater tube stop which is a block from the Hotel  Plenty of shopping and restaurants VERY close by  Rooms were small but to be expected in european hotels  Isn t terribly nice inside but was clean and a perfect place to rest your head and leave your stuff in safety  The staff was very helpful and friendly and even let us use thier front desk computer to check our email about a tour booking  The manager even called the tour company to confirm our booking for us  Also staff was quick to help with any needs including printing maps and directions for us  The people who said the staff were unfriendly must not have been friendly themselves because we felt the staff went above and beyond to help us  Overall  great place for people on a budget and who dont plan on spending tons of time in a room on vacation  
N =>   We didn t sleep all night   one of the most noisy and uncomfortable hotel  We had booked this hotel expecting a good night sleep in what had appeared to be a nice and comfortable hotel for a reasonable price Unfortunately  the Berjaya hotel didn t live up to our expectations AT ALL First  our hotel room for three was located in front of the lift     imagine the noise of the squeeky doors opening and closing until late at the night Then  our room overlooked a sort of basement so that the air was extremely stuffy even with the window ajar    Last but not least  our room was right next to the air conditionning machinery   again  very noisy  The worst thing  WE DIDN T BENEFIT from the air conditionning In a word  try and sleep at the Berjaya hotel in a hot  stuffy  noisy and quite narrow room for     pounds    Really not worth it On top of that  our legitimate complaints were very coldly received by unpeasant staff  
N =>   Very small basement room with water pipes that drained all night I was given a single room in the basement  My window opened onto an alleyway  Although ober  it was still rather warm in London  and there was no air conditioning  and I was fearful to leave my window open during the night  One night  the water drain pipes in the wall at the head of my bed ran water most of the night  Not even the ipod could drown out the sound  It took   minutes to get from the front door to my room  taking the elevator  then through a maze of very narrow hallways  and up and down stairs in the halls  I will not stay in this hotel again  Staff was friendly  though  
N =>   NOISY not street noise Hotel itself is fine but we were kept awake all night by the noise of the lift doors SLAMMING open and closed  We were in     or     which is directly oposite the lift doors  I complaned but was told we colud not be moved  this was on thursday night and hotel not full  staff not very helpful  we ended up getting EARPLUGS from pharmacy  otherwise the hotel is fine for what it is  very well located in cental london so you expect small rooms for the price  
N =>   Overpriced box basement rooms We were allocated at the basement with narrow and smelly corridors  The shower rooms as about the size of our bath at home  the only away to use the toilet was to sit side ways  One of the bedroom did not have hot water at the shower  Staff not very helpful  
N =>  great little hotel stayed here for   nights april       Although room was small  bathroom even smaller  it was spotlessly clean  Good location near   railway stations  Breakfast was ok but didnt like to have to pay  gbp for toast  Although check in is      we were able to get into our room at      as we had transferred from another hotel  staff were very friendly and courteous  
N =>  Very small rooms Room  no       was small  Bathroom while perfectly clean was tiny  Shower curtain sticks to you as you shower Broadband rates were    per hour which I thought was way too much Excellent location though very close to Bayswater tube station but space in room was too small  
N =>   Not to bad but noisy Single room number      Not too big but big enough for me  clean  confortable and worth it to stay for   pounds per night  Shower with no space  dificult to have a proper shower  The room is close to the lift so is quiete noisy  avoid this room if you have a light sleep  You have tea coffe making and a    quot  TV  The hotel is near Bayswater road and any bus will take you to oxford street or picadilly circus    I prefer to have a    min walk to reach ble arch  
N =>  Don t Stay Here My wife and I stayed at the Berjaya from the  rd to the  th tember      and were very unimpressed  Whilst we knew that the standard of room would differ significantly to what we are use to in Sydney and places alike for the same Australian Dollar value  nothing prepared us for just how bad it was  The room was ridiculous  It was like a shoebox  You had to literally climb over the bed to get to the other side of the room  The lift was like a wardrobe with a max    person limit  The bathroom is beyond words  The shower was abominable  The day we arrived the  tube  went on strike and we bussed it around  which wasn t too bad  When we checked with Reception on day   to see if they were aware if the tube was back up  they didn t  and advised us to walk to the station to see  If we were back home and were staying in a real hotel in Sydney or another capital city and for example Central Railway Station Sydney or Kingsford Smith Airport Sydney was closed for whatever reason  the hotel we were staying in would deliver a much higher standard of service and be able to provide their guests with up to date information  as to whether or not the situation was resolved  and if not  when the likelyhood of it happening was  as they would remain in contact with the other service provider to keep their guests informed Apart from this level of dismal service or lack there of  we found the staff to be quite rude and unfriendly  Basil Fawlty could have done a better job  
N =>   Crampy Room First time stay in this hotel  Great location  just meters from Bayswater Train Station However  the room and bathroom are too small  You even can not move your body in the shower The receptionist never smile at all  I don t want to go back to this hotel again  
N => Dont Stay there I was very very disappointed with the Berjaya Eden Park hotel in London   I wouldnt recommend it to any person   After a    hour flight I arrived at the hotel  The person showing me to my room was not willing to carry one of my backpacks   I was carrying two  We were unable to put them into the lift as the lift was only big enough to carry one person  The hotel is built like a rabbit warren  you need to go up two flights of stairs  walk across a corridor then go down one flight of stairs  It wasnt until I accidently dropped one of my backpacks down a flight of stairs the man showing me to my room offered to assist   After my two night stay on the  th and   th of y      I opted not to take the booking made for me on the  th of ust       The person at the desk advised they were willing to cancel the booking but NOT willing to refund me the cost of the night on the  th of ust      They advised I would need to get the refund direct from my Travel Agent when I returned to Australia  When I returned to Aust my Travel Agent tried to get me a refund for the night paid but the hotel would not refund me  Surely     weeks is sufficient time to give the hotel to cancel a booking and get a refund   not according to this hotel  
N =>  Run far far away from this place they call a hotel      This hotel ENTIRELY ruined our vacation to London     No joke   DO NOT STAY HERE  Within minutes of receiving our key card  we went downstairs  yes the basement  and walked and walked and walked to the back of the hotel  The closest fire escape was were we just came from and there is NO WAY to pass someone in the hall without having to step into a door way to pass each other  Plus the housekeeping and laundry rooms are down there too  Our room was soooo tiny  the bed was against the headboard  the one side of the bed was against the wall and there was   inches from the wall at the foot of the bed  We could not put both suit cases on the floor and open them at the same time  Open one on the bed and one on the floor  Plus there were metal bars on the windows so if there s a fire  good luck  After seeing this    minutes later  we went back up to see if we could switch rooms  We were able to switch rooms closer to the stairwell but still in the basement  The room was about   feet bigger but there were no metal bars on the windows  So this is where we stayed  The man at the front desk  who could barely speak english  we are in England aren t we      said to check back with him after breakfast and see if there s an different room we could switch to  So we slept  ate breakfast and decided not to switch rooms  We come back after spending the day out to our room  and our key cards do not work  We went to the front desk and they gave the conceirge a new key and walked us to the basement and opened the door  Guess what we found   There was another couple in OUR room  with their luggage and ours no where to be found     I ran up the stairs and demanded to know what happened to my luggage  they told me that they went ahead and moved us  WITHOUT telling us    Now we are on the  rd floor  room is smaller then the last one with an extremely loud ceiling fan and yes it was warm out and NO AIR CONDITIONING    So as you can see we did NOT have a good experience here  Please go elsewhere and enjoy London because we did not enjoy it   F Y I  we had paid in full for the hotel back in ch  so we were not able to get our money back being that we didn t stay there until tember   
N =>   Extremely Disappointing It pains me how tourists are ripped off in London  Don t let the attractive reception or exterior of this hotel fool you  nor the photos you might see on the internet  When I arrived at this hotel  everything was going well until I got into the cramped   person lift and ascended to my room  The corridors are incredibly small and the rooms are tiny  When I tried my cardkey in the door it didn t work so I went back to reception to tell them  They informed me that my room was  dodgy  and the porter would let me in  After the porter let me into my room I was surprised that  even though the sun was shining  I had to turn on the lights because the window was so small it didn t let sufficient light in  The bathroom was so small  I could barely wash my hands in the tiny sink without getting water everywhere  The shower was also stained and everything about the room just seemed cheap and unfinished  Already dissappointed about the price i d paid for such a dissappointing room  I realised that I wasn t happy with having to fetch the porter everytime I came and went so I complained at reception  Thecustomer service skills of the staff were little to none  and they told me there was nothing they could do about my faulty door  They weren t even understanding or apologetic  and didn t offer me any kind of compensation  The next day when I was due to check out I got a knock on my door at   minutes past    and a voice telling me I was due to check out  Never in my life have I come across this in a hotel I got an online discount but the hotel rates are      for a twin room  I m glad I didn t pay the full price as what I paid was already enough  The staff are useless  the hotel is a total rip off  People should get their moneys worth and this certainly doesn t apply at the Berjaya Eden  
N =>   Do not stay here  Don t be fooled by the internet sight The hotel is NOT elegante  The rooms are not spacious  the staff was not efficient and friendly and the bed was not comfortable The room was VERY small it was like a cabine on a boat next to the machine room  
N =>  smoking policy We    off us from Denmark stayed at this hotel for   days  However the hotel smoking policy is very bad  I my self beeing a pibe smoker  came home from town one night  and felt like visiting the bar  In the bar smoking is allowed  When I took my pibe out and wanted to light it  I was told by one of the bartenders  whom I believe to be Russian  that pibe smoking was not allowed  Next to us   people were sitting smoking cigarettes  I told the bartender that it was regular cigaret tobacco that I smoked  and not smelly perfumed tobacco I also told the bartender  that many danes smoke the pibe because they don t want to get all the toxic substances from cigaret paper  This however did not seem to convince the bartender  and therefore I was told to leave the bar  This is discrimination at it s most  We will never come back Kindest regards  Karsten Lyngsoe  Denmark  
N =>   Never again This was a very terrible experience I will never repeat it again  I had to change a room  because it was impossible to open it with this authomatic card key The staff at the reception is very unpolite  The rooms are extremely small  furniture very old I woke up everytime I turned around in bed  But the rooms are clean  This needs to be saidNever again in this hotel  
N =>  Nice Hotel Good Located The hotel has indeed small rooms  when comparing with US hotels as some other reviewers did  but sufficient space for us because we were there only to sleep  Hotel was clean but a bit old  Price was OK  Breakfast was OK  Very silent located  We stayed there three nights and were happy with the nearby subway  Queensway and Bayswater   
N => Overall hotel ok Overall hotel was ok  Rooms small and in Heatwave in London from e    to   th with no air con or fans in room it was just too hot  Even with window open  Beds were not in good condition although clean linen etc  Just that pieces of fabric pulling off sides of bed supports  Mattress s needed replacing  All this sounds negative  however the location and general stuff were fine  
N => OH Dear   Truly the smallest hotel rooms you will ever have the misfortune to stay in The shower in the toilet would not have been out of place in a dolls house neither would the entire room come to that Rest of Hotel like a rabbit warren goodness knows what would happen if they had to evacuate the place in a hurry On the plus side it only cost     unfortunately you can see why Avoid at all costs unless you are one of the Borrowers  
N =>   eiving website photos Stayed in a single room for   nights in        paid GBP   per night inclu tax and continental breakfast  Good value for a central location  Baysway tube station is only   minute walk away  surrounded by good restaurants and shops Lobby  dinning area  bar are ok but tired decor  lift only fits   people  average service from staffs  helpful conceige  super small sized room  similar to a student s room in residence hall in the UK  single bed fits to the wall like a coffin  have little room to open a standard sized luggage  very small shower room with toilet  have to walk around toilet to get to shower  smallest shower even used  whole toilet became wet after shower tv received   channels with remote control that is working  trouser press worked but not very effective clean carpet  bed linen  towels that are changed everyday  smoking room but smell fresh  comfortable bed  quiet  ordered dinners in room  fish and chips for GBP      steak GBP     plus GBP    for room service  very good quality freshly made food  good presentation and still hot  again good value for money too  but room service only available after      tea and coffee making facilities provided in room  little milk sachets tasted horrible  Bar downstairs made horrible tasted cappuchinno  so ran across the road to Tesco to get tea and fresh milk the room was not warm enough for cold days  staff bleeded the radiator and turned on full power  yet for such a small room  it was still not warm enough  i am still in   s and came from nearby city  not Hawaii will NOT stay there again  
N =>  like staying in a telephone kiosk we stayed at this hotel for a weekend The room was pre paid so we could not check out when we saw our room which was no bigger than a telephone kiosk When i saw the bathroom i was afraid that if i entered i might not be able to turnaround to come back out The toilet on the plane was not much smaller The carpets were worn and the general decor needed a complete change It was my first time in london and my last The beds were dreadfull and this item is vital for any hotel good or bad The hotel was full so there are alot of suckers out there including us The location was great and very near bayswater tube station If you can give this hotel telephone kiosk a skip I wish i did  
N =>  Oh my God  Was this a joke I thought as I was ushered into my room  It was the smallest hotel room I had ever seen  I felt I was in a broom closet  be I could have dealt with the size  but I was in the basement and my window looked out onto a stone wall with piles of gabbage stacked against it  Was this a nightmare or what  It was dreary and so so hot  I came with my sister in law and niece who shrieked with laughter when she saw it  but wasn t so amused when their room was the same size but had two beds in it  I won t even describe the bathroom  but suffice to say  DON T STAY THERE  I asked for another room the next morning  and after some haggling was able to secure another miniscule room  but at least it had a window that opened to the street and I felt I could breathe  It was a maze of corridors and steps and you needed a compass to find your room upstairs  downstairs  left  right     Never again  
N =>  Run away as fast as you can   Without a doubt  the worst hotel room I have ever stayed in  Actually correction  I did not stay in the room  but immediately left once I located the room  through the narrow  maze like hallways  and felt the steamy air hit my face as I opened the door  Luckily  I was travelling alone so I could easily relocate and the room was not pre paid  so I only lost money for one night  I did ask the reception staff to change my room  but was repeatedly told there was not another room available for that price  Even when I offered to pay more for a different room type  there was still nothing available  I was only offered a different room after I asked to checkout  By this point  I was dripping sweat and had no desire to stay in the stuffy room without a window that opens  I agree the location is great and the price was good  but not even that was enough to make me stay in this lousy hotel  
N =>  Oh my God  Not a good first impression of London  The staff were not friendly  or helpful  the rooms were so tiny and always too hot  The breakfast was ok but the staff were rude in the dining room  People should not be allowed to smoke in the rooms  Some people skills are needed  The only good thing about this hotel was leaving it  
N => Never again Fortunately our experience at this hotel didn t ruin our English visit but it easily could have Firstly we were promised double beds before we left Australia yet the Concierge said there was no way any hotel in England would guarantee that   quot Besides quot   he said   quot there is not a double bed room available in the house quot   That was until I offered to pay the difference  Magically one appeared but not at the advertised  by them  difference of    pnds but for    pnds a night  I rang them from outside the next night to enquire about vacancies and they said they had several double rooms so I wandered in and asked  again  to be upgraded only to be told  again  there were no rooms available The lift is so small that it only took one person with a bag to fill it and so slow that I decided to carry my bag up   I beat my wife who had been in the lift for   minutes at least The room was tiny  there was not even a chair to sit on  This made it doubly difficult as the luggage was taking up the only available space in the room  on the bed  If you walked into the shower you backed out because there is no room inside it to turn  I ll try to attach a pix showing the toe of my shoe touching the door of the shower while the heel touches the tap on the opposite wall  If you flushed the toilet it took    minutes to refill so you waited paitiently listening to the cistern filling before heading in Forunately we brought our own soap   they didn t supply the traditonal  extras  Also fortunately we bought souvenier mugs on our first day in UK because we accidentally broke one of their cups on day one  knocked it over in the tight space  and when we left on day   they still hadn t replaced it  Presumably my wife and I were supposed to drink out of the one remaining cup On day two the management sent a letter to all guests requesting that we spread our breakfast times by getting up earlier as they were having trouble coping in the kitchen The walls are paper thin leaving next to no privacy and the phones were shakey at best If anyone paid me to have another holiday here I d say  quot no way  not even for free quot   
N => So good we walked out  When we walked into the elevator it should have given us cause for concern  they were so small  this was after a two hour wait for the room to be ready  We walked down the narrow corridors  one at a time  as you couldn t walk side by side  We opened the door and saw the small room with a brick wall view  as it was in the basement  My Fiance opened the bathroom door  just in time to see the bath regurgitating it s old bath water  We complained and went out  When we returned we enquired about the bath  to which the receptionist had not been informed of it s progress  When we got to the room  the bath still looked dirty  There was toilet paper supplied  but not put on the toliet paper dispenser  We rang room service for a bottle of Muscadet and two glasses and    minutes later they still hadn t delivered it  While we were waiting we noticed the bed had hair on the sheets  and had obviously not been changed that day  despite this being our first day in the room  The room was also cold with no visible means of heating  We then asked to see the manager  who never came  At this point we had enough and found a better hotel around the corner  We then came back  finally saw the manager and attained a full refund  Avoid with your life  
N =>  Worst hotel I ever stayed in my life  It was a horrible experience  I just came back from London and I can t wait to write this review right away coz it was really bad  We booked the hotel for         and   th  Coz we went to Rome in between  First of all  the elevator  lift  can only accomondate two person  which means   person and   suitcase  On our first check out date    th   the lift was broken  I asked the staff to have someone help us to carry the luggages and they said they don t have anyone available so we have to carry all luggages ourselves from the  th floor  While we were walking through the hallways  the housekeepers left all the towels  cleanins supplies  etc  on the floor  Even though they saw us moving the luggages through that cozy hallway  they didn t even move those stuff out of our way  and end up we have to move them ourselves  The worst thing is those stairs were not straight down  we had to make like    turns in order to get to the ground floor  Second of all  we asked to store one of the suitcases in their storage room so we don t have to carry everything to Rome  But they said they can t store it for us even though we are coming back to the hotel on the   th  And so we decided to store them there for the day and look for another hotel  They re so cheap  and have to charge us    pence for each luggage just because we checked out already  So meanwhile my boyfriend was cashing out  I walked through the entire street and finally found a hotel that has availability and will allow us to store our luggage even though we didn t even pay deposit yet  Then my boyfriend wants to cancel our reservation and they said we have to do it online cause we booked it online  And they charge like   pence per minute to use their internet  Lastly  most of the staff there are not friendly at all  they won t even say hi to you even you have eye contact with them  I never stayed in hotel this horrible before  The only good thing was the room was pretty clean and that s about it  
N => a horrible experience We booked two rooms for two nights and when we checked in late on Friday night and went to our room we were extremely disappointed  The lift only held   people  how do you manage if you have children  the corridors were very narrow  the room was very small and hot and the bathroom was a joke  I grazed my knee on the hand basin when I sat on the toilet and when I got in the shower I could not bend over to wash myself  No fans or air conditioning in the bedrooms which were unbearable  Breakfast was continental and we would be charged    if we wanted a cooked breakfast  We found the staff not at all helpful or friendly  We moved rooms to the basement which was a little larger and cooler  Our friends who remained on the  th floor were woken at   a m  on the first night and   a m  on the second by loud music being played in the adjacent room  The staff only agreed to go up and listen to the noise after my friend went down to the lobby and threatened to spend the rest of the night sleeping there  Definately a hotel to be avoided at all costs  
N =>  Avoid   
N =>  Adequate  
N => Superb find nestled in excellent Location  
N =>   Absolutely disgusting  The negative reviews of this disgusting hotel are true  Everything was dirty  The blankets were used and unwashed  The room was disgusting  the bathroom was tiny and dirty  It was the worst place we ever stayed in  There was nothing good about this  hotel   Even though the location was fine  our stay was marred by the experience  The service was terrible    night there was too much  We did not sleep a wink and could hear the street noises through the single glazed windows  Avoid at all costs  
N =>   Terrible hotel   great location   over charged for the value top floor room   they said it was the only one available with private bath    th floor by American counting   steep stairs with shallow steps  had to step sideways going down  Not very safe  Glad there wasn t a fire and I wouldn t put it past a place like that to have a fire no toilet paper  we had to ask at the desk    floors down    clerk gave us an open roll that was sitting beside him  Obviously it was a normal thing for him  He said that  she forgot    meaning the maid  I assumed  our room looked fairly clean and adequate at first glance  tho very small but we wanted to be very near hyde park  so accepted that this might mean some compromises  I hadn t read this so didn t know about the bedbugs or hair  I did not get any bites or find any disgusting surprises  but didn t look for them  My friend s bed was so uncomfortable that she had unaccustomed back pain after the first night that increased each night  My bed was nothing special but ok  it did make a lot of noise every time i moved  so it didn t help my friend to sleep cause i move a lot It looked like the room had been cleaned at least superficially  But after we checked in  it was never cleaned  no drinking glass in bathroom  shower door falling apart  no place to hang coats except one broken wall hanger with one wire hanger   in a twin room that will obviously house   people  windows boarded shut at about   inches max opening  no AC  thankfully it was not very warm because the street was so noisy that we could not even leave this open  i asked for a fan but never got it  my friend wanted an extra blanket and was told it would be taken up  but when we got back to the room  it was not there and she had to go down those famous stairs for it  I shamed the middle aged Iraqi owner into carrying up the luggage   the young Chinese reception staff would not even consider carrying luggage  They were very smiley and superficially polite but little came of it  
N =>  Messed around sworn at don t stay here    For a start we arrived and were then sent to a sister  hotel  as they didn t have the booking  even though it had been confirmed twice    Sister hotel in noisy location  broken fan  dodgy tv and aerial connection  dodgy shower  disgusting fridge The second day we went back to original to sort out a key for some other friends coming for a room  also booked   We were left waiting at recption while the guy on reception chatted to his friend on the phone    minutes later we finally got to talk to him  He couldn t give us a key as the cleaner was at the sister hotel with the keys  but we could get it off him  When we asked if he could phone to confirm with the cleaner he said he had no credit in his phone and the  hotel  phone only takes incoming calls  When we asked where the cleaner would be  we got the following reply  in your F CKING room   So as a a customer asking reasonable questions we were sworn at  So back to sister hotel    on the way we phoned Hotels com as it was booked through them  They denied knowledge of the booking at first  So to the cleaner   we found him  but he said he couldn t give us the key as he only had one and had to return them to the Berkeley  Hang on we were told to com back here to get it from you    Thoroughly annoyed  we met our friends and headed back to the Berkeley  where they now said they could house our friends  not in the sister  hotel   Dizzy    Yes it really was this much hassle  Luckily we had a couple of hours to mess about with all this Now onto the Berkeley   the room didn t lock     the lamp starting smoking when switched on  the window didn t open to let shower steam out  the twin bed turned out to be a double  with a camp bed  with no covers  Overall  poor rooms  DISGRACEFUL staff On the plus side  close to Hyde Park and cheap  but i d rather spend the extra next time 
N =>   Not too bad   great value for money when you re just going to sleep and shower there anyway    You can t expect too much from a budget hotel  and if you have astma or is allergy prone   sorry  you just have to book something fancier   After having read all these gruesome reviews  I was a bit discouraged    I actually didn  t read them until very close to departure and didn t have other  quot options quot  within budget  Me and my sister left for London trembling  but that was uncalled for  Sure  some of the staff members aren t      attentive  but the  quot night guy quot    a real doll  We got to see our room before checking in  all was fine   we even had extra towels and soaps     fancy that    It s close to Oxford Street for shopping  Hyde Park for relaxation and ble Arch Underground station  on the red  central line  for when you want to move around London  I ll book this hotel again next time I go  
N =>  The worst service  rudest receptionist and dirtiest hotel over the world Checking in this hotel was more than a nightmare  First of all  the attitude the receptionist  a young guy around his twenties  wearing glasses and Asian face  to a bewildered guest was the worst for a hotel staff member to my knowledge  To call this place as a hotel is REALLY  REALLY an ABUSE of the word  I will never forget the horrible experience I had in this terrible place  
N =>  BED BUGS  We STILL have welts from bed bugs  I squashed several on the sheets one morning  leaving bloody bug bits behind  and we put the box from the antibacterial cream next to them so the maid would see and change the sheets  and she just put my PILLOW on top  The bathroom was moldy  there was no hot water the entire four days we were there  ONLY because we were having trouble finding another place to stay for so long at such short notice   there were other people s hairs and things on the walls of the bathroom    when we got there  the beds were on end  with the previous occupants  dirty laundry in the corner  We had to take a walk while they cleaned the room  Mom had to go to the hospital for an allergic reaction to the bed bugs  As we left to find another hotel  citing bed bugs to be the reason for leaving  we received a sarcastic  quot awww  quot  in parting  Whoever owns this hotel should be ashamed and outraged that this goes on  DO NOT stay here  Go with Hotel Ibis  or Premier Inn  or Best Western  all of which have comparable room prices  even near the heart of London  
N =>  terrible Had the misfortune of staying here on monday night absolute farce that people would have to pay money to stay in this poor excuse for a hotel  To say staff were incompetent is being kind  There was a definite language barrier with staff  although not all as I can see from previous comments which one can only assume they have left themselves  Rooms were not serviced adequately ie unmade beds  dirty glasses  bathroom   I can t even begin to convey the state of bathrooms  Staff did not believe this to be a major issue  I also  on leaving  experienced the staff dealing with a guest whose room would not lock as the lock was broken  they offered no remuneration for this absolute paramount of features of a hotel room  particularly in a city such as London  shockingly bad  If you are even looking for a basic get away  seek elsewhere for cheaper and you will definitely get something far better for your money 
N =>   don t stay here Had the misfortune of staying here on monday night absolute farce that people would have to pay money to stay in this poor excuse for a hotel  To say staff were incompetent is being kind  There was a definite language barrier with staff  although not all as I can see from previous comments which one can only assume they have left themselves  Rooms were not serviced adequately ie unmade beds  dirty glasses  bathroom   I can t even begin to convey the state of bathrooms  Staff did not believe this to be a major issue  I also  on leaving  experienced the staff dealing with a guest whose room would not lock as the lock was broken  they offered no remuneration for this absolute paramount of features of a hotel room  particularly in a city such as London  shockingly bad  If you are even looking for a basic get away  seek elsewhere for cheaper and you will definitely get something far better for your money 
N =>   Dont stay here  This hotel is truely awful Our booking paperwork clearly stated that we had breakfast included  when we asked about the time breakfast was served we were told that the hotel had not served breakfast for the past two years There was no milk available with the tea and coffee making facilities and when we requested some milk we were told that there was none available We were woken at     am both Saturday and Sunday morning by a very loud sqeeking noise coming from the bathroom  This noise prevented us from getting any further sleep omce it had started  We were informed that this noise was due to a fault with the boiler and someone was coming to fix it   however no one came to do this during our entire stay And to top it all off there was no hot water in the hotel from waking on Saturday morning until we left on Sunday morning  The hotel isn t overly clean either  The staff are not very helpful and the management were unsympathetic to our complaint  did not offer any apology and refused to offer any acceptable financial compensation for the terrible service we expereinced  A      goodwill gesture  hardly covered two distrubed nights sleep and no hot water  I recommend that no one books to stay in this hotel   
N =>  Berkeley Court verspricht nicht das was ich mir vorstellte     
N =>   Il peggior albergo di Londra  
N =>  Comfy stay My husband s brother came to visit  so we wanted to stay in London for a few days  I used a travel search engine and got a good deal  The studio was clean  we slept on a queen bed with a prestinely  white  down comforter  There was a small flat screen in our bedroom  a wardrobe and full size blow dryer  The kitchette had the basics  a pot  pan  and plenty of dishes and flatware  The refrigerator did not get very cold  so that wasunfortunate  The living room area was nice  there was a    quot  flat screen  a pull out sofa  and a table to sit and eat  The bathroom was nice as well with a full tub  but another downfall was the water didn t get very hot  Overall we had a nice stay  Had we known better we would have stayed nearer to central London since the tube ride was over    minutes getting here and there  
N =>   Hmmmm The staff who checked us in put us in a handicapped room    We are pretty sure we do not look handicapped     There is strings hanging from the ceiling eveywhere  We acidentally pull one of the string thinking that is is for the light  The alarm went on  Still the staff did not realize they put us in the wrong room and did not offer us to change the room  When we come back at night  we found out that the room is absolutely cold  the fridge in the room does not work  We call the duty manager  He apologized and offered us a change of room immediately  He told us that the first room that we had was for handicapped and the fridge was out of order for a long time already   Suddenly I thought why did that lady staff offer me this kind of room in the first place  He helped us moving the big lugguage  arranging the taxi to the airport in the morning  Thank you In the hotel website  it says  quot airport shuttle quot   If you travel with big bags  this hotel might not be convenient for you as it means you have to pull your big bags outside ie  few mins walk to the nearest big hotels  Hopabus does not come right in front of the place like other big airport hotels nearby  
N =>   Awful Substandard Apartment I booked this directly on the website and was sent photographs of the one bed apartment that they had reserved for me  I can only say that the photographs are a complete and utter misrepresentation of the standard of the accommodation at Berkely Park  The apartment was extremely poor  shabby and smelt horrendous which they had tried to mask with lots of cheap air freshener   The sofa was covered in stains  On complaining to the reception they were unable to offer me an alternative and I chose to check out immediately with a full refund  I queried the photos that were emailed to me and the receptionist said that this is what is advised by their head office  I would strongly recommend anyone thinking of booking into the Berkely Park to seriously reconsider  Had I seen some of the reviews on this site I would not have done so  Glad to say I managed to secure a booking in an alternative hotel which was at a far higher standard  Although having to move in the evening while on a business trip was very inconvenient  
N =>  Wouldn t recommend to anyone  Firstly this is the same hotel as Berkeley Park Apartments  located in Hayes Middlesex    so all the reviews on the other page hold the same for this page too Secondly I have to agree with the reviews on the other page  this is one of the worst nights that I have had in a hotel in my life  I was guaranteed an early check in by the Front Office Manager  only to find out when I got there  that I couldn t check in before the normal time    bearing in mind there is nothing to do in the area  I had to go back into central London Once I eventually got my room  I had to carry my luggage up three flights of stairs as there is no lift in these newly built blocks  and no porter to help with them  The room was adequate  but wasn t very clean and the majority of the appliances in the apartment did not function correctly I also noticed that they have changed their name to Berkeley Park Executive Suites    posher sounding name for more money  but not the service you would expect from  quot Executive Suites quot  My advice would be to read the reviews on this page and the other  and book yourself in to another hotel   at least you ll pay for what you get  
N =>  Too noisy  The hotel lobby was very pretty  but the rooms were just ok  It was very pricey for what we actually got  The biggest disappointment however  was the noise level  The outside noise kept us awake even with the windows closed  I ended up having to wear earplugs to get some sleep  Won t stay there again  
N => Very enjoyable stay My daughter  granddaughter and I have just returned from a very enjoyable weekend in London staying at this hotel  To say I was a little uneasy after reading some of the reviews on this site  only found this after I had booked  was a bit of an understatement  I need not have worried   admittedly we upgraded to a superior room      per room night    but we were made welcome  the rooms were comfortable  bathrooms clean and full of all the normal additions one would expect  All the staff were friendly and the barman mixed a mean guerita   the breakfast and lunch were both very good  We will definitely stay again the next time we go to London   what a perfect location  
N => A Very Good Hotel in the West End Very good  knowledgable staff Slow service at the bar but this was to pay not order As previously stated small room but we are in the West End Excellent breakfast and very fast checkout I will certainly be visiting again especially as the location is just yards from Oxford Street I would highly recommend this hotel  
N =>  There Are Better Values than Berners  Very overpriced for the level of service received and the room condition   I stayed   nights recently and was extremely disappointed  Breakfast was included with my hotel package  but twice it was not delivered to my room according to the room service request I filled out  So on the third day  I went to the beautiful dining area for breakfast   only to be waited on by extremely rude wait staff  Also  for some reason I didn t have a clock in my room   so I asked for a wake up call each morning  Three times I did not receive it   and this was after they fixed the telephone which I discovered was out of order due to bad wiring  This  coupled with the bathroom sink that backed up on me  which the hotel was kind enough to fix   wallpaper peeling off the walls and a cracked glasstop on the writing desk in my extremely tiny single room  led me to voice my concern to the hotel manager  He kindly wrote me a letter apologizing for all of the mishaps and poor room condition   which contained   typos  I guess inept service and lack of atttention to detail stems from the top     
N =>  Never again      It was our misfortune to be booked in here during three of the hottest days London has recently had  and after staying at a much better London Hotel a few days before   It looked good from the outside  but that impression lasted as long as it took us to walk to the reception desk  The receptionist immediately tried to sell us an upgrade to a room with air conditioning and a fridge  Obviously then  our room would have neither  Not a good start  The lifts were small and slow  Thank goodness for the corridor signing  otherwise we would never have found our room  What a maze  The room was small and dark  There was little direct daylight because we looked out onto another wall of hotel windows about thirty feet away  There was no central overhead light in the room  so it was only lit by a table lamp and two bedside uplighters  Not sufficient  We had to squeeze between the bed and a wall in order to get into the bathroom  This was a disappointment too  Thin  rough towels  An over bath shower with curtain  not what you expect today  Tiny  thin bath robes  Loose toilet seat  No extraction of air from the bathroom  so that it was like a sauna after you had used the shower  Returning to the room  the kettle and complimentary tea  amp  coffee were hidden in the wardrobe  There was no plug socket in there  so we had to stand the kettle on the floor in order to use it  There was no fridge or air con  as previously stated  Neither was there a room safe  nor an iron  There might have been a radio  but the switches didn t seem to work  Neither did the trouser press  despite reporting it  The TV set had a mind of its own  even to the extent of turning itself on at half past two in the morning and blasting football at us  Quite a shock when you are fast asleep  The bed had seen better days  and had a pronounced sag in the middle  It was also a surprise to find sheets and blankets in use  rather than a duvet  A request for an iron brought one  but it was quite basic  and the ironing board had seen better days  Breakfast was the highpoint  A pleasant  ornate  dining room  and sufficient choice of food for me  though not enough variety of fruit for my partner  Staff were not very welcoming though  and their uniforms were often stained and grubby  A huge disappointment after staying at the City Inn Westinster  I wouldn t stay at the Berners again if they gave the rooms away for free   
N =>  Excellent restaurant and a great wedding location We stayed in this hotel for the last day of y and first   days of ust  I found the staff polite and efficient  and the restaurant staff were particularly charming  The service is what I would describe as European British  in that they don t beam at you like they re your new best friend  but we didn t mind  the American type strikes us as fake  Guests used to Californian beaming may need to factor that in  It s a cultural difference The food was beautiful  I would particularly recommend the telapia  a fish I d never had before  It was advertised as spicy  but came covered in a creamy sauce  which wasn t listed on the menu  They were very quick to produce another one for me  as I am allergic to dairy products  When I pointed out that it would be a good idea to list the presence of a creamy sauce  the waiter completely agreed with me Our room was European sized  that is  perfectly adequate to stay in  not supersized to walk around in  A room is for sleeping in  not hanging out in Yes  toiletries are basic  but as long as you bring conditioner  you can use it as hair conditioner and body lotion  and even shaving lotion   Top tip   The manager was firm but fair about moving us to the residents  bar at   am  and he did the same the second night for a different wedding party  We were in room     and couldn t hear anything after   am  I would suggest asking for a quiet room if you are a light sleeper It seems to be popular with wedding parties  so if an early night is important to you  it s perhaps advisable to check in advance if there is a wedding on that week The beds are not very wide  but we had a duvet  not blankets  and they were comfortable  I imagine the rooms might be uncomfortable in a heatwave  but they were fine at    degrees celsius The gardens are absolutely beautiful and it was a lovely location for a wedding  We milled around outside before going in to dinner  which was very relaxing I did find the air conditioning in the restaurant excessively cold  but Americans might like it  as I think they are more used to it  The one tiny quibble I had was that when I found a hair in my glass of water  the waitress who took it away merely said  oh   rather than  I m sorry  I ll replace it right away   She did replace it  she just didn t seem to think it was a big deal   In fairness  she was very young  The     bus route opposite Bromley south rail station has a stop at the end of the hotel drive and it s even announced  If you had lots of bags you might find the drive steep  but you couldn t miss it I had a lovely weekend there  and would recommend it  particularly for the food  
N =>   A Nice Hotel in Kent A nice  simple hotel with clean  if not a little small  rooms which provide everything the ordinary traveller needs  The staff were courteous  and the included full English breakfast was excellent  especially when followed by a gentle stroll through the gardens afterwards   Located close to the centre of Bromley  about a   pound taxi fare   it is in a quiet and secluded  You might not rave about it  but I doubt if you will find anything significant to complain about either  A nice hotel in Kent  
N =>   small but nice stayed here as i was visiting family in the area the hotel room was small but had everything you needed at night the room was very hot even with a fan on  brekfast was lovely a large selection of foods would def recomment this hotel to other friends  
N =>   needs updating in areas The first room i was allocated smelt of smoke even though it was a non smoking room  the receptionist moved me without any fuss The next room was much better but the huge bed turned out to be   singles pushed together so had a very uncomfortable join in the middle The bathroom was lovely  amp  clean  amp  very spacious The hotel in general is just ok The stair and hall way carpets need a serious clean  amp  general modernising as this gives the hotel an air of shabbiness  I would stay again for business trips but never for a personal trip The restaurant was again just ok  I have definatley stayed in better hotels  
N =>   OK but nothing special OK as a business base but wouldn t recommend it for a weekend away  Tucked away in a residential area it s a long walk to the centre  The public areas are ok but the room was small  Breakfast room was light and airy  Room service was prompt and the staff were all helpful and friendly  Happy to stay here if needs must but wouldn t rush back  can t really put my finger on it though  I d recommend staying in London Victoria and getting one of the regular trains through to Bromley    mins  as the station is centrally located  
N =>  No complaints at all  We stayed for   night on Saturday night  Check in and out was painless  staff were helpful showing us various parts of the hotel and ordering taxis  The bar in the hotel was busy  but not overly expensive  Room service was quick but as with most hotels quite costly but thats to be expected Our room was huge  A massive double bed  air con  ask for one of the aircon rooms  very hot  which done the job perfectly  huge window  lovely decor and a nice big bathroom which was spotless  Breakfast was nicely presented in the garden restaurant and you could eat on the terrace if you wished to  Good choice of English cooked breakfast  drinks  cereals and fruit and cakes We paid     including breakfast  
N =>   OK Small Room The room was really small  but we weren t over bothered as we were only there for one  saturday  night  or was ok  Bathroom was ok  shower was good  and all was clean  and room was air conditioned  We were a bit bothered by the very small bed  smallest double I ve ever been in    also had blankets which seemed very old fashioned  We used the gym  very small    running machines  no free weights  good jacuzzi though  Steam room never really got going We had a sandwich and chips in the bar  was quick service  ok sarnie The staff were pleasant enough the hotel is set in quite nice grounds with some views over London This hotel would be ok for one or two nights  but you wouldn t want to spend too long there     was a bit steep for what it was  but there is little choice in Bromley 
N =>   accomodated our family of five perfectly great place to stay very helpful staff clean felt very safe and welcome allowed our three children to share same room with us staff so helpful when booking  booked by phone excellent food great value 
N =>   A nice spot to stay After much research and dileberation  my husband and I finally chose to stay at the Burns Hotel for the start of our European stay  I have to say  we were not disappointed  We were greeted in a professional  friendly manner and our room  although we thought it was perhaps a little small  were told that it was actually one of their larger rooms  It  the room  was clean and comfortable  we did not find any major problems with it  The hotel is situated very close to an underground tube and we found it easy to navigate around the city  Although it was basic  an all you can eat continental breakfast was included in our package and we found that if we ate a large enough brekki  and risked looking like pigs in the process   we were fuelled enough to keep going through out the day  making it to dinner easily  It may sound extreme but it was a great money saver  and plus  brekki was so nice it was easy to eat so much  All in all  if you want a clean  easily accessable  value for money hotel with friendly staff then this is the place for you  Small note  There are quite a few stairs narrow corridoors in this hotel so if you or someone you re travelling with have bad knees perhaps ask for a more easy accessable room near a lift if possible   
N =>   Charming and in a great location This hotel wasn t that bad actually  I would stay here again on a trip to London  Most London hotels tend to be a nightmare compared to other hotels in Europe  The Burns is conveniently close to the Earl s Court Tube Station just up the street off Earl s Court Rd   to your right  across the street and down Barkston Gardens  We booked through a lesser known third party travel company so we had a basement level room  even so it was quiet and clean with a comfortable double bed and clean bathroom  The room was a bit small with the double bed being so close to the wall you would need to climb over the bed to get to the other side  There were some moments the room did get a bit warm but of course basement rooms can get a little stuffy  The windows could have done with a good washing as our room overlooked the back of the hotel ground patio which was not clean so there wasn t much of a pleasant scene  Just keep in mind that you will probably get a better room if you book through the hotel or a more popular third party travel company  Other than that  check in was fast and friendly  breakfast very good but can be expensive if you opt for the full English  Overall I am well pleased with my stay at the Best Western Burns and would stay again  
N =>  Good clean well located hotel     I had read the reviews before and the hotel pretty much fit right into the general consensus  The location was excellent  with a walk of about     yards to food  booze and the tube  Definitely a younger crowd due to most likely a less expensive area of London to reside  I went with a double as apposed to the single bed and got whats to be expected for a lower cost room in London  When traveling to Europe don t expect to get large rooms without paying large bucks  As one other reviewer said about another hotel in London  it s London rooms are small  get over it  This was a good hotel for the money believe me     
N =>   Enjoyable stay room small I had a very enjoyable   day vacation at the Burns  The room was kind of small  but it was just me  and I only used it to sleep  not hang out all day  Staff was friendly  room  amp  bathroom was clean   believe me  I m a neat freak   nice  quiet street  Very close to Earls Court Tube  Tip  there s a cool pub on the corner from the hotel  and a decent place to have a cheap breakfast  is a cafe across the street from the Tube Station  I don t really understand the bad reviews  All hotel rooms in London are small  LDR In Los Angeles  
N =>   Wouldn t stay again I guess I expected better from the reviews I read  but all I can say about this hotel is  quot eh quot  The lobby is lovely  And the staff is very good  bit rare for a lot of budget London hotels    So I was hopeful it would live up to descriptions online Then I got to the lift  Let s just say that everytime I got in  I wondered if I d end up trapped in there forever without recourse  It s small  there s no status display in there  and no emergency phone  I was on the  th  top  floor  so I had to use it  It s also painted black from the outside  so I felt some foreshadowing each time I walked up to it The floors in the halls were the typical bumpy  quot few buildings joined to make one quot  thing  A bit annoying with luggage to have to go up and down stairs in the middle of a hall for no apparent reason  The room I had was small  but not too bad  But the bed was rock hard and the walls were thin  I could hear lots from other rooms  though luckily I had a corner room so I mainly heard the people next to and across from me at times  This was mainly a problem on the weekend when people were in town for football or other events and were being a bit more festive than usual or coming home later than normal There was lots and lots of counter space in the bathroom  a plus    but the toilet handle had to be held down and then lifted up to flush  not due to design  just due to being halfway to broken   I m sure it was just my room with that problem  and luckily it kept working till my leave  I d of not wanted to lose that counter space  The hotel is kept very clean by their maid staff  and the location is right near the tube and a bunch of handy places on Earl s Court Road  But it was just a disappointment overall  It s just run down and a bit dim  really  Plus  some of the hotel sites I d researched said the hotel rooms offered AC  but there was none  So for air the window had to be kept open and then propped open by whatever I could find  During the few rainy nights while there  the window was knocked back and forth from the wind and was a bit loud  though I got used to it Friends booked a nearby hotel for much cheaper than mine was  and they had a room that looked exactly as I thought mine would if mine had lived up to expectations  I might stay at their hotel next time if I can get a deal on it  EC is a great location to base yourself in  I d just not bother with the Best Western again  
N =>   No problems Stayed at hotel with friend for just one night  No problems or complaints  Location is excellent    minutes walk from Earls Court Tube Station which has direct links to Heathrow  amp  West End  Staff very welcoming  amp  helpful The breakfast was buffet style  amp  very nice with plenty of choice  Again the staff on duty were both pleasant  amp  helpful Not sure how suitable the hotel would be for anybody with a disability though  It is an old building  amp  it seemed to be necessary to go up or down a step or two to get anywhere  Other reviews have mentioned small rooms but our s was fine  I suspect we were lucky here as it was a triple room  amp  there was just two of us  Most importantly  the room was both clean  amp  comfortable There is no air conditioning in this hotel  I presume because of the age of the building but this would only be a problem if the weather were particularly hot  This was not a huge problem when we were there  amp  opening the window resolved things  I have stayed in a number of other hotels in the area  amp  none of them had air conditioning either I would certainly stay here again  amp  be willing to recommend to others  though I would prepare them about the above first  
N =>   Great Area The Hotel was very clean  but very small We were a party of three  one couple and one lady  So we were surprised that more thought had not been given to the room allocation  The double room was on a different floor to the single room  We asked to be closer together and were given rooms on the same floor but one at the opposite end of the corridor to the other The double room was so small I had difficulity in getting my case around the door  there was only a tiny window which did open fully and no air conditioing We asked for a larger room and were told they were all the same size but slighty different shapes  the duty manager helpfully showed us two other rooms  we settled on the second option which ended up next door to our friend s single room A group of American students took over the small lounge and foyer for the duration  We were tripping up over laptop cables and the management did nothing about it The second day we could not use the garden as the dining room furniture was outside as they varnished the dining room floor that day  so we had to go to the front door to smoke  this meant weaving our way through the students each time as they were spawled out on the floor in the foyer at this stage It was in a terrific area  but it is a pity that all the patrons were not taken into consideration  
N =>   be Ok In Winter But Without Aircon In Summer Its Not A Nice Experience Stayed here on a business trip to Earls court  Value wise ok  room clean and tidy and ok  Single room  could almost touch both walls  Had a superior single  can only think the bath made it superior     Would not recommend or return     In london it is hard to find quality at a low price but somewhere else will be better than this  Breakfast ok    
N =>   Hated It My mom and I stayed at Best Western Burns Hotel Kensington     thru            I was skeptical about the hotel given the previous reviews here  but we had our travel agent book reservations anyway  We stayed in room      First the good  the room was a nice size for a European hotel  It wasn t too much smaller than an American hotel room  The breakfast  which was included  was quite tastey  and the hotel staff were very friendly and accomodating  Now the bad  Upon CLOSE inspecition  the room was filthy  There were visible stains on the walls and the carpet  The carpet looked like it had NEVER seen a vacuum  The area around the toilet was very scarey with visible mildew and  quot crud quot  and there was constantly a sewege smell coming from the bathroom  For the first night  I was actually afraid to close my eyes to sleep  It is also important to note that the rooms are not air conditioned  It was not a big deal for us since it was cool in London  but that could be a tremendous problem in the summer  Opening the window seems logical  but there is not a screen on the window so insects can come in  Overall  I would not stay in this hotel again unless they give it a complete renovation  
N =>   Convenient location but not the greatest experience As others have said  the location is really good and convenient for Earl s Court and the tube  which was the main reason for picking this hotel The room itself was fine and larger than some of the reviews here had led us to expect  although the decor was very tired and showed signs of DIY maintenance  The TV was very small and it s a bit misleading of the hotel to say that rooms have satellite TV   it ought to be made clear that there are only   satellite channels  Sky News and Nick   The room itself was the hottest room we ve ever stayed in  Even with the radiators turned off  and the window open  the room didn t cool down enough to be able to sleep properly  We tried leaving the window open at night but this meant that we were kept awake by the noise of nearby trains frequently rattling past  Closing the window helped a little  but the trains were still audible and having the window closed meant the room was unbearably hot throughout the night  Almost all of the floorboards creaked incredibly loudly so it was impossible to move around the room quietly The hotel advertises free wi fi in all rooms but we were unable to connect with our laptop   the network name given in the room information didn t appear in the list of available networks on the laptop  The room information said to obtain an information sheet on wi fi from reception but  when we asked about this and how to connect  we were told that it might be too weak a signal from the room and we should try from reception or the bar  this despite there being a wireless access point right outside our door   We tried connecting from reception and still couldn t connect  Asking staff again  we did then get an information sheet containing the password and lists of the available networks   it s a pity this wasn t just included in the room information or given to us at the fist time of asking Breakfast was included in our room rate and was very good  although it felt very rushed  We were shown to a table and the waiter pointed out the continental breakfast buffet bar and took our order for cooked breakfast  tea and toast  whisking away the menu before we d even had chance to look at it  Barely had we started our juice and cereal before the cooked breakfast was served to us  followed a few seconds later by toast and tea When we came to check out  the hotel had added onto the bill       for the use of the room safe  which we hadn t used at all  I pointed this out and they did immediately deduct it from the bill but it felt as if they were trying it on All in all  the hotel was OK but the overall experience was quite disappointing  It was noisier than we had expected and the extreme heat of the room meant that it was just too hot to sleep  which meant that we started the next day feeling exhausted  We wouldn t be very keen to stay here again and would try to find somewhere cooler  
N =>  lovely locationloved it iv e just got back from a three night stay at this lovely hotel over looking the lovely barkston gardens yes the room may have been a bit small compared to american rooms but i ve stayed in worse in paris the reception staff were lovely  the room was lovely and clean the continental breakfast was good plus earls court tube was three minute walk away and if you wanted late night snacks sainsburys was open    hours just round the corner on the cromwell road  so overall i would definitely stay here again if coming to london  
N =>  Great hotel This is a great hotel in a great location  It is only a two minute walk to Earls Court tube station which is on the picadilly line so you can catch the train straight here from heathrow We stayed here on a weekend in il  We arrived at about  am and although we weren t expecting to be able to check in  our room was ready which was great after flying all the way from Australia A few days after we checked out i realised i left my husband s expensive shirt in the wardrobe  I thought i might give them a call to see if maybe it was still there  Not only was it still there but they promptly posted it to us the next day in Australia  The staff here were very friendly and we would definately recommend it to travellers after a good bargain  
N =>   Lovely Stay After having an awful stay in London center  we tried to book something in Kensington  To our surprise  on Easter weekend  no less  the Burns Hotel had a vacancy  We ere so pleasantly surprised  The room was a little small  but very clean  The staff was extremely helpful  
N =>  You Don t Get What You Pay For My husband and I stayed at the Burns Hotel for   nights in ruary       We picked it based on a Rough Guide Directions recommendation and reviews on this site  Of the three hotels we stayed in on our    day trip  the other two in Paris and Venice  this was the most expensive and not a value for the money PROS  Location  Just around the corner from Earls Court tube station you can get anywhere easily from here   The bed was reasonably comfortable  The room was very large with a large wardrobe and desk  Although it looked out directly onto the street we were able to close the heavy drapes and have privacy   The shower head was the best of the trip  Lots of water pressure   The breakfast was included for us  I don t think it is for everyone   It was pretty good  The staff was a little rude  And the whole thing is kind of confusing becuase some people have some parts of breakfast included  others have other parts  But the selection was nice and we were satisfied   The in room coffee and tea selection was nice  Although I have seen better it was just fine and a nice touch CONS  Although not the hotels fault  the worst part of the stay was the  quot rain quot  in the bathroom on our first morning  We got back from breakfast and heard dripping  I went to the bathroom door and rusty dirty water was pouring out of the light fixtures  I went to the front desk and they told me that they knew there was a problem on the third floor but hadn t realized it came all the way through   from the look of the ceiling and light fixtures this is not the first time for this issued   They offered to send in the cleaning service and or to move us to a smaller room  The staff was unapologetic and didn t seem to care what we thought  Even so  we decided to stay where we were since we were checking out very early the next day  The cleaners did come but did not do a very good job  rusty water was still on the floor and toilet seat  and we had used our towels to sop up some of the water and the maids just hung the dirty rusty towels back up to dry   I had to ask for replacements   The bathroom was very tiny  especially for the size of the room   We weren t in London to watch TV  but it was a rather pathetic little set that only got   channels and no international news channel  
N =>   Nice Convenient hotel Spent two days here      th ember      with my husband and son to celebrate his birthday  It is a very convenient hotel in a pleasant location  close to Earls Court tube station  but not too far to walk to the museums either  Staff were pleasant  English breakfast was good  Had problems on check in and check out with the foreign speaking reception staff who did not understand how to use Best Western Member cards and points  Eventually when we got someone who spoke English they sorted it all out  It took about       mins to check out  and about    mins to check in  Nevertheless the staff were very nice  The rooms are small  we got an upgraded room with balcony and decent sized bathroom overlooking the front of the hotel  It was clean overall  but the carpet needed replacing or be given a good cleaning as it had lots of stains on it  We would stay here again  We got a good deal through the best western site but an even better one for the extra night we stayed through hotel com 
N =>  Good value for central London Looking for a last minute hotel for a single night in London  this was a perfect fit  Near a tube station  near central London The room was smallish  but not as small as others I ve paid more for  The bathroom was clean  Overall  I d stay here again if I was looking for a single night bolt hole at a budget  
N =>   Really awful hotel I m not in the habit of writing poor reviews but this hotel was utterly dismal in my opinion  While a couple of the Front Desk members were helpful  one in particular was rude  unfriendly and totally unsuited to her vocation  smart suit or not  The room was clean but ridiculously small  The bathroom had bad plumbing and you could use the loo and rest your feet on the sink  it was so tiny   Of course  we didn t     The floor boards creaked dreadfully every time we walked across them  No faceclothes and very few towels  The trouser press didn t work either  The sides of the bed were threadbare and ratty with loose threads trailing down  Don t spend any  quot romantic quot  time here as the people in the rooms across the hall will hear everything and more  as we did  The location is good but when we went to the Front Desk to cash a traveller s cheque  we were told that  quot We don t do that     quot  Er  pardon  The breakfast buffet staff were very accommodating but the restaurant is set up to handle a few tables  We ordered toast  which arrived about ten minutes after we d finished  Everyone seemed confused  The food was mediocre with  quot just tipped out of the can quot  baked beans  Ugh  Three times I pointed out filthy plates to the staff  with dried on food all over them I realize this is a tourist class hotel but I ve stayed in far better for the same price or a little more  We spent five days here and were very disappointed  
N =>  Not good  I was booked at this hotel because of a Fair at Earls Court upon arrival I was given a single room  The single room felt like an old prison and it was klaustrophobic too I went down to the reception immediately to have another room and they showed me a double room and asked if I wanted to change  even though  I almost had to check out but due to circumstances I decided to stay  Colleagues did send me material that I was supposed to bring to the fair  however the staff of the Hotel sent the UPS guy back with the two packages I needed so bad The price is around a hundred pounds and I strongly suggest that you chose another alternative if you don t have to be into this particular area Peter Gustafsson 
N =>   Unfriendly Front Desk I stayed at Burns Western with my colleague from      to      on a business trip  We arrived to be greated by unfriendly front desk who gave us rooms the size of a coffin  Not only that there were left over luggages from previous guests  basically these were rooms that were still occupied  I immediately worry about the safety of the hotel  others can gain entry into an occupied room so easily  They changed us into slightly bigger single rooms with a small closet  thank god  The free breakfast were cold  which is a huge turn off during the freezing days we were there  When we checked out we were hit by a huge telephone bill billing each call dialed even if it did not get through  I argued that with the front desk and they took half of the amount off  Still  really dissapointment given the good reviews I ve received  Last time I was in London I stayed at Abba Queens Gate Hotel and that was a much better treat  To be fair  the Burns Western was very close to the tube station and clean  
N =>  Nice Hotel The Burns Hotel is a very reasonably priced hotel to stay at  We found it to be very clean  quiet  amp  comfortable  The rooms seem to be different sizes   small  amp  smaller    which is what you can expect in London unless you want to spend upwards of         usd per night  We paid         cad per night which included an english breakfast   through TRAVELOCITY at the beginning of our trip  On our return we paid         cad per night booked through OTEL and included a nice continental breakfast   We took the tube from Heathrow to Earls Court  amp  quickly found the hotel         blocks from the tube  thanks to directions from another trip advisor member  The location was good for walking to various museums and restaurants etc  
N =>  rooms very small we have just stayed   nights at this hotel the room was so small like liveing in a box   carpet on the stairs was held together with tape  the room we had       was next to the lift so every time anyone used it you could hear the doors opening and closeing   i must say for the price we payed for our stay i would say we feel let down and would not use it again   also left a coat in the room so rang hotel to ask if they had found it was told they would ring me back that day did not get a call so next day rang again told the same thing again in the end i rang then   days in all and last time i rang asked for a manager when im pleased to say it was sorted 
N =>  Small Rooms  We    adults  spent   nights in the Best Western Burns Hotel in Kensington  Check in was smooth and friendly  and room was ready on our arrival  even though we were about half an hour earlier than our advised check in timeThe room itself was small enough to not allow us to store our suitcases properly  We were flying off to Portugal for a week after London so had   decent sized suitcases and ended up standing them next to the bed when we were in the room  This then blocked our way to the door  Not ideal in the event of an emergency  but we never needed to leave the room for one so I guess it was ok with hindsight  Bathroom was clean  tidy and well presentedBreakfast   I had prebooked full english s  which were ok  Nothing too special  but not that bad either  Dining room was well lit and airy and staff were friendlyOverall  the hotel was conveniently located a couple of minutes walk away form Earl s Court Tube Statiion  although I expect you could get very wet dragging suitcases there in the rain  There was also a good selection of shops for anything you needed between the Tube and the Hotel  The room and hotel could have done with a bit of TLC  but it served our needs perfectly 
N =>  great location The location was great with less than a   minute walk to the station  restaurants  pubs  and convenience stores  This was our first time in London and didn t know what to expect We took the tube from heathrow to the hotel which was very easy  Purchasing the Oyster for zones     is all that is necessary  It costed    pounds for   days but you have pay additional to get from Heathrow to the center of the city  Taxi cost is about    pounds from Heathrow to the Hotel  The hotel was easy to find using the hotel directions from Earl s court station The rooms were small  I guess standard for london hotel rooms  The floor boards squeeked and was a bit funny  It would be impossible to sneak up on someone in the hotel  Our room also had squeeky floors which also was funny  The staff was friendly and helpful  Breakfast was included in our package which was above average and very convenient  Never tried the dinner menu  We also had breakfast delivered to our room which was delivered in    minutes but it costed   pounds more  
N =>   not bad at all I came to like this hotel  On paper  a cheap hotel in London has the potential to be an ordeal However  after four nights there  I was surely pleased The hotel is located a couple of minutes walk from Earl s Court tube station   in my opinion  the best way to get around London  It is down a quiet road off Earl s Court Road  There is next to no traffic with consequent quietness Having arrived there  the receptionist pleasantly and quickly processed my reservation  Getting to the room involved using the ancient elevator to get to the top  fourth  floor The room was small  but perfectly formed  Bed linen and towels were perfectly clean and the bathroom was sparkling   clean floor  mirror  toilet and sink   quite impressive The bed was fine but the best feature was the quietness  Being a light sleeper  a pin dropping a block away would normally wake me up  But  I am pleased to say that I rested in peace every night The only negative is that the floorboards were a bit creaky  Obviously not a problem if you are not moving around  but I was not sure if I was disturbing other guests    Earl s Court itself is a nice area  There is no shortage of restaurants   Thai  Indian  Italian  Chinese  pub food  etc  Safe  too  
N =>  A Great Little Hotel  We stayed in this hotel on two occasions   one night on the  st ust and then we came back after a   day trip to Paris  and stayed for   more nights  We were pleased with what we paid for   on arrival in London at  am  after a    hour flight  they kindly checked us into a room immediately  even though the official check in time was  pm   this was free of charge to us  we didn t have to pay the previous nights  rate like some other hotels   Our room was very small  but it was clean and comfortable  The decor was relatively modern as well When we checked in a few days later  we were given a bigger room overlooking the street  with our own little balcony   all at the same price The staff were friendly and helpful  even allowing us to leave our luggage there for the   days that we were in Paris Breakfast was simple  but nice and the dining area was comfortable  The central location was also great   it was only a   minute brisk walk to Earl s Court Station  The neighbourhood was nice  we felt safe and secure Overall  we would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay again here if we were ever in London  
N =>  Loved Every Minute  The rooms were small  that is true  but contained everything you would need  They were immaculate and the amenities were close to unbelievable for a small space  I stayed ten days and really did love every minute  When we ate at the hotel  the food was delicious and beautifully presented  The staff was superlative  When I go back to London  I am going to stay here again  I won t even look for another hotel  I would also like to mention that I could walk everywhere I wanted to go  This hotel really had a lot to do with what was a wonderful vacation  
N => Crappy  I wouldn t go back to this hotel if someone PAID me The staff was nice and all  but one night i saw a homeless person sleeping outside my window I went and complained but they said they couldn t do anything about it The food was horrible and the room was no bigger than a closet  
N =>  About what I expected Given the reviews that I had seen of this hotel  I have to say I got exactly what I paid for  I stayed for   nights in ober with a friend  Yes  the floor squeaked and the room was small  but that was to be expected  The hotel staff was amazingly friendly and accomodating  our request for a larger room was handled without fuss   The hotel was clean if a bit worn  the bathroom good sized w  plenty of hot water  From what I ve heard  you re not going to get a large room in London unless you pay a premium price  At about    pounds per night including full breakfast  I don t think you d find much better  And the location is great   just far enough removed from busy Earl s Court that you don t have a lot of traffic pub noise  but close enough to make getting around extremely convenient  
N =>  Cramped but OK We stayed at the hotel from    t to    t       with breakfast included  Our double bed room was small    barely enough room to go around the bed  The floors were very squeaky  and the small elevator can be a challenge for two people with luggage  The bed was not the most comfortable  as I could sometimes feel the bed springs  However  the bathroom was adequate  and our breakfast was very good    good way to start the day  Earls Court Tube Station was a convenient   min from the hotel  and Earls Court Road has groceries  banks  restaurants  etc Overall  it was an OK stay  I d look around before staying here again  but if it came to it  I wouldn t mind  
N => Good place to stay Using Tripadvisor  I was able to research several hotels in the London area  I decided to choose this hotel because of the good reviews  Getting to the hotel was very easy using the underground  The closest tube station is about   block away  Upon arrival  I was greeted by a very helpful staff  I had arrived about   hours early and my room was not ready yet but was given another room right away  The lift is very small but worked great  The room was very small and there is no air conditioner but I was prepared  There was no problem with hot or cold water during my entire stay  The only problem that I had was that the floor creaks very loudly  My room rate included breakfast every morning  The food was prepared very well and the dining area was nice  I would definately stay here again  
N =>  A lucky find at the last minute  
N => Look no further     
N =>  went out of his way to get us information when we wanted something    
N =>   Recepci n servicio excelente comedor no tanto  
N =>   Sehr ordentliches Budget Hotel in London  
N =>  Bon rapport qualit  rpix pas de mauvaise surprise   
N =>  empfehlenswertes Hotel in guter Lage  
N =>   Rooms in terrible state Thankfully I only stayed at the Best Western Chiswick Palace  amp  Suites  My room had so many problems it was amazing     Hot water took up to    minutes to come through   Shower only heated up to luke warm   surfaces in bathroom covered in grime   Large gap under door creating draft   Windows didn t shut properlyReception staff were friendly but uninterested in helping remedy my maintenance issues  
N =>   I will not be staying again in this hotel The bed is too small  I m     m height   Hot water in the shower are coming after appx     min  You have to stand in the bed in order to watch TV  The worse  I had to change my reservation from   to   nights  The manager charged me fully stating that is the policy of hotel  I think sometime a business can meet the customer and bypass the policy  especially in emergency case  But not here  in addition they charge in advance since they afraid that you will disappear without paying  I guess that these are the kind of guests that they deal with in this hotel  Therefore  my place is not there and I will not be staying again in this hotel  
N =>  Adequate Funny little hotel  we were away from main building in a dated room where there was some traffic noise  Breakfast was fine  and staff were good  
N =>   good base We decided to take a trip up to London  so we looked on the web for a hotel outside the congestion zone and found the Best Western Chiswick Palace  amp  Suites  The was so easy to find   with the sat nav  about   minutes off the end of the M  The reception area looked very nice  There were two gentlemen on the desk  who were very friendly  We paid for our stay up front and one of them should us to our room  which was not in the main building  but through the gardens to one of their flats  It was a nice room  overlooking the main road with the traffic lights  We live in a quiet area  so we thought it would be quite noisy with all the traffic  but it wasn t The hotel is on Chiswick High Road with lots of shops and restaurants  We were very impressed  There was so much choice of where to eat  eventually we decided on Frankie Bar and Grill  an italian restaurant just around the corner  It was very pricey  but nice We had a lovely nights sleep in our big bed  it was   singles zipped together  but that was ok  Breakfast in the morning was a buffet breakfast  If you wanted a cooked full english it was extra We wanted to spend the day in London  so when we checked out  we asked if we could leave the car there and take a tube into the City  The receptionist said it wasn t a problem  He gave us a map and told us some places to see in London  Its just   minute walk to Stamford Brook  We would definately stay there again 
N =>  Worst Hotel I Ever Stayed In Room I was given not only did not match the description I had booked against  but was the worst hotel room I have ever seen   small and squalid  Advert said newly renovated  free broadband  kitchenette  no smoking   room stunk of smoke  felt dirty  had definitely not been renovated or even decorated for at least    years  no kitchenette  internet access did not work  I tried to log on to download the advert as evidence   When I complained I was told I was wrong and all standard rooms were like that  Had to get my booking company to fax a copy of the advert to the hotel before they would move me to an adequate room  I will not call it more than that   which was down a dangerous set of stairs and was another very small smoking room with no internet access  and it was very noisy  I would rather commute the   hours each way and stay at home than stay another night in that hotel  
N =>  Left a Day Earlier  Terrible  The staff was horrible    no one paid attention to anything   the rooms were dirty  the tv didn t work and even though I called the reception   times no one ever came  the keys to my door never worked  and I was put in the basement until I requested my room to be changed that wasn t much better  I saw bugs in the bathroom and on my bed Even though I paid in advance I left a day early and went to another hotel Terrible   
N =>  Won t stay here First of all we did not stay here but we were thinking of it  My wife and I are planning a trip to the UK to celebrate our   th anniversary next spring  As we can get Best Western Travel Cards through our Air Miles program we were looking for a BW hotel in London  After reading a fair amount of negative reviews on Trip Advisor we had some concerns about the Paddington  I therefore sent an e mail to them asking four simple questions  rates  decent room etc  I did not receive an answer and sent it   more times Still no answer  I then sent an e mail to central BW booking asking for help  A lady there   Laura  phoned the Paddington asking them to reply to me  They then sent an e mail to HER quoting her a price for twin room for    pounds a night  They the offered HER an anniversary special  f     pounds a night and they would place flowers in the room and chocolates and serve breakfast On the bed  Such a deal  As they had not answered all my questions Laura again phoned them and then forwarded their answers to me  Obviously this Hotel either has too much business or needs a good public relations person  Needless to say we will not be staying at the Best Western Paddington Ron Fagg Sorrento BC Canada 
N =>   Not high standard Location good but there were a few niggles  Broken tap and cracked basin  Temperature control on shower broken resulting in near scalding  Tiny shower room  Air conditioning in room which doesn t work  Hair drier worked for about    seconds before over heating  Advertised as being refurbished with high standards of decor but that certainly didn t apply to corridors  Cables hanging out over most rooms Complaint got me a free breakfast  worth just over       
N =>  Terrible terrible terrible  Worst hotel experience ever  Tiny and stuffy rooms  Staff most unhelpful and with a very bad attitude  The only thing that worked about the elevators was the alarm  which sounded loud all night long  Smell of urine on the stairs to the room  Staff took    mn to figure out whether breakfast was included  They eventually told us it was  but the restaurant charged us anyway  Good location  Close to Paddigton    mn walk   but there are lots of hotel in the area  Avoid at all costs  We wished we had read the other negative reviews before booking  
N =>   An upgrade makes all the difference We booked our stay through opus travel for an excellent price but were contacted directly by the hotel a few days later to say there had been a mistake and that we would need to pay more to them  We agreed to pay an additional     in exchange for an upgrade to a suite and breakfast  which hadn t been included originally  We were anxious at these problems arising before we even arrived but in the end the rest of the trip worked out alright  The upgraded room  across the street from the main hotel and in a basement  was very comfortable and spacious and worth the initial inconvenience  It had a queen sized bed  and decent kitchen area  although the bathroom was somewhat cramped  There was an unpleasant smell in the corridor outside our room which thankfully stayed outside  The breakfast was a served cooked breakfast which suited us but only as we had it included in our upgrade   we wouldn t have been as impressed had we paid the full price for it  there s plenty of cheaper cafes nearby  The staff were very friendly and helpful   the concierge made travel enquiries for us and the rooms which were clean and fresh were serviced daily  The advantage of the suite was that we were able to enjoy the traditional London cuisine  fish and chips   in the comfort of our room after our late arrival The location was excellent in a nice area  with restaurants nearby but still quiet and relaxing  The only downside was a good ten minute walk to the nearest underground station and travel to central London could be slow  There were lovely parks to walk through if you had time to enjoy the area instead of hurrying on the tube Overall our room and the hotel service was fine on this occasion although we wonder if we would have been satisfied with the standard room we had originally booked  as our upgraded room was really what we would expect from a standard room anyway We don t have complaints about our stay this time but probably would look elsewhere next time anyway as we get the impression we were quite lucky on this occasion  
N =>   worst hotel ever   very disapointed we booked to stay here on the internet for   nights   saturday  th and sunday the   th of tember  When we arrived at reception on the saturday we were told by the girl that the hotel was full and that we had to stay somewhere else  They said they would pay for our taxi to this other place   like that made a difference  Now we were extremely ennoyed but went in the taxi anyway to what I can only call a   star B B up the other side of paddington station  This   star was extremely basic and the room was dark and old with just a porta cabin as a shower  amp  toilet  I won t slate the   star as it wasn t their fault but NO WAY should we of been sent here when we paid for the paddington court which is branded as a   star hotel  The same thing seemed to happen to an older couple who where checking in in front of us at the other hotel  We went back to the Paddington the next day and were told we d be in a superior room to make up for beign moved but were in a tiny room with barely any room to move  No way could you stay here more than one night  The air con wasn t working and neither was the stupid broadband  We weren t even offered complimentary breakfast for being moved to another  hotel   We were also given our keys for the sunday night and went up to the room about       only to find someone in it  They never even told us to wait ti     A disaster of a hotel and no way would I recommend it to anyone   
N =>   Wouldn t stay here again  Stayed here for one night in tember and couldn t wait to leave  We had a double room that was perhaps the smallest I have ever stayed in  The side of the bed was positioned against a wall which meant having to climb over your other half if you needed to visit the bathroom  Mind you  there was no other alternative as the room was so small  Note  not all the rooms are as small as the one we had  based on fire escape floor plan layout on wall   so it may be worth asking to be moved if you do intend to spend more than one night here Housekeeping came knocking on the door at     am despite a midday checkout and again at      am  so no chance of a lazy lie in if needed  The air conditioning unit did not appear to work and the wardrobe was entirely taken up by the ironing board Positives  It was clean  
N => Worst waste of money despite location We originally booked a   night stay at the London Elizabeth  which is wonderful and less expensive  but HotelsRUs lost our reservation the day before our departure from the US     ust     and we were left with the BW Paddington Court  Below are listed the worst issues that need attention    lifts did not work     of the time   carrying heavy luggage up multiple levels was not fun   rooms were very small     twins when we booked a double  bath tiny   in this small space there were   standing fans and when I requested their removal  it took   calls to reception and   days    there are a c units in walls   none are hooked up and there are exposed wires in the halls throughout the hotel  The hallways are so narrow that fire hazards are a major issue    our window looked onto the back of a residental area that was FILTHY   people throwing garbage from windows  One building was under construction and workers arrived  with boomboxes  etc   before  am on a Saturday  What a way to start your day    One morning i ordered coffee from room service  which never arrived and when I called to follow up was told that room service was closed for the morning  Another evening  we requested room service as advertised    hours day for light snacks  and was told that service was  temporarily  not available    the bar and dining room are in the basement and do not have any type of ventilation   the bar smells of cigarettes even when empty and the dining room smells of curry  even if it is not on the menu   They are not open for the posted hours     Daily  no face cloths   they gave us bath mats for the floors After  st night  used towels were taken away and no fresh towels provided until we complained  Cheap plastic glasses in the rooms and were not replaced when used  After requesting clean glasses daily  they finally brought    Clever  no    Hotel staff is very smiley but do not follow through   probably due to lack of understanding  No one spoke English fluently   making questions pointless  Had to go to the London Elizabeth to have travel tube etc  questions answered  This hotel is more like a youth hostel  which is fine if you are paying        night  One does not expect constant problems  especially in the UK  I will never use a website to book again and certainly intend to pursue this with Best Western  
N =>  Worst hotel We stayed one night at the Best Western in Paddinton in London and that was one night too many  They ask for payment on check in not check out and I now believe that is so you do not leave when you see the rooms  No airconditioning and our room was in the basement  The smell was horrendous  probably from the shower which looks like it floods all the time  You have to be a contortionist to use the tiny shower stall and if you drop the soap forget it  We were told they had upgraded us to a family room  I cannot imagine what a twin looked like  One powerpoint in our room was held together with electrical tape and paint was peeling off the walls  The rooms are small tiny small  The check in time took forever and the staff are generally unhelpful  Stay here at your peril  
N =>   Nightmare I had researched many hotels and consulted Tripadvisor before making my reservation  Obviously I was not expecting anything luxurious given the price paid  however I did expect a clean room and professional service from a Best Western Hotel I had requested a non basement room with A C after reading the previous reviews on Tripadvisor  On checkin I was given a a basement room  b    with no A C  the room was awful with cobwebbs above the bed  no natural light  tiny room  A C not working  I asked to change immediately  I viewed room     and     both tiny and equally as awfull  I was informed by a staff member only rooms on the  rd and  th floor have been refurbished and the A C does not work in all the hotel  I asked the room to be cleaned and left to enjoy our   day stay in london  On return that day the cobwebbs were still there  it seems when you try to communicate with reception staff they do not fully understand  On the second day the carpet seemed to be wet which appeared to come from the corridor and the room next door  and the room was not serviced  The building work started each morning outside at       however on the last morning it was next door  The room was totally gutted and drilling began whilst we were sleeping  this was the final straw On check out I asked if the manager could come with me to our room  he did not but sat us down in the lounge and listened to me rage  I was also informed by other guests staying in the suites over the road that the rooms were reformed but were tiny and not worth gbp       My advise to other guests is stay away  perhaps pay a little more and go elsewhere  We were shocked by the low standard and service and it totally ruined our first visit to London  
N =>   Filthy Hot Unsafe and Uncomfortable  This room was booked as a free two night deal through British Air  one of their  quot recommended quot  hotels  We weren t expecting luxury  but we did expect a clean  comfortable  and safe place to stay  The room we were given was horrific  It was very small  which would not have been an issue if it had not been so very filthy  The upholstery on the one small chair had large dark stains  there was visible dust and cobwebs on the wall just over the bed  there was a thick layer of black grime the inside of the window sash  and I was afraid to touch the TV remote  The carpet was torn  there was a huge rip in the drapery  and the nightstand and wardrobe were chipped up  The glass of the window was cracked  and just outside the window  which went all the way to the floor  was a terrace upon which we found a rusty razor blade and many  many cigarrette butts  The window also did not lock properly  which was very troubling as the room was only on the second floor and had the terrace outside  There was a chain hanging from the door frame but only four holes on the door where the rest once had been  When we first arrived there was no fan in the room  as was promised on the website  The front desk sent up one which had a plug so badly broken that the wiring was exposed  The second fan did not arrive until after midnight  I called BA Travel to complain  but they only offered to move us to another hotel if we paid for it  We did wind up going to another hotel  Travelodge Kings Cross Scot  clean  comfy  and cold AC    but not through British Air as I could no longer trust their  quot recommendations quot   I took lots of pictures of the room and sent them to BA customer service  but the only response was an offer of a  quot free upgrade quot  at the same hotel the next time I m in London  If I am ever so fortunate as to return to London  rest assured I will not give the Best Western Paddington Court another chance to muck up my vacation  
N =>  Clean nice convenient hotel I stayed at the Paddington Court hotel for a couple of nights last month and found it to be a nice hotel  in a good location  The staff were pleasant  smiling  the breakfast was very tasty  in fact not advisable to eat the full english every day  you get a really good selection As i was in London on business  the hotel was really good for me  close to Paddington  and great for coming from Heathrow  I am a big guy so the shower was thankfully large and it was like a walk in shower  something i havent seen too often in hotels  the showers are usually cramped but it was all good   I would suggest the hotel to employ more staff as sometimes you may wait   minutes to be seen at reception  apart from that  all in all a fine stay  I come to London a lot on business and intend to return to the Paddington Court RegardsNed 
N =>  Good situation but bad conditions    When I saw the hotel  i was surprised by the beautiful old style facade but when i was discovering the room  my hapiness stopped   they are very tall and dirty   The A C doesn t work   I needed to change twice to have a correct room    
N => Go Elsewhere My husband  my elderly mother  and myself stayed in this terrible hotel for two nights  It was a promotion by British Airways  they ll be hearing from me too   so one room was free for the two nights  but only one night was free for my mother  so we had pre paid      for her room for one more night  What a huge mistake  I would never stay here again for free or even if they paid me  In fact  after seeing our rooms at the Paddington Court  we called our usual hotel in London  willing to pay full price to get out of this place  but at that late date they were already full  So we ended up staying for   unhappy nights  It was like staying in a bad youth hostel  The first room my mother got was one of the tiny basement rooms  It was dirty  looked out onto an airshaft  smelled heavily of cigarettes  and had the tiny shower mentioned in previous reviews  It was reached through a narrow dark hallway with rubber pipes hoses  not sure what they were  dangling overhead out of the ceiling  We asked for a different room but were told they had none until the next day  so my husband ended up sleeping in that room to spare my mother  She and I shared the twin room  which really wasn t a lot better  It was a narrow room with two twin beds lined up foot to foot  The room also reeked of cigarettes  even though we had asked for non smoking rooms  The toilet leaked and we both got our socks and slippers soaked from toilet water  When I called reception  they sent someone up who said all he could do was stuff some extra towels on the floor around the toilet  The bed linens were of questionable cleanliness  and the walls were absolutely filthy  covered with smudges and stains  There was a bare light bulb hanging over the  quot desk quot  with no lampshade  The room really was quite hideous  The next day we were given two  quot better quot  rooms  They were marginally better  but still very dreary  with dirty walls and one of the towels was filthy with a large brown smudge on it  I brought the towel down to reception and was told that the towel would be replaced  It never was  And one of the  quot better quot  rooms was on the  th floor  really the  th floor  and the lift was broken  so we had to walk up and down many flights of stairs  At breakfast we were shown the  quot full English quot  breakfast but were told we could only eat from the  quot Continental quot  side   tacky  All in all it was a terrible experience  Don t be fooled by the decent lobby and the nice lounge area  They are no reflection of the rooms you will be given  And I have no idea where those nice rooms are that are shown in the photos on their website  Over our two nights we had four different rooms and none looked anything like the ones on the website  Run in the opposite direction  
N =>   Absolutely terrible experience Having chosen the Best Western for its proximity to the Heathrow Express  as I was arriving close to midnight with medical appointments the next morning  as well as the brand name  hoping this meant a basic level of   star comfort  I was astounded to be told on arrival that there were water problems in the room and I would have to be sent to another hotel nearby  As I had two nights booked  which the staff had apparently overlooked  the advice was that I would move to a hotel for one night and then have to move back the next day  When I refused on the basis I was busy all day they sent me to a different hotel   after a half hour wait  No apologies  no refunds  no nothing  The other hotel was the   star Comfort Inn on Hyde park  It was quiet enough I suppose  but absolutely   star with a tiny  tiny room  no internet access  no air conditioning  no toiletries in the bathroom and a freezing cold room   certainly not the level of accommodation I expected for the price paid to the Best Western  I was not the only guest being sent off to other hotels   there were at least three others in the time I was waiting   extraordinary for a suposedly reputable hotel  Based on this experience  I would never stay at the Best Western again and would recommend others avoid it  
N =>  Disgrace to the Best Western name Just returned from a dreadful night in this so called Hotel When I got to my room after a big delay  I discovered there was a problem with the lighting  It flickered on and off and the light in the bathroom did not work at all  Plus  the bed linen had not been changed after the previous guest at all   I tried to phone down to reception but got an engaged tone all the time so I had to walk down to them as the lift is broken  They sent the service manager up to investigate  First he told me I could keep fixing the trip switch on the landing and when I told him this was unacceptable  he decided to fix it properly there and then  This took about    minutes  I showed him the dirty bed linen  he phoned the hotel manager and told him this was not good enough and then assured me the bed would be changed soon  He also told me that if an inspecter walked in and saw the bed  this place would loose the use of the Best Western name I spoke to this hotel manager myself before I went out and he agreed to give me    off the price of the room on account of the bad service  He too assured me they would change the linen However  when I returned at ten o clock that night  the bed had not been touched  it took   calls to reception to get someone to come up and he only had one sheet  he went away for ages to get one more and then told me they had no pillowcases for me     All of them were locked up  I believe they tell lies to the guests all the time as nothing makes sense  After he went  I discovered the soap in the bathroom was almost worn away  I have stayed at Best Westerns in London before and was always impressed with the fresh soap each day in its own plastec bag Next morning  as I checked out  the hotel manager was  quot unavailable quot   I pressed for more money off the price and after much discussion  I was given     off the price for the bad service  I settled for this as they had my credit card and I could not get a better deal  But I am disgusted with such a place and I would never stay there again  They do not care at all about their guests  The area is lovely but there are far better hotels around and many have much better rates  
N =>  Would never go to this hotel This is by far the worst hotel that I have stayed  I knew that European Hotels were small and upon reading the terrible reviews before I vacationed in London  I braced myself for what was to come  I was not disappointmed  It lived up to its reputation  I checked in with a group of    and alot of luggage  The staff in the hotel did not seem prepared for such a big check in  One person in particular was rude and informed us that the hotel had booked us all in smoking rooms  we had requested non smoking   The staff proceeded to swipe our charge cards to charge us for the rooms which had already been prepaid through our travel agent  We insisted on non smoking rooms and were told to give the staff a few minutes to find the rooms for us  We were told that we were getting the larger rooms because of the original error in booking smoking rooms  My boyfriend and I were put in a basement room  How we found the room and were able to find our way out everyday is surprising  The hotel is a maze of small hallways with multiple doors closing off the hallways  The lift  on top of that  was broken during our stay so we had to lug our luggage to and from the basement  Upon getting into the room we found the room to be small  It was very dark and smelled musty  The bedspreads and window treatments were also a very dark navy blue which did not help to brighten up the room  Our window was open to the outside and was at waist level where anyone could break in  We closed it and tried to turn on the air conditioning  It didn t work  We went upstairs to check with the staff and was told that the air conditioning did not work and to just keep our window open because no one would break in  The bathrooms were very small  The worst part of the bathroom was the shower which was literally  x   Everynight when taking a shower  I was assaulted by the shower curtain which clung to my body  There was no way to get away from it because the shower was so small  Water flooded the outside bathroom floor everynight  Since the shower curtain was so long  I learned the first night that it floated over the drain of the shower and caused the shower to fill up and overflow  If it was put on the outside of the shower the floor got wet  Being very conscientious of cleanliness  I wondered how many bodies this shower curtain had clung to before clinging to me everynight  I found the thought disgusting  I next noticed that there were two PVC pipes snaking along the wall and draining into the shower  I realized that one of the pipes was attached to the backside of the air conditioner and had the the air conditioner been working  I think would have drained condensation into the shower  The other PVC pipe came from the other side and originated from the tank of the toilet and drained out into the shower  I wondered how this could pass anytype of sanitary inspection The bed was okay in terms of comfort  but when I initially pulled back the sheets I found hair  not ours as we had just checked in  on the sheets  I also found that the sheets were not changed the whole time that I was there and maybe this is customary to save on expense  I knew they were not changed because the same brown spot that was on my sheet remained there for the duration of my stay  The internet television service did not work and every night  usually after       p m  a group of people staying on our floor would talk noisely in the hallways and slam doors  Our neighbors could be heard carrying on a very clear conversation I usually don t write letters or reviews like this as I am easy to please but I felt that my experience was bad enough that anyone choosing to stay here needed to know what they could expect  I understand that the rates are affordable and I can deal with small  but cleanliness and good customer service are important  Please don t get me wrong  not all the staff was rude  in fact I really only experienced the initial check in person to be short with us  He seemed to change his attitude after another hotel representative  I think he may have been management  reassurred us that the room situation would be worked out and thanked us for our patience  Then out of nowhere a number of employees came out to assist with our bags Overall  I don t think that I will ever go back to this hotel and would not recommend it to anyone  
N =>  Ok for the price When we first checked in we were given a room in the basement which I found kind of scary  The room and bathroom was very small  The noise above us was really annoying  They moved us to another room on the first floor and it was a tad bit better  the bathroom was definitely an improvement from what we had the night before  actually the bathroom was perfect  The bed was small for my husband and I and the bed spread was old and not attractive  But to be honest with you for the price and location it was fine  Since we are NEVER in our hotel  only to sleep and bathe  when we are on vacation these problems did not bother us  The location was excellent because it is near a main underground  If we return to london we will stay here because you could not beat the price  If all you want to do is sleep and bathe I recommend this hotel  
N =>   Bad experience I stayed in this hotel for   nights  I wish i could move to another hotel during my stay but i couldn t since it s already booked and paid for  From the first day  i already have bad impression on this hotel  since the lift doesn t work at all  and everyone have to take the stairs to go to their rooms  luckily my room was not that far away  but the hallway to the room is narrow and confusing to find a way  The room  itself  is very small and the bathroom eventhough it s quite clean  it is also small The bad impression leads to bad experience on the second day of my stay  After a long day of work training and sightseeings  i went back to the hotel room and found out that my key didn t work    I went to the reception and told one of the receptionist that it didnt work  She put my card into the card reader  reprogram it and gave it back to me to try it again  So I did  up the stairs  around the hallways  went back in front of my room  just to find out that the key still didnt work  I went to the reception again  and this time with different receptionist  and he did the same thing as the previous receptionist did  and gave me back the key and i did the same process again  Until the third time i went back  the receptionist came to the room  brought something to program the door key but it still didnt work until   minutes later  I was really tired and weary at this point  and when finally the door was open  the guy said to me to report the problem to the reception the morning after and have them to reprogram the door so i wouldnt have this problem again  WHAT    Shouldn t he  the one who report to his collegue in the morning to fix the problem   I m already tired and can t argue anymore  so i just went inside the room and sleep on this lousy spring bed Before I stayed in this hotel  i stayed for one night in premier travell inn county hall  I have totatlly different experience  With almost the same price  travell inn definitely have more spacious room  clean beds  linens and bathrooms  and also helpful staff  I really not recommend best western paddington hotel  if you have other choices  you better off with other hotels rather than this one  believe me  or try it for yourself    
N => Very Poor Upon arriving to the Hotel we were impressed The entrance gave the impression of a spacious  clean and up market hotel but it was all downhill from here  We checked in and were told not taken  where are rooms were  The lift was far too small  there was only two of us with a small amount of luggage each and we only just managed to get into the lift  call me fussy but I find it rather frustrating having to struggle just to get into a lift As went got into our room it just looked very used and tired  although it was fairly clean  The bathroom was smelt of    well you can imagine  which was poorly disguised with bleach  The beds were very uncomfortable and the bedspreads and curtains were very tasteless  We were only given a few sheets which were rough and itchy After getting settled into the room we went sight seeing  When leaving the hotel via the awful lift we ended up on the basement level where we got a little confused and were rudely asked  quot Can we help you   quot  and were told this was not the exit and to use the stairs When we got back to the hotel we went straight to out room then didn t have a very good nights sleep  The next morning we went down to breakfast  The dining room and staff again were well presented  The breakfast itself however was AWFUL  I had a bowel of cereal and a croissant and my friend had an English breakfast  Both our meals were very tasteless  The milk was off so we had to ask for a fresh jug of milk  The coffee was weak and tasted like it had been sat out all morning  Overall the breakfast was the worst I had ever eaten Again that day we went out sightseeing When we got back to the hotel room I discovered my towel was missing  it had been mistaken for one of their own towels  Although it was white just like thiers  it was far better qaulity than the ones they had provided  I phoned the reception asking where it would have gone  Because of a laungauge barrier he only just understood what I was saying and said they would call back  no one did The next day we checked out and I had to enquire about my towel again  They took my address and said they would mail it to me  you may think this is a bit silly just for a towel but it was an expensive one and I don t see why I should have to buy another one because of someone else being incompetent and not realizing that its a different style Later that day after checking out we decided to stay another night  after experiencing this hotel we were not going to stay there again  We found a hotel near Tower Hill called Apex Hotels  you can read a review of this one by searching  
N =>  Customer Service Wasn t a Priority I wish I would have given the harsh reviews more thought  however  I work in Customer Service and I can be the first one to tell you people look for things to complain about  However in this case Best Western had it coming to them  First as other complaints after flying    hours only to find our room not ready  Which luckily  Paddington had quite of few restaurants so we went to go eat  Finally get a room  Oh the elevator is like a death trip  It is old  noisy and SLOWWWWWW  THere is only   flights of stairs   The room is fairly clean  Especially the bathroom  BUT    our room is supposed to have interenet service  Ours was broken and never was replace in the   days we were there  The TV only had like   channels  Oh and if you want air conditioning or heat that is only avaliable in the suites  Even though there was a thermostat on the wall  But my all time favorite is   i brought a calling card with me to call home to say I made it  Even though there is a big label on the phone saying they accept all calling cards  THEY accept NO CALLING CARDS But all those were minor details compared to the staff  Not all of them but mostly the ones working during the day shift were the laziest and rudiest  We left a note for extra towels and coffee creamer everyday  And everyday after our day of sight seeing we had to call the first desk   quot Be right there quot  was a favorite saying  Because they knew in    minutes there were off their shift therefor leaving us to call down again Overall hotel not to shabby  the customer service was crappy 
N =>  Good Location Good location    that is the only good thing about this hotel  Our room was in the basement  There was no fan in the restroom  In fact  we actually set off the fire alarm when we used the shower  Without a fan  combined with the basement location there was mold all over the walls  It was really awful  I guess there are no health codes in the UK  I am certain that there must be      night hotel rooms that are better We arrived at about   am  and the room was not ready  This seems to be a recurring statement by many reviewers  After a long  overnight flight from the US  I would atleast recommend looking for a hotel that may be able to accomodate Luckily  we were in London to sightsee and didn t spend alot of time in our room  On a good note  the bedding was clean  and the beds were comfortable I would never stay here again  This was definitely the worst hotel I have ever stayed at  Avoid at all costs 
N =>  We loved it We spent   nights in this hotel  and we really liked it  In our opinion  the hotel is stylish  Our room  standard twin  was quite small but clean  and the beds were comfortable  Nothing disturbed our sleep   perfect  And the breakfast was great  Paddington station is nearby  so when we were leaving we took a train to the Heathrow airport   very convenient We just can t understand all the complaints about this hotel  we would stay there anytime  
N =>  Stars Lie On arrival just before the  pm check in time my wife  amp  I were told that our room was not ready yet  which can happen in any hotel   we accepted this  During the following   hr    min wait before we got a room  no bar or cafe was available   the bar does not open until  pm  amp  closes at   pm No lift operated in the part of the hotel we were put so we had to carry our luggage up    steps  amp  through one opening    inches wide  amp  one    inches to our room in the group            This room was  ft x      ft with an additional   x   shower Continental breakfast was limited The chamber staff must work extreamly hard to keep the rooms  bedding  amp  landings spotlessly clean What we want to know is how did this hotel get a three star rating  
N =>   Shabby  I stayed here on a business trip to London in ch     I was deeply disapointed by this hotel The problems began at check in where reception staff seemed barely able to manage a simple check in Eventually I was allocated a room which was small  grotty and had walls so thin that I could hear other residents use their bathrooms  Avoid the restaurant  the breakfast buffet looked great but most of the food was lukewarm at best  a real health hazard  The Paddington Court does not warrant its rating and I will not be staying here again  
N =>  I urge you all to NOT stay in this hotel Where do i start  First of all  i stayed for   nights  and from when i checked in until i checked out i didnt no receive one single smile from any of the hotel staff  be it te reception staff  or the restaurnt staff  In fact  the restaurant staff barely acknowledged the guests  it reminded me of fawlty towers in so many ways  And the breakfast is a bap and coffee   so not worth it the reception staff are incompetent  Whilst i was checking in another lady had a problem with her bill  which the reception staff did not know how to deal with and the lady had to wait for ahes while the staff rang numerous people who still did not know how to fix the problem  NO one knows whart is going on in this hotel So i checked in and went to room  The smallest room i have ever been in in my life  From the hotel s own web site i was expecting a fair bit of luxury  which i so did not get  I cannot express my dissapointment here  I have travalled to many a city  and this has been the highest nightly rate i have ever paid to get the most basic room  I have stayed on one star hotels and have had a better room Which then leads me to when i checked out  which wasn t to soon   still no smiles by the way  Even when there was a billing error  and i made the staff aware of this  they proceeding to charge me double my total price to my credit card  They told me they could not fix this  and i would have to ring head office my self  That was the first thing i did when i got back home  which was three weeks ago  i have since been on to them a furhter two times  and both times i have been told my card has been refunded  and it still hasnt to this date Overall   no smiles  terrible customer service  small room  the advertised FREE internet is actually an internet TV that doesnt work  terible staff  still waiitng on refund  Please DO NOT STAY HERE 
N =>  Confused by recent reviews I felt the need to write a review after reading recent posts on this hotel  giving it only   or   out of    I stayed here in ober for   nights  I absolutely loved it  its in a busy  but not noisy  area so I felt safe as a woman staying alone  My room looked brand new  very clean including the shower which worked perfectly  Very comfortable  Tiny but I am used to that from staying in other London hotels  There was a tv  a phone  a safe  a microwave and a fridge which was really useful as I was there for over a week The hotel is also very close to restaurants  cafes  pubs    tube stations including Paddington  grocery stores and theres an internet cafe nearby  I cant comment on the shopping or sightseeing as I was there on business and didnt have time for that    but it is about a    min walk to a shopping centre and a park  My only complaint  reducing rating from     to      was similar to some others which is that I arrived exhausted from a transatlantic flight to find my room not ready  in fact I was taken in a cab to another hotel for my first night  I was not given any options other than this  which was frustrating being so tired and carrying heavy bags  However the hotel they sent me to was very nice and nearby  and I had no further mishaps during my stay Messing around with rooms doesnt bother me much  I am more interested in a clean and comfortable room  which I got here  so I would highly recommend this hotel based on my own experience  In fact I am booking it again for a trip in il  
N =>  Worst place I have ever stayed  We have booked to stay in this hotel through a discount hotels website It turned up to be a complete nightmare We had booked a room with double bed non smoking  After arriving at the hotel  they told us that they run out of the double bed rooms and they would give us a twin room  We accepted that being very tired of traveling  The room was so small that we could not even fit our suitase in  The two beds were placed the one opposite the other  The window would not open  No ventilation  The room was smelling  Toilet was so small that you could not even stand inside Would never ever stay there again   What a terrible experience  
N => What a dump       The first thing that greeted me was being told rather rudely that my reservation had been cancled     they couldn t give an explanation and told me it would be a few minutes        minutes later they managed to find a room for me  I was shown to a room the size of a closet with a single bed  The bed was so patheticaly bad I couldn t beleive it  it was litterally caved in on one side  I had to flip the mattress over to find a reasonable flat surface  even with this  you could feel ever hard spring  What absolutely defies logic  is that for the price of one nights stay in said room  this hotel could not go out and replace a mattress that was years past it s usefullness  The bathroom was VERY worn around the edges and had a filthy shower curtain  I was awoken to not one but three ear pierciing alarms through the night  The radiator was not working and was stifelingly hot all night  with not ventalation  I had prepaid for the room the night before  as I had an early flight to catch  only to be told in the morning that I owed them an aditional    pounds  This was while I had a taxi that had been pre aranged waiting and racking up expense  I said I wasn t going to pay it  and he had the nerve to ask for my credit card to swipe  I will never stay at this or any other Best Western hotel or thier affiliates     and beware  there are several in London  Shame on British Air for being associated with such an establishment    it s a reflection on an otherwise good airline  
N =>  Good Result in the End  I booked an executive queen sized bedded suite   requesting a quiet location  Upon arrival  received a very small cramped room with standard size bed on the rear elevation which was extremely noisey as a result of externally mounted air conditioning  After complaining I was told none of the suites had queen sized beds but was offered  others to view to assess the noise  Both were on the same elevation  so had the same noise problem  After rejecting all three rooms  I was offered a basement executive queen size bedded suite   yes the very one they said they didn t have  This room was perfectly adequate although I have to say the bathroom was very snug   my knees touched the radiator when using the loo  On the positive  the staff were extremely friendly and very oblying in dealing with my series of complaints  
N =>  location was good we had a great offer when we stayed at this hotel     quid  which reflected in the size of the room  no space to hang your clothes or to put your luggage  i had to crawl over my husband to get to the other side of the bed  bathroom was excellent though  and the tele needs tuning  
N =>   the worst hotel in London I am a journalist and I have travelled all the world  I  ve been in the worst places in Africa  S America  China etc   but this hotel was a terrible experiance for me  My room was in the basement   The restaurant as well No windows   no tasty food  awful breakfast    Even though I love Paddigton   Court Hotel was a kind of nightmare  
N =>  Not the best On arrival at the hotel we were told that we were being upgraded to an executive suite for our   night stay   thank goodness  I dread to think what a standard room may have been like  The room was extremely small  with the tiniest double bed I have ever seen  however this would have been ok if the room wasn t so hot and the air conditioning unit was too noisy to sleep through  Also  our internet didn t work and although we informed the desk staff of this shortly after our arrival  many excuses were made over the next   days as to why this was never fixed    saving graces  the tube station is a   minute walk and the suite had a little kitchen so we didn t have to risk the hotel food  
N =>  We were lucky I d read about this hotel shipping guests off to other hotels  so it was no surprise when we were told on arrival there were  quot problems with the rooms quot  and we would be going elsewhere  They comped drinks while we waited and a taxi  a Mercedes no less  that took us to the Shaftesbury Kensington  which is a four star hotel This is the former Hogarth Hotel and not to be confused with another Shaftesbury elsewhere in London The hotel is very nice and new  My guess is they we were guinea pigs while they trained a new staff  You ll hear no complaints here  The hotel was nicer than I m used to  it was close to the Earl s Court tube station and the area was lively with plenty of good restaurants  
N => No Probs  After reading some reviews I expected the worst  We got a good deal     per room per night  I have to say given the location it was great value Only problem was the location of the room  It was at the junction of two corridors and stairs and overall was noisy  I tend to blame the other guests rather than the hotel for this Room was fine  clean and tidy  had i been staying longer I would have requested a change of room but other than that good value and location  
N => Quite average This hotel is best described as average  From the outside it looks like big luxury  but the inside can t quite keep up  The room and the bathroom were both clean and tidy  but it was very small   the bed took up most of the floor space  The breakfast was filling  but nothing special  All in all not a very memorable experience  but not terrible either  
N =>  Frustrating and inconvenient   at its best After researching and selecting this hotel  quot on sale quot  online  ok  maybe I should have known better   we somehow managed to find this hotel  and arrived late at night only to be told that they had overbooked the hotel and we would be transferred to  quot another   star hotel quot  which was  quot just as good quot  as Best Western Paddington  Of course  they paid for a taxi to transfer us  and our room was paid for at the other hotel  However  notification at arrival of our transfer to another hotel I had never heard of   and didn t enjoy  was frustrating  the understatement of the year  and I would not recommend this hotel to anyone   
N =>  Could have been better and bigger With a child about       year old  we had ordered a double room with a cot  We got a twin room  but no cot  One of the reasons why  was perhaps that it was no space for a cot  without throwing out one of the beds    We also got a room in ground floor with a window that could not be opened  With C       in the room  and no AC  this was hot    The next day  we got a new room  that was a little bit less small  and with a window that could be opened  The service was ok  but not all of the staff spoked english  or Norwegian    One pre for the place was free Broad band internet  I brought the laptop with me  so that we could make plans for the next day  I think the price we paid       per night  was ok but that didn t include breakfast  The next time I am on a holliday I will look at reviews on this web page BEFORE I go   Gunnar  Oslo  Norway 
N =>  best western games Well  we ve fallen into the same trap that many others here have reported  We booked a room at Paddington Court and  surprise  surprise  AFTER we signed in  we were told that we had to be transferred to another hotel because of some unexplained problem with fire alarms  We then arrived at the Hogath building site in Earl s Court and waited in line to check in again   now an hour behind schedule  Our room was coated in thick dust the result of the building work they obviously hadn t finished  Our windows were covered in scaffolding and plastic sheeting  There wasn t any air conditioning  The bed wasn t a full double and was a mattress on a box frame  They also insisted on running our credit card through the machine and asking for authorisation to cover any  quot extras quot   This  they insisted  was normal but was queried by everyone we saw at reception and led to long waits to check in and out  What is their game  This transferring has been going on for months  Saying all that the dining room was nice   Moroccan stlye   and the breakfast good  
N =>  Absolutely OK  I spend five nights at the Paddington Court in the middle of august  I must confess that before I left Sweden I was really worried  especially after reading all the negative reviews  But there was no need to worry  The hotel was fine  It was a typical three star London hotel  Nothing more and nothing less  The staff were very helpful and polite  Although I had only book and paid for a single room I received a double  I did not find the room smaller then any other three star hotel I staid at in London  It might not be a perfect family hotel and if I was travelling with children I think that I would book a room at a four star hotel  But I would definitely recommend the hotel to my single girlfriends since the area felt safe  The hotel is conveniently located close to the Paddington Station  were you can catch several buses  underground trains and the Heathrow Express  At the hotel I notice that they could help the quests to book a shuttle to the airport  something that I did not use since I was travelling from Heathrow However  even though I enjoyed my stay at the hotel I would not recommend it to someone who is handicapped  The hotel state that they have a lift to al flours which is a large over statement  The hotel has a lift  but when you reach to your flour I will have to take several steps of stairs before can get to your room  When I staid there most of the guest were from USA and UK  some from Germany  Italy and Spain  but no one else from Sweden  I believe that most Scandinavian tourist would prefer the Mornington Hotel   Lancaster Gate  with it s Nordic stile and smorgasbord Anna sson  Sweden 
N => honeymoon disaster Like so many other reviewers  my husband and I arrived at the Paddington Court straight from our flight from San Francisco to discover the hotel was overbooked and that we would be transferred to another hotel  Now let me emphasize  this was our HONEYMOON  We were transferred to a nicer hotel  the Hogarth Hotel   with a new name  but it was under renovation so our first room had no hot water  no a  c  during the heat wave  and a view of scaffolding  The staff was very nice  and we knew the situation was not their fault  they did transfer us to a nicer room that was larger  with no scaffolding view  and hot water  It was actually a very nice room  except there still was no a c  Thus we got not one night of good sleep  although the fan they gave us helped a little  I would recommend the Hogarth to people when the renovation is done  the staff was great  And the staff at the Paddington Court was very nice too  But what I am forewarning others is to be cautious of booking these or any other hotels in London  Europe or anywhere in the world through Expedia  You have the chance of your hotel being overbooked  They did not offer any compensation  only a travel voucher to book through them again  That s bad business  in my opinion  
N =>  Disorganized in the extreme Like the previous reviewer  we showed up to find that we were being transferred to another hotel  The only difference is that we had booked over   months in advance  so they have no excuse for not knowing we were coming  While the staff was apologetic  we were still made to sit in a hot overcrowded lobby for over an hour while they found us a cab to transfer  When we transferred we found that we were nowhere near where we wanted to be in the city  causing us to incur additional costs in order to meet our tours each day  When I complained to the hotel management after the fact  I was offered a  quot discount quot  rate on my next visit that was the same as the rate I can book online anyway  Of course  I will not book with this property or this chain again  
N =>  Sense of Humour Required My husband and I had a horrendous experience with the Best Western Paddington in y  We arrived  tired  at the end of a long trip  looking forward to a good sleep before our flight home  This wasn t to be  The first man in line as we arrived was berating the frazzled desk clerk about his accomodations and was wanting an immediate room change  which couldn t be accomodated  Next up were two businessmen  who were told there was a problem with their rooms and they would need to be put up in another hotel  After a lengthy  heated exchange  they stormed out of the hotel  cancelling their  reservation   Next up  we were also told that there was a room problem  but they were going to put us up in an upgraded  four star hotel and they would pay for the taxi over  Sounded good  However  we waited much longer than an hour for the ride  Turns out they couldn t just use a taxi service  it had to be a company they have an arrangement with  so we waited  waited  waited  with the clerk intermittently phoning them  pleading with them to come as the list of unhappy travellers continued to grow  When we finally arrived at the hotel  well after midnight  we were horrified  The  four star hotel  we had been promised was under major renovation and in the dark all that could be seen was scaffolding  Our sound sleep was not to be  There was no air conditioning and the room was stifling  The window wouldn t budge more than an inch  The front desk person came up and fought with the window and also couldn t get it to open  His solution  open the door to the hallway to let cool air in  By then it s about   a m   so that wasn t a particularly viable option  And sure enough  in the morning  construction started up  so there was no quiet and no privacy as construction people walked right by the window The only good thing about our experience was the camaraderie developed with other exhausted people who were waiting with us  caught in the same predicament  An Irish couple dubbed our    star hotel  Fawlty Towers  which had us hooting  You ll see why  when you see the attached picture of our  quot   star upgrade quot   
N =>  booked here but transferred to another hotel I booked this hotel before reading the reviews  We arrived to check in only to be told that their system had crashed the day I made the booking online     days before  and as a result the hotel was overbooked  The staff were apologetic and explained that they had booked us in to another hotel close by of the same calibre and would put us in a taxi to get there  We were on a week end break and had chosen this hotel because of its location and because it had a bar where we could meet our friends  We arrived at our  quot new quot  hotel only to find it was further away from where we had wanted to stay and had no bar  I felt disappointed and wondered why the Best Western hadn t had the courtesy to call me up as soon as they realised they had no room for us  I would have preferred to know this in advance instead of feeling conned  
N =>  sucks My husband  I and our    month old daughter travel from NY to London    we had no sleep and our baby was cranky    when we reached the hotel at    am they said they would clean up the room by  pm and we could check in then    w came in at  pm to see if the room was ready   they said they had no rooms and transferred us to another hotel    they also took the money for our   day stay in advance and assured us that the rooms will be the like the one we booked for in best western paddington  BWP        we were all so tired that we went to this hotel they transferred us to   the Hogarth Hotel   in Earls court We had booked for an executive double   paying premium       pounds    and when we checked in to the room it looked small   but we decided to call it a day as our daughter was very cranky     the next day we found out that the room was a standard double costs    pounds  instead of an executive double  We paid    pounds for an executive double  To top it all there was renovation work going on at hogarth place   that robbed us of our sleep They moved us in an executive double only on the last day of stay and did not refund us the balance     their argument   best western paddington told them that we should be booked in a standard double  The hogarth hotel gave us free cab ride to Kings Cross station     pounds worth  on the day we checked out Pls    take our advice    do not book in the BWP      unless u want to spoil your vacation  
N => Not worth it  Myself and two friends arrived home from London today and will definitely not be returning to the Paddington Court Hotel  After booking a room with three single beds  we were told that there wasn t one available and was given a room with a double and a single that had a lovely view of a brick wall  as we were in the basement  The shower was stuck at    degrees and after complaining   times it still was not fixed  The television also didn t work and after complaining twice it was not fixed  The iron did not work  the window was not secure and the light in the bathroom didn t work  All in all the worst hotel i have stayed in  
N =>  Give it a miss  I was sent to this hotel because of overbooking at a  sister  hotel nearby  The double room I was given was the smallest I have ever seen  The decor of the room and bathroom was fine and very new but the window was old and metal  It lacked a catch and swung in the wind  The room was on the third floor and the water pressure was feeble The worst thing that happened was that I arrived back from a visit to the theatre to find that my luggage had disappeared  I was initially relieved when I went to reception to be told that  no  it hadn t been stolen but had been moved to another room  That room was already occupied by some people and they had to go an extract my bags  The luggage included my laptop and passport  I was very cross but they seemed to find it funny  My advice is to avoid this place like the plague  
N => Rude staff and a huge rip off I wish we had read the reviews before booking  Initially  they wanted to put us  two adults and two young children  in two rooms that I am sure were closets in their past life  They were damp  dirty  really small  and desperately in need of renovations  After we had a fit  they  quot upgraded quot  us to a room with a double bed and pull out couch  The pull out couch looked like it came from a second hand sale  It was ugly  dirty  and the bed matress was about two inches thick  Our internet did not work  The staff was unbelievably rude on multiple occasions  There is some serious attitude going on at this place  Do not stay at this hotel   it is terrible  
N => Hot  The staff was not helpful  On one occassion the information we were seeking was right around the corner in their hall  but they knew nothing of it  You had to go beg for a fan  The room was not clean  The rooms were hot and the mold was awful  Two of the four of us went to the doctor   times the first week back and    days later we are still dealing with Respiratory problems  Breakfast was very slowly restocked and was nothing to brag about  This is not my first stay in London so we were not expecting an American style resort  It was a health risk  
N => If you require space skip this place    To say the rooms are small  would be an understatement Hotel is clean  and most of the staff is helpful and flriendly  just the rooms are incredibly small  Now I m not saying this  as the  quot ugly american tourist quot  either  I ve stayed in London before  and all over the world  just simply put  these rooms are freakishly small  Take that as you wish Continental breakfast was includsed w  the room  otherwise  skip  too expensive at   pnds  Internet was ok  kinda like TiVo internet  for basic stuff  not to fast  not terribly slow  but allows you to access your web mail  so cant t beat that Tube IS NOT close by   It s not a Long ch either  but after all the walking you do  you dread that final walk from the tube to the hotel Neighbourhood is safe  clean  and middle classish    not a knock down  just  its not Chelsea  or Kennsington Beds are decent at best  shower is tooo small as well  hall ways are small  If you are a Keibler Elf  its not a bad place to stay  
N =>  Very Nice   We stayed a this hotel in ch of       I totally loved it   granted the room was small  but it was a very pleasant hotel  The staff was very friendly and helpful  The location was excellent  it was about a   minute walk to paddington station and about a      minute walk to Notting Hill we would stay here again  
N => Not so Cheap and cheerful We arrived on   th ember with our young son who became sick whilst travelling  We waited patiently in reception very busy   When we were served  I explained that my son was ill and we needed to take him to our room as soon as possible  We were told our room was ready  The receptionist then said there was only one bed in the room   we booked an extra one for our son   I asked her to sort this out and she said it was not up to her   it was up to the company I had booked the accomodation with  I had to call them and it turned out it was the Hotels fault  We then had to wait three hours for a room The room was small  the shower in the room above leaked into our accomodation  This was reported and nothing was done The hotel is in a lovely area but we were disappointed by the attitute of the staff  
N =>  Stay away       We live in Essen  germany  and stayed in this hotel from      th november      We didn t expect much and have been in London several times ago  But this was too much  We had no hot water in the shower in   from   days  Every day we told the reception  As other users already have written  they are unfriendly and don t react until you become real angry  making a scene  They told us  the boiler  water heater  was defect and had been changed  so we should wait for the water to heat up again  Our request for another room was denied  they had none  On the third morning we had at least no water at all in the shower  The reception was not really impressed  Nothing happenend until we went the third time down and made a real scene  They admitted  but without apologizing  that the whole  th floor had no water  After argueing a while  they generously gave as a room in the third floor  there everything worked By the way  this room was significant bigger than the first one  This first room in the  th floor was  as others have already told  very  very small  The room was the bed and the walls around the bed    At the weekend there are waiting times up to    minutes to get a place in the breakfast room  You re waiting standing in a line down the stairs to the room   But I would have accepted this  but the cold shower I couldn t accept  This is too much  I even couldn t wash my  long  hair properly If youv ve already booked  Don t accept a room in the  th floor and if you have reclamations  repeat and repeat them at reception  otherwise nothing will happen           GOOD LUCK    
N =>  Cannot imagine a worse place to stay I have well over a       nights in hotels in the last    years at various places around the world and nothing comes even close to being as bad as this hotel  The staff was rude  the room was unbelievably small  I have seen bigger closets  and it was not the cleanest place either  If this is your only choice when staying in London I would suggest trying a bench in Hyde Park instead  
N =>  Not the best Best Western in the world At first sight this ought to have been a good hotel  but sadly it wasn t  We requested a double sized room  and found a broom closet  The room would have been small for a single bed  One side of the double bed was hard up against the wall  and if two people stood up at the same time  you had to be thin  Tiny bathroom too  Everything was there  no air con  but TV  tea maker  closet etc all present  and clean  just very small  Unfortunate occurence on checkout  they had lost the prepaid voucher and we nearly got into an argument over payment  Took half an hour to sort out  In fairness to them  their lobby was being redone and thet were in cramped temporary quarters  Not cheap either  but nothing is in London  Five minutes walk from Paddington Station and the express train to Heathrow  so a good location  Might go back again  but would look elsewhere first  
N => Just Fine After reading the terrible reviews  my friend and I were pretty apprehensive about this hotel  but it turned out to be just fine  Of course the rooms are small  but any visitor to London knows that you re not going to get a spacious and super fancy place at this kind of price  There wasn t any air conditioning  as had been advertised  but we did get a big oscillating fan  so the A C wasn t terribly missed  The room was clean  the bathroom fine and the staff very courteous and helpful  They are in the midst of renovating their restaurant and bar   the lounge was just finished when we left and is very attractive  We had no wait to get into our room and no hassles checking out  I would definitely stay here again  I seriously think the strongly negative reviews must be from people who are not aware of London hotel standards and were expecting something luxurious at a budget hotel price  Don t be afraid  It s just fine  
N => Great hotel  I thought this hotel was great  Yes  the room is very small  but how much time is spent in the room  Plus  with the standard cost of London hotels  this was a deal It was very clean  a decent sized bathroom  a beautiful lobby and lounge area  The restarunt was being renovated when I was there  so they offered to bring breakfast to your room  It was a great location  only   blocks from Paddington train station  My only complaint is that the website stated they had air conditioning and they did not  They did provide a large fan which was sufficient  
N => Price good but hotel very average Arrived early        and asked what time I could ckeck in  I was told  by the rude and unfriendly staff   people that the whole of England can be proud of  that a room would be available at       When I returned at      I spent the next   hours waiting for the room  The room was extremely small  even by English standards  but it was clean and functional  There was not enough room to have two bags on the floor The bathroom was the smallest I have ever seen in a hotel  The shower was enclosed in glass and I could not turn around without breathin in   I am very tall  The water temperature was hard to control so I ended up scalding myself as I could not get away from the water without getting out of the shower  In the end I showered with the door open The breakfast wasn t worth waiting for and in the end I just breakfasted at small cafes in the area All in all the hotel would not suit those used to Asian and American hotels  It is  however  OK if you get a cheap rate as it is convenient  
N => Worst service ever  Save yourself the trouble    I initially booked a room at this hotel because I thought its location would be ideal since it is in close proximity to the Paddington tube station  and in fact that turned out to be the only positive outcome from my stay there  The hotel appears lovely from outside and the lobby is quite nice  too  but on the first night there I was waiting to check in and I received an omen that I was about to experience an awful stay  A couple there was complaining about how they had requested coffee    hours ago and they had called several times to remind the concierge but no one did anything about it  It was obvious that they were upset and the concierge really did nothing to help them out  it seemed he couldn t care less  He wouldn t answer them when they asked for the manager s name  nor would he give them a contact number  The couple was enraged and they left fuming  I thought at first that maybe it was just them but then that same night I discovered that we didn t have a blowdryer so I went to the front desk to request one and the concierge there said there wasn t one available because all the rooms were booked at the moment and he would need to wait until someone had left the next morning so that I could have one then  I found that hard to believe but went along with it  So I called the next morning around      and asked for the blowdryer  I was told then that they would deliver one to my room in    minutes  Half an hour passed by and there was still no sign of the blowdryer so I called again and this time another person answered and he told me that it s  quot in the drawer quot    I asked which drawer  and he continued to be vague so I just hung up  It turns out that it was in the dresser drawer right beneath the TV  which by the way didn t even work properly  but I couldn t understand why I wasn t told that the other night when I initially asked for it  Anyway  we had this other problem with the staff there  Besides the fact that most of them    were rude and disrespectful and    were totally incompetent  it seems that they actually went out of their way to make our stay difficult  We needed a room for one extra night since we were spending part of our vacation in Paris and we were told that we wouldn t have a problem getting a room  The next day  however  when we tried to book something  this other receptionist  a short Indian woman whose name I couldn t catch  told us that we were mistaken  there was nothing available for the night we requested  Obviously we were furious because not only were we given the wrong information the previous night but she did absolutely NOTHING to help us  and her sour expression showed no sign of empathy at all for our situation  We decided to speak to someone else the next day and the assistant manager  Roy  handled the matter but he did put on a very arrogant and snooty attitude  He didn t give us any confirmation of a room but merely signed a letter saying that something was available and that was all  So we came back from Paris and apparently there was a mix up because they couldn t find anything booked under the cardholder s name  my friend s  who was staying with me  and they told us that they were fully booked for that night so we couldn t stay there  Fortunately  we were able to get assistance from the manager there who was really a blessing  If it weren t for him we would have been left with no place to stay our last night in London  Not only was he corteous and kind but he also went out of his way to do what he could for us  It turned out that the room was booked under my name although it would have saved us a lot of time and trouble if Roy had told us that to begin with  but anyway  we got to stay at this   star hotel instead of at Paddington for the same rate that was promised to us  so in that sense we lucked out  Even our transportation to the other hotel was provided for us thanks to the manager  I can t remember his name because I lost the business card but I think it was something like Peader  he had a slim build  average height  and red hair   Really  I can t fully express just how terrible the service was at this hotel and the manager was the only person who stood out as someone who cared about the customers  If you can settle with bad service then stay there because it is in a good location but I would rather stay somewhere else that has a nice and friendly staff  I ll admit that the rooms were decent but still small  and the TV gave us problems  it wouldn t turn on at times   Overall  I would have to say that it s really not worth it to stay at this hotel because it will ruin your trip by making you disgruntled twoards Londoners thanks to the poor service and attitude at the BWPCH  
N =>  If you love to sleep with bugs and bad service    eptive  Upon arrival to the Paddington Best Western  the lobby looked clean and quaint  The staff was curt and uninviting  but that could just be Londoners   When we arrived at our room  other boarders mentioned that the electricity was out in their rooms and they were waiting for over an hour and had called the concierge multiple times  So we waiting in our cramped toom  The room looked clean  but upon getting into bed  I noticed a cockroach next to my pillow  then later in the bathroom  That was enough to disgust me  but I sucked it up  Meanwhile  our bathroom had a sign up that said   quot DO NOT USE quot  and we were worried that there was a problem so we called management and they said not to worry about it  Any reasonable person would take the sign down if there wasn t any problems  We were reluctant to use it  but ended up conceeding  Then I went in search of a hairdryer  This is where the problem escalated  We didn t find one in the room so called the concierge again and noted that to them  They said it was in our drawers  but we mentioned that we couldn t find it  So I went to bed with a wet head  Then in the morning before we left for the day we AGAIN notified them that we did not have a hairdryer and AGAIN they said it was in our drawers and we said it was not in there  So they said that they would take care of it  By the time we arrived back at night we decided to stop bothering them and hoped that it would be there by then  Again  no sign of a hairdryer  So I called the concierge AGAIN and he said that his colleague went looking for one  but never returned  He in the end brought me to another room to actually use the hair dryer before the new occupants arrived  I was furious by then  but too tired to complain to their manager about this frustrating situation  I had to ask them FIVE times for a     hairdryer  I was afraid to even ask for roomservice after that  Besides finding bugs in my bed for the rest of my stay there  we opted to stay out of the hotel as much as possible  If you can find a better hotel with better service  I would highly recommend it  The Paddington BW  is a poor representation of the Best Westerns in the US  
N =>  Worst hotel in London LOL   We couldnt locate our room  so we asked a maid to help us  She couldnt even find our room  we had to be escorted back to the reception area  because we had no idea how to get back to it  to have someone else show us where our room was  This hotel is like a labryinth of twists and turns  It gets better   Once in our room  the floor squeaked with every step  I literally thought we would fall through  Oh and how can I forget the bed  It was the most uncomfortable thing I have ever attempted to sleep in  I do not recommend this place  Learn from my mistake  do not stay here  
N =>  Not my cup of tea In full agreement with the negative reviews offered by my fellow carping arrogant whining Americans and other discriminating travelers The Good   Proximity to Paddington Station  safe neighborhoodThe Bad   Unhelpful staff  billing dispute  didn t want to honor the rate on my booking confirmation The Ugly   Rooms   quot Small quot  would be an improvement  Hallways  Did someone mention a rat maze  
N =>  Bad hotel  Terrible hotel  Quite expensive  but not good value for the money  The hotel is a maze  I actually got lost on my first attempt to leave the hotel  Had to write down the route through the hotel  Ok  that can have its charm   Room was very small  Shower was almost unusable  way too small and not much water  Breakfast buffet almost doesn t show any choices  Neighbourhood is Ok  Would not stay there again  
N =>  Miserable  dishonest property    After a typical overnite flight from the US  we presented to the front desk at appox      hrs  We were told that our  quot room quot  would be available by      hrs  We understand this is the norm  and no big deal  We were instructed to wait in the lounge  We sat in this room until after      hrs with about     other people who had been told the same story or had screwed up reservations of some sort  As the growing number of waiting people grew  to the point of an overfull luggage room  the staff cheerfully checked in travel agents and their families     Finally  we we reached our room we found it to be substandard  dirty  and somewhat dishoveled  We have traveled Europe extensively and found this property to be the biggest dissappointment we have encountered  Perhaps the benches at Paddington Station would have been more accommidating    
N =>  London hotels When we arrived at the Paddington Court our room was typical London  small and not to well furnished  The friends we were with found the mattress in their room had seen better days and complained to the management  We were moved to larger and much nicer rooms on the first floor  All in all our   day stay became very nice  The staff  both hotel and kitchen  were great  the breakfast was very nice  the rooms were cleaned everyday and it was convenient to the tube and buses  My only complaint was I had joined a Best Western Crown Club and getting the points became a catch     Because I had made the reservations on the internet from another party it was not counted  That to me was the big joke  This was not the hotels fault however  
N =>  Much too small double room feeling like in a basement Room B   certainly didn t look like anything we saw on the Internet  Quite disapointing small room  had to move the bed to get around  under ground level  facing backyard  dirty carpets  stressed staff  
N => Small Room   Dirty hallways Chose this hotel for proximity to Paddington Station  Our room was in the  quot old quot  wing  there appeared to be a new wing which was much nicer  with elevators and electronic room keys    but we did not see it   The room was very small  even by European standards  and at ground level  The bathroom was relatively clean  although the hallways leading to the room were quite dirty and the carpet in the room had old gum on it  The chain on our door was broken and was not fixed after two requests  although staff was otherwise relatively friendly  There was a coin op internet terminal in the lobby  which was very convenient  Otherwise    would not recommend  I m sure you can do better   
N => Ugg    think twice before going here Some how this was by far the worse hotel experiance I have ever had  This was a   star hotel  It was more like a no star  We sent reservations in advance for   rooms  we ended up being on different floors than our kids  the first room we were given was smelly  bed was broken down and in poor condition and extremely small  like no room to walk   We immediatly went to the main desk and requested another room and were given another room  This one was  X   this is not a misprint  This one had a bed with springs that popped through the matress  After a sleepless night we requested and were given another room  this one was okay but nothing to brag about  Looks good on the outside but not worth the money or sleepless nights  
N =>  Be Aware We agree with the reviews posted  the room was inconvienently small  front desk never answers the phone  hotel is under staffed  We would like to add that we were nearly the victims of an apparantly common hotel practice of being overcharged for transportation when we requested a cab  The hotel concierge called their transportation  which was an unlicensed  unmetered  uninsured van which would have charged us    lbs for a ride to Victoria Station as opposed to      for a licensed  metered regular cab  So if you request a cab  make it clear you want a regular  metered London cab  not their private van  The room rate was good  but we got absolutely no more than we paid for  and we won t stay there again  
N =>  Terrible choice  stay elsewhere Chose this hotel for proximity to Paddington station so we could easily be at the airport the next day  It was much further from the station than we had anticipated  We were given a former janitor s closet as a room  You could clearly see the former sign on our room door and our room number was marked in pencil on the hallway directional sign  Clearly  our room had recently been  quot created quot   The room was below street level so you could only see the outdoors with half of the window  Staff was rude  we always had to wait just to drop off the room key which you must do EVERY time you leave the hotel  The key was like an elementary school hall pass  We saw several young guests lounging barefoot in the common area  It was only one night  but we will never go back there again  
N =>  Disputing charges  did not stay when I saw it Booked online  photos disceptive  had child s accomodation down   hallways from adult   could not stay after speaking w mgr  Disputing charges  
N =>  COuld have been worse   though I don t know how   
N => Don t expect much from room or service  
N =>  Good value Hotel  
N =>  Okay If Not In Room Much  
N =>  Rooms WAY too small too far from tube reception too busy to help  
N => One of the worst I have stayed in  Not recommended Booked double deluxe room in this   star hotel   Very small  Mini bar  amp  snack cupboard empty so a total waste of much needed space  Table for internet use blocked exit from one side of the bed a real safety risk if you needed to go to the loo at night  Cigarette burns in the one very thin blanket on a very cold night  Lovely curtains blocked heat from radiator   if opened allowed anyone to seeinto the room as no blinds Delivery in the street outside at      am lasted around   minutes  amp  sounded like crates being stacked  An unpleasant stay                     Will not visit there again  
N =>   PLEASE do not stay here This hotel was extremely disappointing  I arrived at reception to hear a client complaining about a toilet leaking into his room which made me nervous from the beginning  My room was tiny  barely enough room to put a bag down  The wardrobe was only about   cm deep  so couldn t squeeze much in there either  The shower was also tiny   I couldn t wash my hair without my elbows hitting the shower walls  Fire alarms went off several times a day  Really loud maintenance work was going on all day  TV reception was terrible  They had advertised internet access via an interactive TV  but this was not available  There was one computer in the lounge that could be used  but there was always a queue for this  On the plus side  the room was clean and there was hot water  For the price  there must be better hotels nearby  
N =>  terrible simply terrible I expected a small room but this was ridiculous           I couldn t open my luggage anywhere in the room   There was blood  amp  other human things on bedspread  Fire alarm went off   times while I was there lifts dropped you at whatever floor it felt like  Appeared they were renovating they really need it  Would not recommend this place to anyone  
N => Do not stay here  It s AWFUL  Myself  my wife and two children stayed in this truly dreadul dump for three nights in mid ember       We booked and paid for a room for the four of us  including breakfast  When we arrived in London after our long haul flight from Australia  what did we find  A double bedroom with an old folding sofa bed wedged into it  The room was so small that the four of us and our bags did not physically fit in  After complaining to the manager  who had overdosed on his  supercilious git  pills that morning  he agreed to provide another smaller room  This proved easier than it would seem  because the hotel we were staying at   the Allandale   had been taken over by the Best Western across the street  and was being renovated  Dust was everywhere  the smell was appalling and the second room was little more than a broom cupboard  Breakfast  we thought  would make things better   the famous full English breakfast  Now  we d paid for it  but every morning the breakfast room staff   none of whom seemed to speak English  Okay in Prague or Paris  NOT OK in London   would try to stop us from eating  claiming we  hadn t paid   I would then be off to see the World s Snootiest Manager to  again  and again  point to our receipt with the words  Breakfast included  printed in large letters  Breakfast would not commence for us until we had gone through this little charade  wasting about half an hour each morning Bottom line   This place is an utter dump  Stay in Fawlty Towers before you stay here  Only extensive renovations  some soul searching about room size and the wholesale sacking of everyone from the manager to the cleaner will save this miserable hole  
N =>  very sad don t go there i book the Allandale Hotel after read the reviews from the tripadvisor  I want a warm family like and inexpensive hotel so I choose Allandale When I arrive this Hotel  a notice was post on the door that told me they have change the management to best western  We have book a double room in Allandale Hotel but they give me a twin room in Best western hotel instead  The Staff in best western was cool and not friendly from the receptions to the house keeping staffs  The room was small and have some bad smell  Outside the window was some rubbish  I want told that I want the room in Allandale Hotel  but they are impolite to told to me that our hotel is a three stars hotel and Allandale is just a two star  we are much better than Allandale  But i don t think so  As lease the people are not nice and the room was not good  If you have book the hotel but not pay yet  I recommend that you cancel your booking  If you pay it already you may ask for refund since best western is not as goog as Allandale  A hotel called London Gruds hotel nearby is inexpensive and good fo the price    GBP  you may book this hotel  
N =>   Very Disappointed We booked the Allandale Hotel and paid a deposit  but turned up at the door to find someone who couldn t speak english pointing us across the road to the Best Western Paddington Court We wandered across quite confused expecting some kind of enlightenment when we got there  But we were disappointed to find the lady on reception telling us we were in the wrong hotel  Eventually she consulted her supervisor and we were told that the Best Western had taken over the Allandale and we would be staying in the Paddington Court during our stay On top of that they tried to charge us for the room again  even though we had pre paid  and despite booking a triple room  and being told we would get a triple room when it was ready  we returned to the hotel to find a double room and had to be moved again  We were also told the bags would be taken to our room  but had to move them ourselves after the triple room was sorted out I understand that meging two hotels must create some difficulty  But we were not informed of the take over in advance  and weren t really offered any kind of gesture of apology after our plans were disrupted The experience at BW Paddington Court was not what we were expecting at the independent Allandale  and it spoiled an otherwise enjoyable trip to London  I won t be returning  
N =>  Sopra le aspettative il Paddington Court Hotel  
N =>   decent lodging in london room was very small  yet it was conveniently located close to kensington gardens 
N =>   Recommended good value LOCATION Great location  especially for first timers   short walk to Hyde Park  so quite centrally located   short walk to two Tube stations  therefore access to Cirle  District and Central Line    surrounded by many other hotels  so while you won t really meet any locals  there are a lot of tourist y shops  fast food and late night minimarkets and even a small shopping mall around  which can come in handy   safe neighborhood  at least it felt safe enough to me  a solo woman traveler     gt  ROOMS All together good   old building  which makes it charming in my book  but also showing in creaking floorboards under the carpet  hearing every sound from the hall and   once   old fuses popping out  which was taken care of right away    rooms are a little tired  but overall enjoyable and   most importantly   clean   comfortable beds   clean   and in comparison   new bathrooms with lots of hot water and good water pressure   keys  left at reception upon leaving the hotel   no modern keycards    gt  STAFF Overall good   they were polite enough  but not overly motivated   answered questions and assisted where needed  as seen with other guests    breakfast staff seemed a little overwhelmed but got the job done in the end   cleaning service was good  felt safe enough to leave valuables in the room  tipped them  though     gt  OTHER   small bar  not used    cute little lobby that felt like a living room   computer with internet  for a fee  in the lobby   safety deposit box at front desk free of charge   breakfast not great  but enough to get you started  a breakfast person might want to plan ahead for eating out  CONCLUSION  Would go there again anytime  especially for good value  Got a good price over christmas    nights for approx                for a single ensuite room  which is quite cheap by London standards  Might not be worth the normal rack rates  though  
N =>   Clean room safe area and decent value I checked out a variety of hotels through Trip Advisor and eventually chose this one because a review said it was a safe area  The price was not out of the way either  When I arrived I noticed the hotel s reception was clean and the decor a bit dated  The staff were pleasant   some reviews had mentioned unfriendly and I can understand why  I would say a bit cold rather than unfriendly  They were perfectly pleasant to me  As a solo traveller I expected a bit of discrimination  although solo travellers really shouldn t be discriminated against  and my room was tiny  But I just needed a bed  The shower   toilet room was small but spotless  The room s decor was dated but again the room was clean  I had tea coffee facilities  toiletries  access to a safe  in reception and somewhere to hang my clothes  The hotel was a good budget one for London very near to two great tube stations and Kensington Gardens and I felt safe  Breakfast was fresh  nothing outstanding  I d have no hesitation in recommending this hotel based on my experience  
N =>   Good hotel  Great location in Bayswater near to   metro stops  Bayswater and Queensway   also near to shops  restaurants and Hyde Park  The room was clean and quiet  Staff were fairly courteous  although we wanted to check into our room early since we took the red eye over to London  They had told us over the phone prior to the trip that they could not guarantee anything and when we arrived there we had to wait in the lobby for    minutes  The rate is decent for London and comes with a very nice breakfast  Room was small and basic but came with free wifi  I would stay here again  
N =>   Top value  We were   persons who wanted individual beds  We got room nr XI  on    floor  There were   large comfortable beds  enough space but not spaceous  A small wardrobe  could have been larger  Tiny TV  The bathroom was large enough and modern  and clean  The room was also clean  The staff was friendly  Quiet area but thin walls    min walk from Bayswater Underground    min walk from large shoppingcentre    min from Boots    min from busy street with bars  restaurants etc    min from beginning of Notting Hill area  There were no airconditioning  one elevator  take the stairs on the way down in busy morning hours   Watch your head in the breakfastarea  You really risk banging it if you are tall and not careful  Breakfast was good enough to get the day started  I think it was great  and it doesn t take much for me to be critical  
N =>   Would definitely stay there again  I stayed in this hotel for my UK trip that ended in London last year  and am finally getting around to posting a review   The Ritz it isn t  but I wasn t expecting it to be  and it really was the perfect hotel for everything I needed in London I was a female  mostly solo  traveller  and felt perfectly comfortable using this hotel as my base  though to be fair I wasn t out until the very wee hours   It s right near a busy and bustling street that has everything you need  but just off it which eliminates noise or any other concerns  There are two tube stations within just a few minutes walking distance  which was my mode of transportation outside of my own two feet  which allowed access to everywhere in London  Kensington Park is only a few minutes walk as well  Technically I did walk from the hotel to venues like Harrods and even Buckingham Palace  but unless you have a lot of time and energy you will probably be using public transportation to get to any of the main touristy things The room itself was small  but no more so than any other place I d stayed in Europe  There was plenty of room for the stand to put my luggage on  and to maneouver around it as well  The bed was perfectly clean and comfortable  The bedding etc was older  but not worn or threadbare  The bathroom was a perfectly adequate size  and very well kept  The one downside to the room and the surrounding hallways was the lack of air conditioning  however I had no problems just by using the little fan that they provided and keeping my window open  and I don t tolerate excessive heat for sleeping well   The one thing that was mildly annoying was the bulky keys key chains  however with my large purse it wasn t an issue  I ended up using the available computer in the lobby area most evenings to keep in contact with people back home  One of the internet cafes would have been cheaper  but for the convenience at night it wasn t a bad price  Outside of one evening when a large group was taking turns  there were no issues when I wanted to use it  The small bar was very quiet and sedate even at night  pro or con depending on how you look at it   The staff were fine  though not overly helpful  I wasn t impressed with two of them   however it never detracted from my stay  They were kind enough to store my luggage in their back room the last day as I didn t fly out until later  and it was there and as left when I returned  The breakfast that was included with the site I booked through was adequate  but not memorable Overall  I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel  The one downside was the lack of A C  but never to an extent even in the middle of summer that I had any problems  It was also  relatively  close to the train station  however you certainly couldn t handle it walking with significant luggage   it was convenient walking there for my day trip out of the city  however for taking the Heathrow express from Paddington to the airport I did cave and take a cab there as the metro was simply too much of a hassle with luggage and walking was a little far  
N =>  Basic but comfortable We stayed one night at the Phoenix before taking the Eurostar  We arrived in the evening and immediately had trouble with the staff  The receptionist barely spoke any English and did not think to tell my wife where our room actually was other than  quot you can t take the lift quot   When I returned to enquire I got the directions with an air of contempt from her  The room XIV between the ground and first floors  the bar tender whom we met on the way by contrast was very helpful  The room itself was comfortable and warm  and the bathroom was clean and unusually big for a London hotel  Bizarrely it had   single beds instead of the double we had booked  but the beds were clean and comfortable The next morning the included breakfast was tolerable  but the staff again did not speak English particularly well  
N =>  great inexpensive hotel We booked this hotel as a package through BA  To be honest  I was worried with the rating  We usually do   stars in Europe  We were very happy with the location  Short walk to tube  and very convenient to many restuarants  The room was suprisingly large with a new bathroom and a loft area for my teenage daughter  The staff was over the top helpful    They even included breakfast    
N =>  Good location   good for London Chose this hotel for three reasons  Best Western is an average standard so thought it won t be too bad  price was good  not too cheap  amp  not too dear   amp  finally located near tube stations  handy as our main mode of transport  Upon checkin we received no smiles  no customer service at all  amp  the ladies could barely speak english  The hotel employs alot of Russians  amp  in fact the whole area it was difficult to find anyone actually English but that wasn t a drama for us The hotel was clean and seemed to have all things necessary  amp  was a nice little place  The rooms were not big but hey that s London  They were warm  we had a pleasant view  amp  they were very clean  amp  the beds comfy  Only criticism would be the bathroom which was very small  Shower was half or less than half the size of a standard shower  you were in trouble if you dropped the soap  There wasn t really anywhere of any reasonable size to put a toilet bag or two  amp  towels  On checkout we had a man on reception  amp  he was no friendlier  not even a thank you for staying or anything  The customer service really was what let this place down  amp  can so easily be fixed  It doesn t cost anything for a smile or a hello as people come  amp  go but we got nothing like this  The area was good  lots of shops from the tube to the hotel so one could pick up anything from a salad in a tub to subway  KFC  chinese etc   all prices to suit  Most people in the shops in this area  amp  surrounding areas are foreign  asians  muslims  russians or others  Oh  amp  there is no fridge in the room only tea  amp  coffee  amp  that only got filled up once  
N =>   Horrible  I really only planned to sleep there and nothing else  but even that didn t work  I slept in a single bed room and it was loud outside  Closed window didn t help  The person in the room next to me showered at   am and you could hear everything  The state of the bedroom was disgusting  Bed sheets stank  Bathroom was nice and new  Breakfast was ok  
N =>  Basic all the Way I booked this hotel mainly for the location  It appeared to be very convenient to tube stations  shops etc   and I was not disappointed  The tubes were close enough even for a  quot non walker quot  like me  The choice of restaurants and pubs was extensive  Now to the hotel itself  the best word is  quot basic quot   The single room I had was tiny  even by London standards   and the bathroom was reminiscent of a bathroom on board ship   The carpet looked as though a good cleaning wouldn t hurt   but everything else was clean  I was amazed to discover one face cloth is issued to each guest        but you won t get another one unless you go to the front desk and request one   There is an elevator  but it was out of service one morning which meant walking up and down five floors   not a good prospect four months after knee surgery  The receptionists were very helpful and friendly  The free breakfast was very good  and the cooked breakfast was good though a bit high priced Not a great hotel for a vacation  but if you are planning on being out all day and just need a place to sleep   it s not bad  
N =>   Great After reading reviews of the Best Western Phoenix in London  I was worried about staying here  but when I arrived and checked in  I was pleasantly surprised  The hotel is located really close to the Bayswater Tube station  which made it perfect for getting around town  The hotel staff was friendly  there was cheap internet access  and the included breakfast was pretty good after the other continental breakfasts I was used to having in other European countries  The room was terrific  I was staying with a friend  but we had requested a room with   beds  since there was no extra charge  Instead we were given a room with   beds  which was nice and spacious  again this is in comparison to the tiny hotel rooms we d had in other countries   The room was clean and had a fan  so it didn t get too hot  Overall  I would stay here again if I were in London  
N =>  Bad Bad Bad Do not believe the reviews below  Don t do it  We were scheduled to have a one night stay at the Phoenix on our way back from Paris  and  based on the reviews written here  this looked like a pretty good hotel value  I can tell you it is not  The gory details follow below Upon our Saturday night arrival  we were given a  quot ground floor quot  room  G     if I recall  that  when we opened the door  was notable for three things       the worn       s era  Kansas motel  decor  including a bedspread that was clearly     years old       a wide open window  and     a horrible mildew smell that pervaded the room and made it smell like a crypt  Upon seeing this  we went back to the desk and asked to be switched to the other room  The woman at the front desk appeared irritated and told us there were no other rooms  but  after asking her to see the room roster she had in her hand  she conceded she had one other room  She then led us to another room  this time the  basement  level  that may well have had the same mildew smell but for the acrid smell of cigarette smoke that had leeched into every square inch of the room   Hoping to have us accept the room  she helpfully added  quot it has a flat screen      We told her this was also unacceptable since we had booked non smoking  Although she was clearly irritated  we returned to the front desk and asked to be switched to one of the upstairs rooms  of a guest that had not checked in yet   She begrudgingly relented and pushed a key at us  the hotel does not have modern hotel locks or any modern conveniences   e g  refrigerator  iron  safe  and sent us to the second floor  When we got there  we found the same decor as the previous two rooms  with a tiny TV     quot  max  shoved in the corner of a worn out desk   The TV had a melted lower corner  to boot   A small wardrobe and luggage rack were provided for clothes storage  but the remaining luggage had to end up on the desk  The shower and bathroom were clean  thankfully  but incredibly small  think medium closet size   One interesting feature was that the faucet had no mixing of hot and cold water  both came out of the same faucet as separate streams a few millimeters from each other   For electrics  only one outlet was readily available in the room to plug things in  so we couldn t power up anything other than one at a time  We put our things down  cleaned up for a bit  and went out to meet friends for dinner When we returned  just out of curiosity  I pulled back the bed to see the sheets beneath the bedspread  The first thing I noticed were the multiple      stains on the underside of the spread  including   that appeared to be old blood  The sheets were no better   although the sheets were made  there were hairs  not ours   all over the sheets and pillowcases  making it appear that the bed had been slept in and then made  We called the night clerk  different than the first woman  and he agreed to get us new sheets and pillowcases but insisted on asking us  quot are you sure you didn t sleep in the bed yet  quot        Shortly thereafter  we got the sheets  made the bed by putting the new sheets over the old sheets and the new pillowcases over the old pillowcases  I did not want to see what the mattresses and pillowcases looked like after seeing the underside of the bedspread   and slept a very uncomfortable       hours in a room with no air conditioning The only pros  as I see it  of this hotel are the proximity to the Bayswater tube  about       blocks   free wi fi  you have to get a code from the front desk  and the good  included  continental breakfast  This hotel does not live up to the Best Western standard by any means  and do not be fooled by the name when you book Also  someone here mentioned proximity to Paddington Station  It is not close  so don t book here if you think you can walk to Paddington for Heathrow Express  
N =>   Good Choice This was a good location for my first trip to London  Only a few blocks from the Bayswater Metro Station  Safe area with lots of restaurant choices  The hotel room was small as expected  but very clean and quiet  The free cold breakfast buffet was better than expected in a nice basement breakfast room  Very reasonable price for comfortable accomodations  
N =>   great location   good base for london tourist Great location   very close to tube station  restaurants  shops and bars  Staff friendly enough  amp  we didn t experience any major problems  Breakfast very good   good selection for continental  Room clean  amp  comfy bed  Would agree with reviews about heating   couldn t seem to adjust it at all  We stayed in ruary  amp  although it was quite cold outside  the heat was too much later in the night but this was only a minor problem  Would stay again  
N =>  Returning customer I ve stayed at the Phoenix before  I stayed this time around and I will stay again this   made the booking just before leaving Been to London many times and I was follish enough not to stay in this hotel  Great value for money First time I was there on uary      and my review was  quot There were eight of us sharing   guad rooms for   nights  Due to a missunderstanding  one of the rooms was a triple  Manager offered me a single room to stay for a night untill our second quad was ready  free of charge The single room was small  but in UK terms  larger than I ever seen  I mean  traditionally  english BnBs are beehives  rooms have enough space just to sleep and get changed  This single room was larger than any other room I stayed in London and with a wonderfull view over the park across the street  The quad rooms  were  quot family quot  rooms  two single beds standing aside and two more single beds up   steps with their own TV and window  it was so lovely  Both rooms were spotless  The stuff is unbelievably hellpfull  even with people not speaking english  and they can recommend places to see and eat  their idea of eating at  quot Bella Italia quot  just around the corner  across the tube station was very good  real italian food in reasonable prices  Ask for the  quot espresso menu quot  Breakfast was the classic continental breakfast  coffee  tea  hot chocolate  nuttela  marmalade  slices of bread you can toast  rolls  cheese  ham  flakes  musli  youghurt and fruit  I found it more than satisfying  Location is    well  even if it is your first in London and you are blindfolded  you can t miss it  so close to the tube and bus stops  with supermarkets  pharmacies  clean restaurants from italian to morrocan to greek to indian just a few minutes walk away from it and a shopping center at the corner  I stayed before in the same area  but I was foolish enough not to book in Phoenix the first time   I unquestionably recommend this hotel to anyone  It is so cute and warm  so clean  so wonderfull  it is going to make your stay unforgetable PS  If it is your first in London  concider booking a  quot Classic London quot  tour  This wonderefull service will you can find it in this hotel  a leaflet just by the elevator  
N =>   Noise noise noise    Hmm    how can one describe the noise level  It didn t seem to matter whether the windows were open or shut  We tried both  but the truck deliveries through the night were tiresome  After   days at this hotel  I was ready to check out  It wasn t a bad experience  but it just wasn t a comfortable place to stay more than a night  Also  don t forget that the hotel does not have air conditioning which prevents you from closing the windows  noise  on a hot night  
N =>   Don t listen to the negative comments    Ok  the rooms are small  But staying in London is like staying in NYC  Many people want to stay in this magnificent place so do you really expect large rooms for the price you pay at the Phoenix  I have had a very good stay  check in went without problems  Rooms were very clean and so was the lobby  It smelled like some kind of perfume I couldn t place  Continental breakfast was good  just take as much as you like  Receipt of wireless internet signal in my room was good  it worked all the time I wanted it too  I would definitely stay here again and recommend this hotel to others  
N =>  Stay FAR Away   OK  it s been quite a while since I stayed here     but looking at the pictures brought back the painful memories all too vividly  We booked this hotel through British Air  a   night layover en route to Cairo  It s location  the fact it was accross from a small park  amp  the reasonable rate for London sounded pretty good to us  Standard room    beds  nothing fancy  We were given a room with one double bed    and that was all that would fit into that room  Thank goodness neither one of us is obese  or we wouldn t have fit on the toilet    no joke intended  If you dropped the soap in the shower  it was all over  I lived in our   ft trailer while we were building our home  and our trailer bathroom  amp  shower were bigger than that bathroom  Believe me  I ve travelled far  amp  wide  amp  I wasn t expecting luxury  This was just incredibly bad    I had to crawl over my husband to get out of bed  or climb out the end of the bed  amp  over a table      the door into the room only opened half way because it banged into the  quot closet quot   getting our suitcases into the room was a real treat      no place to put our suitcases except on the bed or in front of the bathroom door  we travel light with    quot  bags   When we asked to be moved  amp  said we had booked a   bed double room  we were told they could move us to a larger room but we would be charged extra  I forget how much it was now  but it was quite hefty   Let s just say the location isn t all that great to suffer through that again    I d definitely beware of this place   
N =>   Good choice at a fair price in Central London Conveniently located close to Bayswater and Queensway tube station  to Kensington Gardens and to Whiteleys Shopping Centre  the hotel is clean and comfy enough to have a good night sleep Plus the included continental breakfast is good Definitely recommended  
N => Don t Know We Got Bumped I chose this hotel because the reviews seemed good and there seemed to be lots of amenities in the area  however  upon arrival we were told that the hotel was over booked  despite us having a reservation for more than a month  and that they were putting us up at a sister property  This seemed to be a normal experience for them so beware The sister property  John Howard  while reasonably nice  was in the middle of nowhere so we spent all of our time trying to get places  If you book at this hotel and they try to bump you to the John Howard and you don t have a car  unless you re a marathon walker  insist that they honor your reservation  
N => Sardines On Toast We arrived at the hotel late evening after booking through Hotels Com earlier that day  to be told there were no rooms available  Having been debited for the      accomodation  cost for two nights  we were less than impressed Seemingly the hotel had not closed off availability and the provider sold the room in good faith  The initial attitude at reception was I have no rooms   end off We were then told of a close by sister hotel but that would be quite a bit more   with Hotels Com unwilling to comit to any subsidy  presumably as it was not their fault  Best Western refused to subsidise the difference  though eventually offered a room descibed as a double yet only used for single occupancy their only concession was free breakfast  Well at   pm tired and desperate to secure a bed we elected to stay Probably a mistake the room offered     was just able to accomodate a queen size bed and there was a large mount of damp evident on the walls The next day we were given room     seemingly standard fare   but this was only marginally bigger and so warm that we sought soft drinks at  am Breakfast was good in terms of food   but the tables so close and so packed it was uncomfortable  All in all despite a further     discount due to my protestations I left the hotel thinking it was quite terrible and not what Best western would be proud of the plus side was location and the bathrooms which were good Downside incompetant   uninterested reception staff   rooms that were a disgrace and a hotel existing only on location  amp  unsuspecting foreign tourists who presumably leave with a very poor impression  Advice stay away and pay a little more  
N =>   Don t expect a health breakfast  We stayed one night and found it to be okay   somewhere to lay our heads  It was a reasonably quiet location  wonderfuly close to   tubes  The breakfast was far too sugary  Tinned fruit is not my idea of a healthy breakfast  The cereals were also      sugar  If you can get a deal on the price all well and good  stay   but if not    look around  
N =>   Value and comfort if you get it at the right price Pros   Very close to both Bayswater and Queensway tube stations Shopping and dining close by  Friendly and efficent staff Larger double bed ent sized room Elevator Shower and bath Nice continental breakfast   good selection  amp  quality Very clean Large towelsCons   Warm room even in ember  Bathroom was a wee bit small  but not horribly so On an active road  so rooms facing the road are a little noisy  but not horrible  Breakfast room is somewhat overcrowded with too many tables   if they lost two tables  it would be far better   One girl on the front desk  when asked about a vegetarian friendly restaurant in the neighborhood  told us she didn t understand vegetarians  During our stay  there was a rather boisterous group of drunken Swedes staying just a couple of doors down from us  Both nights of their revelry we called up the front desk   who then handled the loud partiers quickly and efficently  We were very impressed  We got this hotel through BA Holidays and paid a low rate for the week we stayed  There was no problem checking in with our voucher and we were not given an inferior room because we pre paid  we had room       We d definitely stay here again  particularly with the price we paid  a bit over    GBP a night   
N =>   Great Location   Great Stay We booked this accomodation well in advance after reviews we d read on trip advisor  We were definately not dissapointed  We definately enjoyed a hastle free  realxed stay at the Pheonix  We had booked twin share accomodation and we were very suprised at how spacious the rooms were   after reading reviews we d expected our room to be like a shoebox but it was suprisingly spacious  The rooms were very comfortable  clean and homely  We were very pleased with the location   Kensington Sq Gardens is a very nice  clean area with not much traffic to tend with   we could even leave our windows open without worrying about noise from the street  Queens Way is only a minutes walk around the corner with has pretty much everything a hotel guest would need   including the Bayswater tube station  It was a very convenient launching pad for exploring the city We found the sitting areas downstairs very nice   a nice little bar that was a little pricey but what can you expect   The lobby was nicely done and the breakfast room was great   not to mention the breakfast  Staff were also very friendly and helpful   we didn t come across one person at all that displeased us All in all we were extremely pleased with our stay at the Pheonix  We would definately reccomend it to anybody travelling to London  and of course would stay there again ourselves on our next holiday to the UK  
N =>   A bumpy start but things improved My fiancee and I stayed at the Phoenix from tember       We requested a non smoking  double room  only to find out upon arrival that we had a smoking room with two single beds   in the basement  you couldn t even use the sink because it had a glass shelf covering most of it     doesn t make washing your face very easy    They were completely booked the first night but promised to move us to a different room the next day  They did as they promised and we were moved up to the second floor the next day  a big improvment   The only problem we encountered during our stay after that was on the third night when we got back to our hotel room to find a note in the shower saying that we could not use it  We inquired with reception and they said the problem would be fixed the next day  When we got back the next afternoon  all of the rooms had signs on them saying  quot do not use  chlorination in effect quot   Again  we inquired with reception and they said that it would be safe to use the water in about half an hour but they would notify us  About    minutes later  we REALLY needed to shower at this point   we decided to just go ahead and use the water  It appeared fine and luckily we took the initiative because the staff at the hotel never notified us Overall  we found the hotel decent for London standards but it was nothing special  The staff at the front desk were not overly friendly or helpful but they did their jobs so we had no complaints  The continental breakfast in the morning is very basic but it provides everything you need to keep you going until lunch  It s a no frills hotel but it was clean and decent Toronto  Ontario  Canada 
N =>  Great hotel but got ripped off by their cab company We stayed at the Phoenix from ust               and thought that it was excellent value for money  The  quot continental quot  breakfast was buffet style and allowed us to start the day with a full stomach  The area is safe and there are lots of Internet cafes around should you choose to leave your computer at home but need to check your e mail  don t use the hotel s computer   there are many cheaper options just down the street near Bayswater station  Here is our only complaint Our plane was leaving on Sunday morning and we had to be at Gatwick by      am due to all of the extra security at check in  The subway starts late on Sundays  so we had to get a taxi to Victoria to get a train to Gatwick  We asked the people on desk if we could order a taxi in the morning but they suggested that it be ordered on Saturday night  When the cab showed up on Sunday morning  it was a minicab and the driver charged      When we questioned the fare  the driver said  quot Victoria Station is not that close  quot  Victoria station is in fact     miles or     kilometres from the hotel  To give you an idea of a realistic fare  a black cab would have cost less than        Mini cabs are supposed to be cheaper than black cabs It s really unfortunate that the hotel chose to phone a company that would rip off their guests because it was our last experience related to the hotel and it left us with a sick  disappointed feeling I suggest that if you need a cab  you just go out into street near Bayswater station and not rely on the hotel  
N =>  Nice hotel Nice hotel    close to the Tube and buses    staff very helpful   close to mall  shops  Hyde Park  Wonderful breakfast  small but nice rooms  Not much to watch on the TV  Overall experience was great  Would go back again  
N =>  A good value hotel Just returned after   nights at the Phoenix  The room was good and a little bigger than I had expected after reading other reviews before we went  Bathroom was also fine and both were very clean and tidy  Comfortable beds with sheets changed after two nights  Situation of hotel was not as quiet as I had expected  with some late night revellers outside on two nights and early morning traffic  I m very glad I had my earplugs with me  It was very hot during our stay  up to    deg  so the absence of air conditioning was a major disadvantage especially at night  A small fridge in the room would also have been lovely  We had booked our stay via the internet to include English breakfast but found on arrival that it only included continental breakfast  English breakfast would have been       extra per person  As the weather was so hot  hovever  we were happy with the continental breakfast  It was fine apart from the final morning when the hotel appeared to run out of bread for making toast  The dining room was a little cramped  Overall  fairly good value  Would stay again  but not in summer  
N =>  Prix Qualite Rapport Location in a leafy Garden Kensington Park Gardens  see aerial photos available Google Two minutes walk from what was Whiteleys Store   once the most exclusive store in London   Now a shopping Mall with an array of shops Five minutes from Kensington Palace Gardens  amp  Hyde ParkBuilding  About   houses built around mid nineteen century respectfully converted into hotel about   o   roomsBreakfast   supplied pleasant dining roomOn a food budget  Several food places in Mall supplying food Scores of restaurants to satisfy almost ever conceivable taste  amp  most Budgets within walking distance Staff courteous  amp  efficient  Rooms perhaps by some standards are not big but adequate for me particularly in view of price  Would I stay here again Yes  Recommend this hotel to friends  yes   unquestionably  Particularly those who do like to be nearGardens as distinct from corporate crash pad hotels situated on top of Railway stations   amp  other unfortunate locations 
N => Better spare your money We spent a day and a half in London  and we stayed at the Best Western Phoenix hotel The fact is that this was not a   star hotel as easyjet and hotelopia claimed it to be I even wonder why Best Western chose this building to be a member of their family The space given to us as a double room was exactly the size of an almost double bed  You open the door and actually step on the bed  there was no more available space even to stand and get dressed The restaurant was down at the lower basement with some windows protected by iron bars and we had to wait for almost half an hour in the queue in order to be seated and have breakfast  if someone can call breakfast the poorest buffet i ve ever seen We certainly felt like prisoners going from the cell    so called room  to the dinning area    so called restaurant  to have our portion of bread and water    so called breakfast  The floor was covered by wall to wall carpeting and was squeaking on every step giving the impression that on any minute you were going to fall in some hole covered by the carpeting  Not to mention the odour in the corridors and the room Ok the location was good  near the underground  peaceful neighbourhood and we had room service and clean towels every day but thats it  As a conclusion i don t recommend it  didn t deserve the money spent  Definitelly won t go there again and you shouldn t too if you respect yourself  
N =>  Will go back There were eight of us sharing   guad rooms for   nights  Due to a missunderstanding  one of the rooms was a triple  Manager offered me a single room to stay for a night untill our second quad was ready  free of charge  The single room was small  but in UK terms  larger than I ever seen  I mean  traditionally  english BnBs are beehives  rooms have enough space just to sleep and get changed  This single room was larger than any other room I stayed in London and with a wonderfull view over the park across the street  The quad rooms  were  quot family quot  rooms  two single beds standing aside and two more single beds up   steps with their own TV and window  it was so lovely  Both rooms were spotless  The stuff is unbelievably hellpfull  even with people not speaking english  and they can recommend places to see and eat  their idea of eating at  quot Bella Italia quot  just around the corner  across the tube station was very good  real italian food in reasonable prices  Ask for the  quot espresso menu quot   Breakfast was the classic continental breakfast  coffee  tea  hot chocolate  nuttela  marmalade  slices of bread you can toast  rolls  cheese  ham  flakes  musli  youghurt and fruit  I found it more than satisfying  Location is    well  even if it is your first in London and you are blindfolded  you can t miss it  so close to the tube and bus stops  with supermarkets  pharmacies  clean restaurants from italian to morrocan to greek to indian just a few minutes walk away from it and a shopping center at the corner  I stayed before in the same area  but I was foolish enough not to book in Phoenix the first time    I unquestionably recommend this hotel to anyone  It is so cute and warm  so clean  so wonderfull  it is going to make your stay unforgetable  PS  If it is your first in London  concider booking a  quot Classic London quot  tour  This wonderefull service will you can find it in this hotel  a leaflet just by the elevator  or at      
N => Not Good at all       We stayed in   rooms here in ember  The good news first  The location is awesome  very close to the Tube and a lively neighborhood just a block away  Other reviews have it well chronicled here  The free breakfast buffet is adequate  but very boring after a couple of days  The pub  lounge is good  comfortable  affordable  and friendly  They offered complementary snacks during happy hour  which was nice The bad news  They really messed up the reservation and gave us the wrong room  so we had to move the next morning  They charge absolutely criminal rates on phone calls     pound for a    second call to an     number   We were using several kinds of     number phone cards  and had to pay an additional      in calls when checking out  They charge a very high price for internet access in the public lobby        for    minutes is not a good deal  They claim to have  quot satellite TV quot   but the TV s in both rooms only received   channels each  while the TV in the pub got several hundred channels They claim to have  quot concierge quot  service  what a joke  All of the deskstaff was cold  pompous  and unfriendly  The maid service was lousy  they only emptied the trash cans  ignoring used coffee dishes  empty bottles  etc  They didn t replace coffee cups  spoons  etc  they let trash pile up for days  The heaters in the rooms were very hot and couldn t be turned off for some reason  We were forced to constantly have the windows open  in   to keep from sweating The shower water was scalding if you weren t very careful with the controls  I think the value for this hotel was decent  but don t expect too much  and you will be happy here  
N => I will come back to The Phoenix We have just returned for   days at Phoenix  We were   people in   rooms All has been good  clean and nice rooms  quite small but quiet Full breakfast included with the room price  with good cereals  cheese  jam  rolls  It has been more than expected  Perfect hotel for a visit to London stay  Definitivelly I can recomend Phoenix to every body that looks for a good price Hotel in London  
N =>  Disappointment We selected this hotel based on the reviews from Trip Advisor  I have to say we were very disappointed  We are American Expatriates living in England so we have stayed in a number of hotels during our many travels around the UK and Europe  This one ranks close to the bottom  The room was very small  but not as small as the bathroom  We were only staying for one night as we were flying out of Heathrow the next morning  Had we been staying longer  I would have seriously considered moving to another hotel  The location was good as it was very close to the tube station  I wouldn t stay again  
N =>  Great location very clean and cozy We ve just returned from England and Ireland and stayed for   nights in the BW Phoenix  We were very pleased with our room and the hotel in general  It looked as though it may have been recently remodeled  Our room was on the small side  but not a problem since we were usually only there to sleep  The breakfast every morning was great  We never ventured out to sight see hungry  We would definitely stay there again   the Tube station was less than a block away  
N =>  Great location small but clean Stayed at this hotel for   week      y       Booked it based on comments from travel advisor and was not disappointed  The room was small  I expected that  but clean  plenty of hot water  great water pressure  clean linens  great bath towels and a fantastic location  Close to two tube stations  Kensington Gardens  Hyde Park and Notting Hill  Plenty of restuarants  pubs  cafes  and shops  The continental breakfast  included in room rate  was totally satisfying to us as we re not big breakfast eaters  Four different kinds of cold cereal  rolls  bread  croissants  ham  cheese  yogurt  juice  and canned fruit salad  No air conditioning  however the evenings were cool and comfortable  I d think twice about staying here in ust  though  Overall  a great place to stay  
N => I thought it would be great     I had never booked a hotel over seas before and did my research pretty good  My travel partner left it up to me and she said that she wanted to be in a certain area  So as I narrowed it down I settled on the Phoenix hotel  The location was good  near Bayswater and one other tube  the food in the area is good but the hotel itself was smaller than I expected  the beds were hard and the sheets looked really old  The bathroom was tiny but ok  but the water pressure was horrible  I had to move back and forth to rinse my hair out properly  The breakfast was the same everyday and became dull quickly  The witnessed some of the staff being rude to other guests and that was a put off  Also every day when it was time to go back to my room after breakfast the lift did not want to work and we had to huff it up the stairs to our room  It seems that the lift did not take kindly to being used so much at one time  and this happened every day  So any one who has a hard time with stairs do not stay there  
N =>  Wish we hadn t bothered  We booked in for two nights  London athon weekend  As soon as we got there the receptionist tried to tell me they were fully booked and they were moving us to a sister hotel the other side of Hyde Park  I argued because we had booked this hotel three months previous so we were going nowhere  They got their own back by putting us in the smallest boxroom they had in the basement with only one plug that worked the small tv  so to use any other electrical appliance we had to unplug that  The shower flooded the bathroom to at least an inch of water  The wall clock didnt work  The kettle was hidden in the wardrobe because the room was too small to leave it out anywhere  The french window opened onto a whitewashed wall and the foreigners in the next room were arguing at  am   All in all  it was crap  We wish we had let them move us but we had family staying in Hilton Hyde Park thats why we booked the Phoenix because it was near to them  My partner had to leave early on the Sunday morning to get to athon start and they didnt even offer an early breakfast  we had to buy breakfast in a local shop  I wouldnt recommend this hotel to anyone  it may be cheap by London standards but it was still      wasted on one breakfast and two nights in a dingy  noisy boxroom  
N =>  No complaint but no recommendation either    I ve stayed at this hotel just for a night  It was very  very convenient location with lots of restaurants and shops around  And I didn t feel uncomfortable walking by myself in the night Breakfast was OK but can be improved as some cold meat and cheese I had were poor quality  Room was very tiny   specially the wash basin was so tiny that I had to use the shower to wash my face    but at least it was clean  
N =>  Conveniently located  
N =>  Ottima sistemazione per Londra   
N =>   The worst   star hotel we have ever stayed in   bad bad bad     We have tried   tested this hotel twice   giving it a second chance    the first stay was bad  the second stay was a catastrophy in terms of the quality of the room  the double bed barely fitted the size of the room   elevator broken  no water in the room   pipe problem   thin walls   tv sound from the other rooms  spitting sounds and various toilet sounds  etc     We have tried   rooms in this hotel  all have various  most unpleasant problems  The hotel was very cheaply renovated   street noise  water leakages  some rooms and corridors are overheated others freezing   Whatever category you book    the rooms are all the same  There is a difference in size of a few square feet   deluxe is definitely not deluxe  Rooms  bathrooms  bed covers and corridors are dirty  Staff is unfriendly  discourteous  not trained for the hospitality industry  Do not stay there   The management knows about the shortfalls   hence they try to attract the unaware traveller with what seems to be an attractive special offer  No refunds  not even excuses   Be warned   this is NOT A FOUR STAR HOTEL but a very poor quality   Star Hotel  
N =>   Not quite what it says on the tin Location for theatre land was excellent I arrived at a quiet time to check in and the receptionist couldn t find my reservation  I had misplaced my slip of paper with the confirmation number on  which would have helped  However  the receptionist answered the phone on a couple of occasions whilst looking for my booking  I did eventually find my confirmation number  After about    mins a male member of staff arrived to look at my booking  He and the female receptionist started talking to each other in a foreign language  which I thought was quite rude  When I asked if there was a problem  the male member of staff said no  After about    mins I was eventually given a room number and key  The friendly female member of staff advised me of the free mini bar in my booking  Club Room  and the free fruit  The room was nice  bit warm  and the bathroom was good and clean and well supplied with toiletries  However  there was no fruit in the room so when I left the hotel  I advised the receptionist and she said they were just about to put some in my room On arriving back at my room with my companion the fruit was in the room  My companion used the bath towel after showering  On the bed was a letter welcoming us to the hotel and advising us of the following Free mini bar   yesFree fruit   eventually yesTurn down service with chocolates   noReplenish any used towels   noBathrobes and slippers   noFlowers in the room   noBreakfast was good but coffee was cold and not replenished and there was an unpleasant smell on the corridor as you walked through to the breakfast room All in all  it wasn t an unpleasant experience but we felt that they did not deliver what they had promised  
N =>   is it a scam Booked in to the hotel and arrived only to be told there was building works taking place    for a hotel that was only renovated three years ago seemed strange  relocated to Radison  although hotel was nice  quot small rooms quot  the rates here were much cheaper  however the rate charged did not reflect this  makes you wonder if they book you and move you to make money  be wary  
N =>   The worst Western The best Western hotel that is a joke  We arrived at the hotel we we had booked a deluxe double  we were taken around a back street to another hotel which they claimed was part of their hotel  We were given the key to our room after climbing hundreds of steps we entered into this very small dindgy dark clamy room  We looked around the room and thought this is a nightmare  I pulled back the sheets to assess them AHHHGGGH it was disgusting i discovered that there were hairs and huge brown staines on the sheets  We immedietley called and asked to speak to management  They came and apologised for this and offered us an upgrade  We decided to take a look at the other room  The other room was quite large but it was in the basement   It was was satisfactory  but i went to open the windows and to my horror the all windows were cemented shut the only route out of the basement room was through door we came in   Every ten minutes we heard a loud rumbling noise above us  I m not sure if this was the laundary shoot or the rickety old lift  It was disturbing  This was a really terrible hotel we couldnt believe this hotel was graded four star it was horrendous  
N =>   great bathroom Only just joined site so thought would tell of fav places over last few yearsWe stayed here for my partners birthday as a hotel theatre package  Its very close to everything  our fav part was the t v in the bathroom wall its a small detail but made a big difference The breakfast was served very well and tasted great  a very pleasent stay only critisism was they billed me twice for the room but was rectified quickly  
N =>   Bed Bugs  Do Not Stay At This Hotel    The hotel was terrible    I saw bed bugs in my bed during my staying at the Best Western Shaftesbury Paddington Court  The bugs bit me a lot and I had a bad rash in my body  I have been feeling very ichey since the rash came out  I asked a receptionist to change the room but they insisted my rash come from food allergy  They did not change my room  I checked out and saw a doctor at London  The doctor said it was ovious that the insects bit me and my symptom was not from allergy  He said I should have asked the hotel to change the room  Actually I did  But the receptionist ignored and denied    Everytime I see the rash over my body  I feel angry at the unclean bed and the unkind services of the hotel  The doctor said it may take one year for the mark of the rash to disappear  Also  I saw a doctor and it cost me     pounds  In addition  the doctor advised me to wash all things which I kept in the room  because the insects might be in them  So  I had to do dry cleaning my coat  gloves  muffler  bags  boots  etc  It costs a lot  as well  I made a phone call to talk this with a manager of the hotel  but they said manager was in the meeting and I can send an e mail  instead  I have sent two e mails to the manager already  but no answer yet  Therefore  I think nobody should stay at the hotel  It is the worst hotel I have ever seen  
N =>  Give it a miss My husband and I stayed at this hotel following a business trip in London and decided to have a weekend break from the kids  Firstly  we had to pay for the room on arrival  when usually you pay when you leave  The full amount was paid and then they asked for     to hold in case we had any extras  This we agreed to  but the next day discovered that a further     was missing from our account  The hotel denied they had taken this money  even though the bank was telling me they had  After more than a week of being      short in my bank the money was eventually credited back into my account  I was told at the time it would take     days for the      After complaining both to the hotel and Head Office about the missing money I received no response and had to call again  This time I was told it was company policy to take more money  On top of all this the room was tiny  had no facecloths or shampoos and credits itself on being   star  I don t think so  I will never book a Best Western Hotel again  
N =>   Awful Hotel Both myself and husband stayed at the Shaftsbury last weekend  on arrival we where asked to pay in advance  only one receptionist on thedesk  my card wouldn t work in the machine  knowing I had the funds available  however she was very rude when I asked her to try the other machine   which went through fine she did not apologise at all  another gentleman waiting to check in asked to see the manager or another member of staff to check him in who apparently where not available  Although arriving at      for check in the room still was not ready and we had to wait in the small reception  The hotel as a whole was in poor repair  the rooms small and not clean  The rooms where very hot and hallways dirty  maids leaving used sheets and bin bags on landings  Overall we found this hotel not to be up to the usual    Best Western standard and certainly would not have paid the      for our room as advertised on the front desk  The only positive is the location  whichis fabulous although you are probably better off staying in the TravelInn round the corner  
N =>   Overall Good Value For Money Room was clean but tiny  the air conditioning did work  thank heavens but considering it s location we think that the hotel was good value for money 
N =>   Rude Reception   Lovely Room We stayed at this hotel Saturday   th emeber  We parked in China Carpark which is literally across the road  It cost     for    hours which isn t bad in London  When we got to reception i thought it was all down here from then     The receptionist rudley told us that they were over booked and that there was only   room available  I explained i had pre booked this room for me and my partner weeks ago  That did t seem to matter to her  She told us the room never had a window but could we look at it anyway  So we looked at it  and thats all we did  It was horrendous  When opening the door it scuffed along side the double bed  the room was TINY  We went back to reception and told her no way  All of a sudden we had a room availble which we should of had in the first place  No apology was made  nothing to say about the room  no enjoy your stay   we were very let down by reception  What annoyed us more was that other couiples were coming in  over   s  were in our   s  and they never offerred the room to them  On the way to our room we saw the concierge who told us that they were overbooked and were trying to get someone in that room  obviously which ever poor bugger was last booking in would have that room  What a disgrace  Anyway when we got to our room  this is   mins later  it was lovely  Really modern which a lovely comfy bed  It was great we had a fridge cos if they think we were drinking there wine at       for a small bottle    glass   we went to over the road to the shop and bought a normal size bottle for        A can of coke they were charging          Thats just ridiculous  The bathroom was great and we loved the tv in the tiles where u could have any channel on  Our room faced out in to the side street and u can here the traffic and police sirens when ur windows open but with it shut we couldn t here a thing  And anyway to me hearing the hustle and bustle of London is what its all about  Plus we were too drunk to hear anything when we got back to the hotel anywayl   We never used any of the facilities at the hotel so cant comment on that  The room is spacious with a lovely warm feel to it  You get to check out it midday which is a bonus seens as most hotels are   am  The location is excellent  ur in the right place to head off anywhere you need  We booked through        and paid      for the night  Dont book directly through the hotel as its about      dearer and ur be paying over the odds Overall we had a fab time  the location  hotel  everything was brilliant  Its just a shame we had such a frosty reception to begin with  but i would recommend u to stay there   just try and get booked in early to save getting put in the dungeon room   
N => Awful  Only good if you re an insomniac   My companion and I were forced to stay at this hotel  when the Shaftesbury Kensington overbooked our room and transferred us On the whole  our stay at this establishment was unpleasant from start to finish On arrival there was no one to carry our bags  and the chap on reception was incredibly rude  We thankfully found the room to be spotless  and well ventilated  However  the windows were not double glazed  despite the hotel being located on a very busy main road  which is exceptionally noisy   especially at night when sirens  late night drinkers and car horns can be heard well in to the early hours  Having gone to bed by      pm due to an early start in the morning  by  am we were still awake  and I was forced to go down to reception and request a change of room Thankfully  the two young men on night reception were far more polite than their earlier colleague   openly admitting that they often received many complaints about the noise     and a new room was arranged  However  just as we left the room to move to the new one  reception called to say they had made a mistake and asked me to come down to see them again to change keys for yet another room  This was only a double for that night   which was   floors above the first one  and not much better noise wise   and we had to change again the following day No apologies were made to us by the hotel for the inconvenience caused  If this were a  cheap  hotel I would have less cause for complaint  However  this is apparently a   star hotel  with very high prices to boot  and I am sure I am not alone in expecting value for money from such an establishment  I am confident that  party people  would love this hotel  However  depsite the good location for shows  shopping  etc  I would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone who likes to receive good customer service  or indeed values their beauty sleep   As you are unlikely to get either from this establishment I travel a lot  and stay in London often  but I will NEVER stay at this hotel again  I strongly advise fellow travellers to look elsewhere for their accomodation   
N => One to avoid I was disappointed when I stayed at this hotel  The double room I had was quite small and the TV Internet did not work properly  I returned to reception and was allocated anther room where the TV Internet did work  but be warned  Although the hotel does offer free broadband Internet access as advertised the screen resolution size is fixed at a ridicuously large size  which makes navigating for such purposes as internet banking impossible  When I rang reception to ask if the resolution size could be changed I was told it couldn t be Add the less than friendly staff to the picture and I d say you are best advised to try elsewhere  
N =>  Better than expected I was concerned by recent bad reviews and would not have booked this hotel had I read them first  I nearly cancelled actually but I am glad I didn t Good points   excellent room  fair size and well equipped with everything working  Clean  comfy bed and good bed linen  Breakfast was very good in a small  bright  airy room  Bad points  Reception area is very plastic  I had to wait quite a long time to check in as two receptionists dealt with a group of four The hotel is brilliantly positioned in the theatre district close to Soho and Covent Garden  Tips   book a junior suite and phone to tell them you may be late as I think there were people being moved on  
N =>  A dirty unfriendly dump  We were sent to the Shaftsbury by the Best Western Paddington Court hotel  The only good thing was our cab was paid for and supposedly we were  quot upgraded quot  at no charge The Shaftsbury is okay if you don t mind filth  torn carpeting  dirty banisters and dark hallways  Urine on the bathroom floor  televisions dangling out of the wall  Sticky  dark  unknown substances staining surfaces and broken coffee machines  If you are the adventureous type and the possibility of catching a disease from unclean surfaces  the Shaftsbury is your place to stay in London It was awful  I would not recommend this place to an animal  
N =>  A real dump    what a mess  We attempted to stay at Padding Court hotel where we made reservations back in the spring but we  as I see others were  shuffled off to the Shaftsbury where we really got the shaft  We did not get to the hotel until late in the evening after the restaurant was closed  The entire evening was wasted driving around due to a  quot problem with the rooms  quot What a dump  I have pictures to prove it  There was dried   crystalized yellowish blotches that weren t in the tile pattern  urine on the bathroom floor  the TV was knocked out of the wall and hanging by wires  the carpets were torn  We had a basement room down a long dark hallway and had to walk   flights of stairs with our luggage to get there without assistance  One does not want to use the banister at the Shaftsbury because it was covered in crud and dirt Don t book at the Best Western Padding or the Shaftsbury  These are awful hotels  
N => Great Location but no attention to detail Have just returned from spending a night at the Best Western Shaftesbury in London  Location wise it was great  between Piccadilly  amp  Leicester Square and within easy walking distance of Covent Garden  Oxford Street and Trafalgar Square  The hotel was advertised as having just been modernised and updated which was very true  the rooms being very modern and  quot designed quot   Trouble was I think they paid more attention to the design than the practicalities  Every surface already had stuff on it   the desk had a tray with kettle  cups coffee etc  but the lead was too short to reach the socket  The cups were very nice but too small to use a whole coffee sachet unless you like rocket fuel  The bathroom was tiny with no room to put any of your own toiletries though it did have a TV     The hair drier would not reach a socket anywhere near a mirror  We booked a junior suite which was basically a room with a settee in it  The bed was two singles pushed together with an uncomfortable join in the middle  As our room was on a corner it was very noisy which I suppose is really to be expected on a busy main road  If you want a quiet location this is not the one  I expected more from this hotel to be honest especially at the price as its not cheap   ranging from           a night  It did for our needs as we were only there for one night and had a busy schedule of theatre  exhibitions and sightseeing but for any longer you would not have room to move      
N =>    As Well Buy a Lottery Ticket BEWARE  I can t write a review of the actual hotel as I ve never managed to stay there  Twice now I ve booked and when I ve arrived I ve been moved to another hotel  The first time the excuse was computer problems and the second   quot Health and Safety quot   What rubbish  On each occasion  despite my vocal protestations  I was moved to far inferior hotels  and not as central  I work in London two or three days a week and frequently stay over so I know the hotels well and this has NEVER happened to me with any other hotel If you don t mind where you stay then try an  quot Allocated on Arrival quot  deal and save a lot of money  because that s what booking at the Shaftesbury Hotel seems to amount to in my experience  Their customer service is an absolute disgrace in this day and age  
N => Shaftesbury Hotel is a nightmare Our stay at the Shaftesbury Hotel was easily the worst hotel experience my partner and I have ever had in Europe  Our room  considered a Premium room  was small but that was really was not an issue for us  What s at issue is the how this hotel is mismanaged  The woman we dealt with at the front desk was sullen  cold and unfriendly at both check in and check out  Regular room service had been discontinued due to remodeling  which is understandable  but there was no mention of it at any time prior to check in nor any notice on their website  Three light fixtures in the room didn t work during our stay  only one was fixed after speaking with the front desk   Our room was boiling hot  and I do mean boiling  day and night with the radiator always turned off  We were told at the front desk to turn on the air conditioner but couldn t because the only way to do so was via a remote control device that was missing from the room  Several other items like an alarm clock advertised as to be available in the room were not  But the best of all was the noise coming from the hallways and neighboring rooms  and when guests doors were closed  they ALL slammed shut so loud it was as if a rifle were being discharged next to your head  One morning at about   AM we awoke to the sound of crinkling plastic wrap coming from the hallway that lasted for more than two hours  To our amazement  the housekeeping staff had turned the ENTIRE  nd floor hallway into a linen closet  individually wrapping hundreds of towels and bed linens in clear plastic bags that stacked almost to the ceiling  This wall of linen remained in place all week  Oh  and the Welcome plate of fruit that you get on arrival  it s really ugly  There are other hotels in Soho  save yourself the aggravation and stay clear of this place  
N => Clean and great location I stayed here for two nights in a triple room a few weeks back  We got a good deal online  though the reception staff were going to charge us again for the room  even though we d already paid online   The rooms were very clean  yet did not have many of the facilities as stated online  There were no cd players in rooms  and no internet   one of the main reasons we chose to stay there  They did however let us use a computer in the basement area  The manager was very helpful and friendly to us  she could not have done more  The things I didn t like were the tiny lifts and corridors   the lifts were very hard to use when you have a few pieces if luggage  I would stay here again however  
N =>  Great Hotel Location and Staff The room was about the same size of any NYC hotel room  if not a little larger  Try to get a room off of Shaftesbury Ave side   it is a little noisey  Rooms and bathrooms very clean  staff was very helpful  and we were close to everything  We will stay here again and recommend to others  Thank you Shaftesbury Hotel  
N => Just terrible   stay away from that place  
N =>   Muy recomendable OJO AL RESERVAR NO CONFUNDIR CON EL DE KENSINGTON  
N =>   Good value for the price paid The hotel structure is a bit odd  but not unpleasant  The room we got       was a family room for   people  so it was huge   a very pleasant surprise  Even tough we ordered a superior room  it was much more than we accepted  The continental breakfast was a pure and the variety of the food served was very little  but it was sufficient  The hotel staff was very correct but not too friendly  The location is excellent   the tube is not more than a     meters away and all the good of Finchley road  shops  fast foods  restaurants  shopping center with multiplex cinema  supermarkets and much more  is at a few minutes walk  All in all we had a very nice stay at this hotel and we ll definitely come back again in future visits to London  
N =>   nice hotel   nice price   shame I was locked out It s not luxury but good for the     per night paid  Room large and clean  quaintly decorated  Finding way around hotel difficult  very higgledy piggledy small corridors and tiny lift  Close to tube in a lovely quiet  safe area Paid for cheap advance reservation but despite saying in confirmation email that they charge the card immediately they didn t with me  What happened is that me and hubby checked in  went to our gig  came back just after midnight and our card wouldn t open our bedroom door  Went down to reception  waited    minutes until the only member of staff had served customers at the bar  explained our problem and was abruptly told the reason we d been locked out was that my credit card had been refused when they tried to take payment  I was surprised because thought I had paid before arriving and card had lots in the account  I was tired and just wanted a bed so I didn t argue and I insisted on trying the card again and low and behold it cleared no problem  Got to bed by about  am but next morning had to phone my bank to check I hadn t paid twice  I hadn t   Make of this review what you will  It s a nice hotel for the money  but is the potential hassle worth it    Oh yeah there is free wifi  ask for the code at reception   I think they change the code each morning though so if you get the code in the evening then want to check something on the internet when you get up in the morning  it doesn t work  signal wasn t great in our room either  
N =>   Don t go there Surly reception staff on our arrival  triumphantly telling us  without checking  that the car park was full  very tired bedroom  wallpaper damaged  etc    walls in lift badly defaced and simply left that way  rabbit warren like access to rooms  the list just goes on  Also   no fault of the hotel  very difficult to locate and access by car and  as above  no daytime parking  Finally  when you find the breakfast room in the basement you re told you need to go back to reception to get a voucher for breakfast          An unpleasant experience  
N =>  Average It s not the best hotel of my life  but it s not the worst It s not close to city center  but conveniently close to Swiss cottage Station  gray line   if you wanna experience a  quot  Londoner neighborhood  it s a good experience Rooms  small  old furniture  but clean and a renovated bathroom  although the time we spent there  there was a leaking on the toilet   such a waste of water and they didn t fixed it   Breakfast  we didn t find anything close  they have a average  good continental bkf  and you can pay a bit more to have eggs  bacon and beans  I think  Service  we were well treated  Free Internet  I would prefer to pay to have one   doesn  t work If your budget is around USD      stay in this place  You gonna have a quiet room  a clean bathroom only for you and close to a subway station  
N =>   lots of in room noise slept badly lots of in room noise  woke up in the night with laughter and banging from above at        was i below staff accommodation  not just a bit of noise  a lot of noise  i just wanted to sleep  if you are going to advertise a    room at      per night  without discount   you can t have rooms like this  i pay to be able to rest  nice room  nice furniture  old world style  perfectly pleasant staff at reception  great location near the tube  shame i mainly wanted a good night s sleep  
N =>   Horrible stay  The hotel looks great on the website  but only the lobby area has been refurbished  As I made my way upstairs  I started noticing how old everything looked  and when I opened my room door  I was so dissapointed  extremely old  kettle had mildew in it  everything felt dirty  heating wasnt powerful and the shower was only lukewarm  Breakfast is totally not worth it either  Whilst the location was great  I would not stay there again   really a bad experience  
N =>   Not bad for the price I got this hotel for a cheap rate on hotwire      including taxes and fees   I was a little disappointed to find it was in Swiss Cottage  but it s almost next to the Underground making it really handy for central London  My room was large  by London standards  with a full bath  as opposed to shower  and tea and coffee making facilities  The staff was helpful but kept a low profile  I didn t eat here so can t comment on breakfast  There was a sign in the room saying that internet was available  presumably at a price  but I checked in and was going straight out again so didn t need to investigate this The local area has a few shops and eating places  though I struggled to find a coffee before   a m  but the tube is so handy that you can be in the centre quickly and if you re feeling energetic you can walk there across Regents Park which is close by I d stay here again for a trip of     nights  
N =>  Good value and convenient We had hoped to stay at a Best Western west end hotel using Nectar Points but were told when we tried to book through Nectar in ober that it was  quot too near Christmas quot  to be able to use them  Instead we were offered a superior double room deal at the Swiss Cottage Hotel and I requested a quiet room  The room we were initially offered was in the basement  reeked of cigarette smoke and was facing on to the road  Somewhat reluctantly we were then shown a quiet  non smoking second floor room which was comfortable with a good sized bathroom  including a bath  It was in good decorative order and everything worked Breakfast was adequate but the cooked breakfast was virtually cold  The hotel was being redecorated while we were there but this was well contained and did not affect us in any way Staff were polite but not over friendly  We would stay there again  It offered good value for money for London  it s near the Tube  which wasn t working the weekend we were there  but the replacement bus service was very good  and it s in a pleasant area not too far away from the west end  
N =>  Felt like granma s house The place was average  It had a very old timey feel to it  I felt like I was entering a retirement home or something  The room was clean  I enjoyed the little tea coffee they had set up for us and the bathroom was very spacious  I listened to my instincts and decided not to have breakfast there  I m glad I didn t This hotel is located in a residential area  Its   min walk to the subway  The staff was friendly and very helpful I guess I would stay here again   when I m     
N =>  Terrible I don t know where to start with this but don t stay here Filthy rooms and the bedding was changed twiceThreadbare TowelsPaint and paper peeling off wallsHairs in the bedHairs in the showerBoxes outside the windowsRotten window framesDoor didn t close properlyHad to check out at   pm and move to another hotel as it was so awfulFind somewhere else at all times 
N =>   Good location Found the hotel easily  Swiss Cottage tube station is at the bottom of the road Check in was a bit rushed the guy on the desk pointed at the paper in   places  amp  said  quot  name  signature  signature quot   but they kindly kept my bags as it was quite early  amp  i was unable to get into my room at the time  My room was very clean  amp  tidy  bathroom was small but clean  amp  I had all the facilities I needed  The only problem was there was no remote control for the TV  which they soon bought up to me  Worth noting if you have my room       the quality of the TV on channels     was abysmal  it just kept shaking  amp  going distorted  Unfortunatley i can t comment on the hotel bar as I didn t use it   amp  I didn t have breakfast  this is an extra        Location is great  central London a few minutes by tube  amp  Lords cricket ground    tube stop away  Plenty of restaurants  cafe s  bars  on the main Finchley rd in town    mins from the hotel  
N => Disappointed We stayed one night in this hotel to sightsee and attend concert  We paid     for room and additional       each for cooked breakfast  I was asked to pay on arrival as I had a debit card and not a credit card   I had not been told that before  Our room was downstairs along a corridor past rooms labeled  smoking rooms    Our room was small and dark  It had large dark furniture and there was a large hedge outside the window that blocked the light  There was tea coffee but no biscuits  We had lukewarm showers  The bedside lamp did not work  The bed was OK  The shower was still cold the next morning and we could not face it  The breakfast was surprisingly OK and it was worth the extra    for a cooked rather than continental breakfast  We did not complain about the shower or lamp as we did not have time  Overall we thought our room was poor value for money  The location was good as it was in a quiet area near a tube station  
N =>  So much better than expected  After reading the reviews on here  I was a little nervous  but this hotel was really nice  PROS  good location  not right in the middle of the city  but in a safe and pretty area  the room itself was super cute  and had a nice view  at the end of the street within a   minute walk there is a tube station  a pub    fast food restaurants    convenience stores  and a movie theater  staff was really friendly  and security was pretty good  you have to buzz to get in at night  CONS  there are only   that I can think of  no air conditioning  and a teeny tiny bathroom with a teeny tiny shower  It s not the Ritz  but overall I was very impressed  
N =>   Bad manners boorish behavior We decided to stay an extra couple of nights in London and looked to Expedia com for a good rate on a reputable hotel  Although the price was significantly higher than we had paid for   and   star rooms for the previous week  we thought the property looked quite nice and worth a try  We were sadly mistaken  When we arrived at the hotel  the front desk clerk  manager  I believe  reluctantly tore himself away from his conversation with an employee  then couldn t find our reservation  and asked how we had booked  We told him  quot Expedia quot  and he rolled his eyes  told his assistant to immediately call and close all  quot discount quot  bookings  and proceeded to give us the  quot Basil Fawlty quot  treatment  Without any pretense at good manners or effort to welcome us to his property  he gave us the key to a  quot discount quot  room up in the attic  and turned his back on us Up in the attic  we found a clean  fairly well presented  quot British style quot  room that had been recently renovated  It would never win any prizes for tasteful decorating  but at least it was clean  safe and secure  The only real faults with the room itself were poor water pressure and the fact that the hot water tap dispensed hot water and the cold water tap dispensed even hotter water  The bed springs were creaky and the TV reception was poor  But in an English   star hotel you learn to be forgiving  and overlook such deficiencies as  quot charm quot  or  quot character quot      At checkout time I received further attitude from a clerk when he was forced to accept a credit card instead of cash for my WiFi usage  You d think that three pounds per hour for WiFi would be a great source of hotel income  usually offered for free in most reputable hotels   but at the Swiss Cottage Best Western the taking of money was just another excuse for eye rolling and bad manners I m a well dressed  very polite and respectable guy  The one thing I do expect from any establishment where I spend hundreds of dollars and or pounds is appreciation of my business  A simple  quot welcome quot   a smile  or even a simle  quot thank you quot  go a long way  Thanks for nothing Best Western  you can be sure I won t be back  
N =>   An absolute joke I came across this hotel on the Best Western site  and called direct to book as i often find that you get a better deal  I found I had to give very little detail  so requested a confirmation letter to be emailed  this never arrived  When I called back and spoke to someone  they said that my booking had not been entered yet  I then asked them to do it while i was on the phone and give me a booking number  and was told that they couldnt as it would hold up the switchboard  but they would do it and send confirmation by the end of the day  This never arrived  I tried to find alternative hotels  but they were all full  so had to settle for the this hotel  I called back again  and was still told that confirmation would be sent  however the booking was now in their system  I never got it at all  When I arrived at the hotel  I was greeted  however before anything else was exchanged  I was met with the words I need your credit card  I stay in lots of hotels  but this normally comes after the check in process  I was given a room  and then pointed to the lift  no offer of newspaper  alarm call  no help with luggage   nothing   normally all Best Westerns do this  I got to my room to find that it had not been cleaned from the previous guest   it was  pm  I went back to the desk  the same guy who checked me in said oh well the maid must have had one of her dizzy days  and found me another room  so back upstairs i went  The room i had was on the  rd floor   room      The room was dark  dingy  the bed was in a poor state  the bathroom was disgusting with limescale marks  dust under the bed  on the ledges  window sill  stains on the walls  wires poking out of the light fittings    I could go on  The room does not seem to have had a redecoration in some time  I was told that there were no other rooms available now  but to check in the morning  I asked the guy who checked me in if i could speak to the hotel manager and was told that he was on holiday on his yaught in the carribbean  i am the highest person in the hotel so you can speak to me  i told him to forget it  This guy Ian has to be the rudest person I have ever met and had no idea of service  There was never anyone on the bar to serve drinks  I attempted to order room service   times  whenever i ordered     minutes later there would be a call to say they had run out  followed by the flipant remark that the chef was a pensioner and very forgettful  so in the end i went out for dinner  In the morning i called in at the desk and said about moving  and was told pack my luggage and they would take care of it  Breakfast was luke warm and the staff hardly made any conversation  tables were left uncleared for some time  When I came back to the hotel and asked what my new room was they said they were not aware of me moving rooms  They did not know where my luggage had been put so asked me to take a seat while they found out  I asked to see the manager and was told that there was not one  when i questioned this  I was told by the guy on the desk that they did not have one as they could not afford one  but a friend of the owner looked after the hotel and that he would be back on Thursday  My luggage appeared  but they still did not know what room i was in  At this point I made some enquiries and found a room at another hotel  told them that i wanted to check out and go somewhere else  The guy on the desk called someone  then a girl came to check me out  I have to say she was really sympathetic and quite embarrassed by the whole thing  She put a discount on my bill and did offer a taxi  I wrote to the hotel after and got no response  I then wrote to Best Western and then had a response from the hotel saying sorry for the inconvenience  That was all I got  Its hotels like this that let the others down  
N =>  Last resort For a four star hotel not what was expected  We booked two double rooms well in advance and got two twins three floors apart  The hot tap indicator was connected to the cold tap  Whilst waiting for the bath to refill I walked in a large puddle in the bedroom where the raditor was leaking  The room was tiny and far too hot even with the radiator off  The decor was grubby  and the staff attitude was that it was just tough that we hadn t got what we booked  Breakfast OK  Location OK had the tube not been closed for maintenance  The bathroom had been recently refurbished but I suggest that choose a better plumber  
N =>    star hotel   dont think so  We have just returned from a Weekend trip to London stayin at the Swiss Cottage Best Western Hotel  Thank goodness we didn t have to spend much time there  We had booked two double rooms  Instead we got two single rooms  or so it seemed  that they has squshed two single beds into  We were under the impression that there had to a minimum clearance around the bed for the hotel to attain   stars  Sqaushed against the wall and radiator is not acceptable The bath was chipped and very small The wardrobe doors were badly fiting and banged all night  We would recommend any standard traveloge rather than this hotel  The breakfast was adequate  just   Definately not good value for money  
N =>  Good locale but only so so My friend chose this hotel after a good stay a few years ago  But after   nights in   different rooms this time around  she admitted it wasn t what it used to be  They do make an effort to keep this Victorian style place clean and you can make a fairly substantial meal from the breakfast spread  Our first room was a  quot family room quot  with   single beds  Space was enormous  but the floors are creaky and uneven beneath the carpet  Beds aren t very comfortable  as the springs are warped with age  The double room on our return had a nicer decor  but was the room was tiny  With no A C  there are electrical fans  but because they re so dusty with cobwebs we couldn t use them  My biggest gripe were the showerheads  They tend to lean against the wall and have very little water pressure  Only saving grace is that they re detachable The hotel is in a quiet neighborhood and it is very close to the tube station  But even with all that  it s doubtful I d ever book a room here again  
N =>  Er  Alright I guess   My father and I stayed here in y of       the outside is alright  over painted  neighborhood noisy due to construction  Near tube which is convenient  However when we checked and went to our room they stuck us in one of there basement rooms  It was stuffy  wallpaper peeling  saggy beds and furniture  and itsy bitsy bathroom  barely large enough for one person  Had gotten free eng  breakfast which was fine  Stayed there again on the end of our trip and put us in a room upstairs  Not much better than the first one  Clean still which was nice  
N =>  Disgraceful  hotel  This place was a joke  We booked a double room for Valentine s day about     weeks in advance  We turned up to check into the hotel after driving all the way across London  The guy on the front desk fumbled around for a while and then asked us to fill in the necessary details to check in  all the while his colleague was sitting down just behind him  Once he had filled in the necesssary details his colleague then got up and told us that they had no double rooms available due to a problem on the fourth floor and the room they had given us was a twin  Needless to say we couldn t believe it  No one had bothered to phone us in advance to tell us  which is very suspicious  The guy on the desk had the cheek to offer us room service on the house as compensation  Avoid this place at all costs  no place that operates in this manner deserves any guests at all  We didn t take the room and because we had booked through a hotel booking website the idiot on the front desk told us we could only get a refund through the website  We asked him to call them to inform them of what had happened and he said it would have to wait til Monday as they were closed on Saturday  We rang the website after leaving the hotel and it was open  This was a very special day and this hotel was disgraceful in the way it thought it could treat us  We didn t take the room and will be reporting this matter to the Trading Standards office  
N =>   Okay   
N =>   Small but perfectly formed  After reading reviews on here  i decided on this hotel due toits proximity to the tube station and the Royal Albert Hall  It was about two minutes to the tube and only two stops to the Albert Hall  I was aware from the reviews previously read that the room would be small  And it was  it was the smallest room i have ever stayed and coincidently reached by usuing the smallest lift  Everything was spotlessly clean and there was everything there that you could need  Shower was rubbish for me as it was not on a riser and was very high up on the wall  but ok for hubby who is  ft    Breakfast was taken in a small room but the choice was absolutely fine  Fruit  cereal  juice  croissants  toast  yoghurt  cheese  bottled water  tea  coffee  hot selection with everything but bacon  Got the room for    pounds including breakfast for a double on the link from this site to opus  Interestingly was much more expensive if navigated straight to opus or tried to book direct  Would definately choose again for a short trip  
N =>   Wow that s awfully small room  We knew from Trip Advisor that it would be on the small side  but since     Hotels said we d get a queen or king sized bed  we thought it would be OK      Hotels was wrong  There are no queen or king sized beds in this hotel according to the manager  We were on the LG basement floor in one of their  quot bigger quot  rooms  We couldn t get us and our two bags in the elevator  We ve never seen such a small room  There were two    x    foot spots to stand plus a smaller space in the bathroom  The double bed was crammed against the wall  There was a window that led to a shaft of light On the plus side  everything was like new and was crystal clean  The price was a bargin  the breakfast was excellent and the location was perfect  
N =>   This was more like a dungeon than a hotel room I booked this hotel for the weekend after a conference in Brighton  I called from Brighton and asked which train to take  Reception did not know  amp  did not offer to find out  The directions they gave me from the tube stop were wrong  suggesting a left turn  instead of right   My room was a tiny claustrophobic basement room with one small window onto a small air shaft  Although the room was very clean it was very dungeonlike and unpleasant  
N =>   Great hotel  We stayed for   nights in twinroom LG    basement   Absolutely loved it  Room wasn t huge  but had no problems with that  Enough storagespace  closet  nightstand with drawers  drawer in desk   Bathroom was a bit on the small side but well equiped  great shower  Staff was really friendly  we had brought our luggage in the morning and checked in at the end of the afternoon  this was no problem  Free wireless worked perfectly  If I ever go to London again  I will stay here  
N =>   Nice and clean Stayed in a single room   very clean  room was very small  but everything was in the right place and consequnetly it worked  One thing was that in the morning there was a lot of slamming of doors as the doors are the heavy firedoor ones  Reception was fine  really close to Earl s Court station and a couple of good pubs witrh decent food nearby  Breakfast was a bit cold by the time I got down as well         
N =>   If only there were hotels like this in Paris It was a pleasant   night stay  Modern  refurbished and with Wi Fi  With a last minute discount  the value was good for a   star  I was in the basement  but it barely showed except no view although a window  The room was a bit cramped  but its particular layout helped  I suggest that you specifically ask to avoid basement  because you might then be under the room in which they serve breakfast  BTW  the food was very good  
N =>   Almost an unpleasant experience but saved by Ms Lovelah the frontdesk My wife booked a room online for GBP   a night  We took a look at the photos online and we thought  quot hey  that looks alright  quite nice actually  quot  And so it was  AFter a   hr flt from Singapore  we checked in to a room that was an underground dungeon  It was THE SMALLEST ROOM I HAVE EVER STAYED IN in MY LIFE   Refer to the uploaded photos  So we went back up and asked the front desk staff at that time  an unshaven gentleman  but still very tidy  well spoken  polite and helped us with our luggage  Thank you very much   and asked him if we could have a change of rooms for the following reasons   I was claustrophobic and because we were there for a tradeshow and had a clothes rack  samples  catalogues etc  way too many things to keep in a dungeon  Our suitcase was behind the front door mind you coz there was no where else we could lie it down  To which his reply was   All the rooms were fully booked and that he would get back to us  Then i asked if all the rooms were that small and he said  quot Yes   The rooms are all of about the same size  quot  So i went back to my dungeon and took a look at the fire escape plan on the back of the door and exclaimed  quot BOLLOCKS   quot  we got the smallest room in LONDON   And so i asked my wife if there were different classes or price ranges for the rooms and she said there weren t  And checking back  the dungeon was not featured at all on their website to at least prep potential customers that hey  you could be  quot doing time quot  when you get here  but depending on your luck  But shame on that guy for lying to us by telling us they were all about the same size  SHAME ON YOU   And even after i tell you that i am claustrophobic and you say that you will get back to me  and leave us without a reply   He wasnt at the desk for the next   days Then comes our heroine   After spending a sleepless night  mostly looking out the window  which faced a wall fyi   we went back to the front desk after breakfast where i stepped out for a smoke and  because of my temper  left my wife to ask for a bigger room  This time it was Miss Lovelah behind the desk  A fresh face and warm smile   a true heart warmer on a cold cold morning  Once again  she said she sympathised with us but they were fully booked  but would find a solution  SO again we trudged back to our dungeon  WIthin minutes a call came in and lo and behold  The Lovely Ms Lovelah transferred us to a  quot deluxe room quot  over looking the street  It made the remaining   nights A LOT BETTER  and the main reason  why i would recommend this hotel to anyone going to London  But  do state under remarks when you are booking the room that you do not want to be incarcerated in any dungeons below Overall  the hotel  even the dungeon  was very clean  very new  very well kept and done up   My wife actually felt the dungeon was cozy   I found myself respecting the No smoking rule and smoked outdoors becuase it was so clean and hey  i thought everyone is making a collective effort to maintain this  so i shant be the black sheep  I used the kettles in the hotel  which i normally wouldn t even think of  to make tea and checked my mail with the free Wi fi  Good Job with the free internet usage Breakfast was pretty ok i thought  Simple  standard english breakfast in a cozy little cafe The staff  in general were very friendly  even the gentleman who left us in a lurch  no matter what time it was  i went out for a smoke at like   in the morning and was greeted by a smiling gentleman behind the desk  but Miss Lovelah  she truly made the difference to my first experience in London  Kudos to you Lovelah  If i ever go back to London  I ll definitely head back to Best Western  The Boltons Hotel   Earl s Court  
N =>  wonderful refit very pleasing to book over the phone    best western site is very good  and arrive to find such a lovely hotel  for amazing price      pd night   our room was on top floor which has no lift  a hard time with   bags The men at reception were spot on  the woman another story  DONT get them to call you a taxi   hail it yourself outside  WAY CHEAPER  A private car turns up and be prepared to get ripped off  Such a shame to spoil an otherwise top spot  
N =>   Average rooms good location Not a bad place to stay  although when we got there our basement  executive  room had decorators staring in the window from outside  Still nice hotel  good location and pleasant staff  rooms really clean  so yes i would stay again 
N =>   Enjoyable Stay  Lousy lift  I stayed at The Cromwell from the   th to   th of ch and overall I had a very enjoyable stay  The hotel is perfectly situated with the Underground station just across the street and various other shops nearby  The staff were very friendly and helpful from check in to check out  As others have commented scaffolding does cover the front facade although this was no issue as I had no intentions of staring at the building all day I arrived around    AM  and my room was ready after a short wait which was great after a long flight  Room      on the top floor  was quiet  clean  and more then adequate for my needs  Keep in mind the lift does not reach the  th floor for future reference  Yes  the rooms are small  but this was no surprise  The decor seemed to be recently updated and bathroom was very nice and modern  My one complaint about the room itself was the lack of hot water on occasions  I found if I did not shower early enough lukewarm water the best I could hope for but not deal breaker Breakfast was included in my room rate and was delicious and a great way to start the day  The staff attending the breakfast room were very friendly  attentive  and made me feel welcomed The only matter I did complain about was the lack of a working lift every morning of my stay  Without fail the lift was out of service every morning  but when returning in the evening it was back in service  I also noticed that there signs stating it was out on every floor but the forth every morning  So you had no idea it was out if staying on the  th or  th floor   But overall a minor inconvenience  
N =>   Avoid any basement bedrooms  any room starting by      Four of us travelled to London for business and booked   rooms at the Cromwell s  I did not have a chance to visit the other bedrooms  but from the comments by my colleagues  quot it is just like being in a caravan   quot  My bedroom was in the basement  And looked pretty cozy during the first    seconds  I should have been alerted immediately by the presence of   air fresheners in my tiny bedroom   It was freezing cold     C when I got there and had to leave a credit card in  while we had supper to make sure the heating was gonna work on    No heating in the bathroom  Although the room was clean and nicely decorated  it was     smelly  No window to be opened  Just a pretend window that was all painted over and not to be opened  The room really stank of   well I do not dare to say   sick    Only then did I spot the air fresheners    When I went upstairs to ask for another room it was to be told that the hotel was fully booked  but that they would come to spray my room with yet more air freshener      Somhow I manage to get to sleep in  I have to admit   the bed was nice and comfy   But I woke up during the night because my head was suddenly feeling extremely cold  I am not bald     I checked the temperature and it was     again although I had left the noisy  very  noisy AC on   Do I recommend it   NO  A positive   At breakfast  I asked for a hot chocolate and was told by the waiter that they did not do that  A cook who happened to hear that  nicely offered to do one for me    He was  really  the only nice and friendly staff around  
N =>   Bad Heating  The Hotel was okay  your average standard middleclass Business Hotel in a central location within walking distance to Hyde Park  Museum of Natural History  tube station and Harrod s  But  The heating in the first room  I was put up in  didn t work properly  
N =>   great minus the construction my roommate and i are both college students  we stayed at the cromwell for   nights in january  and it was a good experience overall  the only bad part was there was LOUD construction going on in the next room  but it usually didn t start until   a  when we were usually out anyway  we just happened to catch it one day  the room was pretty small  but the bathroom was spotless  the staff was super friendly  the location was great  not even a   minute walk to the gloucester road tube station  i d go back  
N =>  My worst experience in    years of business travel  My worst experience in    years of travelling    Stayed   nights  and was given a room in the basement  no window  Air Con heating turned off when removing the room key  so the temp was    degrees C in the evenings  Management didn t care and were totally uninterested in the fact that I stayed   nights  
N =>  Avoid  Really not a good hotel   definately would not recommend The staff were not helpful  and didn t speak much English  My fiance s debit card was fraudulently used during our stay  Whilst it may have been cheap for London  it was a bit of a dump  The room was OK pretty small  felt like we were in a cellar  Cleanliness was OK  bit of mildew in the bathroom  OK for one night  At weekends the parking is free if you can find it  but if not  parking is     for    hours  Ouch  Quiet area  not rough like some areas of London This was just our experience  other reviews seem pretty good  It met our expectations  but these were pretty low based on other stays in London  
N =>   Blew reservation Made booking in tember after phoning hotel and ensuring they had quiet rooms not facing Cromwell   a very busy street Confirmed again in ober Got their confirmation reminder again a few days before the visit Arrived   no room on garden side But they upgraded us to a noisy  quot exec quot  room on street side that was tired with carpet stains etc We did not stay   I ran around to a few nearby hotels  ended up spending    pounds more to get a room at the Holiday Inn on Cromwell  
N =>  Really good Hotel We booked a twin room which was a good size  The room was lovely and clean  The staff were very polite  amp  helpful We could leave our luggage  We didn t have breakfast but there are plenty of cafes within walking distance  Good location right by Gloucester Road Underground station It s noisy but that s the area Would recommend a stay there  
N => Great hotel We stayed two nights en route to rugby at Twickenham  Yes the room was small but that didn t matter as we only wanted somewhere to sleep  We found the staff very helpful and the room spotless  For central London the price was good and we would not hesitate to stay there again  No breakfast so we can t comment on that  
N =>  Horrible Experience   Do Not Recommend I arrived at The Cromwell around      a m  on ember          for one night s stay  I had chosen this hotel because I had actually stayed there in e y      and had had a positive experience  even wrote a positive review on TripAdvisor Upon arrival  they assigned me room     and took my luggage in for storage as it was early in the day and the room was not ready  I warned them that I would likely come back very late in the day as I was planning to go to Windsor Castle and then catch a show at night in London Thus  it was with utter shock that when I came back around       p m  that day  ready for a good night s sleep  to be told by the front desk guy  whose name was Asim  that my room had been given away  We went back to the storage  and  indeed  there was my suitcase with a tag with the Room        and yet I had no place to stay  Asim started assuring me that he would have me transported to another hotel  I was very upset  though  because the hotel knew I was in  so how could I be left without a room  having made a reservation on y     and having presented myself in person early in the morning  While I have been to London many times  I was not familiar with the locations of the hotels Asim was proposing  Asim was saying that these would be   star hotels  yet somehow  it all did not sound credible  I had selected The Cromwell strategically for its proximity to the subway and ease of access to Harrod s where I had planned to shop in the morning prior to taking off for my other European destination I got really upset and started demanding that I speak with the owner  Asim had mentioned at one point that the same owner owned the other hotel where he was planning to have me transferred  and that it was OK if I paid a discounted rate at this supposedly   star other hotel  I demanded that I speak with the owner  and stated that I was refusing to be moved to another hotel  At this point  we had been arguing back and forth for about   hours  since Asim was the only personnel at the hotel  and my discussion for accommodation was constantly being interrupted by guest requests  The later it got  the more upset I got  considering that I had not slept in over    hours So  given the extreme aggravation  I said I was expecting them to put me up for free and that I was demanding to speak with the owner  I had to make this request multiple times and be extremely insistent  Finally  Asim  who in his own way was trying to be helpful  told me to pick up my suitcase and follow him out of the building  We went next door  and it was a building under renovation  with enough contruction dust on the window panes to accommodate a creative graffiti artist  I started getting horrible visions that this was Asim s   star hotel  and began protesting that I would not stay there  Asim assured me that this is where the hotel owner slept  He kept banging on the door  and I joined him in the effort  Sure enough  the owner  by the name of Andre  soon emerged in his underwear and clearly was very sleepy  given the time of the day  or  rather  very early morning  Andre immediately suggested that I should be put up at another hotel  Asim said that at this point I was refusing to pay  First  Andre said that  of course  I had to pay  But when I explained the circumstances of how poorly his hotel  The Cromwell  had treated me  since I had been there in person  and I had left my luggage  he agreed that indeed I should just be taken care of  He was most gracious at that point Asim called a cab that the hotel paid for  and I was taken to the Lord Jim Hotel in the Earl s Court area of London  Lord Jim turned out to be a   star hotel  Luckily  the front desk gentleman  who was French  was very nice and accommodating to me  I arrived at the Lord Jim past      a m   so unless you want to take a chance at a hotel that could overbook you  as they did me  steer clear  
N =>   Tiny room but good price If you re looking for anything more than a place to sleep at night  I wouldn t recommend this place  but it served its purpose for me I ended up on the first floor  although I asked for a higher floor  because the elevator was broken and my suitcase was about    pounds  The room I got was set up like a flat  with a miniature landing with one room to the bedroom and one room to the bathroom The bedroom itself was tiny   there was barely room in my room for a bed and desk  The setup with the bathroom was a little inconvenient in the middle of the night  as the doors were pretty heavy Since I was on the ground floor  there was quite a bit of noise from the street as well  and I had a nice view of the adjacent building s wall The breakfast was okay  but a little awkward to find  and a staff member watched me the whole time I was eating  The location was pretty convenient  It was within walking distance to many sites  and very close to the tube and a grocery store  a must in London   restaurants are just too expensive   
N =>   Such a shame   great staff bad hotel Booked the hotel through late rooms on a great deal of around      a night  Couldn t find out much info about the hotel as new and as London was v busy  Wimbledon  Tour de France  booked it anyway   really wish we hadn t For the first night I was put in room     which was TINY  And I mean TINY  The decor was contemporary and the big tv was great but it was just a very small room  barely enough space to walk around the bed   As it was just me on my own for the first night it wasn t too much of a problem  although there wasn t enough room to work at the desk so had to lie on the bed and work   and I wanted a bath but there was only a shower in the bathroom  The room was also noisy  It was at the back of the hotel which meant there was no road noise  which was good  but the air conditioning vent in the ceiling was obviously just underneath the upstairs room bathroom  I heard everything  and they were decorating the room below so I didn t sleep well  When my boyfriend arrived for the following   nights we realised the room was way too small for   people  no space for our bags    When we asked to move due to the noise the staff were lovely  although they said that a few people had complained about the room    and couldn t move us for the  nd night  hotel was full  but could for our last night The  nd room      I think  was slightly bigger but unfortunately was quite noisy as the window was broken and wouldn t shut properly  we d moved due to the noise and they put us in a noisier room which I thought was weird   We informed them in the morning and the staff again were wonderful and apologised  The staff were great but I wouldn t stay here again as the rooms are too tiny and noisy  There are plenty of hotels around this area that are better for the same price  The hotel is still not finished  still working on some rooms  wires everywhere all weekend and the bar at one point was swamped with curtains   and I miss extras like a mini bar in the room  especially when you have to wait    minutes to get served at the bar as they keep leaving to check people in    also couldn t see sign of room service  there might have been some but no menu anywhere   and a bath Sadly the staff and service are great but on another level to the hotel  Booking this hotel was one risk I won t be repeating  
N =>   stanze piccole ma per il resto molto bene  
N =>  Ottimo per brevi soggiorni  
N =>  Hotel ideale per una breve sosta a Londra  
N =>   Attaccato alla metro  
N =>   No heat in late tember   early ober No heat of any kind in the hotel  and no air conditioning other than very small portable room fan   t  had a cold spell plus maid left the windows open all day  so when I returned late evening  felt like I was sleeping outside   this happened several times  Put on four layers of shirts and had two blankets  but still cold  This went on for most of my    day stay during t          Brick concrete     yr old Victorian bldg has no insulation  I have stayed here several times in the past and found it extremely convenient to Heathrow Express about a ten minute walk  trains to Oxford and north of London  two tube stations nearby     minute walk to concerts at Royal Albert Hall     minute walk to Kensington Palace  grocery stores in Paddington Train Station for snacks ten minute walk  so no spend money on taxis  Always clean room  but very small  Only five hangers for my long stay with good clothes  but staff could not locate even one extra hanger for me when I asked more than once  Hair dryer was taped to work  Hassle to use the room safe  New flat screen TV was nice  Only one hotel computer and was out of order at least three times when I really depended on it  so I missed a very important meeting  Continental breakfast OK  but it never changes if you stay several days  Breakfast room always clean  Remodeled some curtains in hotel  Quiet back rooms  but front rooms have some traffic noise  am    pm  Current staff friendly and professionally trained  Problem in general is London hotels are notoriously small and too expensive with unpredictable quality and just cannot give the value compared with ANY hotel in the United States  I do not think any American would be statisfied with any London hotel  I have stayed in about a dozen London hotels  I hope this one would have been adequate given its good location to the trian station  but now I am not sure  Lift but several rooms are inaccessible via lift  
N =>   Good value I stayed in a twin room for one night  The room was very small  with the beds about a foot apart  however  they were able to fit a desk and extra chair in the room  which was nice  Not a room you would want to hang out in but perfectly fine as a base for exploring London  Paddington Station is a five minute walk from the hotel  The room was not air conditioned  but they provided a fan  which helped  Though the room itself was clean  I have to take off a star for the absolutely filthy curtain in the bathroom  Since the window is right above the sink  it was impossible to avoid noticing the grime and stains on this curtain  and every time the breeze blew it toward me  I would jump out of the way because I didn t want it to touch me  it was that nasty  Otherwise  this hotel was a good value  
N =>   Not impressed  Staff abrupt not too friendly service non existant   After booking a room at the Admiral Hotel which is opposite the Delmere we were moved to the Delemere as they has a water damage in our room  the gentleman at the Admiral was very politeand sibcere my than i can say about the staff at the Delemere  The room     was in need of a refurb   The wardrobe was filthy inside  the bed was not made on y half done  the cups and saucers had stains inside  gteaspoons still had coffee on it   At breakfast we waited to be seated only to be met by a grumpy waitress who lacked in communication skills  she brought our coffee and never saw her again  We were expecting a hot buffet breakfast  unfortunatelt there is no english breakfast  felt likethat none of the staff seemed to really look after their guest  this is my first and last time at a Best Western Hotel   
N =>   Good value    great location We were only going to be in London   nights and had an early departure out of Heathrow so we wanted to be near Paddington Station to get the express train  This hotel is very convenient to Paddington Station and Metro stop  Our room was very small but included tv  fan  hairdryer  coffee tea service  Bathroom  though small  was very clean with good storage shelves  Our room was on the back side and was very quiet even though we slept with the window open  Free internet was great  Breakfast was not included in our rate  There is a nice lounge sitting area if you feel you need more space for reading relaxing  We found a nice modern Italian restaurant a few blocks away  
N =>   Mind your head    I had previously stayed at the Best Western Paddington Court so was looking for something more when I found I had to travel to the London at short notice The Delmere was a disappointment in that the rooms were tiny  My suitcase took up a lot of space in the room I really wonder how they managed to squeeze in the attached bathroom    The buffet breakfast was passable but I made up my mind there and then never to return to the Delmere again even if it meant that my stay cost a little more  
N =>  Just loved it    We had poured over review after review for hotels in London and were getting a bit discouraged  Our budget seemed to limit us to hotels with medium low reviews  But apon arrival we were pleasently surprised  We arrived to meet friendly staff who helped coordinate our lost baggage and its safe arrival from the airport into our room  They had offered recomendations for areas to walk  pubs to visit    Our room was small  granted   but  that s Europe  If you re looking for a resort type holiday  this is not the place to stay  Don t go in expecting the  American  style Best Western experience  Most of these hotels don t have pools  work out rooms  large suite like rooms or large public areas  But  if you re like us and just want a clean  safe  comfortable place to rest at the end of a long day of exploring  This is the place for you  Most important to note  even though there is a lift  you may still have some stairs to get to your room  The food was good   My fiance still raves about the coffee      the area was really nice  great access to transportation  and as I said the hotel was clean  friendly and safe  It s a place I d definitely go back to  
N =>  Uuugggghhhh  We booked late  a sure sign of trouble  We wanted to share a room to save a little   and took a room with   single beds that were pushed together  Even with the beds together  the room was extremely small and my friend and I were stepping all over one another  The blanket and bedspread had what looked like semen stains  the beds were extremely hard  One night I listened to a couple arguing for   minuets  another  I was awoken by a guest or staff member throwing up in the back garden area  The hallways  elevator  bathrooms are all so tiny  The room had no iron  the shower area a bit moldy and paper thin walls  Dinner was okay but skip breakfast here  The only plus was a good meal in the restaurant  over priced but okay   the room had a hair dryer  and it was three blocks from Paddington Station  This is a nice neighborhood  but if you wait until the last minute to book the Hilton  skip this place  You would be better off in a hostel  
N =>  Truly awful hotel    Do not stay here if you value a good night s sleep   The noise from the road outside was loud and continuous but didn t quite succeed in drowning out the noise coming from the rooms above and beside us  I don t think we slept a wink that night  We knew that it was a twin room but what we weren t expecting was two single beds  head to head with a large headboard between us  The room was only marginally bigger than a shoe box and got very stuffy at night  and the bathroom was the smallest I ve ever seen The breakfast was not the best we ve ever had     and I agree with previous reviews that the restaurant area itself leaves a lot to be desired All in all  I d say avoid this hotel   there are plenty of other ones along the same road that looked a lot nicer  certainly their reception areas looked a lot more welcoming than this one   
N =>  Terrible hotel   A truly awful London hotel  Convenient for Paddington Station and the Heathrow Express  but otherwise has absolutely nothing going for it  With plenty of other   star hotels in the neighbourhood to choose from  I recommend you go elsewhere  The room was incredibly small  cramped and stuffy  as were all of the public spaces within the hotel  The bathroom was revolting with mould in the shower and used soap on the basin      The towels were as stiff as boards and the size of postage stamps  The bedlinen was crumpled and tatty although thankfully  apparently  clean  The noise from outside was overwhelming  but drowned out the noise from upstairs until first thing in the morning  I had an early train and although reception had agreed to provide breakfast    minutes before  quot official quot  breakfast times  the kitchen had not been informed and this was not available  The reception staff were surly and rude and far more interested in chatting among themselves than serving guests  All in all  not a pleasant stay  Avoid  
N =>   Great Location Great location for attending a function in Hyde Park  handy for Paddington  Unfortunatley our request for a non smoking room was unable to be met  hence a musty room with cigarette burns in the blanket  Our room on the  th floor was compact but as we were only using it for a base  amp  to sleep for the weekend it was fine  As the room was an attic room it was extremely hot  resulting in our need to keep the window open all night  amp  as the hotel is situated on a busy road with a large hospital around the corner not much sleep was gained that night  Having said that when we asked for a fan from reception the following morning one was supplied for a small deposit  The ensuite was clean  amp  the water pressure in the shower was great  The bar was tiny and not used  the restaurant only sat    people  amp  when busy the   staff struggled to provide a good service for breakfast  despite being self service  I must say that the receptionist was extremely helpful  amp  friendly but this would not be our  st choice for a return stay  
N =>  Clean and comfortable Our room was downstairs and was small but not too small  Location was handy  five minutes walk from paddington and Hyde park on a quiet street  For continential breakfast  it was good  and we were able to get our fill for the morning  self serve   Most importantly the place was very clean  something you can t take for granted  Would stay again  
N =>   Did not enjoy my stay Stayed here for four days  on business  In a single room on the fourth floor  No pressure for the shower entailed turning the tap in the sink on in order to build up water pressure  I had problems with broadband  but I think this was my work servers rather than hotel broadband I preferred to stay out in the evenings rather than spend time in the cramped accommodation Plastic croissants in the morning unforgiveable  especially since all the staff were French Staff helpful enough  but did not appear to be knowledgeable about a  shower  b  broadband I stayed here because it was cheap  Next time  I am going to pay the extra and stay somewhere roomy and comfortable  
N => Cramped but satisfactory I stayed one night to attend a function in town  Hotel was easy to find from Paddington tube The single room was very small  tea making equipment above the bed headboard    but with a place for everything I need  Everything was clean and functional  Some road noise  but this is London of course  I got the impression that sound insulation between rooms wasn t great but since I didn t have noisy neighbours it wasn t a problem Breakfast was fine  service efficient overall Good value at     B amp B in central London 
N =>  I slept in a cupboard  Teeny weeny room that just fitted the bed    a shower which was up   large steps   after confessing my mistake to colleagues   they also admitted to having stayed here and hating it Do not be fooled by the best Western branding and brilliant price compared to others   it is truely awful I did not sleep   bedroom boiling despite wndow wide openBreakfast more than depressing i left an hour and a half before my train as i prefered to sit at the station Horrible  horrible  horribleDO NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL        
N =>   Good for the price but tight and a little cold  I have to say first we spent three nights there and had a very pleasant stay  The breakfast  included  was more than sufficient  The rooms were clean and neat  The location was excellent and the staff    the staff were the best part  friendly  obliging and very cheerful  particularly the ladies at the reception desk The downside  very small rooms  If you have a lot of luggage or children it will be inconvenient  There is a lift but as we discovered  it took us to the  nd floor but then we had to haul the luggage down a flight of stairs to get to our room  The house is old and the stairs are all over the place  One of our rooms was in an outside section which was very quite but again we d come along way  London was one of many stops   had a long way left to go and it was all a bit much for us as we each had a large suitcase and smaller bag  I have to admit to being frustrated at times with the lack of space  My father also had trouble finding his way about in the maze of door and stairs The other thing was the heating  it was il  it was cold and the heating turned off automatically in the evening  My father complained of the cold and I went to the desk to ask them to turn on the heating and they said they couldn t  They offered my a little electric heater and charged my credit card    pounds for the use  it was to be deducted once the heater was returned  and it was  but I was a little flummoxed by the whole situation   I would recommend this hotel if you re looking for cheap  clean and convenient but before warned of small room and cold nights  I rated it with the price in mind  
N => Small Room But Convenient Location We arrived in London at Heathrow Airport  Then we took the Heathrow Express train that stops at the Paddington Station  The Delmere Hotel is only two blocks from the Paddington Station  The room was quite small but very clean  The weather was warm in London  We were glad to have a window in our room  because there wasn t air conditioning in the room  The continental breakfast was typical  The hotel staff was friendly and quite helpful  What made the Delmere Hotel wonderful was the location  near the Paddington train and tube station  near Hyde Park  restaurants  shops etc  It was easy to either walk or take the tube to various locations in London  
N =>  Noisy and small Unless you are looking for a cheap place to stay before catching an early flight  I would not recommend this hotel  I stayed at this hotel because of its proximity to Paddington station  I was catching a      am flight out of Heathrow   When I arrived  I was given a tiny smoking room  even though I had requested a non smoking room  Further  I did not get even an hour of sleep as the windows are thin and I could hear all conversations and cars outside even though I was wearing ear plugs  The hotel has no air conditioning and the heat in the room was unbearable  When I asked for a fan  the desk clerk gave me a heating device and told me that it blew cold air    it didn t  After a call  she brought me a real fan  My advice  stay at the Comfort Inn at Hyde Park  
N =>  Delmere a good choice We booked the Delmere near Paddington after much research on Trip Advisor  We made a good choice  When we arrived early they held our luggage till we returned later in the day  Our room was very clean and the bathroom had corian counter tops  newer and very clean  Yes  the room and bathroom area were small but we expected this as most in London are  The price was agreeable at    pounds a night thru LONDONNIGHTSThe continental breakfast each morning was delightful and the staff in the breakfast room were great  We asked for two twin beds and our room had them pushed together for a Queen size bed  We had towels each day and upon inspection of the mattress I was satisfied we had found a clean place to stay  My only poor review would be for the blonde at the desk who seemed to be in charge during the day  Not rude but felt like she didn t like her job or the intrusion of guests who ask questions  Otherwise all personnel were great  including those in the lounge area  Paddington station was a short two blocks away  very easy to navigate if you are pulling luggage as we were  The HEATHROW EAXPRESS goes straight to Paddington in no time at all  Would recommend this hotel and location without reservation  
N => A Great Holiday My wife and   adult children stayed at the Delmere for   nights              and            In between we traveled to Rome  The proximity to Paddington station was convenient for access to the Heathrow Express  We were able to walk to the Delmere with our luggage  Also used the Paddington tube stop for access to all of London  The rooms were clean and comfortable  with a nice bathroom and shower  The complimentary continental breakfast was a great start to each day  After each full day of touring the city sights  it was nice to return to our quiet neighborhood  There were several pubs and restaurants in the area  There was a comfortable and well appointed lounge room which we used for family gatherings  We also took advantage of their small bar  The staff was friendly and accomodating  They had our   rooms available before check in time  since we arrived early from an all night flight  They also held our luggage after check out  as we had a late afternoon flight out  We would stay at the Delmere again  
N => Great Choice My wife and I spent three nights here and were not disappointed  It was our first visit to London and we found the location to be well suited to our plans  The staff was very friendly and helpful  rooms were clean  breakfast was adequate  Would stay here again  
N =>  A good choice I chose BW  Delmere on the basis of reviews on tripadvisor  It was a good choice  This is a small hotel near restaurants and shops  Rooms have internet access  but since I hadn t brought my computer I went to an internet cafe a block away  Hotel staff were friendly and helpful  the room was small but comfortable and very clean  the continental breakfast was good and plentiful  and the location was great  just two blocks from Paddington station  For me price was the deciding factor  Given the location  the price can t be beat  I arrived three hours before check in after an overnight flight from the US  I was invited to wait in the lounge while my room was readied  The desk clerk brought a cup of coffee and asked the maid to clean my room first  I was in my room after only    minutes The hotel would not guarantee a non smoking room  and although I did find an ashtray in a drawer  the room was free of tobacco odor  But one who is especially sensitive to smoke might want to choose a hotel that will guarantee a smoke free room I will definitely stay at Best Western Delmere on my next trip to London  
N =>  Delmere   A Hidden Gem in London Your reviewers were right  My husband and I recently spent three nights at the Delmere during our first visit to England  We loved our little room  The staff was so pleasant and helpful  The location was great  Paddington Station was a super place for starting our exploration of London  We would certainly reccommend this hotel to family and friends  
N =>  Accurate reviews for this lovely quaint hotel in a convenient location  Just came back from a   day trip to London  The Delmere hotel was a wonderful choice  It was conveniently located by the Paddington tube station  which is not too far from central London and all the major sights  The Heathrow Express took us directly from the airport to Paddington station within    min  The hotel staff was very gracious during our entire stay  Our booking included a daily continental breakfast in their small restaurant  La Perla  which was perfect since eating in London can be VERY expensive  The room was cozy with a clean en suite bathroom  and was located in the back of the hotel  which was very quiet  Rooms facing the street may be noisy due to street traffic  We would definitely stay here again  Many thanks to tripadvisor com for the recommendation  
N =>  Small room but well positioned hotel  
N => A very clean room  
N =>  Friendly good service easily accesible to things  
N =>  Comfortable stay and lovely breakfast  We stayed here for   night  had a lovely meal in Chinatown and then went to the Theatre  The room was certainly big enough for us  we liked the free lugguage storage upon departure of our room  the breakfast was buffet  replenished frequently and we liked the option of having a cooked breakfast  yes you don t get Bacon and they did substitute the Mushrooms for Sausages   but that didn t bother us   We could hear a little traffic noise  but we were on the  rd floor facing the street  but we couldn t hear trains and to be honest by the time we got back from the Theatre were too tired to care  I would certainly recommend this hotel  
N =>   Enjoyed convenience of location We did have trouble initially finding the hotel from the locations given with registration  Soon enough  a cab driver led us there   Room was roomy for London standards  very clean  some road noise  expected though as we were very close to the street  Bathroom was sufficient for our needs  felt safe and secure during our three night stay  Would recommend to others traveling to London  Free wi fi  the front desk was very helpful  Breakfast each morning was great way to start the day  We had a slight mishap and needed a bandage  which the hotel was not able to help with   only reason service not rated   star 
N =>   Very nice hotel We stayed   nights in BW Victoria Palace in the middle of e and I must say that I found it to be good value for the money spent  Small rooms  but very cosy  clean and nice  Also bathrooms were very clean  We even had a nice sight from our room  in  th floor  to Big Ben and London Eye  Breakfast was okay  comparing to London standards  toast  youghurt  corn flakes  fruits  and the hot buffee   The hotel was also easy to reach  just   minute walk from Victoria station  Staff was really friendly and our stay was very pleasent   I would stay here again  
N =>  Bad Surprise The Hotel was in a great location  But     the size of the room  quiteness of the room and confort of the room was a very big disappointment  When we arrived we were shown a room on the basement level with an almost window  The next room was underneath a flat and had a lot of stairs to get to  When we did get a room it was on the street side with a lot of noise  We booked this hotel    months prior to visiting London  We will never stay at this hotel again  There are so many hotels in London  be very sure that you do not pick this one  
N =>   Reasonably priced handy place to stay Although we upgraded to the queen size bed  the room was quite small but very clean  amp  the bathroom was immaculate  Staff were helpful  amp  friendly  The breakfast set up  pay a little extra for sausage  amp  bacon  was not as good as some other hotels   amp  I m vegetarian    but there was sufficient  amp  wouldn t be put off staying here again  There are lots of nice looking restauants on the doorstep  too  
N =>  The Cupboard Under The Stairs  The  quot room quot  was TINY  but clean  The length of     beds and the width of one arm span  Bathroom nearly killed us with heat steam unless the door was open  which was not an option given we are two ladies who prefer private showers  Noisy  next to the lift  Breakfast room was inadequate for the amount of people staying so get in early to get a table  Milk was almost curdled with warmth   ew  Heating worked  but was totally unnecessary in il  At least the window opened in our cell  
N =>   Okay but not great  The location was good  being very near Victoria Station  which will get you anywhere you need to go in London  and the staff was very nice and helpful  We did have a couple of problems  though  and felt it was a little overpriced  Within the first hour we were there  a light from the ceiling in the bathroom fell and nearly hit my husband in the head  It was fixed while we were out  but the mess from the dry wall wasn t cleaned up well  There also were no instructions on the heating cooling system that we could find  so we spent two nights freezing cold  When we figured out how to get the heat working  the radiator wouldn t get hot so the next day we had to ask again about the heating  Finally on the last night we had heat  They did have free internet access in the lobby  which was very nice to have  
N =>   Good value for money if you re heading for London We stayed as a couple at the Victoria Palace from   th     th ruary  having booked online early in uary  We were looking for reasonable value and comfort  as we didn t expect to be in the hotel much on this visit to the capital  We were travelling by rail into Kings Cross and then by tube onwards  The walk from Victoria to the hotel took      minutes  Check in was from  pm but on arrival at the desk at      am it was no problem  we couldn t go to the room but could leave our bags which was fine  The foyer gave a good impression although not over large  After lunch and afternoon out  we returned to prepare for our theatre visit  Our suitcase had been taken to our room  a double which also had a single bed  The room was adequate in size  fairly recently refurbished and the shower   toilet was good  The room was on the first floor facing the main road  and traffic noise would be an issue if the windows were opened  Access from downstairs was by lift or stairs  As it happened we both slept quite well anyway  The breakfast room is in the basement  There is a reasonable choice to suit most tastes  breads  cereals juice  coffee  tea  Cooked items included boiled  fried or scrambled eggs  beans  tomatoes and toast if required  Bacon or sausages were       optional extras  Service was from      to     am  We arrived about      and had no problems  but      onwards was quite busy  Throughout our stay the staff were pleasant and helpful  We found this a good place to stay because of its access to the centre of London  and we thought it gave good value for the price  We d stay here again without any worries  
N =>   Mushrooms but not much room  The last time my wife and I were in the Victoria area we stayed at the Park Plaza  However  because of several favourable reviews on this site and a very good price through Venere we decided to give the Victoria Palace a try  Unfortunately we were disappointed on the whole The twin room was clean and adecuately equipped but was very small There was no bar  restaurant or room service  The breakfast was self service and unusually bacon and sausages were totally lacking from the menu  Mushrooms seemed to be in plentiful supply but regrettably I don t like mushrooms  The breakfast room staff were very friendly but seemed keen to finish by the      breakfast deadline and the clock was set at least   minutes fast The location of the hotel is quite good at only a few minutes walk from Victoria station but if you enjoy the whole hotel experience of pleasant public areas  bars  other amenities and friendly reception staff then this hotel bears no comparison with the Park Plaza 
N =>   Great place to stay A wonderful place to stay  We had a two bedroom apartment  The rooms were clean the staff was friendly and very helpful   we ordered a pizza late one night I had to argue with the staff that they didn t need to bring it to my door  The hotel is easy walking distance to victoria station and from there anywhere in London  Staying there was a very nice experience 
N =>  Great hotel This hotel is a great place to stay  only    mins from Victoria station  room was clean and perfectly adequate for the   of us  the  quot no sausages etc quot  breakfasts mentioned in other reviews although admittedly slightly odd was not an issue at all   there was more than enough choice in cereals  fresh croissants etc and if needs must you could have sausages or bacon at a little extra costOriginally booked for   nights but due to flight cancellations ended up needing to stay a further   nights   the hotel manager could not have been more helpful  he held his last room for us till we found out whether we needed to stay then upgraded us for no extra charge  without him the flight problems would have undoubtedly caused us far more stress  at least we knew we had a bed for the night We would and probably will at some point  book this hotel again with no hesitations and would thouroughly recommend to anyoneHelen  amp  Mike  Aberdeen 
N =>  Good central hotel I booked this hotel because the location was good and the price was reasonable  When I arrived I was told I d been upgraded  whcih I was thrilled about  However  I was then taken out of the hotel  down the road to a basement flat  It was grubby and not what I wanted at all  I explained that I was alone and did not feel comfortable here and wanted a room in the hotel  Immediately I was taken back and given a nice room  It was in the basement as well and I would have preferred a room higher up  I m not a city girl and was a little uncomfortable  However  the room was at the back and was quiet  Otherwise my stay was perfect  Breakfast was nice  again in the basment   The location was great   easy walking distance to Victoria and the staff pleasant  It was good a place to stay for business and in a muhc nicer area than I expected   wide streets  those lovely big London houses  
N =>   A great small hotel in the midst of London We are so happy with the overall value of this incredibly clean and helpful small hotel  We would go back to them in a heart beat  They accomodated our last minute request for twin beds and helped take our luggage to the room  The room itself was very small but arranged nicely and had all amenities  even air conditioning  unusual for small hotels in London   It was close to Victoria Station and was definitely good value for money  The best part about it was the staff which deserves high marks for helpfulness  even acting as concierge when required  
N =>  Victoria Palace   Great Value   wonderful staff I visited London on my own for a few days in late ruary and wanted a location close to Victoria Station  After reviewing this site and considering the price I booked   nights at the Best Western Victoria Palace  As my flight arrived at      a m   I arrived at the hotel about   hours prior to my official check  in time  Without hesitation  the staff at the reception made every effort to get me into my room early   as it was  I was settled in my room at about      am  The room was bigger than expected  reasonably quiet  very comfortable and clean  The breakfast which was included was very good and hearty  The location was perfect within central London and getting from Gatwick to London and back again using the Gatwick Express couldn t have been easier  I will return to this hotel on my next visit to London as it exceeded my expectations in comparison to other similarly priced hotels in London which I have stayed at KC  
N =>   Too small for the price This hotel though not in a bad location  a little far out of center of town we found to be very expensive for the type of rooms that they have   We paid     GBP which is     usd with breakfast   this with a discount  The room was unbeliveably small  after complaining they put us into a bigger room  type apt  that smelled of indian cooking and looked not finished  It had a bathtub that was buildt under a staircase  meaning no standing while showering   The staff extremely helpful and friendly  The breakfast was typically english  not very good But London itself has become excessively expensive  On this date the euro was   and half times more and the dollar   times  All the attractions are out of price  One adult tkt at the tower of London was   GBP meaning    euros and    usd  Of course all other attractions  restaurants and even public transportation is very expensive  Sorry it will be a long time before we return to London  Won t even mention the tighter security measures in town and at airports  
N =>  Yeah  Victoria Palace  Yes  it s small  very  but since you don t spend a lot of time in your room   it has everything you need  Our room was clean   amp  kept clean   Everyone was extremely helpful  amp  gracious  Extra pillows  towels  hold our bags  which Indian restaurant should we chose  buy tickets from the desk so we don t have to stand in line  ice from the kitchen etc  Travelcards  post cards  amp  stamps at the store opposite the hotel  Victoria Station a    minute walk but even better  Bus     a block  amp      away  Breakfast was standard European  which was just fine  amp  because of the almost useless dollar  saved us a lot of money  We had room      it faced the back courtyard  amp  was quiet enough for us to sleep with the window open  We liked it enough that when we returned I spoke to Best Western Corp to say nice things as well  
N =>  We were put in the dungeon    On arrival the receptionist couldn t find our booking  luckily I had my confimation   We were kept waiting for a while  and then told that we could have a room  after all  and that they would even honour the price I d been quoted   We went down to our room to discover that we were in the basement  The view from our room was of some steps rising to the pavement some     above us  Very dark  amp  dreary  The bedding had seen better days  and the divans were very old Tatty  The hotel states that it had undergone refurbishment  but it looked as they d done it half heartedly  Some things were new  eg good flat screen tv  nice shower  but others hadn t been touched  tatty paint  carpet The bathroom on  st entering looked lovely   quite newly done  But the walls  amp  tiles were very very dirty and mildewy  Could have done with a good bleach  There were no facilities at the hotel  other than a vending machine in the reception I wouldn t return here   but maybe we were unlucky with the room we were given  due to our reservation not being on their system   
N =>   Smallest Cleaneast Noisest room of all time  Smallest room I have ever been in  Very clean  Floors are crooked  so you may sleep on an angle  Very Very Noisy  If you choose to stay there  and I wouldn t recommend it if you want to sleep  Ask for a room AWAY from the street  It is as noisy as if the window was open  because it is on a main street  right at a traffic light  so you get it all  Our room was immaculate  There was free internet   which was a plus  Good location  walk to bus and train station  Just Noisy and small  Did I say clean  It was     Breakfast isn t worth going down to  Go to the local coffee shop  
N =>  Time Travel Back To The      s  This hotel has recently been taken over  amp  is now called  quot Best WesternVictoria Place quot   We decided to book into one of their self ontained quot apartments quot  which is a few doors down  I use the term  quot apartment quot  loosely  It was more like a dingy bedsit I thought I had done a  quot Sam Tyler   Life On s quot   amp  woken up in       We should have seen what was coming when we opened the door only to be met by a rush of heat  the central heating had been left on top temperature   The main enterance lightbulb was also broken  which staff promised to change but didn t   The living areaconsisted of a kitchen  with a broken fridge   cooker  microwave  a very old settee  amp  a single bed shoved in the corner  The antique portable TV complete with wire arial sellotaped to the wall barely picked up grainy images of terrestrial TV  The bath had the strangest tap combination I have ever seen  Someone had glued a cheap shower hose to the taps  amp  then screwed the head onto the sloping ceiling above  This made it completely useless as a shower as it was far too low to stand up   amp  very slow when trying to fill the bath  The walls were paper thin to the point where we could hear everything our upstairs neighbours were doing  including all of their toilet visits Having said all of this  suprisingly it was clean   amp  the bedroom  amp  bed was pleasant  The staff were also very polite  amp  helpful  I just hope that now it has been taken over the new owners put some investement into updating it  
N =>   Loved it    Excellent friendly and helpfull staff  awesome location  room more then excellent  clean  cosy  very safe  wonderfull breakfast  made our visit to London really a pleasant one Would definatelly recommend this hotel to everyone  
N =>   dungeon like room Stayed        Reception staff were friendly but room  like a lot  was below pavement level very small  noisy and of course very little daylight Was also very hot and could not adjust the heating It is very handily located to station but for the money would have expected a better room  
N => Liked it okay but then    Could swear that I wrote a review of this hotel before  but here goes again  Booked   nights here  going to and from London Gatwick    easy   min walk to Victoria Station    Only booked a single with shared bath  but was given relatively large  for London  room with double bed and decent size bathroom    HOWEVER  it was on the TOP floor  SIX flights of stairs  if I counted correctly   which was a HECK of a schlep  Thank goodness I m in decent shape  The tradeoff of having a decent sized  relatively quiet room was worth the climb  No bad smells  clean sheets  hot water fine  Carpet could have used a hoovering  First day  amp  night    fine    out sightseeing the second day  returned around  pm    to find that they had  quot checked me out quot  and packed all of my belongings and stowed them behind the front desk    They didn t bother to check the receipts that said I had PAID  with credit card  for TWO nights  I had quite a fit  which was exacerbated by the fact that the front desk clerk had a pasted on grin which I thought was pretty inappropriate for the situation  Luckily they gave me back the same room    I had hidden my camera equipment behind the spare pillow and they failed to find it when they packed me up  yikes  So in a nutshell  if you get a decent sized room and they don t discharge you involuntarily  it s tolerable and cheap  However  I don t think i ll be taking this risk again  
N =>  A horrible experience Me and my partner booked this hotel on internet for a  nights while we were transit in london since is close to Victoria Station We didnt want luxury but a clean room were to rest bfore and after a long flight The pictures shown on internet made it look perfect for us  When we arrived the reception was unrecognisable  We realised that pictures on the internet and brocheres were of a different hotel  No lift was available and when we got to a room we were disgusted  They gave us the smallest bedroom ever There was no space for our luggage infact we had to put them in bathroom The room stank of cigarettes and it was not welcoming at all We were looking forward for the following day to leave After our   week holiday we went back for another night since we had booked before  This time it was even worse There were workers all around the place  This time we were lucky to be given a room on the  th floor Since there was no lift we had to carry   huge luggages all the way up  The room stank of burned plastic We had to open window becaus we were afraid we would die in our sleep  We covered the door crevices with towels so to block smell and dust  The workers were doing a lift in front of our room and we had cleaners shouting at each other outside our room   When we left hotel we realised that our luggage was covered in fine white dust that had gathered in our room during the night Since luggage was in same room we were in we inhaled the same amount of dust We didnt dare eat breakfast there since they didnt cover toasters and glasses etc The workers were working right next to breakfast room It is a cheap hotel but after i didnt expect they would book us if they knew that they were going to refurbish all   floors  It was a beginning and a sour end to our perfect holiday  
N =>  Niente di straordinario buono per chi sta molto in giro  
N =>   Albergo per chi non   troppo pretenzioso  bruttino ma in ottima posizione   
N =>   Clean room decent price This was a great place to spend our night in transit back to Canada  
N =>   Good enough for my    hour layover I had a short layover in London on my way home to the US  It was decent enough for my needs    clean  well kept  and most importantly for me  it was just around the corner from Paddington station where I had direct access to Heathrow via the Heathrow Express  The major drawback  though tolerable for my circumstance  was the lack of elevator  My room was small but since I was alone  I could deal with it  Had there been   of us  no way   I concur with other reviewers about the breakfast  Also  there was no air conditioning  For me  not a big deal as I prefer fresh air  Would I stay there again  Possibly  I think if the hotel offered an in room mini fridge to where I could store beverages and restaurant leftovers for later snacking  I would be more inclined  
N =>  Won t come back I booked The Beverley City hotel as a last minute act of panic  I wish I had chosen any other London hotel The room was tiny  had a bad smell  the bathroom was filthy  and unhealthy  I am sure   and the breakfast was poor  They ran out of bread    minutes before the breakfast ended  and provided no alternatives   there was nothing else to eat  
N =>   Horrible  Worst hotel experience I can not exaggerate that I experienced my worst hotel stay at the Beverley  The heating only operates between  am   noon  amp   pm   mid  The night we stayed there the outside temp was  c max  I could not shower in the morning as the water was cold  The room was so small we had nowhere to put our bags  Breakfast was horrible  Toast  cordial  budget quality cereal  slices of cheese  ham  amp  boiled eggs  All self serve  As we are vego we could only have the toast  We asked for an alternative meal but they would not provide it  Of course we still had to pay for the breakfast  The towels were old  amp  worn  They had the name of their other Hotel situated in the same street  My guess is that the Beverley gets all the old stuff  The pillows had no spring in them at all  I had a terrible nights sleep  We moved out the next day  amp  went to another hotel down the street  It was much  much better  amp  only cost a little more  Of course they will not refund  amp  insist on payment upfront  They have a sign in the room tell patrons that they will not refund  If you are planning on staying there I would strongly suggest checking the room  amp  dining room first  
N =>  So bad we moved out after day one We had such a bad experience with the Beverley City Hotel that we moved out after the  st day  I will not be advising people to stay there To put it in a nutshell  The heating is on only between  am   noon  amp   pm   midnight  That was a little uncomfortable considering the max outside temp was  c  The room was so small that you could not place a shoe between the bed  amp  the wall  If we placed our bags on the floor we had to step over them as there was nowhere to store them  The bathroom toilet was so small I had to walk in  amp  back out  no room to turn   There was no tea  amp  coffee in the room  If you wanted a tea coffee you had to order it from them at a cost  The pillows were very old  amp  completely flat  They had no spring left in them at all  The towels were old  amp  worn  They had the name of their other Hotel on them  I can only assume the Beverley gets all their old stuff  There was no hot water when I went to take a shower in the morning  Breakfast was self serve  It consisted of cordial  toast    choices of cereal  Cornflakes  Rice Bubbles  amp  Coco Pops   thin slices of cheese  amp  ham  amp  boiled eggs  Everything looked low quality  Because we are vego all we could eat was toast  no jams   We asked if we could pay extra  amp  receive a hot breakfast but we were told they could not do that  The dining room was so small that I had to move the table out to let Karen sit down  I had to move it back so I could sit down  The dining room resembled a pauper soup kitchen in my opinion  Judging by the behaviour of the other guests they were not enjoying the experience as well  We have been used to friendly chats  amp  happy people during breakfast at all the other locations  
N =>  Why did I listen to the good reviews    Despite living in the USA I am British and I felt this hotel had tried too hard to please the American guests  and failed   our room was in a nice old townhouse on a quiet street   mins walk from Paddington tube station  It had new cheap matchy matchy  hampton inn style  furnishings  with a new moulded plastic bathroom  a good safe  a hairdryer in the room and breakfast provided  It was tiny  but cheap  Great I said  Then I remembered there is nothing around Paddington   no real restaurants  pubs  shops  The room was far too tiny to chill out in  so just one nice bar nearby for a drink before bed would have been nice  The breakfast was TERRIBLE  I am not a picky eater and would have been happy with   slices of toast and a mug of tea  but the tea  jam  bread tasted awful    How could they get all that so wrong  We decided to make tea or coffee in our room and then pick up a croissant from a bakery  but there was no coffeepot kettle in the room  unheard of for a british traveller   We even tried to get a glass of wine one night from the sister hotel   doors down  but the wine was bad and it wasn t so much a bar but a hallway and we felt very uncomfortable there  The walls of our room were thin and I was kept awake  so I decided to sleep in and then discovered there was serious building demolition work going on from  am  no one warned us   I would have moved hotels or gone to stay with friends  but we had to pay for our full stay up front  again unheard of for a british traveller   I would tell the hotel to spend less on matching the curtains to the comforter  and more on the teabags and bread  I would advise you to stay somewhere more lively and on a less convenient tube stop  to get more for your money and a better london experience  Staying close to the British Museum Convent Garden is often a good option  
N =>  Crappy but central Stayed here for a week actually Rooms are very small  standard  but ok  The rooms are clean enough  Hotel staff is ok  although we often had to visit the hotel next door for service   guess they cooperate with the other hotels in the area  Breakfast was terrible  We only went to the breakfast room one morning  And to buy breakfast in an expencive restaurant in London each morning  for a week  increases the budget  Anyway  the breakfast was in a dirty little hole in the basement Only a   minutes walk from paddington station Would I stay here again  NOT A CHANCE  You can find both cheaper and better than this Will you ruin your vacation if you ve already booked  Nope  we had a great week anyway Enjoy  or not  
N =>  Basics not working in the Beverley House Hotel The most terrible hotel I ever stayed  The toilet was not working and neither was repaired until   days despite my request and complain  The sheets were not changed  not after the previous hotel guest  and not during the following days  Of course many other things were just ordinary  but as a whole  the hotel management didnt take it seriously to provide the basics for the guests  
N => dump I can t believe this hotel gets   stars it should only get half a star  We had to wait for our room to be ready  even though we didn t show up early for check in  The staff is incompetent or has an attitude  when there is staff around because they also spend time at another nearby hotel  Therefore  no    hour reception  and having to wait long to check out  The rooms are tiny  there isn t enough room for a decent sized microne  They don t keep in mind that tourists stay at hotels  and we need room for our luggage  They forget to bring you towels  which are sometimes torn  yuck  We found a cockroach  double yuck  Their rich breakfast buffet is the worst I ve ever had  how can you call tang orange juice   I can go on but thinking back on this place is making me sick  
N =>   Tr s bonne surprise   
N =>   Reasonable We went to this hotel due to the price we paid The hotel is very secure you have to ring a bell and they let you in through the CCTV camera s on the door  We stayed on the  th floor room number     It was abit small but VERY reasonable it was suitated on the back of the hotel over looking other houses   but this did not both us  There is only stairs no lift  so i would not recommend this hotel to anyone with mobility issues as we struggled up them and we are both in our early    s   The breakfast is RUBBISH that what does let it down  you have to ask if you want Tea or coffee and you either have a cooked of   sausage    bacon    hashbrown and   fried egg Which is all nearly cold  but it takes    minutes to get to you   It s lucky that there is a starbucks down the road on Oxford street for my tea But i would stay here again just due to location and the price  
N =>   Warning  This hotel should be closed  It s dirty  does not function when it comes to drainage in the bathroom  staff that barely speeks english  it is just not okay    They are in for the money   but don t really know howe to run a hotel  
N =>  Awful We came to check us in for one booked night but the receptionist dont know anything and offer us to single disgusting rooms for   persons in which we did not booked then left the hotel to eat some food  Then when we came back he told us that we were booked on another hotel some blocks away  so we took a cab due to it was late in the evening  Sadly we also had already booked   more nights the next week  I dont want to make some troubles so we came back to check us in and we got our booked suite for   persons  It smells sponge this hotel  The floors squeeks when you go on it  The stairsways is awful and have that sponge smell  The door to the restaurant squeeks everytime someone opens it and we can hear it in our room  It really bothers us  They dont have service minded people  We never got a smile  They only have one fan for   rooms and it was very warm in the room without fan and it was    degrees outside  The breakfast was not OK due to the waitress forgot this and that  
N =>   Dirty and disgusting This hotel has nothing but its location going for it  It smells horrible  is dirty  has a couple of really ugly cats running around which looked like they had flees  curtains that were not attached to the windows  There was a kettle and tea bags in the room but no mugs cups and my friends room had mugs but not kettle or tea bags Completetly over priced and should really only have  star   if that  I would NOT reccomend it to anyone   
N =>   Simply awful  When I checked in to the Hotel  I found mains flex dangling from the ceiling as I went up the stairs to my room  a ladder  power drill and vacuum cleaner in the small hallway  which had four rooms leading off of it   a wet towel on the back of the chair  a large wet patch on the carpet  presumably where the previous guest had dried themselves off after showering   the door to the shower cubicle didn t close flush  the radiators didn t appear to work  and there was only one pillow So overall  I wouldn t recommend this to anyone unless they were desperate  
N =>   rubbish we booked this thinking it was a good   star hotel  but once we arrived our room wasn t ready and there was cats running around inside  i must say that it is a good location in london but i would rather to go further out of london  the rooms are dirty but at least the sheets were clean  the door in the bathroom wouldn t lock and the toilet leaked  the floor boards creaked  the curtins wouldn t close  oh ya the staff were nice but useless  they don t know a thing about london  
N =>  Would rather sleep with the rats on the street We arrived at just after  pm at night and from the outside I thought I had done well  I booked through hotels com after finding one to suite my needs for   nights  I walked in and the smile soon changed I have never seen such a pig sty   sorry but that s putting in mildly   the ammount of dust and grim in the carpets was truly shocking I walk through to reception but it got no better before I siged in I requested to see the room I was taken to room    and well I think if the carpets had ever seen a hoover it did not show  The bed was unmade and there was even a old sock on the floor I told them straight it was not suitable  I was going to be shown another room but I had decided that I would ask for a refund and seek accomodation elsewhere  We did get a full refund but only after I told the duty manager what a  quot pigsty it was quot  Everywhere you look in this hotel needs attention I question on how they got   stars I would not give it    Never in you baddest dream would you dream of staying in here  I have just one word to say about  quot The Bickenhall Hotel  quot  and that is avoid     
N => Bickenhall blues I guess as a Canadian  I am not used to older hotels so I love the ambience of an older but clean hotel  This was not one with beds that are    years old and dirty showers that dripped all nightit was disgusting  When we first arrived the receptionist was less than friendly there appeared to be  quot regulars quot  including a moustached woman  hanging around and the lobby had filthy old couches in it  Our room had a teeny tv and one of the beds was an old cot that was held together I am sure by dust mites  We were afraid to eat breakfast the next morning and never even checked it out since there was no dining room in site  The only good thing  the location was great for the subway  
N =>   Shocking Absolutely shocking is the only way I can describe this hotel We though we would  overlook  the bad reviews on this site   they must have been having a bad day or something Everything was going well  We arrived   checked in and made our way up to our room which was on the  th floor  Carpet was in need of replacement  but not too bad However as we started to look around we could see a few problems  There seems to be a bit of a damp problem or something as the paper and paint seemed to be coming away from the walls ceiling  Made a note to myself not to wear high heels on the way out that afternoon as the carpet on the loft staircase was nearly threadbare and the banister not attached very well to the wall  On our way across the landing there were   bottles of Becks   one unopened  one half empty against the wall  They remained there for the whole   days we were there  alongside the hoover which seemed to have no permanent storage  If it did it was never put away   The room was OK  we think we were in the right one as one of the numbers was missing   In need of a good paint but clean enough with a good view  The bathroom wasn t great however  There was grime in the bottom of the toilet   obviously too old now to be scrubbed off  The sink wasn t properly attached to the wall and was wobbly  You couldn t lean on it as it was held only by a bit of sealer and the pipes behind it  The light fitting was hanging out of the ceiling and you could see the wires  ided it would be best to have a shower with the door open to reduce the chance of electrocution  Shower did have good power and the water was always hot We noticed that the pillows on the bed were those thin ones that you usually get when you go abroad so on the way out that night I asked the receptionist if she could sent a couple of extra pillows up for us  She politely told us that we could have extra pillowcases but no pillows  Little bit strange but decided not to persue it as she obviously didn t speak much English  I ended up with a folded up blanket under my head that night and other half used his fleece Breakfast was served until   am  We headed down about      to be greeted by lovely cat food in a bowl right next to the entrance to the breakfast room  After looking at what other people in the room were eating we decided that we would have cornflakes and toast  The breakfasts were swimming in grease and didn t really look like they had been cooked using the greatest of ingredients  The cornflakes never arrived  Probably due to the language barrier I think  The toast was ok   more bread than toast but edible We packed and made a fairly swift exit after that There is more I could say but I ve waffled on for long enough now  Simple conclusion   don t bother  Don t waste you time or your money  
N =>   Excellent Customer Service I couldn t believe how nice the hotel manager was  The room we had was on the first floor  and its was very suitable as I had   kids The room had one room inside our room so we had our privacy also our kids were with us aswell  There was   double bed in our rooms which they kindly changed my kids ones to two singles I never tasted full english Breakfast before and its was delicious  Nice cozy breakfast room aswell This is an old victorian property so obviously it does look old but I liked it as it seems so british to stay in this hotel and not like the other hotels which are Posh We went to England to see british things and this is definately So BRITISH hotel Liked it    loved it     would definately go there again    
N =>   Okay could have been better We spent   nights at the Bickenhall  The location was good  Bus stop literally outside the front door  Baker street tube station just a short walk away  as well as pubs and restaurants  Rooms are a little rough looking  Globes on lights missing  wall paper peeling  etc  We were on the  rd floor and the floors were squeaking pretty much every step we took  I felt bad for those below us  The shower in our room wouldn t turn off  We had to get a staff member to come up   times to turn it off  There was a tricky way of turning it off  I m sure a plumber wouldn t figure it out  English breakfast was OK  the staff serving were very friendly  
N => Be Aware Be Very Aware     Some good points first  great location only  mins to Baker Street Tube station   min walk to ble Arch and bus stop outside hotel door  Full English Breakfast was freshly cooked each morning  My room was of good size and ensuite was clean  as was the bed linen My room was on  th floor but there is no lift  not suitable for some less able folk than I  Wall paper and paint were peeling in many places  Carpets were as if blackened by coal  getting dirtier as you ascend the stairs  Once you hit  rd floor  the floorboards begin to creak and become embarassing to walk on from  rd floor staircase up  The stairs becomes narrower and gloomier the higher you proceed  Debris was littering the hallways of top   floors  broken sink andplinth  mop  stepladders  storage boxes  Door next to mine No    had no door handle or lock  kept ajar with occupant s slipper or piece of clothing  My bed was ready for the skip and my floorboards must have deafened and annoyed the guests below me  Check out my candid pics for visual confirmation  
N => old and noisey filthy old carpets  needs big overhall  stayed at front of house and it was so noisey from passing traffic  loose floorboards and tiles in bathroom  breakfast was alot to be desired as everything tasted of fish  cats feeding bowls on view in kitchen  too many cats about  however not in the rooms  there is no lift and no offer of help from staff to transport luggage  it was in a very good location and moderately priced  would not recommend it for couples  more suited to hen  stag parties  
N =>   Cant beat the Location I was a bit nervous reading the previous reviews about this hotel as I am allergic to cats and my   month pregnant sister was travelling with me and had concerns about toxoplasmosis  However Bickenhall wasnt bad  The sheets were clean as was the bathroom and we got a good workout everytime we climbed the stairs as there was no lift  This place is screaming for a make over  Floor boards are creaky  we thought Riverdance was being performed in the room above us   and there are one or two cats but not in the bedrooms  I would recommend this place to a group of guys or girls but not so much to couples or eldery people  You cannot beat the central location or the price and the staff were very friendly  
N => Dirty Dirty carpets on stairs and in the rooms we stayed in  Bed cover was stained but the sheets were ok  Bathroom in first room was very small  Second room loose bathroom floor tiles  Hotel was very smelly due to the smokers  Would like to point out that due to the amount of cats mentioned in another review I received flea bites  However breakfast was very enjoyable and the location was great  
N =>   Avoid this Hotel Bus stop right outside  noise from traffic all night  hotel is old and dirty  Was     a night  not worth it in my opinion 
N =>  Situated perfectly for visitors I recently stayed at Bickenhall hotel  It was situated in just minutes walk from Oxford Street or even edgware road  With the price they offered me made my trip to london even better  
N =>   Numerous stairs awful even after being guaranteed a lower floor room We enjoyed Kevin and his interesting take on the local scene  He was a gracious host The breakfast selection was fine and the food was nicely presented We had requested a room on the lower floors because my wife had just gone through a complete knee replacement  Unfortunately that did not work out  And on our return trip late in our trip we were relegated to an even higher floor after making a request for the lowest floor  We did have very noisy neighbors on our first visit and had to beat on the wall at   am for them to get quiet  
N =>   A good location for a city trip Some disappointment with this hotel  which although very well sited for a city break to London  was more of a B amp B  than a hotel The room was clean and of an adequate size Tea  amp  coffee facilities were available but had to be picked up from a cupboard  Nowhere to safely plug in kettle A change of towels was only  quot permitted quot  every three days  Despite our leaving very damp towels out in the bathroom after the second day  on returning to our room the next afternoon and finding the same damp towels hung again on the non heated towel rail  The breakfast although continental  was limited Very close to Pimlico underground No lift so beware of the stairs  
N =>  Location hospitality   the Blades has it all Prior to leaving for London I did exhaustive research on hotels in the city  I became more and more apprehensive about where to lodge after reading so many bad reviews of almost every hotel  Price and location didn t seem to matter  We finally booked a room at the Blades Hotel  which did have quite a few good reviews  but in spite of this I think I held my breath all the way from Memphis to London in anticipation of what we might find when we arrived  Thankfully we were pleasantly surprised upon arriving at a quaint  clean    th century establishment  The room was spacious enough for my husband and myself  no large storage drawers but did have clothes rack with hangers    the ensuite shower was full size with plenty of hot water and good water pressure  the sink was tiny but cute and served it s purpose  and we were lucky enough to get a room with french doors opening onto a small balcony  no patio furniture but the view of the street and the night breeze were nice   The daily breakfast was wonderful and included crumpets  toast  cheese  yogart  granola  fruit  cereal  juice  cold turkey and ham  and coffee and tea  I may have forgotten one or two items   Although I love most things English I couldn t have suffered the traditional fry up that some B amp B s offer  Best of all was our host  Kevin  He communicated with me prior to our arrival  which helped set my mind at ease  and was a most pleasant cordial host throughout our stay  One of my fondest memories of our trip are our breakfast conversations with Kevin and the other guests  whether advising us about our sightseeing plans  discussing history or enlightening us with stories of England and the Royal Family  There is no lift but we were able to stay on one of the lower floors  The heating was very adequate  I m not sure if the hotel is airconditioned  We stayed there in ch when we didn t need it  There is no    hours reception but we advised Kevin of any needs at breakfast  car hire for the airport  etc   and our request was handled swiftly  During our stay we encountered three other visitors from the states  One of them had been there one week and had already changed hotels three times and the other two were staying at places that they didn t sound too enamored of and were paying quite a bit more than we were  Having a good place to stay put our fears to rest and allowed us to really enjoy our stay  We are so grateful that we choose The Blades  I only hope that we can return so that we can stay there again and we would certainly recommend it to anyone  From all that we had read and heard about concerning hotels in London we feel like we found a treasure  
N =>   Great budget hotel If you want a reasonably priced hotel which is clean  friendly and close to a tube station look no further than this one  It is always a bit of a risk choosing a budget hotel in London but this one will not disappoint as long as you appreciate that you are getting what you pay for  If you want   star go and pay over the odds somewhere else but otherwise this is excellent value for money From check in to check out the staff could not have been more helpful  the room was clean and a good size and the bathroom  though small  was perfectly adequate Breakfast was a jovial experience with Kev telling jokes and imparting his vast knowledge of London to his guests  There was very much a family atmosphere even to the extent that he produced a cake with candles for a litttle girl who was celebrating her  th birthday and we all sang  Happy Birthday   Great fun  There was a good choice of cereals  cheese  cold meat  bread and crumpets to choose from so no need to go hungry All in all  I would definitely recommend this hotel both for convenience  it is only a   minute walk from Pimlico tube station  and value  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay  
N =>   Great experience Loved Kevin We stayed   nights at Blades after recommendation from this site and others  We had the family room on the main floor and it was perfect for us  The hotel appeared clean and breakfast was great  We mentioned to Kevin that we were going to Paris on the Eurostar the next morning and he offered to hale a cab for us  He told us to come to breakfast at      and we would need to take a cab at about      to make our train  Breakfast is not usually served until       but he said just come down early  He was reallly great  we really enjoyed our stay there at Blades hotel  
N =>  Would definately stay again My daughter and I went to London for the first time and was looking for a place that was reasonable and close to the tourist attractions  The Blades Hotel was just what the doctor ordered  not only was the staff great but the other guests were friendly and it was more of a family atmosphere than a hotel atmosphere  We stayed eight days with no regrets Kevin and Lydia were the perfect hosts and we were treated as family  This is a Victorian Hotel that is not ultra modern or ultra swank but if you are looking for a nice  clean and safe place to stay this is the place for you  Our intention was not to spend much time in our room and we did not  Public transporation is just a short walk away both the bus and underground  Musems  the Palace and other London Landmarks are within walking distance I was not disappointed because I did take into account all the reviews on this site  For us there were no surprises  I am planning to return to London in the not too distant future and I will not hesitate to stay at the Blades again  
N => Less than a budget hotel  I d say a bit above camping  We read the reviews at great length on TripAdvisor and even heard this property was in one of Rick Steve s books  We knew it was a budget hotel but nothing prepared us for what we experienced  To give you a sense of our comparison  a budget hotel to us would be one like Motel     Blades was well below that  I d rank the property a bit over camping   certainly not a budget hotel in American standards  And we paid nearly      per night there First the good and there s not much here The location was great  Near   tube stops  However  most of London to be easy to get around in from almost anywhere   but Victoria Station is a major thoroughfare and convenient as all other reviews stated   There are many budget properties in this area   not sure how they were to stay at  but there seems to be many options  In addition  we had a problem with tickets to the theater that we couldn t use and the staff offered to post a notice about that  Here are the issues we encountered with Blades  There is no air conditioning in the hotel  so our windows were open  One of the windows had to be held up by a book as it did not remain open on its own  Also  it rained   out of the   days we were in London and so the room was somewhat damp   It was noisy at night  We stayed on the fist floor in the back of the hotel and on an alley  We heard animal noises most nights    We were given a bath towel and a hand towel for each of us  There were   of us in the room  The towels were supposed to be changed every   days  The towels we received were frayed and thin  With only one rack outside the bathroom and   hooks to hold the towels  enough for   towels to be held and aired out to dry  and the humidity in the room  we were never able to completely dry the towels out   Although our towels should have been changed on the  rd day  they weren t  I believe we only had one set our entire stay  We were at the property   days  Had we had a new set  we would have had dry towels on our  rd day  This was not the case   Cleaning service did not come one day  By the time we returned to our room and realized they didn t clean  it was too late to do anything  There is only one key given to us for the room  There were   of us and we split up on occasion  The one s  without the key had to ring the bell to get an employee to open the Main door  There are no phones in the rooms so you couldn t call your party to open the main door   The sink drained very slowly  We had to constantly turn the water off while washing or brushing our teeth so as not to flood the floor  which of course  we couldn t have wiped up  as we had a limited ration of towels   There was no closet and not cabinet or dresser to put our clothes in  I have added a picture of the rod that was up against one wall and out in the open  This was what was to be used to hang clothes  In a room for   there were    hangers upon our arrival  We requested more and got them with no problem  but the rod was still too small for all of our items  We were there for   days and had to live out of our luggage   Breakfast was very basic and open until       This isn t      American standard where you can come in at      and be served  It meant that at      they began clearing away the food  You needed to come down and finish by       Just something worth noting  On one occasion  we requested information about the theater district  I know the staff aren t supposed to be concierges however  we where led to the pay phone and told we could find our answer by calling out of the phone book  We didn t even know where to start   Our window never completely shut  It was on an angle so that there was always an open gap   We had a flight at      in the morning and needed to be at the airport at     am  We abided by the request of the hotel to have them order the taxi the day before  The day before at breakfast  we did request a taxi from one of the ladies who worked in the hotel  Just out of a whim  I also asked for the phone number so we could confirm  Low and behold at midnight when we returned to our room and I checked in the with taxi company I learned no cab was ordered for us nor available  I then called the manager owner who took care of getting us another taxi  So glad she was there and answered the phone  Another taxi came early in the morning  Had I not called to confirm  we might have not gotten to the airport on time  We only received   hours of sleep that night   The owner manager of the property told us the fare for the taxi would be    pounds  When our driver got to us  he turned the meter on and told us that any cab before      in the morning did not offer the    pound fare    it was instead    pounds When we left the lady in charge  Noreen knew about our problems and offered a   night complementary stay on our next visit  As we would never stay at this property again  I instead asked her to credit us on our e trip  I was told that wasn t going to happen  Noreen felt that I should have highlighted more of our issues to her throughout our stay so she could have fixed them   It s a wonder she felt that there were enough problems to offer us free nights on our next visit but wouldn t take care of this one  We would never go back to this hotel Overall  we were very disappointed in the property  We came off a       week trip finishing in London  which turned out to be quite a let down  After reading the reviews on Trip Advisor we were expecting a warm welcome  assistance with our London trip  clean hotel and a small bathroom  We did receive the small bathroom  yet the other things expected were not there  
N =>  Typical European Hotel We loved the manager  he entertained us at breakfast every day  which was basic fare  but decent and free   But  one woman in particular was not very pleasant  There is no lift in the hotel and there are    quot stories quot    so beware  The rooms are small and the bathrooms are very small  but like the manager said   this is Europe  If you want large accomodations then stay in America  Overall extremely average  but with the incredible prices in London  not unbearable  
N =>  Saintly service I am embarrassed that it has taken me so long to write this review given the remarkable stay we experienced at the Blades  My husband and I toured London for   days prior to our wedding in Inverness  London  notorious for outrageous hotel prices  offers few acceptable budget options  We found the Blades a perfect fit   great location  great price  great breakfast  clean  and nice people  We discovered just how nice when my wedding dress  shipped in advance of our arrival  failed to turn up  Online and American postal systems were unable to find it and could provide us with no useful information  Kevin  the Blades  manager  immediately sprung into action  spent a ridiculous amount of time on the phone  and was able to locate my dress at an airport outside of the city held up in customs  Having no knowledge of the intricacies of the British postal service and customs  we would have never been able to find the dress on our own  This is the type of service I expect but rarely receive at a   star hotel  We cannot thank Kevin enough for his generousity  We hope to return to London soon and will most certainly choose to stay at the Blades  
N =>  Worked for us We were happy to have experienced a real British hotel  A great location for walking or tube  Small  yes but typically so  We did speak to an English traveller who repeatedly uses the hotel when in London  We rebooked for a couple nights after a side trip  Our second room was one with a sink you could rest your head on when on the toilet  Wouldn t work if you are overweight  But the beds and furnishing were adequate  I called it much better than camping  We just didn t want to spend more than    pounds  The continental breakfast was fine  Only saw the manager once  but the two young workers were very pleasant  We went to the White Swan on Vauxhall Bridge Road nearby for pub food  It has a non smoking area  which many don t  
N =>  great place to stay  We stayed at the Blades Hotel on   separate nights during our trip to England  The room and bathroom were very small  but clean  You basically get what you pay for  We asked for a single room with double bed ensuite  the smallest that they have  to accomodate   people  and it was fairly adequate for us  The only downside was that it was at the top of the hotel and we had to walk up   flights of stairs  Be sure to pack light or not to have any difficulty with walking  The breakfast was tasty and there was a good selection of buffet foods  
N =>  Great location  My friend and I just returned from   nights in London at Blades  We found the facilities fully adequate for our budget  and the staff at Blades to be extremely helpful Prior reviews noted concerns about sheets and towels not being changed with the same frequency as anticipated per US standards  Upon check in  we received a sheet which detailed their policy  in accordance with the British Automobile Association ratings  and this did not cause us any problems  While our room was ample  the bathroom was somewhat small by American standards  but extremely clean and newly refurbished  Both Kevin the manager and Michael the owner were extremely friendly and eager to make suggestions to improve our time in London  The location of the hotel in the Pimlico area was very convenient to the Underground and breakfast was delicious  Since London was extremely expensive  take advantage of the breakfast at Blades and you will save money on lunches  
N =>  Great Hotel Stayed at the Blades for   nights in y       It was great  the staff friendly and very helpful  Kevin the manager  was most accomadating in allowing us to store some extra stuff while we were off to Paris for a week  Furthermore  he was very entertaining during breakfast and gave great advice as to how to get to Waterloo Station   cab  not public transportation   what to see and what not to waste time on   Yes  the rooms are small and the baths even smaller and the TV is miserable  but it s london  The Best Western two blocks away was   times the price and I suspect the room were not much bigger   
N =>  I don t think I would stay there again My husband and me just came back from our little London vacation  We spent   nights at the  Blades Hotel   near the Victoria station   I would like to share few comments with the others  because for us it was an unpleasant surprise   When we arrived we discovered that there are no phones in the rooms  We were irritated because by paying      per night  may be not horribly expansive  but still not very cheap  we did not expect that have a phone in the room should be a problem   We have stayed in a number of European s hotels  but I have never seen such a tiny bathroom  In order to pull up your pants or if you need to dry yourself up with a towel after the shower  you have to open the door into the room  because it s not possible otherwise   We stayed there for   nights and our bed sheets were not changed even ones      The towels were changed on the  th day of our stay        Of course there are some good things to say  location is perfect  breakfast is good  staff is friendly and helpful  
N =>   This was the dirtiest and poorly maintained hotel I have ever seen  I was shocked by the room we had booked  The carpet was so filthy and smelly  we kept our shoes on all the time  Sheets had been nailed crudely to cover up the bedheads  and the shower curtain had rusty nails holding it up  The next night we asked for a better room  which was cleaner  but I would never grace this hotel s doorstep again  A lesson learned about budget hotels in London  We overheard   other parties requesting different room during our   night stay  
N =>   Believe nothing of what you read After reading all these terrible reviews I was really shocked  I had booked the hotel earlier and I didn t know what to do  Finally  I decided to go to the hotel but I was prepared for the worst  Fortunately  I was positively surprised  The room was quite nice  the windows were open  the bathroom was clean  The TV  fridge and hairdryer worked  We spent   nights there  We left the room every morning and we came back in the evening but I could notice that the room was cleaned every day  Every morning we had continental breakfast which was toasts  butter  different kinds of jam cornflakes and tea  coffee or juice to drink  That was enough for us till lunch  For my son the breakfast was very tasty  Also the service in the hotel was very nice and the same I want to say about the manager   a very helpful man  To be honest  however  I must admit that the curtains in our room were extremely dirty  That was my first visit in London and next time I am going to stay in the same hotel  
N =>   horrible and lying staff i really despise this hotelroom advertised at    i reserved it with cardwhen i got there the evening was told       i had no other options so had to take iti was charged a fiver for wirelesswhich upon turning on laptop did not worki came down was not granted a refund i was told there was no reception on that floorwhat  he should have told me before charging me a fiverpatheticshower is IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOMnothing at all to seperate it from the roomhorrible horrible manky hotelavoid please 
N =>   Disgusting hotel On arriving at the hotel we were led to an attic room which was dirty  The toilet was on a floor below and looked as if it had never been cleaned   When we complained we were asked for     each night to upgrade   friends with us had also upgraded but were only charged     for their entire stay     nights as opposed to our     we were told we had booked ecomony   I didnt have a choice when booking    Breakfast for us wasnt included in the booking so we paid     for continental breakfast which was rice crispies  weetabix or cornflakes  self served from tuperware containers  the milk was served in jugs that had broken and chipped lips  and one toast rack of toast  The coffee was tepid  The kitchen staff were Polish and our last morning was spent listening to them argue loudly   yelling at each other between ktichen and dining room  I am sure if the hotel  if you could call it such  was inspected it would be closed down due to serious health and safety risks   
N =>   Do not go here  Offered a room in the attic with shower in the middle of the room  so high up we could have cleaned the chimneys  The toilet was disgusting We  upgraded  to a double room with a double bed an a single bed  Wardrobe had no doors  curtains needed hooks  pelmet missing  door to ensuite didn t close  expelair was ready to take off   i could go on Lethal stairs to  dining room   Light fittings bare wires and staff who entertained us by yelling at each other Fawlty Towers  Bring back Basil  
N =>  Just be warned We were booked for three nights but didnt stay for any  Room was not only small but we had to clamber over dirty linen to get to it down in the basement  The bathroom was very small and in the bedroom there was nowhere for our suitcases  The view from the only window was of the hotel refuse bins  Were offered another room at extra cost but declined  The only redeeming factor was that they refunded all but the first night  Booked on recommendation of NZ friends but obviously they got a better deal than what we were offered  Thank goodness for cell phones I say as we were able to find something far better quite easily  
N =>   Clostrafobic   and dirty  When we arrived i thought it was a joke it wasn t we arrived in the bedroom and the windows were left open and it s not the best thing in uary the central heating wasn t really working anyway we were provided by an electric heater that we manage to put close to the bathroom  there s no heating in the bathroom  and tried to warm the room cos taking a shower wasn t a pleasure   dripping water and cold place took me    min just to wash my hair we decided to have a tea as we spotted the kettle put the tea bags were full of dirt and dry looking and there were only one  broken  cup we managed anyway to clean the kettle get some tea bags from the shop and cups from the restaurant   problem was that you had to decide if having a cup of tea or keep the heater on as there were only one plug The pillow covers were a bit   dirty looking and i had to sleep with   duvets as i was freezing Really really cold Breakfast was    crap and the place were overcrowded you had either standing and wait for other people to finish or just skip breakfast as we did I would not recomend this place to anybody seriously We are usually very adaptable people but this was a nightmare   
N =>   Dirty and Grubby Recently stayed at Blair Victoria  Really is a dirty depressing  grubby little hotel  Rooms small  dirty and smelly  Refused the  st room they showed me   nd not much better  but very tired so took it  Do not stay  Be warned    
N => 		  Dirty Floors  Full Trash Cans Never emptiedThe bed I have to admit had fresh bedding but the shower and hand basin did not look as though it had been cleaned in months It was the dirtiest place we have ever stayed and we really think that it should not have even   star never mind    Who said it was decent enough to be run as a hotel   We really think this is one hotel  that needs to be removed from the listing  
N =>   Really Horrible     Don t even think about it    It s the worst hotel I ve ever stayed in  As soon as I got in I was shocked  The stairs leading to the room were so narrow and old that I was afraid I d fall and I could barely lift my luggage  The room is so tiny  I could barely stand and there was no space to leave my suitcase  The bathroom was really small and smelly and the furniture so old    I was appaled  The first night I couldn t even sleep  fearing someone could come in  The service was really bad and breakfast     I won t even comment on that  Searching for a cheap hotel doesn t mean having to put up with all the rudeness and the filth in there  I d rather pay some extra pounds next time than staying in such a disgusting hotel again  And it wasn t that cheap anyway  considering its size and conditions  Some reviews giving    to it make me wonder     Anyway  JUST DON T STAY THERE      
N =>   Dont Stay here  This hotel was way below standards  We were given the worst room  The toilet and the shower were attached  It smelled and was very dark  We were sent across the street  in the basement  Their ad says they have internet  it was in the main building so my children couldnt go unless I was with them  very busy street  We were promised we could move into the main building the next night for the rest of our stay  they said the rooms are much nicer and was not in the basement  I wanted a discount for the  not nice room quot  for the night we stayed in it  they would give us nothing  They admitted it was not nice across the street Tudor Inn  the name  But they sent us there anyways  no refunds nothing  Be warned this place is awful     
N =>  DEFINITELY FIND SOMEWHERE ELSE      Don t stay at this Hotel   it s dirty  a fire trap and the photos are NOT WHAT IT IS REALLY LIKE    BE WARNED   Find somewhere else   pay a bit more   you won t regret it Also our room was across the road and we were asked to bring our key back each time we life   sorry  not normal practice We didn t sleep there   found another place just around the corner    Lesley from Brisbane  Australia 
N =>  where not to stay poor quality hotel with safety issues windows held open by bits of wood sash type location good seemed more like a night shelter  
N =>   Cannot be described as a Hotel This really is the worse hotel we have ever stayed in  We booked for one night    rd ember    The photos on their website all look very pleasing  but dont be fooled like us  We arrived at       in the morning  dropped out bag off without inspecting the room  Arrived back at the Hotel at      in the evening and was given our room key   Room    Well what greeted us can only be described as a total slum  Our room was Tiny  Cold  Damp  Smelly  Not to mention the filth   looked like it had not been cleaned for some considerable time   One pillow had blood staines      Well the best bit excluding the bathroom was the state of the hair dryer  The plug at some time had over heated and burnt the wire  thus exposing live wires  When I pulled the cable the wires fell out of the plug   After complaining we were transferred to Room     Slightly better but still filthy  curtain rail was hanging off  bathroom was very small and really needed a good clean  The carpets and walls were dirty as was the cups  kettle  etc  Not a very nice place to spend a night  In the morning we made our way to the restaurant for breakfast  Well you had to se it to believe it  The restaurant   if thats what it can be called   is down a narrow flight of stairs in the basement of thebuilding  The carpets covering the stairs  like all the others withing the hotel are thread bare and filthy  But nothing compared the the restaurant  The cups  plates  knives  forks  table cloths are discusting  The dust on the chairs was so thick you could write your name in it  Check it out if you do visit this place  look for D  amp  A on one of the chairs   We just turned around and walked out After getting our bag we went to recepting to complain  Well the chap who denied he was the manager was totally rude and totally dismissed us as being fussy  My wife told him that we had taken photes of the filth around the place whic really did not go down very well with him  We were actualyy physically pushed out of the door and had it slammed behind us    Can you believe it    a hotel pusing you out because you complain about the filth   Well I went back into the hotel to voice my oponion about having a door slammed behind me and was then told by the chap   who says he is not the manager   that we are only complaining because we are Racist      Yes we are a White British Couple  and yes he is of Asian origin  but at no time was that mentioned or more to the point should he have accused us of being racist  Please anyone who is considering a stay in London  dont at any cost stay at this hotel  We have since been refunded our money via the booking company who we booked with  I just wish we had looked at the feedback from other Trip Advisors  
N =>   Disgusting insecure smelly fleapit What a disgusting place  Don t believe the photos they publish  my wife and son refussed to stay there after being shown the room  It was insecure  smelley and just plain shoddy and dirty I spoke to the  quot manager quot  and he agreed with their comments but told me he could not refund the night they paid for as it was the booking comany s policy Lies    I actually got the booking fee refunded  they told me it was the hotel who were responsible for the rest  Of course they refused when I later wrote to them I am British and ashamed that anyone visiting England should have to stay in diabolical conditions like this  especially as it s not so cheap  there are much better places around Take my advice folk and give this a WIDE berth and look for other places  RIP OFF merchants who deserve to be made to clean up their act before anyone stays there  
N =>  Bnb not a Hotel Its a BnB of the lowest standard not a Hotel      it should not have any rating    as it was filthy and definately the worst place I ever stayed in  The room we stayed in was nothing like what is shown on their website    misleading advertising I would call it   The room we stayed in was disgusting    the shower had tiles falling off    filthy bedspread     the view from the window was of a stone wall    then a queue to get in for breakfast in the morning     Anyone thinking of staying here    my advise is dont  
N =>  it wasn t as bad as the reviews say  I needed somewhere cheap and central to stay so I could go to a club  so I booked this hotel as a late deal for      for the room   To be honest  I m not entirely sure this was a  deal  so much as the going rate  but for the location I didn t mind paying my share  After booking the room I read the reviews here  and obviously I didn t have very high hopes  Our room was in the basement facing the street  the bed was under the window which I presume was single glazed as the night got a little chilly and there was a bit of outside noise  But there was plenty of sheet layers to keep me warm  and I had quite a decent night s sleep  I imagine it could be quite chilly in winter  The room was small and basic  There was an open cupboard  tea making facilities  although I wouldn t drink those open teabags if you paid me  and a telly  Wouldn t be very suitable for people there longer than one night as there wasn t any space for cases  Cleanliness was alright actually  The bathroom certainly did seem clean  and the shower  in a separate room to the bed   really didn t seem so bad  The bathroom light had what seemed to be a  watt bulb in though  so you had to use the facilities in the dark at night  The staff were fine  The reception is   hrs  and although you have to hand your key in  there isn t a curfew  There was someone there when I trundled in at     am the next day  I wouldn t necessarily go back there in a hurry  but for one night it was absolutely fine  be a little below average  but you can t beat it for being a  minute walk from Victoria  There s plenty more hotels around that area to check out before I consider The Blair Hotel again  
N => Nightmare Blair Victoria          Our hotel was a nightmare  We were put across the street to another motel  Golden Star  that we had booked in  People trafficing in and out all night  doorbell ringing all night   we could not understand the purpose for a doorbell in a part of a hotel where there was no staff at all  Very small untidy rooms  For example there was not space for one small person in the toilet if the door was closed There was nothing in the room  not even soap  Got a kettle after requesting it  but no cups or coffee or anything  Wonder if you were expected to drink directly from the kettle Another odd feature was there was a room without number  Still the door was going all the time  Interesting feature as well was that my room had a shover in the living room  No door in front  but naturally there was a fitter carpet  that can suck a lot of water I believe  Checkout at        leftluggage at the reception costs       per bag  Robbery especially as the shoebox rooms costs about     Petri Syrj l TampereFinland 
N =>  Avoid this place  I stayed here   night in      with my    yr  old daughter  amp  her friend  We had   rooms  mine was a tiny single at the top of some very narrow  steep  dark stairs no lift  we could barely get our luggage up   The girls  room was a little larger  but they did not like it at all  It was drab  amp  the bathroom sink would not work properly  If I had been by myself  I would have stuck it out for the   nights I had booked   amp  prepaid    but the girls were so unhappy thatthe next day I walked down the street  amp  found a hotel that was cheaper  nicer  amp  friendlier  also they had a lift    The Blair Victoria refused to refund me for the  nd night  amp  were very rude about it as well  By that point  I just wanted to get out of there  amp  never see it again  We moved down the street  amp  enjoyed our  nd night in London in a fresh  clean hotel at a bargain rate  Avoid the Blair Victoria at all costs  There are too many decent hotels in London to put up with this  
N => The worst ever The rooms are small  dirty  windows can not be fully closed and the bathroom is not big enough for    years old child  When i saw the breakfast i went to eat in fastfood    I ve also never seen so arrogant stuff How can they call it  quot hotel quot     I ll never return there  Only recommend it to your enemies  
N =>  everything was OK  We spend four nights in Blair Victoria Hotel in standard quad room just a few days ago  Our group was me  amp  my wife  our daughter and her schoolfriend  both are    yrs old   Room was tiny  but clean  Bathroom was bit small too  it was clean anyway  Sheets and beds we re clean and good enough  Staff was friendly and price really was what we were lookin  for  So all in all  our stay there was nothig but enjoyable  and I can imagine to visit in this hotel in futere trips too  
N =>  bad services I and my husband stayed   nights the     of  The room was neutral  enough clean  with cheap but not bad furnitures  The dimension was proper  The toilet was poor but clean  with hot water The problem was ouside the room The common spaces are badly kept  there was a wall in the stairs were the water of a broken plumb fell down  There was no taste in the furnishing Breakfast was in an ugly room at the lower level  toast  marmelade  no jam   coffe or tea  cornflakes  Not bad  but the room  the furnishing  and the crockery were bad  unfashionable and broken  but not dirty   The second day we had breakfast ouside We will not come back in that hotel that is not cheap enough to be so bad  
N => Terrible place Don t choose this hotel  It s dirty  our double room was too small and there was just a little narrow space between the door and the bathroom  And the window was broken  so during the night we slept with not a properly pleasent fresh air in our room  The bathroom was really really small  and there was almost never hot water  so we had to have the shower with cold water even at   in the morning  The room were they serve breakfast it s small too so one morning we have to be in the queue for    minutes to have our breakfast  
N =>  worst place I ever stay I have stay there with my husband for a week in y       We stay for the week because it was fully paid when we arrived  The room was so small  we didn t have place for our luggages  The room and the bathroom was very dirty  There was holes in the sheet  The entire place had a unpleasant smell  I would not stay there again for sure  
N => Pure Hell at Blair Victoria I stayed in this hotel over a year and a half ago  The experience was SO bad that once I discovered this site  I could hardly wait to warn anyone who would listen NOT to stay there at ANY COST    The room was small  dirty  and disgusting  I have stayed at hundreds of hotels all around the world and nothing comes close to how bad this place was  I have stayed in THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES with better accomadations  The worst part was how the management responded   they did not care  Please  do not go to this place    
N => Disgrace not a hotel     This Hotel is an absolute joke and must be kept away from We booked a double room with on suite and recieved a single room with a double bed and a hole that was called an en suite When expressing our complaint the staff they were unwilling to compromise in any way even though they own another hotel just across the road called Airways  We are totally insulted that we gave them a penny  I would not even let my pet sleep in that thing  The pictures on the site are completely unrealisic and defintly not the Blair Victoria  
N =>  Loved the Blair Victoria oh i had the time of my life at the Blair Victoria  As soon as we stepped through the door we were greeted by staff members who fantastic  our laugagues were taken to our rooms on arrival  we were shown the main attraction site which were nearest from the hotel  the staff member were on call    hours so that was very reasuring to know that someone could help us if we needed it  The best thing about this experince was the price of the rooms  all this set us back next to nothing  the rooms had everything we wanted  large and spacious  decore in the rooms were very good and didnt feel like we were in a BnB  I REALLY enjoed the experifnce  iv already booked four rooms with the Blair Victoria for this chirstmas      i recommend the Blair Victoria to anyone and everyone  ENJOY P S even though this was a    hotel  i really think it was    luxary  
N =>  Awful  The location is actually quite good  very near the victoria station  calm and nice neighbourhhod  Our double room however was really small  one person had to sit on the bed in order to facilitate the other to change or move around  it was really dirty and dusty  old carpets  really dirty wallpapers  bathroom small too  there were hairs left etc  So one suggestion  try to fin another hotel   
N =>  Typical Having read awful reviews of the place  I was wary when I got there It wasn t as bad as I had imagined though  Arriva Hotel at King s Cross was way worse      we had a twin room at the  quot Tudor Inn quot   obviously a part of  quot Blair Victoria quot  The room was rather small but had at least two separate beds and the linen was clean  don t look to closely at the bedspread though  The carpet was     well  ugh   don t look to closely there either  lighting was also rather poor which sort of helped in that case  and wear shoes The bathroom was a small plastic walled cubicle of maybe a square meter  the door hit your knees when sitting on the loo while your right food stood in the shower  Sink looked shabby  but at least no mouldy spots anywhere And the shower actually worked alright We booked without breakfast  something I d recommend anybody planning to stay at Blair Victoria and Victoria Station  and with it a variety of coffee to go places  are close by It s cheap accommodation in London so there s not much to expect anyway  
N =>   close to victoria station It was close to victoria station lots of noise from kids next door wallpaper peeling off the wall in room bed was very cold but clean plenty of tea  amp  coffee had to check out at  a m so did not get the breakfast I paid for which meant I had to buy breakfast somewhere else  okay for a nights stay but would not like to stay longer  
N => An absolute nightmare Having just discovered this area of the website  which I only wish I had done before booking   I am appalled at the amount of complaints regarding this hotel We had booked to stay   and   ember  As soon as we drew up in the taxi my heart sank  Going inside was no better and when shown our room  well that finished it  We immediately went back down to ask for another room  which they didn t have   We left our luggage in the room and spent the next three hours trying to find alternative accommodation  We could not find alternative accommodation for that evening but secured another hotel booking for the following evening  At this stage I could have got on the next available train home I can t begin to think what foreign visitors must think when arriving at this hell hole Why it is still allowed to function is beyond me and I know I will certainly never be near the place again  
N => SCARY DINGY TOTAL RIPOFF HOTEL  My sister and I just came back from Paris  and we took   days to see London This is the worst hotel I ve encountered  in all my    years of traveling  It is the filthiest that I ve stayed in  And it is not cheap  Dirty curtains you can see once you come in  lobby   Ugly large pots of plants on tables  brochures and other printed matters all inside that cramped check in lobby  The rugs in all the building  lobby  stairs  room  were not even vacummed    you can see dirt everywhere  After taking a shower  I was afraid to step on the rug  So I pulled out the bed blanket  and put it on the floor to line it  I was afraid to step on their dirty rug barefooted  The bathroom was so cramp  the sink was filthy   with dirty ring  The short shower curtain was folded twice to fit the stall  and it was also dingy with black stuffs  Because it was short  water splashes everywhere in that small space  No toilet paper holder    it was just laid on the sink  Only two towels were provided  and two   x   inches soaps  unwrapped   No face towels  etc We were afraid to sleep on the bed  because of bed bugs  for sure there are  the way that hotel looked    We used some of our personal clothings to line pillows with  and used our coats as blankets  It is completely misrepresented in their advertisement   their website lists lifts to all floors   none at all  I know this because we were placed on the  th floor  and we had to climb it up and down each time  At our age  our knees are not that good   we re close to age       We asked to be moved to a lower floor the next morning for the second night  but the manager  Y  Patel  never showed up  to let us know what has happened to our request  The clerks didn t do their jobs either to respond to our request  They let us run our two nights reservation without letting us know about it I was leaving a note for the manager  they did not even have clean scratch paper to use  They had to tear up a clean  blank piece of paper from other printed matters to write on  It s the worst  It shouldn t be in business at all  Complete rip off  You can read from that manager s face  he s owner also  I think  he cares only for money  WORST  WORST  WORST  THE DIRTIEST HOTEL  Two block from there  we saw this known chain hotel  initials CI   and inquired about the rooms because my children are supposed to visit London in a few months  We saw clean  good sized  modern elevator  They let us see a sample room  two twins   and it is only    pounds a night  Of course  I will send my children to this CI We paid     pounds for two nights at Blair Victoria TOTAL RIPOFF  I wouldn t recommend this hotel to any paying customers  There are other inexpensive priced hotels in London  that are also clean  decent that you are happy to come back to NOT THIS ONE  
N =>  Very unfortunate experience  
N =>   NO no no    Non andateci assolutamente   
N =>   sehr kleines Zimmer Hotel im Warwick Way   gute Lage  N he Victoria  Station   
N => Run down  We arrived at   am and understandably our room wasn t available but we checked in and were given a card with our room number  We left our luggage and had a day out  On our return  I asked for the key to the given room which was on the  rd floor  We had been in the room for a couple of minutes when the  phone rang  It was the receptionist asking me if I was sure I d asked for the correct room key  She said we should have been in a different room but would ring back  The room was very tired and the bathroom smelt damp  There were twin beds and we had booked a double which was no big deal but when the receptionist called back I was happy with her suggestion to move to the room we should have been given as we decided it couldn t be much worse  Well             There was a double bed and the bathroom didn t smell damp but it was all so old and in need of urgent renovation  The taps were down to the brass and covered in verdigris   perhaps it was a feature  The shower head was so low down I had to duck down to wash my hair  I m not tall but  ft  inches  There were no wardrobe doors which I am sure was NOT a feature  It looks as though the wardrobes should have had sliding doors  As with other posts on this site  the hand wash baisin was in the bedroom and not in the bathroom  We had to fiddle around in order to get the kettle to work and the TV remote took some working out  In order to change channels you had to press the channel number plus the TV button  odd  The hairdrier was nowhere near the mirror but at least there was one  The bed and pillows were comfortable but the duvet cover was made of a Polyester cotton mix and was old and a bit bobbly  We were on the ground floor with a window overlooking a small quadrangle which was full of scaffolding with scaffold planks on top so no light at all came into the room in the morning  The continental breakfast wasn t too bad in spite of what people on this site have said  There were   different cereals  rolls  croissants  toast  preserves  ham  cheese  yoghurts and plenty of tea and coffee as well as fruit juices  On the Sunday it was raining very heavily and there were buckets in the bar area to catch the rain coming in  On the plus side the hotel is in a great area with   tube stations close by  Plenty of restaurants and a couple of Tesco metros plus other shops and a shopping centre with all the high street stores  Notting Hill is a    minute walk away with Kensington Gardens close by  At this time of year London hotels are very expensive and the place we usually stay was over      more than we d paid earlier this year so I suppose you get what you pay for  
N => Bed bug hell Stayed for one night and woke up in the morning to find a bed bug crawling across my duvet after helping himself to a tasty meal as I slept  Later that day I scratched a trail of bite marks along my upper leg  To make matters worse my sleep was ruined by a bathroom extractor fan that would not turn off and a gargling radiator beside my bed  Avoid this hotel 
N =>   Worst breakfast ever Bossy staff in restaurant  you can not sit where you please  Same approach three days  No smiling faces  Seated on a table with a bedsheet as tablecloth  No egg  no fruit and no plain yoghurt to your breakfast  Not possible to have hot chocolate for teenagers  I will definitely not stay there again  
N =>   No Air conditioning i stayed in the club double with my partner for my birthday as we were seeing blur in hyde park  to start of i had to wait til  pm to enter my room so had to float about for   hrs  then i was requested to pay    deposit for the room  i paid it in cash as i said that would do us   for the breakfast and bus to the airport  so i was happy with this arrangement the room was gorgous really big spacious and pretty  the shower was amazying and really funky room   the view was scaffolting it was    degrees that weekend and there was no airconditioning  instead we got a fan that didnt circulate much air  went down to reception and the said some rooms have air conditioning  but feel secure that people that dont are complaining to  i paid extra for the fancy room and it was to hot    we sleep on the bed not in it      when we eventually got to sleepwhen checking out the didnt give me my    in cash  instead they deducted it from the over all bill from my credit card  now when i handed over the cash when i arrived the reassured me il be getting it back in cash  i questioned this and the girl got her supervisor over who was the most coldest  rudest front desk person i ever meet    i had to take    out of the atm and i was charged extra fees and a high exchange rate just because i wasnt in ireland  id think twice before staying here again  the room was beautiful  but the staff  view  heat  lack of facilities was horrible  oh and the lift was broken for our stay    climb up   flights of stairs with bags in    degrees is great fun     
N =>   Awful Stay dirty cramped hotel poor service Grubby tiny rooms   poor service and standards of hygienge   crap breakfast   Have to pay me to stay there again   no adhrerance to DDA      provision Glad to leave in morning 
N =>   Comfort at an affordable price I m a student on a gap year from America  who visited the Blakemore hotel  located in the heart of London  late e this year  It was the perfect place for a tourist like myself  since it was comfortable  even egegant in ways  with staff who attended to all my requests  As for the room  it was just what I needed  a single bed and a tv in a traditional styled bedroom  The restaurant and bar was amazing  although I prefered going out clubbing to a greater extent  and this standard was met by the delicious breakfast which was served up in the early hours of the day  I was particularly delighted to find that there was available wifi  allowing me to use my itouch with ease  Staying at the Blakemore in Bayswater allowed me to abscond to nightlife swiftly  
N =>   Not the Real Slim Shady at all          Stayed in room     which was utterley appaling to my standards  I would not even allow my pet cat to stay here      But I noticed there is some sort of refurbishment taking place  Perhaps modernising the rooms would be a start followed by the bathrooms Regards Flash Gordon    
N =>   Trouble Trouble Trouble       Biggest complaint   on our departure we asked receptionist to call a cab     people to go to Paddington  drop off   person  amp  onto the fair Holiday Inn  Cab driver charged      Not black cab but  gray van   We believe it was a private van  Cab had no meter  amp  no fare was given  We assumed it was ok as the hotel called them  Management has not responded to our complaints Staff not knowledgeable   asked about siteseeing brouchures   told there was none available point blank Stayed in a triple room on   separate times     days before our trip to Budapest  amp    day returning    days was enough   had it not been difficult to find   twin beds we would not have returned the   day Tiles in bathroom broken  amp  floor leaned to one side  Twin beds rolled when you sat on it   had to be careful when you sat down it didn t roll away from you  Carpet old  amp  worn Scaffolds surrounded the building  amp  noise to follow  Elevator was not working   had to use staff elevator which fitted   people   suitcases  amp  had a   gates to open  amp  close which was very difficult to do while trying to maneuvering   suitcases  Elevator will not be working until ober  At one point people were stuck in the elevator  which has no emergency button  and when we informed staff   no one seemed to care  amp  there was no hurry to help these people  We didn t trust the elevator after that Stay at the Blakmore Hotel again   Never    
N =>  Be Aware Be aware that the front of this hotel  amp  lobby look great  but the rooms are very small and lavatory is in the bedroom  The twin beds were not attached to the walls and if you were not very careful   it would slide out from under you causing you to fall  There was very little space for luggage  There was no mirror for shaving or doing makeup  Lighting was very poor  Our room was very noisy as it was close the the service elevator  Bathroom was not very desireable as shower fixture was very old and hard to control Continental breakfast was downstairs and consisted of a piece of toast and jelly while other guest had a full breakfast  
N =>  Cramped and very poor washing facilities very disappointing  the handbasin was in the bedroom and the taps didn t work  If you managed to turn them on you couldn t turn them off again  Reported it to the reception who didn t have any maintainance on site until the following morning  They did turn up but problem still not fixed  Not very promising  will be holding the olympics in a few years time  Won t be recommending this hotel to anyone  
N =>   If you travel for business this is definetly NOT the place to stay We travelled to London to participate a conference  We flew there friday morning so we could have a short sightseeing before the conference starts  First we went to this hotel  The first impression was good  elegeant lobby  nice bar and more or less friendly staff  We left our luggage there  including my laptop  which was secured free of charge   We were told that we were unable to check in as the earliest time to check in was  pm  So we went to the city  We came back around     pm to check in as we had to go to the opening ceremony by  pm  We checked in  There was   of us in   rooms  We all booked the same category of rooms  at least we thought so  for the same price My colleagues had a fairly nice room which was newly fitted and was clean enough for the price of     Our room though was dredful  We changed rooms once becuase in the first room which we had been given the window was broken  We couldn t close it adn the glass itself was also cracked in a couple of places  I asked the reception to change our room but instead of this I was told to wait becuse somebody will go up and check it  Anyway finally somebody came  He tried to close it  luckily he couldn t so they had to change our room  They had no more twin rooms so I agreed to change to a double  I thought we will receive a proper one this time but this was not the case  Our secind room was probably as bad as the first one  The only difference here was that the window was not broken  The wallpaper was torn in several places  the bathroom didn t look like a bathroom that you could use  the tiles were broken  some of them were even loosely fit  the shower was disgusting  etc  the carpet was dirty  the furniture was broken  cracked and so on  so the whole room was completely worn out and unacceptable  But I had to get ready as we had to leave for the opening event so I thought I will have a shower but there was no hot water running from the tap  The  hot  was barely warm so I decided to skip my shower I went down to the reception again and asled for a new room  A room like that which my colleagues had received  The receptionist lady was not helpful and was quite angry with me this time and as there was other people I was told to wait  Well I told her that I can t as I have to go  Anyway finally she promised that by the time we come back I will have a proper room as well  So we cam back and expected to have a nice  tidy room where I could finally take my shower and go to bed after my long day  In fact this did not happen  A man who was the evening receptionist  anyway that lady was gone by   pm  told me that they cannot change my room as they are fully booked  So we decided to leave and instead of apologising they wanted us to pay the first night as we have  quot used quot  our room in a manner as if I was some sort of immigrant who could happy to be there We had argued for a while and finally decided to stay for the night  The bed was uncomfortable  I had hardly any sleep and had a tiring saturday after this  Saturday morning I went down for breakfast  which was included  but i didn t eat anything as there were hardly anything to choose from  Naturally they offered a  quot deal quot  for   pounds I could have English breakfast but I refused it  So Staurday morning I left this awful place and never ever wish to go there again  
N =>  Worst Hotel Ever  This hotel looked amazing as it is set in a fab location  but this is as far as it goes  We booked this hotel for a valentine s weekend away  only to find that the hotel s policy on admission varied from person to person especially management  This review comes in three parts    price    room   customer service Price  The quoted price of this hotel on the website was     for   people for one night  There was no mention on their website or in the bookings site that they would need a deposit  Also as I have spent evenings due to work in many hotels in the past this one is the least value for money  The price they quote if you don t book in advance can soar to over      for one night  If you are looking for value for money and a lovely night  you are better off booking the travel lodge or buying a tent and pitching it in Hyde Park Room  I booked for a double room and received a small double squashed into a single room that smelt musty  as if damp had set in  The bed was not comfortable as you d expect  springs were spiked and meant that there was not a comfortable to be had  The heat in the room was not sufficient for the British weather  The heater was fixed behind the bed head board and hence no heat in the room  the advertised room stated radio and TV however due the lack of reception in the room we could not even watch TV or listen to the radio we had to resort to using a mobile phone to listen to radio  The stated  mini bar  was a kettle and   tea bags  it worked out better value to just go to the small convenience store   min down the road to get a box of tea bags and milk The en suite bathroom was what you would expect in a cheap hotel in the middle of a  rd world country tiles were broken and the shower pumped sparse amounts of mildly warm water  a lime scaled filled shower hose and a cracked shower plate  After spending nearly      on a room for the night I expected more than a shack in the midst of London  although this is what I got  broken tiles on the floor  not only that the tiles begun to actually come off    if you are looking for a decent room in London I would never recommend this hotel even for one night Customer Service  The customer service begun with a friendly and smart face however as the check in procedure continued the service transpired that they did not even know what the actual hotel policy was is  My guest arrived early and was not let into the room and was not even told about the following  guest are to pre pay     for a deposit on the room   which is understandable  however the guests are told to pre pay via credit card  some were offered the option of     by cash  this meant that my guest had to wait   hours to even enter the room  The staff were accommodating at the end of our stay as they were able to have a luggage facility which enabled us to travel around London  This Hotel is Poor and not even worth a glance  If you want a decent night s sleep in a comfortable bed and relaxing place to stay I would advise to find an alternative to this grimy and sullied hotel  
N =>  Great Value The wife and I were looking for a cheap hotel as we were over from Ireland to see atheatre show on a budget  Booked a double room for     and wasn t expecting much  Was delighted to see a bar in the hotel which stayed open till after midnight  Room was basic but clean  Breakfast was much better than expected  Overall  if you are on a budget this is a grand spot  close to the tube and centre of London  
N =>  basic rooms dirty and unhelpful staff when we arrived  the receptionist couldn find our booking so kept us waiting half an hour while she sorted paperwork out  without any communication  Instead she giggled and chatted with the other girls on reception whilst ignoring the customers queuing at the check in desk  We were finally given a cramped room with the washbasin next to the bed and a toilet that didn flush It was so hot in there we requested a room change  The staff told us to pack out bags ready and they would arrange a change  The room we were given was unclean with hair clumps in the plughole of the sink and torn sheets but as it was our last night so we endured The breakfast staff were not friendly and food was basic ie cereal there was a lot of noise in the hotel as renovations were taking place  Wouldnt choose to stay here again  
N =>   Grotty One Star Outside  amp  reception deceiving   Once you see the rooms you will be so disappointed  The decor is   star   hand basin not in bathroom but beside the bed The first room s TV was unwatchable so we were given another room reluctantly after being told that it might be fixed tomorrow  We checked that the TV was ok  amp  went out to dinner nearby as it was after   pm  when we returned at    pm we noticed that there was no water in the hot tap or shower but as we were tired we thought we would manage until the morning This was only the start   the toilet did not flush   the radiators did not cool down  amp  made a dreadful noise all night  The street outside was noisy  amp  the builders arrived at  am   yes the hotel is being refurbished We went down for breakfast  amp  reported the problems first thing  amp  were told to back our belongings  amp  come back at  pm when a new room would be ready  Fortunately we were going to be out most of the day anyway  amp  a working room was given to us on our return   no apology   or still that of a cheap B amp B not a   star hotel so but the beds were OK  amp  breakfast very basic  
N =>   Noisy Hotel i stayed at this hotel for  wks in ember it was the worst fortnight i have ever had in London   I was working on constant nightshift but was nt told about any works being done until i was woken with constant banging all day long  so i was eventually moved to the floor below me  RD which was no better as they were ripping all the ceilings down and again banging all day and the mess of the corridors with all there materials was a disgrace  My room was very outdated and very small with the heating on constant could nt get if off as there was no regulator my bathroom was tiny at   point there was no hot water for   days no explination given  the alarms kept going off just a poor hotel altogether 
N =>   Was shocked at the standard of the room  My husband and I stayed at this hotel  between  th to  th ober  and paid a total of      for a double room  The room was tony  with tha bathroom having space  just enough  for a bath shower and a toilet  The washhand basin was in the main area of the room  The bed was against the wall which meant one of us had access into and out of the bed  with the other person having to clamber out  or shimmy to the foot of the bed and then shuffle sideways along the foot of the bed  My husband and I are thankfully not large people  so I don t know how someone of  ft would manage to move at all  The furniture was in a state  with varnish peeling off the wardrobe  All I can say is that the room was clean  not much to keep clean  and that staff were fairly friendly  Initially when I made a complaint about the room  the member of staff I spoke to  said we may be moved to a  nice  room  However  when I spoke with the manager  we negotiated a discount  and a late checkout instead  Although the negotiaion was fine  he was somewaht surprised at  my demands    I was surprised that he could not see what the problem was  This has been the worst hotel room I have every stayed in  On the defense of the hotel in general  I belive they do have the majority of their rooms to a good standard of sixe etc  however  this room was not fit for purpose  
N =>   Do not stay at this Hotel           My husband and I stayed at the Blakemore Hotel last weekend tember   and    The outside of the hotel looks very good as is reception We checked in and went to our double room What a shock The room was about   feet wide  You could not sit on the side of the bed   the room was so narrow There was no air conditioning except a stand up contraption that circulated the hot air around the room The window would not open more than   inches The bathroom was tiny and you could not close the door  I am not exagerating We travel to London often and have stayed in various hotels always very good or excellent  this was absolutly disasterous  We enjoyed our trip not our hotel  
N =>   Be Afraid    Luckily we only had to stay at this rip off dump for one night  My partner and I had travelled all over Europe and were pleasantly surprised by the high standard of accommodation considering the price we paid  On our last night we wanted to stay somewhere special so we picked the Blakemore  which turned out to be terrible     We booked a superior double room and we were given a tiny room just big enough to fit ourselves and our bags   we had to jump over the bags to get to the bathroom  There was a hole someone had kicked in the wall that was the size of a toddler Also  there was a cement mixer   metre away from our window which was used at  am     Our package included breakfast  but when we got to the restaurant we were told we were not on the list and that we had to sort it out with reception  After fixing this up we trekked back down to the breakfast room and received a mediocre breakfast After checking out  we left our bags with the concierge  When we went to pick them up  the concierge manager verbally abused us for a minor mistake one of his staff had made  and screamed things at us in the middle of the lobby like  next time i m going to throw yours bags away       How embarrassing Do yourself a favour  do not stay here  there are plenty of nicer hotels that are more affordable  with friendlier staff  
N =>  Stay Away from the Blakemore My wife and I stayed at the Blakemore Hotel in London for five days beginning on e           I have stayed in hotels all over Europe  even in Russia  and the United States and this has to be the worst accommodation I have ever had  After booking months in advance  we arrived around noon  When we opened the door to our room  we were shocked at how small the twin room was  There was less than    inches between the foot of each bed and the wall to say nothing about the otherwise shabby appearance of the room in general  If the size and condition of the room were the only problems  I would not be writing about our experience  But unfortunately  this was only the tip of the iceberg  Directly outside of our window on the  th floor was a walking scaffold  Workman had a bird s eye view of our bedroom  I then turned on the hot water in the sink to wash up and I was unable to turn it off  It was running at full throttle and filling the room with hot steam  A call to the desk brought a prompt response from a hotel staff member who also could not turn it off  A plumber showed up shortly after that and was able to turn it off by jiggling the valve  He said the plumbing was old and showed us how to turn it off ourselves  I called the front desk and asked for another room  I was told the hotel was completely booked  but they would give us another room the next day  The new room was slightly larger and in better condition than the other room  There was no scaffolding  but our strange odyssey continued on  During the course of the next four days  here is what happened  The room was very hot and we were unable to open the windows beyond a three inch gap  What was advertised as a  ceiling fan  in each room was a cheap  stand up floor fan that hardly blew any air  We suffered for four days in a stifling room  If this weren t enough  the handle on the toilet broke late one evening  A staff member came up and after looking at the toilet  said he could not fix it  He said it would be fixed in the morning and in the meantime  we could fill the trashcan with water and pour it into the toilet  To be fair  we were offered another room that evening  but it was very late and we were very tired  We simply were not up to packing all of our stuff up for a third move  It was fixed the next day  Around   AM one night  after finally falling asleep in the hot room  the hotel fire alarm went off  The occupants of the entire hotel evacuated to the lobby and the outside  Everyone was standing around half dazed and no one in the hotel told us what was going on  After around two hours  everyone finally returned to their rooms  When returning to our room  I noticed a sign on the wall that said that in the event of a fire alarm  the local fire brigade is required to be called in  No one from the fire brigade ever showed up Continuing on  in our first attempt to use the hair dryer  it started to grind and threw out sparks  So much for the hair dryer  Additionally  the shower had a temperature regulator that didn t work properly  We basically had two choices   steaming hot  and  boiling hot   We did mention this to the staff  but nothing was done  My wife and I were able to use the steaming hot shower by moving in and out of the stream while showering  I am the kind of person who rarely complains  In fact  I have never written a letter like this about any accommodation  If an accommodation is safe and relatively comfortable  I am generally OK with it  This accommodation was neither  
N =>  Facade gives wrong impression of hotel I had a room with bath confirmed but was given a room with a shower only  The hotel could would not change me for the first night  The receptionist tried to tell me the bath was  quot just a request quot  until I shoed her the written confirmation  The room was TINY  the shower was dirty  the extractor fan did not work and the shower toilet door would not lock  The sink was in the bedroom     how archaic is that The restraunt is tiny  we could not get in to eat and were not advised to book if required at check in  There were four staff at check in  it took them two attempts to process my card Continental breakfast was disappointing  just bread and cereal  no cold meat or cheese  no yoghurt or fruit of any description Eventually I was moved to a room with a bath  I had asked for a room as high as possible  I was put on the ground floor  The view when I opened the window was like being in a basement and I was looking at scaffold  Againa sink in the main bedroom area that leaked all over the carpet The foyer area is very nice and gives a good impression BUT the hotel does not live up to this  When I went to settle my account their was no reduction despite having a CONFIRMED booking for two night in a room with private en suite bath  I refused to pay and was eventually offered a twenty per cent discount  No apology was forthcoming I resent this poor standard of treatment  Was this I ask myself because I got a better rate on the net than their published rates    I will not reccommend this hotel and can understand why tourists complain about poor London hotels  
N =>   AWFUL HOTEL The rooms in this hotel are tiny  In the double rooms there is one double bed with no space either side of the bed to get out  We booked for   adults and   children and got one of these rooms  There was no seating area and no sofabed  We got a cot for one of the children and had to climb over it to get to bathroom  The bathroom was so small you could not use the toilet and close the door at the same time  The breakfast was supposed to be continental but what was on offer was limited cereals and toast  tea and coffee  Yoghurt  fruit eggs etc on were on offer for an extra supplement  Desk staff did not care about our concerns they just repeat same bog standard lines for any query  I have stayed at many hotels in my life and have never ever complianed  This was so bad I felt I had to warn others  Location not bad  
N =>   Cold breakfast  dissapointing  We have just returned from a girlie night stay in London to watch Dirty Dancing  great    We booked in at the Blakemore Hotel as it was quite reasonably priced          for a twin room  We did not expect it to be fantastic due to the reviews we had read  First impressions were very nice  the lobby was lovely and spacious  Our room was very spacious too  however the bathroom was so tiny and the sink was in the bedroom  But we were only sleeping there  so we thought   The walls were very thin and the cleaners could be heard in the above and rooms along the corridor quite early in the morning  I was unable to sleep due to the noises and the rooms were very hot  This was a shame  as the beds were very comfortable We went down to breakfast at      breakfast served until       We were told we could upgrade and pay an extra       each for a hot cooked breakfast  What a bargain and definately needed it So we upgraded and found our breakfast to be completely COLD  When we complained to the staff in the restaurant  they microwaved our food with no apologises at all  The unfriendly staff on reception would not deduct the additional       charge from our bill  hence  we will not be returning or recommending this restaurant to our friends  
N =>   A pleasant stay Definitely met our expectation  thankfully After reading all the negative reviews of the hotel  we were a bit apprehensive when we checked into Blakemore Hotel for a one nite stay on    il  However  we were pleasantly surprised all the way  We booked a twin room on a high floor and got a nice quiet room away from the lift We arrived at   am  way before check in time of  pm  but the doorman Conceige security was a very pleasant man who kindly stored our luggages securely away till then  The room was old and dated  including the bathroom  but it was comfortable  clean  and the general housekeeping was good  Continental Breakfast was also included so we can t beat the value for a central location with a comfortable night stay The trick seems to be that all the rooms on the first floor were brand new  with electronic card door entry  while second to fifth floor were still brass key entry and dated decor  they will ask you for a     refundable deposit for the key  or take a pre authorisation of your credit card   We requested  amp  got the top floor for a twin room  and got a very nice  amp  airy room  Guess it all depends on which rooms they allocate you to  Good luck  Based on our experience above  we will consider this hotel again ken 
N => 	Night Stay First off  I never have any illusions that I m staying at a   star hotel  and to be honest  I ve stayed at some   stars that were not as good as this hotel   I got what the company paid for  which was all I needed  a bed  and a shower  The room and bathroom were clean  The shower was a little larger than the norm in London  The breakfast was good  but basic  My biggest complaint was the heat  Others have written about it and it is an issue  I had to sleep with the window open but on a couple of occations some idiot Americans  no doubt they were Yankees were outside yelling at  AM  The bed wasn t good enough to write home about either  Overall  a decent experience and if I can get the same price  I d stay again  
N =>  Escaped When I arrived  there was no electricity  no hot water  lifts out of order  Staff said that they are trying to solve the problem  Tomorrow morning situation has not changed  They said its the same in the whole street  I checked in the hotel across the street and everything functioned normally  Besides this  my room was dirty  window could not close properly and bathroom completely rusty  Asked for another room and got it  This time there was no rust but wall carpets dirty and stripped  stains all over the floor  wardrobe tiny and broken    I left the hotel after one sleepless night  Avoid Blakemore at all costs  cheap does not have to include rust and dirt  Being a travel agent and traveled across the whole world  this is definitely the worst three star hotel I have ever seen  No  no  no  
N =>  very happy me my partner and mother have just arrived back from a one night stay at the Blakemore  after reading some of the reviews we were really worried  We were taking mom to london for the tutankamun exibition and really wanted her to enjoy it and the room was of much importance as anything  Our worries were totally unfounded moms single room was lovely  clean and the en suite was perfect with a shower over the bath  our room was just as nice but the bathroom bigger  The staff were all very friendly and very helpful breakfast was continental with a full English at a small cost  over all we enjoyed our stay and would definately stay there again 
N =>   Disgusting My girlfriend and i have just returned from London a day early due to the fact we could not stay another night in this hotel   On arrival the hotel looks fine with a lovely spacious lobby and bar area  The first thing we noticed was a sharps bin  needle disposure  in the hotel toilet    first impression not good   We then entered our  quot double quot  room on the  th floor      it was tiny   the double bed hard up against the wall with the other side   quot  from the dressing table come shelf  therefore you got out of bed from the bottem being careful not to bang your head against the wall mounted TV   The bed had seen much better days and on inspecting the matress found urine stains   We asked to be moved and were offered room       The carpet was filthy and torn  There were   X   quot  screws sticking out the front of the headboard where there was was a shelf  which we asked to be removed but were not   The decor was complete with holes in walls and mould in the corner    But what gave us great amusement and several texts to friends was the size of the bathroom   I measured it with my shoe which i know is    quot  long and it was   foot square   The toilet was one end and basin the other yet you could sit on the toilet and wash your hands at the same time   I am   feet tall and had to bend my head while standing in the bath to shower    will definately never return 
N =>  Close to tube unhelpful unfriendly staff Our stay at The Blakemore was disappointing from the start  My sister and I arrived in London in the midst of tember s transport strike  so we needed all the help we could get regarding how best to navigate the city without access to the tube  Unfortunately  reception staff were absolutely no help    they made no effort to procure bus information for the many visitors who were requesting it  did not have up to date information about the status of the strike  and did not suggest places of interest in the vicinity  They also attempted to charge us for an extra night and when we requested an adjustment to our bill  did not apologize for their mistake  Without question  however  the worst part about our stay at The Blakemore was the staff incompetence  Our wakeup call came more than an hour late on the day of our departure  and the elevator wasn t even working  If it wasn t for the helpful maintenance man who assessed our situation and carried our heavy luggage from the  th floor to the lobby  the hotel doesn t have porter staff  so he did this out of his own kindness  we certainly wouldn t have caught our flight  The room was fine  the bathroom was clean  and the hotel is in a great location  but our experience with the staff will keep me from returning  Bayswater boasts a number of similarly priced hotels  and next time I ll book one of them instead  
N =>  Avoid the Blakemore Hotel Avoid the Blakemore Hotel  Staff are at best unhelpful and incompetent  at worst dishonest  Refused to refund me an extra    pounds fee charged to my credit card due to their incompetence Breakfast stale and uninteresting  rooms ok for the price but very noisy  
N =>   try somewhere else We booked into this hotel as it seemed cheap and reasonably priced  Our room was small but manageable  The bathroom was very small and the handle of the toilet kept falling off   The whole apartment needed a good clean and the carpet looked as if it hadn t been vacuumed for a long time  There was hair and food crumbs on the carpet  It was a little dated but that wasnt a problem  The location was ok but not as close to train station as I thought  there arent really any restauants inc lose vacinity but a good little pub over and down the road  The staff we ok  not overly helpful or friendly though  I probably wouldnt stay there again  I think I would rather pay a little more for a cleaner room  
N =>  Bring your earplugs    We arrived to a very nicely refurbished reception area and the staff seemed pleasant and polite  After an awful drive we were pleased to finally arrive and made our way up to the  th floor where our room was  room       Upon opening the door  I was less than satisfied with our room  it was extremely small  the bathroom smelled mouldy and there was a large amount of paint peeling from the wall next to the bed  Not one to complain unless I really feel the need and also after having such a bad journey trying to get here we just got ourselves changed and left for the theatre  It was my partners birthday and I had wanted to treat him to a lovely theatre break in London so I didn t want to spoil it by complaining  When we arrived back at the hotel we made our way up to our room and fell asleep  This lasted all of   hours as the room we were allocated was right next to the lift shaft and was terribly noisy  Constant noise from the lift going up and down  up and down banished all our efforts to sleep and to top it off the room had become incredibly hot which heightened the mouldy smell coming from the bathroom  The windows open a very small amount so this was not easily rectified  If you are thinking of staying at this hotel  I suggest you ask them not to allocate a room next to the lift shaft and remember your earplugs        
N =>  Great location My Husband daughter and myself stayed at the Blakemore ine  We were on a   week holiday round the U K  France and Italy and wanted to stay in London for   days  I spent many weeks on the web looking through the Trip Avdisor web site  trying to find good but affordable accomodation that did not cost a arm and a leg but was also close to the heart of London  We read many horror stories and picked this one out of the bunch  It was close to restaurants  Pubs and shops all reasonably priced Also seemed a good and safe area at night to go and eat The room was very tired but a good size with   single beds clean towels and linen every day  beds were very soft  The bathroom was so small hardly room to move with a very dodgey toilet and a shower that leeked water on the floor  But this was always cleaned daily but not to many complaints  Our room was quiet on the third floor with a view of the front of the hotel  The hotel staff are all foreign and not to helpfull  But value for money we would stay their again  it is in a side street just across the road from Hyde Park  
N =>   Cheep could be more cheerfull Hotel was very good value at about     a night  I had paid an extra    per night to have a full English Breakfast  The breakfast supervisor had no record of this and was quite rude  Eventually I proved that I had paid for this  No apoligy from waitress  Cooked breakfast was of cheap and poor quality food  tip is to still to the contenental which is generally included  The  nd day  the waitress seemed to be indicating to follow her to table but for some reason she just wandered into the kitchen  There were plenty of tables however  The hotel have some work needing done to improve the staff and the customer service side of things Receptionists were a bit impersonal and lacked efficiency and frendlieness Barstaff were quite good  and lounge bar was confortable and attractive Room was quite pleasant  Shower was a bit low but worked fine  TV worked fine  Bed was comfy  Despite being near the main door  I found it quiet enough to get a good nights sleep This hotel is fantastic value and is located in an attractive location  Despite my  quot service quot  comments  the value makes this a good choice  
N =>   Never again When we arrived at the hotel late at night we were shown our room  that was very tiny  That s ususal for London and that was not the problem  The big problem was the noise coming from any electric machine outside the room  The windows were so thin that you could hear everything  We complained the noise and got another room   with the same noise problem  Then we were given each a single room  My room was okay  but the room of my husband absolutely not  Early in the morning when the tube started to go  it seemed as if it drove through the room  So my husband had four uncomfortable nights at the hotel   with much noise of the tubes and less sleep  My friend had another single room  When we arrived from the city one day she wondered why her door wasn t closed   although she had knocked it certainly  Nothing seemed to be stolen but we all wondered why her door was opened The lobby of the hotel was nice  the breakfast was nothing special  but okay  It was continental  but not absolutely bad as some other guests wrote  
N =>  It was bad      Well where do we start  We booked in for   nights and from the outset things weren t good   we were surprised to find the  quot non smoking quot  room we requested was very smoky  I have mild asthma  so when we asked to change  my husband was told that  quot all rooms were smoking and there were no  quot non smoking quot  rooms quot    We were told to ask after breakfast the next day to change rooms  which is what we did  the other room was smoky too  I think smoke was coming in through the wall or something  The doors easily bang if the window is open and we were subjected to hearing noises from other rooms  the insulation isn t good    Most of the employees were grumpy apart from a happy concierge who was very jolly as we were leaving  The breakfast was ok but queues were long sometimes   we went for the continental breakfast and filled up on croissants and toast  The only good thing was the orange juice  It is ideally situated for the tube  I m trying my best to find something positive to say about the place   but we definitely won t be going back to stay there again  We give it      for the orange juice and tube access  
N =>  My room was broken into and stuff stolen Wish I had first read some of these bad reviews  I was given a very basic and somewhat dirty room when I arrived which suprised me as the lobby is quite nice and I also spotted some rooms getting cleaned as I passed by which were so much better but I was told this was the only one available  However  worse was to come  returning late at night to this room  I discovered to my horror  someone had come inside and slached open my locked suitcase with a knife or something and stole some of my stuff  There were no signs of forced entry to this  nd floor room  Staff were not at all helpful or supportive  I was told  quot your insurance will cover it quot  and  quot this is London  you know quot  and  quot you had one of the rooms with a poor locking system which is easily tampered with quot   Most rooms had electronic locks  They also had an amused look on their faces every time I tried to get some help  The managers tried to ignore me and also almost laughted  The police were called but staff had rushed up to the room beforehand and opened the window to try to make it look like someone had climed up that high and come in  I am disgusted and very upset  I was refused any compensation and not one penny was taken off the room price  Needless to say I stayed awake all night even though I was then given a different and much better room but I had nowhere else to go so late at night  I would never recomend this place  There is a rotten  lying thief lurking about  
N =>  Nice room terrible breakfast We booked a Dbl room and a single room  Single room was very small  but as it was only for one night it was ok  It was clean and comfortable although there was a spotlight outside the single room window which lit the room all through the night and kept our son awake  Our Dbl room was very spacious which was a nice surprise  very clean and cosy  However  you can hear everything through the walls  Staff were friendly enough  We had read the breakfast was great  so we were greatly dissapointed  It was cold  rock hard eggs and burnt sausages  and we had to pay       extra each for this  If you are staying here we would suggest sticking to the breakfast which is included in your price  croissants  rolls  toast  juice etc  Other than that we would stay here again  The lobby being very sumptous does however suggest that behind the doors i e hallways etc  would be the same but it is infact in need of some tlc    and we would stick to the cafes for breakfast  
N =>   Fine for a   star I stayed for   nights with my   year old daughter  The staff were welcoming and pleasant  advised breakfast was included without me confirming first  hotel reception was nice  clean and i was given a ground floor room whch was great eventhough i did notice a lift  Room was clean and bathroom was fine  It was small but big enough for my stuff plus a buggy and bags  Easy to walk from padddington station and close to bayswater shopping area  plus within walking distance of hyde park  and many areas  i walked to marble arch in about    minutes  Breakfast was buffet style continental and u coud eat as much as you wanted  You could pay a little extra for english breakfast if you wanted  i would stay there again with my daughter  
N =>  Wowwww       What a Surprise      We moved to the Blakemore Hotel from the Pembridge Palace  more like Pembridge Prison  Hotel for the last   days of our holiday in London  Stayed there with my cousin from Greece in late ober  Purchased a voucher on eBay for    GBP Twin Share per night  On arrival we were greeted by the professional staff  The friendly reception staff really goes out their way to make your stay as enjoyable as possible  They even have an information desk in the reception area When we went inside our room we were trully SHOCKED     WOWWWW    WHAT A SUPRISE     Our twin share room was HUGE  our bags actually fitted inside the room this time compared to the previous hole   We lit up a smoke and enjoyed the freedom of smoking inside our hotel room  Only odd thing was that the wash basin was in the actual room and not in the bathroom  The bathroom was well maintained  abit old but still served its purpose very well  The room also had free wireless internet provided by the hotel  Coffee  amp  tea facilities were also provided The Full English Breakfast was really good  We pigged out until we couldnt eat anymore  The dining room was really nice and comfortable We set out on our final day in London  We purposely left the  quot DO NOT DISTURB quot  sign on the front door because how much can you dirty the place in   night  Well to our suprise  when we returned at  am our clean towels were waiting in the passage way in front of our door  This was really nice and courteos of the cleaner  Location was the best  Close to the Bayswater restaurant shop strip  Also close to   tube stations The Bar in the reception was also a great place to hang  That night we had afew drinks there  A great place to pick up but we couldnt be bothered that night  Some nice ladies that were enjoying a quiet drink Well my cousin and I really enjoyed the Blakemore and would definately stay there again  GO STAY THERE AND YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY    POSITIVES  LARGE ROOMS  FRIENDLY PROFESSIONAL STAFF  VERY CLEAN ROOMS  FREE WIRELESS INTERNET  NICE ENGLISH BREAKFAST  BAR IS GREAT   NEGATIVES  mmmmm none really    just that we didnt move here earlierPS  CHECK OUT THE PHOTOS I TOOK OF THE BLAKEMORE 
N =>   Be aware I feel i need to make everyone aware this hotel was the worst i have ever stayed in and i was so disappointed  The Room was tiny the end of the bed nearly touch the wall  You could not swing a cat in there  The sink was in the bedroon and the bathroom was awfull  The taps and plug holes had mould in them and it was so old fashioned  The wardrobe was a sliding door style one and i went to slide it open and the whole door fell out in my hand  This room was the pits  I asked the receptionist for a better room and i was told they were all the same  The bar staff are very rude  The bar was advertised to open till    yet the shut this at      pm  When we asked if we could get a drink they very rudely said no  For breakfast you have to que nearly   mins for a table  Please please to not go to this hotel and ruin your stay in london  It was in a central location but i would have preferred to go on a extra tube then ever stay here again  
N =>   The worst place I have ever seen A so called Standard Room  for the smart rate of    UK Pounds the only thing available through HRS Online Booking is simply a nightmare  Dirty  disgasting  unfriendly  simply unusable  In certain rooms you have to go in backwards  as you will not be able to turn around once you are in We stayed there exactly    minutes an left immediately  as you could only use it fully dressed  Nobbody would dare to shower naked or use the toilet  
N =>   hated the blakemore      i stayed here for two nights with friends  the hotel itself was clean and comfortable but the staff were terrible  i never met so many rude people and there manners were a disgrace  the waitor could not do his job and the receptionist wrere extremely unhelpful  thay had no drink at the bar only a few bottles of each and trhat was it   they could not speak very good english and everthing seemed to take twice as long to do   i would not recommend this hotel to anybody and if i return to london i will definitely not stay here 
N => Clean and Convenient I stayed at the Blakemore last il and found it clean and very convenient to Hyde Park and several Tube stations and worth the budget rate  Travelling alone  I didn t mind that the room was very small  though I felt like I was staying in a college dorm room  The room was clean and I never went without clean towels  though I sometimes went without hot water  My room was on the  nd floor near stairs so it was very loud at night  It was unseasonably warm when I was in London  and without AC  the room was very stuffy  The hotel staff were friendly enough  though I never required their services other than when checking in and out  They did forget to give me a phone message that I was expecting  and therefore  missed seeing old friends  Though the hotel was adequate enough  when I go back to London this summer with my boyfriend  we won t be staying at the Blakemore  
N =>   Tired and Compact A competitively priced hotel but the double room we had was just big enough to get the bed and one suitcase in  The room itself was in poor repair with a major fight to open the window Breakfast was a bit of a scrum in the basement area and staff were brusk Lots of smoke in the bar area  which made it an unpleasant place to relax Would not stay again even though it was at a cheap rate  
N =>  Pleasantly Surprised Very impressed with the Blakemore  My friend and I arrived in London to go to our hostel where our reservation in a studio apartment in Earl s Court was SUPPOSSED to be  However  when the suppossed hostel no longer seemed to be in operation  I had to quickly find a new hotel  We stayed the first night at a hotel in Earl s Court but then went online to find something better  That s when I came across the Blakemore  The price was right  between    and     weekend rates  pounds per night for a two single bed room  We arrived early before check in to see if we could either check in early or leave off our bags  The receptionist  very friendly  told us that out room was not ready yet but we could leave our luggage off and come back in the afternoon  She also informed us that we had been upgraded  not sure why  to a  quot deluxe room quot   We weren t sure what that meant at the time but didn t expect it to mean much  After seeing photos of other rooms in the hotel  I can tell you that the deluxe rooms are really great  The bathroom was brand new  well lit  fantastic water pressure in the shower one of the nicest bathrooms I ve seen in a hotel and certainly the nicest bathroom I ve seen in a European hotel  The room was small  but nicely decorated with rich colors  We had down comforter blankets and there were extra pillows in the closet  Be sure to but out the do not disturb sign because the maids will knock early  We were in room    and although we had no view  the room was very nice  I was very impressed with the hotel since it was a last minute reservation and they gave us way more than I expected  DEFINATELY go for the deluxe rooms if you can  
N =>  typical english but nice and clean me and a friend stayed at the blakemore at the end of august and we enjoyed it there  we just payed   pounds a night which was a great offer    if you ve ever been to london you know what to expect and the blakemore was very nice  the room was not the biggest but enough space for two people  we had a twin room ensuite   the bathroom was small but also enough to take a shower and it was quite new  i would deffo stay there again  
N =>  Fine for the price I stayed at Blakemore Hotel for one night only but was positively surprised after the reviews I read here  We had some bad luck when arriving as Queensway underground station is closed until       and there was a terror alarm at Bayswater station so we had to come by bus from Edgware Road tube station but that was ok in the end  In the hotel they did not find our reservation made via HRS but they did not discuss and even gave us an upgrade to a better room than booked  I still don t know why but it was apleasant surprise   The girl at the reception desk was Swiss and spoke perfect German which was very convenient for us and gave us a good feeling The room they gave us was nice and absolutely clean  with a modern bathroom  if a little small  but that is really normal in London   As I am by now quite an expert in London rooms  I checked the room first this time BEFORE getting my stuff out of the suitcase  Unfortunately the room was directly facing a big fan airconditioning outisde on the roof which was humming quite loudly  They did not have another executive room but gave me three keys to check normal rooms  As two of them were reeking of smoke and the third was just besides the elevator  we stayed in the original room which was nicer  oh yes  we Germans are fussy       Still  the hotel tried to satisfy us as their guests The room   apart from the fan outside   was very quiet as we had requested and we did not hear other guest during the night Breakfast was included in the price and absolutely ok   a selection of rolls  toast  croissants  cereals  jam  butter and two different juices as well as tea and coffee  You can get a nice English breakfast if you are willing to pay an unreasonable amount of money   better go to a cafe round the corner  The breakfast room was nice and clean The area around the hotel is quiet but Bayswater is near with all you can wish for  many internet cafes  restaurants   most of them bad and too expensive as is usual in London  supermarkets and a shopping centre with cinema  All in all  I can definitely say that the Blakemore is absolutely ok for the price and better than a number of other hotels in the price category  I would book it again  
N =>  Good value for money I have stayed in this hotel before with a friend  Now  however  I was there alone  I booked the hotel via Internet both times and there were never any problems with the bookings The hotel is in an excellent location just a short walk from Hyde Park  It is also close to the Bayswater and Queensway tube stations and Whiteley s shopping centre  However  if you prefer using busses  many of them are using the Bayswater Road that is close by Blakemore is a quite cheap hotel compared to most of the other hotels in London  Still it looks a lot better than the other budget hotels that I have been to and the service there has also always been good  The rooms are ok  they are not in excellent shape but they are clean and they are cleaned every day  My room was a L shaped single room  Otherwise it was a nice room but if you wanted to open your luggage on the floor it was difficult to get around it as there was not that much space There were also a couple of incidents that were not very pleasant  One morning at about   AM  there was a fire alarm  Just as I managed to exit the room  it stopped  I called the reception because my phone had rang during the fire alarm and I thought that they might have called  They did not know anything about that so I guess the ringing of the phone was some how connected to the fire alarm  Anyway  it was a false alarm Second incident was that one evening a group of teenagers were hanging around the hotel staircase which was close to my room  As the doors are not that soundproof you could clearly hear everything  Of course  it was my fault that I didn t complain but I just did not want to get out of bed     
N =>  Very pleasant hotel that s a great deal in expensive London The reception area was pleasant  despite the aroma of smoke that wafts over from the bar area   the rooms did not smell of smoke  I noticed it appeared to be the only hotel on the street that offered automatic doors  which comes in quite handy when you arrive depart w  all of your luggage  I had had some difficulties with my hotel reservation  Used a booking site to book all   days but when I called the hotel to confirm  they told me they only had me for my original request of   days  But the booking site told me they had straightened the problem out  amp  my entire   day reservation was booked    And checking in went off w o a problem  My room was nice enough  tastefully decorated  carpet had a few  wrinkles  in it  but that is no biggie  large wood laminate vanity area  amp  armoire  large   panel window  and a tub  I was surprised to see a tub as I thought teeny tiny showers are the norm  BUT there was a problem with the tub  for some odd reason it was elevated about     feet up  So not only was it dangerous trying to step down afterwards but its a good thing I wasn t tall as my head would ve been near the ceiling  And there was absolutely no water pressure  Which made it difficult to get the shampoo conditioner out of my very long hair  And the other negative was that the room was west facing  and top floor  so it was quite hot  I had to borrow a fan  which helped a bit   Apparently they require a deposit but I was not asked to do so   I did hear the Bayswater tube as mentioned by others  its not  quot underground quot  which is why you hear it   But it wasn t bothersome at all  Actually the west side was extremely quiet  Well  the outside of the hotel was quiet  As I discovered the next morning  my room      forgot to take pictures the room  was right next to the service elevator lift  And the door to the lift would slam itself shut   As do all the room doors unless the person is considerate enough to hold the knob  amp  not allow it to slam behind them  So I was woken up by housekeeping in the morning at exactly  am  If I was just there for a day or two  no problem   but I was staying   days  So I decided to request a new room  before the crowds arrived for Live     So on the  rd morning  I asked to be put in another room  Which they accomodated for me w o any questioning  apparently they had one room available   They gave me the key to the other room       to see if it met my approval  It did  They even offered to move my belongings for me  which I declined   The room wasn t decorated quite as nice as the first  no wooden laminate large vanity area  actually the vanity was small  and I had a shower this time instead of a tub  But that was fine w  me as I only take showers  Plus the shower was quite roomy  Plus it had wonderful water pressure  And most importantly  it was so quiet  I was no where near the service elevator  The room faced the street  so I did ocassionally hear some tourist buses outside in the morning  etc   but it wasn t an issue  And since the room was east facing  and on the  rd floor   it was much cooler  Very happy   I did discover the toilet didn t flush  But they immediately sent someone up to fix it  They do request that you drop your key off at reception before leaving  And there is    hour reception to retrieve your key upon your return  The hotel did have many amenities  bar  restaurant  laundry  etc  that I did not take advantage of  They even had organized tours  such as going to see plays  that I was not aware of until the day I checked out and saw it posted next to the concierge s station  But I guess thats my fault  The neighborhood is quite nice and there are many hotels  all in similar buildings  Though some buildings appeared they needed renovated   I was glad I wasn t staying in those hotels  And many hotels that were on the street were in the middle of renovations  though I never heard construction work   The street leading up to the hotel  from Hyde Park  which was a block south  had many shops restaurants etc that would appeal to tourists  amp  locals alike  There were   Greek restaurants  a pub at the bottom of another hotel  Leinster Arms    or    quot convienence quot  stores  internet shop  etc  And if that isn t enough    or   blocks west is Queensway which has every kind of store you can ask for  Boots  Tesco  Post Office  multiple restaurants  tourists shops  even a mall  Whiteleys   And of course  the tube stops  Queensway  central line  is closed down right now unfortunately  But Bayswater  Circle District  is also close by  Though Circle District line isn t nearly as a desirable line  at least not for me  Central was the line I used to most  So I often walked a bit further in the other direction  east  towards Lancaster Gate  But even though it was a little bit farther of a walk then Bayswater stop  it was still very close  It was about a      minute walk   where Bayswater was about a   minute walk  Paddington Station was also a short walk away  Which makes it very convienent to take the Heathrow Express  I was very happy with my stay at The Blakemore  I would definitely stay there again  
N => you do not find a better one for this price I just returned from a   nights stay at the Blakemore Hotel   Me and my wife flew over from Germany for a Neil Diamond Concert   Considering the price you will hardly find a better one in London  Clean rooms  friendly staff  and good service  I agree  that rooms are small  but this is normal for London  In have been to at least ten different hotels in London in recent years  so I got used to the small rooms  None of the hotels I have been before  I ever would return to  because of different reasons  like unfriendly staff or unclean rooms or junk furniture or too noisy etc  So on every trip I tried another hotel  The Blakemore Hotel is the first one I will return to on my next trips to London  And thanks to low budget airlines I surely will return soon  From my point of view there is nothing to complain about The Blakemore Hotel  Cheap  compared to London prices  and good  I am glad I found it  I really can recommend it  
N =>  Small and expensive but what do expect from London  The hotel is at a great location  right next to Hyde Park and only   minutes from the Queensbay tube stop  We arrived rather late   am  and the staff was friendly  The shower was not working properly when we arrived and the receptionist sent a non english speaking bellhop to help  which didn t work out very well  We were all soaked along with the bathroom floor and with nothing resolved  The strange thing was  he told me that he was going to get some more help  I think  and never came back  I went back to the lobby and the receptionist was nice and came right away to help with the situation which was resolved quickly afterwards  they did not provide extra towels though    The room is rather small with too much furniture stuffed in it   The walls were thin as we could hear our neighbors  night activities  My bed was uncomfortable as it sunk in the middle and did not have extra pillows  I was disappointed by the price and quality compared to other hotels that I have stayed in in Europe  but I know London is extremely expensive  
N =>  Cheap and OK Stayed on   occasions during a holiday to Europe  Convenient location near Hyde Park and tube  close to city  For the price you will find it hard to find better in inner London  Quiet with reasonable  clean  rooms  Concierge not overly helpful friendly  
N =>  Wonderful  Good Times  We stayed at the Blakemore hotel in il       I had read some reviews that said that it was subpar  and was a little scared  We arrived in London at Noon  and The Hotel Staff quickly checked us into our Room  It s a small hotel  but on a quiet street  right next to Hyde Park  It s only   blocks from the nearest tube station  and took us less than   minutes to walk there every morning  I wish I could go back to London  Since Hyde Park was right near our Hotel  we spent a couple of Afternoons there  Every afternoon we d come back to our room to find it spotless  I do have to say the rooms are small  but it s London  We had a GREAT Rate     pounds a night  It wasn t the cheapest hotel in London  but I believe it was the best for the money  I would definitely stay at this hotel again  if I ever get back to London    
N =>  Clean and nice I read so many bad reviews about terrible budget hotels in London  so my expectations for this Blakemore Hotel was low  I guess that was good in a way because I was pleasantly surprised at how clean the place was  It s close to two subway stations so that made getting around easier  too  
N =>  highly recommended Trusting the comments of the previous visitors of the hotel  Blakemore was  quot the quot  choice  I ve picked a wonderful rate from the net  which was welcomed by the hotel  Yes  the rooms are very small  they are not even kitsch  and the TV does not have remote  Who cares    miles away from everything  I got very clean sheets and bathroom shower  a warm room with a window to open  and very helpful international staff  They even claimed to have given me an upgrade  for half the door price I have paid If travelling alone  a great choice  in case of a company try to get a larger room  
N =>  Generally fine but    Generally fine  but a very unhelpful  amp  unpleasant response when there was a theft from their luggage room  
N =>  I would return again    I stayed at the Blakemore Hotel  in uary       and with    other people  it was a class trip to London and I found the Blakemore to be a very nice hotel  The rooms were every nice and clean  The staff was good and even though the breakfast wasn t what we expected we made the best of it  We had no problems  I even stayed an extra   days there and the staff was very good to me in reference to changing rooms and attending to my needs  I would stay again here because it s close to many things and its a nice part  I would recommend anyone to stay here  Plus your there to visit London not to stay in a hotel the whole day  Enjoy your trip  
N =>  Not the best choice   just ok  
N =>   esperienza positiva   se non fosse per l assenza dell aria condizionata  
N =>  sin ascensor habitaci n cutre estafa al llamar a taxi  
N =>  No regresar a a este hotel   la fachada enga a   
N =>   Hugely over rated As a frequent traveller to London we usually stay at the Berkeley or the Park Lane but I thought this time we would try Blakes as I had always hearrd good things about it and the rate was much the same  What a disappointment  Our room was dark  small and tired  It was also in the basement with bars on the windows and an air conditioning vent sticking out the window  The small courtyard area was pleasant enough but when we requested a drink on returning from dinner we were refused  I just couldn t recommend this hotel to anyone given our experience  be in it s heyday it was something special but sadly we found it lacking  
N =>   Sadly I have to agree       Blakes is looking tired   Had not been to Blakes for    years  I was a little shocked to see it looking so tired    But  honestly it did not take away from any charm this hotel has  Absolutely  would recommend this hotel to friends  I love it  Worth every penny in my book  The staff are with without a doubt  friendly  helpful and quite charming  Looove this hotel  
N =>   A sumptious place to stay We used Blakes as an easy point of access for the Chelsea flower show and Central London  as soon as we arrived we knew we had made the right choice  expensive but plush  
N =>   Wonderful unforgetable experience Fantastic HotelStaff  and service immpecible When I need to stay in London Blakes will be top of my list Can not praise highly enoughWonderful unforgetable experience 
N => Worst hotel experience ever  Had heard from a coupe of people that this was a good hotel to stay in the Chelsea area   I think though that was in the      s  It needs a major refurbishment  The lift even had graffiti and the air conditioning wasn t working  My room was so hot that even after opening all the windows i was still hot  The hotel manager s solution was to turn off the entire hotel heating but i was told it would take about an hour to cool down  Is this good enough    especially at these prices    NOI complained and checked out after just   hours there   and checked into the very good Number    just down the road   I will never go back to Blakes unless they refurbish  
N =>  Simply not good enough     Firstly  let me say that I live very close to Blake s Hotel in South Kensington  I have builders working in my house  so it was easiest to check into a hotel whilst the work was being completed I had heard a lot of good things about Blake s  it was small  quiet and dedicated to providing unprecedented levels of service  Sadly  I got a major shock when I arrived    I was allocated a room in the basement  it was cold  no heating except for an electric heater    noisy and had no shower  I tried several times to order room service  and when the kitchen did answer I was shouted at down the phone  quot I ll have to call you back quot   Whilst the decor is spectacular and arresting  it is very impractical and now looking very tired  I checked out the following night  they were fully booked and could not accomodate me  but was due to check in again for the remaining few weeks of my stay  When I looked at my new room  it was pretty much the same state of affairs  How do they expect to retain   star status and not even be able to provide a shower for guests  A huge disappointment  espically given the price That said  I have checked into an excellant hotel very nearby  Number Sixteen  It is again a small hotel  but the rooms are bigger  fresher and have showers    
N =>  Massive disappointment  What a let down this was Our daughters booked this hotel for us as an anniversary gift  I feel they were robbed  they really thought they were doing something nice for us They booked a luxury double at                 vat room only I was horrified at the state of the room we were allocated  it was on the fourth floor  We used the lift and after what seemed to take a life time we reached the fourth  The hallway was narrow but tastefully decorated     that s where it ended Our sitting room was awful  the carpets were stained  it had an overall grubby appearance  To turn off one of the lamps we had to pull out the mini bar    how convenient     We couldn t open the blinds as they were broken The bathroom was miniscule  it didn t have a window and as far as we could tell there wasn t an extractor  and if there was it wasn t working  it was so small they couldn t put a toilet roll holder on the wall  the loo roll was perched on the side of the sink  The bath had dead flies in it and the plug didn t fit so the water trickled out constantly  You could barely turn round in there let alone dry yourself The bedroom   well   you wouldn t believe it  you could barely walk round the bed  there was about   inches from the side of the bed to the patio doors which wouldn t open so it was stifling  and about   inches on the other side to the wall  We couldn t get dressed undressed in there as it was too small and again the carpet was stained  most unpleasant We were hoping for a relaxing evening and unfortunately the champagne that our daughters had delivered to the room for when we were returned from a lovely evening at the ballet had to be brought home  the ambiance just wasn t there and by this time the room was unbearably hot  no a c  We spent as little time as possible in the hotel which was not the point of the trip I know the website says that their description of the rooms can vary  but this room was a million miles away from anything on the web site or in their brochure  On checking out my husband noticed that they had added an  optional        service charge for bringing the champagne to the room and also we had been charged for drinks from the mini bar which we hadn t had  The receptionist did remove these items without any fuss I will add that the reception area is quite impressive and the staff were pleasant and polite but apart from that I wouldn t recommend this hotel at all  
N =>  My favourite London hotel I have been staying at Blakes for many years  including a year I spent essentially living there back in       This past weekend I spent two days staying in a  quot luxury double quot  in the mews  If anything this hotel has improved  The service was better and the atmosphere even more pleasant than in the past  The room is not large  but it is extremely comfortable and cleverly designed to maximise the space  The bath was very large  although baths in the main building do tend to be small  and of course I stole a bar of the famous grapefruit soap to bring home  Room service was excellent both in service and in taste  They have recently upgraded to flat screen TVs and expanded their channel selection  which was nice when I arrived late at night still on NY time  The bed was a little less comfortable than I remembered   I think they may have removed the featherbeds  The room is heavily curtained and can be made completely dark  which is great for the jet lag impaired I have read the othe reviews on this site and was really surprised to see that a lot of people did not enjoy their stay at Blakes  For people who are trying to decide whether to stay here or not  some things to consider    This is a very European style hotel   it is not Americanized to cater to US tastes at all  Most rooms are fairly small and most baths are just that   baths  not showers    It is expensive  Not just the room rates  but also the cost of meals  etc  It is not a  quot good value quot  kind of place    The style and atmosphere is idiosyncratic and will not be to everyone s taste  Velvet walls  layered fabrics  dark moody rooms  that sort of thing  I personally love it  but anyone who favours a more modern style will probably not find it to their liking  
N =>  Not Sure I took my wife for her bday and to be honest for      per night I was a little shocked The bar and rest was closed as it appeared someone had came in and bought them out     quot  I booked it     months prior to date quot  the strange thing was though I was told   weeks before though that they had double booked us     I have my thoughts there    anyway nice room if a little worn but and I am sure if you wanted one romatic night away this might be the place   if you did not know anywhere else      concierge was wrong on a few occasions and the staff were not as I woud have liked for      per night Would I go back     If only someone else were paying    
N =>   Not worth the money We should have realised when trying to book this hotel that it was masquerading as a    property  Having been cut off once  then told someone would phone me back  I finally managed to make a booking on the third attempt  This did not bode well Check in was fine on arrival  but the lift is like a coffin  Dark  and you can only get two people in it  it is so tiny  The porter had to go up the stairs and meet us on our floor We booked a Directors Double  which cost      for the night  excluding breakfast  which was another      Having read reviews here  I was relieved that the room was not as small as I had expected  However  there were other problems There was a mobile air conditioning unit placed in our bedroom  A large venting pipe went out of the window  meaning that we were unable to close the window for the duration of our stay  This caused us some anxiety when we had to leave the room for the evening  as we were unsure about security  In addition  this air conditioning unit leaked profusely  meaning that for an area of about   metres around it  the carpet was absolutely soaking  This was positioned where my partner had no choice but to walk through this puddle when getting in or out of bed  hence he spent most of our stay with wet feet  As noted by previous reviewers  we also had peeling wallpaper  drawers and cupboards that didn t open or shut properly etc  And whatever you do  be very careful if you want to buy souvenirs of your stay  There is a price list in the closet   candles are         soaps are         robes  not very luxurious        Needless to say  we didn t bother I feel that the hotel desperately needs upgrading and no longer deserves its    rating  It has clearly been designed  a long time ago  with style over substance  The day bed in our room was impossible to relax on due to the strange design  and our mattress was incredibly hard and uncomfortable  The tv is placed behind a curtain under a table so is impossible to watch from any position except laying on your front on the bed  I found this room very uncomfortable  not a luxurious joy to be in at all With breakfast another      again  we didn t bother   I feel that this is an expensive night away  and this hotel certainly didn t justify the price  Next time I would go somewhere else where I would feel I was getting value for money  There are much better hotels in London than Blakes  
N => Do not stay here   Unless you are willing to fork out      a night for a room here then expect a dark  depressing  claustrophobic room with a tiny fuzzy tv last furnished in the mid    s with a bathroom to match My girlfriend and I planned to stay here for   nights but could not wait to get out of there by the second night We checked in at  pm on the Saturday into a  director s double  at a rate of      a night  By midnight we were suicidal  Any energy or life we had in us was sapped up by the dark red walls and carpets  the black furniture and the small uncomfortable bed  You could not walk around the room with bumping into a wall  table  chair or lamp We called the useless night manager at midnight and explained to him our discomfort  He advised us that he had   other rooms into which we can move    of the rooms were  although designed differently to ours  equally dark  dingy and unimpressive  The other room was a much larger suite costing      per night We therefore had no choice but to take the suite however we were told that had to pay an extra      even though it was midnight and the manager could see our discomfort and annoyance  The following day  we asked for a  pm check out but were told that that was not possible as they needed the room Blakes has had its time and is in desperate need for a refurb  With so many other beautiful  comfortable   star boutique hotels in London this should be last on your list of choices  Do not make the same mistake I did  
N =>  An expensive but decadent haven perfect for couples  We could only afford to stay for   night for my birthday  but are very glad we did  This is a hotel to STAY in On arrival  the smoky glass doors open and you step into a lobby filled with the scent of grapefruit  candles   bowls of oranges  warm wood floors  amp  soft candle lighting  Even the reception area seems mysterious  hidden away behind a set of key cubbyholes  The concierge  an enthusiastic young New Zealander  showed us to our room  around our room  amp  organised tea in the Chinese room Having got their early  we were given an outside lower level room   part of the section of Victorian terrace that the hotel takes over  It was accessed by going outside of the hotel  had its own front door and kitchenette   but I was concerned about potential noise on the road on a Saturday night  amp  it didn t quite have that  decadent  feeling  Also   not being famous      we didn t feel we needed to be so secluded from the rest of the hotel  So  we asked if we could move to a room within the main body of the hotel itself facing inwards That was the best move  Our room was luscious   reds  blacks  amp  golds  Could never get away with those colours in our own home but it worked  Orchids adorn the rooms  the sofas are sinkable  the bathrooms luxurious and the beds sumptuous  Dupion silk lined the walls   who needs boring old wallpaper  The concierge was wonderful   i ve never had such service   he offered to go and rent us DVDs from the shop to watch  and to go out to the local pharmacy to get us bath salts we wanted  The tea served in the Chinese room was laid out in moroccan style silver pots with a plate of homemade lemon  chocolate and vanilla shortbread biscuits  The hotel is so cosy that you fail to see any other occupants   even when full  When we ventured down to breakfast at   am on Sunday  there was no one there  But why would there be  The room service menu was the best i ve ever seen by far   chinese dim sum  delectable cocktails  sumptuous desserts   and breakfast in bed is an option The downsides It was very expensive  We got a good deal on a director s double but it is still somewhat overpriced   probably because of the celebrity guests  For such expense  I would expect bath salts and nicer bathroom  condiments  instead of typical hotel style bottles of shampoo  It s a    minute walk from the tube station   so with heavy baggage that s a bit of a pain  I would ask them to pick you up from the station  Overall though a great place to hide away in for a few days  
N =>  Could not get out of there fast enough  I went to Blakes after reading the excellent reviews on Tripadvisor and because the hotel where I usually stay in South Kensington  the excellent Sydney House  was full  Blakes is quite a bit of a walk from the tube station  either South Kensington or Gloucester Road  if you have luggage to carry and I was a bit exhausted by the time I got there Reception staff was very pleasant  the decor busy but interesting  Main problem was my      night room  inc tax  was so tiny I could not even have both the bathroom door and the wardrobe door open at the same time  The mini bar  hidden under a small round table  did not function  Who would want warm Coke or champagne     The TV was a cheap looking  tiny portable set tucked away in the wardrobe  and placed on top of a really cheap and nasty plastic set of drawers  The safe  non electronic  needed supposedly my asking the reception for key  I did not bother  When I sat on the toilet  my knees were pressed agains the wall  I took a shower  the water was just lukewarm  Given the tiny size of the room  one might question the wisdom of the decorator when he decided to paint it      dark green  This really made for a claustrophobic  buried alive feel  The bed was really high   you had to climb onto it rather than fall into it  which made sitting on it eg to put on your shoes not very practical  There was no duvet on the bed  but an old style thin blanket  There was also some sort of damage on the ceiling  which looked a little caved in at one corner All in all I detested Blakes  I am assuming the good reviews on this site come from people who stayed in large rooms  only I was not prepared to pay more than      a night  and for that price I would expect a spacious  modern room   so I checked out as early as I could do so without incurring penalty and went to another hotel for the remainder of my stay  
N =>  A Proposal Dream  I was taken to Blakes by my fiance on uary   th       On arriving at the exclusive venue we were shown up to our room by the porter through corridors filled with character and style  The room was stunning throughout and a perfect location for my fiance to propose to me  It was a memorable occasion and the hotel service and decor only added to our experience  Highly recommended all round and looking forward to our next visit
