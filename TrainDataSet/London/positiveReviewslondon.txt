P =>  Nice  A few days in Vegas with my mother and father in tow saw us select the Hilton Grand Vacation Club at The Hilton  We d stayed at The Hilton before  but rooms were better value at the HGVC so we booked there The room was nice   a king suite  with mother and father occupying the master  and me the sofa bed  The sofa bed was just fine  but the hotel staff do nothing to help you set it up  and there are one or two sharp corners on the frame of the sofa bed  which drew blood  But it was comfortable enough once set up The master also featured a spa tub  and a seperate bathroom had a shower and twin wash basins  A ful kitchen was set aside from the lounge area  which had a flat screen TV  the master had an older traditional television  All was clean and the room was serviced daily to an acceptable standard The hotel also features a small health club and pool  Despite being ember  I was able to swim daily in a nicely warmed pool  I did not venture into the gym Location wise  the facility is adjacent to the Las Vegas Hilton and room charging is possible from that property  Set back from the strip  a car is essential  but that isn t a big deal Friendly staff make this a property I would definitely recommend and return too 
P =>   Great property   timeshare swap Once again we chose this swap based on reviews here and a previous stay at another HGVC  It is a very clean and tidy property although our room was only cleaned once in the week  The room was very spacious and had a well equipped kitchen   the free inroom wireless internet was a little lethargic  The shop was well stocked and did fresh rolls  wraps  salads and sweets each day   with very helpful and friendly staff as were all we had dealings with  The reception and concierge were particularly helpful This is a quiet hotel but is adjacent to the main Hilton which is fully equipped with casino and many restaurants   inc an outstanding buffet and has headliner acts  If you are a Star Trek fan please be aware the Star Trek experience closed permanently from t       The pool was quite small but adequate and has a large jacuzzi and towels are provided The hotel is a little walk from the main strip   but you need to walk off all that great food     
P =>   First class customers service and an enjoyable stay  We were relocated to the Hilton Grand Vacations Club  HGVC  at very short notice  We were due to spend our honeymoon at the Meridian Luxury Suites  but found out  via a review on this website      the evening before our wedding that they had closed down  Meridian didn t even have the decency to inform the travel agent   Anyway      the HGVC more than made up for the Meridian s shortfall     We received a warm welcome from Jodi on the Front Desk  who provided us with some much needed essentials after one of our cases went missing The rooms are spacious and well equiped   definately a  home from home    washer  dryer  oven  microwave  large fridge freezer  coffee maker  blender  hairdryer  spa bath  large tv in lounge and bedroom  and best of all    free wireless internet connection  Complimentary sachets of the following replaced daily   shampoo  conditioner  body wash  soap  starbucks coffee  washing powder  washing up liquid  On day one we thought we had a problem with the water temperature  An engineer was knocking on the door within   minutes of making the call  I simply hadn t run the tap long enough   Oops Alice and ian on the Front Desk made several phone calls on our behalf to locate our lost baggage  We can t thank Alice and ian enough for their help  The manager k is approachable and clearly places a great deal of importance on the wellbeing of guests  k was aware of the situation with our luggage and offered his personal support Blanca and the other Maids were very efficient and friendly  We returned to our room each day to find a wonderful towel creation   swans  dogs  birds etc etc The deli is open from early in the morning to   pm  They stock all the essentials plus a range of sandwiches  wraps and salads  plus cakes  muffins etc We never struggled to find a sunbed by the pool  Fresh clean towels are provided by the pool area  There is a bar beside the pool  and free use of barbeques The hotel is located off the stip   a positive or a negative depending on the purpose of your stay  We spent a lot of time on the stip so enjoyed the quieter side of the HGVC We would definately stay here again  Thank you to all at the HGVC  
P =>   Great but quiet If you are looking to escape the Strip and the sounds that come with it  this is the ideal hotel  It was very clean at an affordable price and a cab ride away from the Strip  I would recommend it for older people  
P =>  Good This hotel is clean  beatiful and excellent service  Las Vegas is for adults  Not recomend to bring childrens  
P =>   Great for Kids in Vegas Stayed for   nights in the middle of a road trip with the kids  More of a   bedroom apartment than a Hotle room  full kitchen  washer  dryer etc  Great pool  jacuzzi and free barbecues  Only on block off the strip and probably the only place in Vegas with no slot machines We absloutely loved it   
P =>   Excellent We have been in Las Vegas probably    or    times  I have personally stayed in almost every casino hotel of the city  We are a family of four  my sons are   and     My review for this property is just a word  EXCELLENT  The suites are cozy  very well dressed  it makes you feel even better than at home  The convenience of the washer dryer and full refrigerator and kitchenet is a major plus  I have been in other suites that has these conveniences  but here you do not really see them  they do not invade your space or make you feel like you have the kitchen in front of you  as other places  The whole resort is great  the pool  the gym  free very clean towels at the gym   and the deli market  The deli market has good prices and the sandwiches are just plain GREAT  fresh  and huge  Three of us actually ate only one sandwich  If you have a family  you can not be wrong by staying here  If you want to leave your children playing or seeing the TV     channels    you can go to the  quot quiet room quot  which is a huge lounge  very comfortable and cozy  
P =>  Another great HGVC experience Tucked away just off the strip  the Hilton Grand Vacation was a welcome change from the  quot cheap but charge for everything quot  Casinos that makes up much of Las Vegas s accomodation We had stayed in a Grand Vacations hotel in Orlando in      and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves so our expectations where high for the Las Vegas Grand Vacation     We booked a king suite and weren t dissapointed   For a start it was well appointed with a kitchen  laundry and spa bath as well as TVs in the lounge and bedroom  Features aside  the suite nicely decorated  comfy  tidy and above all else  roomy  Compared to our previous Las vegas accomodation who wanted to charge us an outragious amount of money for basics such as internet access  wireless was part of the service at the Grand vacation and the staff were also really nice Given it s close proximity to the strip and it s amenities I d strongly reccomend the Grand Vacation over Casino s in a flash  
P =>   loved this timeshare we stayed for   days and I loved this place no noise at night  no smoky smells  no overly crowded pool  I think I am getting old  I liked that you could get away from the strip in   minutes and get right back if you wanted to  The bathrooms were nice and we had a   bedroom    tvs and a full kitchen  We didnt find the deli horribly priced  expected to pay more for convenience  and the sandwiches and salads were good and fresh  the pool was a pleasure  plenty of places to sit  clean towels and very pleasant company  we had our grandkids there for   days  pool drinks a little pricy but the slushies were very tasty  elevators quick and the staff very nice  we had zero complaints  convenient parking  free  just across the driveway   mile from drugstores  supermarkets etc w o going to the strip  take a right on Karen down to yland Ave  Would love to stay here again 
P =>  Great Resort This was a timeshare exchange  We had a   bedroom suite for a girl s weekend  It was great  The room were spacious and the beds comfortable  We did not hear noise from any neighbors and we slept late because of our casino hopping  I was very impressed with how this resort was set up  Check in was easy and parking was a breeze  There was no high pressure sales pitch  They left a message on the phone but we were too busy making donations at the casinos to talk with them  No one ever ask us directly to attend a meeting  I really like this resort and would recommend it highly to anyone  The Hilton is less than a   minute walk and the monorail is right there  We had breakfast at the Paradise Cafe and the omelets were great  You can t eat in Vegas for under      even a sandwich and drink  but the Cafe was good and reasonable for Vegas  We had a great time and would go back in a heart beat  
P =>  Calm Nice and spacy rooms  Somewhat distant from action  The Monorail transport option helps though  Would prefer to go again when I retire  
P =>   Very nice for the price As many of the reviews have mentioned that this is a typical timeshare location and the staff are really nice  Parking is easy  check in was smooth  and the rooms are nice  We booked a studio on hilton com for      tax night on a weekend and we were given a   bedroom suite  which was quite nice  It has everything in it including laundry  whirlpool tub  and a flat screen tv There is a little store called the marketplace and it is really overpriced  but what hotel s store isn t anymore  The store has a large variety of food and non food items A nice thing about the location is that it is next door to the Hilton  so if you want a real restaurant  gym  or casino  it is right there  This was the first hotel we ve stayed at in Las Vegas that wasn t in a casino and it was actually quite pleasant to not have to walk through the noise and the smoke before getting to the room  But it is not the typical Las Vegas experience  If you are looking for that  this is not the place for you  However  this location tends to have quite inexpensive rates  
P =>  Great Service I didn t stay at the hotel because my friends booked the wrong hotel  But the registration manager went out of his way to call the other property and got us a room for the same price  for a hotel with better location  It was so nice for him to do that  I will highly recommend this hotel  
P =>   A timeshare property It s a timeshare property  but that just means that you may get a suite w kitchenette  wash machine  amp  dryer  amp  a full sized fridge for the price of a nice hotel room   On this particular trip we stayed in a studio  which is pretty comparable to any standard hotel room  My wife  amp  I are big fans of packing our own beverages and snacks whenever we stay at a hotel   and although the studio suite only came with a refridgerator and microwave   it was still very convienient The hotel is a short walk from the Hilton Hotel Casino  and if you re there to gamble you only need to make that walk once a day  because the monorail is right next to the entrance to the Hilton  A    hour pass on the monorail is    and it takes you to a dozen casinos  The first night we rode all the way to the end of the line and then worked our way back   and just scratched the surface  Between the monorail and a couple of taxi rides  the Wynn looked like it was too far to walk to  we felt very satisfied with both our location and our transportation solutions The hotel property was clean and well appointed  if not spectacular  There is an onsite coffee shop deli convenience store  What most impressed us was how friendly each and every one of the hotel staff we interacted with were  Good job on that  We did eat one meal at the adjacent Hilton Hotel Paradise Cafe  and it was a good  reasonably priced meal  breakfast  We had also recently stayed at a timeshare property in Scottsdale for a Christmas party and loved our room there too  We re definately going to add timeshares as a  quot good value quot  when looking for hotel rooms in the future  
P =>  Good for business Stayed here for a conference at the Hilton Convention Center  It was extremely convenient to stay at the same place as the conference  The hotel was nice  the casino was considerably smaller than the others  but was very luxurious   with crystal chandeliers and all The hotel has several restaurants to choose from  Paradise Cafe was great for a lunch  the Buffet was decent and included wine and beer  Quark s Bar was really fun and had great drinks  but the Chinese restaurant was absolutely fabulous We enjoyed the room  unfortunately  we were in an older room that had not yet been renovated  The room was still spacious and clean and the bed was very comfortable  We did have issues with the hot water when taking morning showers   I guess because so many people were going to the conference early in the morning Having the monorail station there was great and it is truly the best way to get around Las Vegas   especially since the Hilton is so far from the strip We did go see a concert in the theatre  not Barry Manilow  but another headliner  and the theatre was very nice  but could definitely use some updates I would consider staying here again  but  next time  we will stay on the strip  
P =>   Reasonable Hotel if You Want Quiet We are members of the Hilton Club and stayed here while attending a conference at the Convention Center  We had a   bedroom suite  The overall room was great and the small kitchen was reasonably well appointed  fine for making breakfast  wouldn t want to make a meal here   The facility has a pool  a food store  and a very small gym    stepper    treadmills  and a universal weight set   If you want a place that has peace and quiet and no casino noise  this is great  It is within walking distance to the Monorail at the Hitlon  across a long parking lot   You don t really get any discount or advantage at the Hilton itself but if you want a nearby casino the Hilton has one The Hilton  hotel  spa is nice  the gym is pretty small  several treadmills and steppers and several weight machines but relatively spartan by Vegas standards Overall the Hilton Grand Vacations Club is fine if you want a quiet place to stay but it s not anywhere near a  quot Vegas quot  experience  One significant downside is that it s hard to get a cab here at night  During the day they call a cab for you and one usually comes  At night you are just out of luck  even if you call a cab  they don t come   It s   blocks from the strip and far enough away that you just can t flag one either  We ended up going to the Hilton hotel across the large parking lot and waited in the long cab line there  Leave yourself plenty of time if you have a reservation somewhere  
P =>  Wonderful Place to Stay I have visited Las Vegas many times and have previously stayed at the Excaliber and the MGM Grand  When you stay at a casino hotel  it can get on your nerves   the long walk to and from your room  walking thru a smoky casino  very few amenities in your room  etc  I wanted a change and the Grand Vacations Club was perfect We booked a king size suite  The kitchen was perfect  even a dishwasher  There was a small washer dryer unit in the closet  The kitchen had everything we needed to make small meals and breakfast and the fridge was full sized  Our son slept on the sofa bed in the front room and we slept in the bedroom  The bath included a large jacuzzi tub The room was extremely quiet   so much nicer than having to deal with the partying that happens when you sleep  quot on the strip quot   The pool and jacuzzi were clean and heated and nobody was around when we used them  It was wonderful  The MGM closes down their pool during the winter months as do many of the Strip hotels There was a small grocery in the hotel  but I drove a few blocks to a market and stocked up on food  The new monorail is within walking distance of the hotel  in the back of the parking lot   an easy way to get to any of the strip casinos The hotel also had a concierge in the lobby  She was awesome  She got us great seats for Spamalot  even though it was very short notice  All of the staff was extremely kind  helpful  and accommodating  I can t say enough nice things about them Many of the hotels on the strip have shabby rooms and are extremely dirty   this is because many of the visitors are partying and are rough on the rooms  At this hotel  everything was in good order  clean  and beautiful There also was a lounge with a big screen TV and a billiards table  Lots of room to play games  if you wanted  I saw many families hanging out there during the day  but it was never crowded or annoyingly loud Our room even came with a DVD player so our son could watch movies  This is one of the few hotels where we have stayed with that amenity I also work on the road  so I was able to access the wireless internet from my room on my laptop with no problem  The internet service is FREE   included in the room charge   the casino hotels charge extra for that Other than the small market and your room  there is no place to eat at the hotel   however  you can walk to the Hilton which is right next door or eat on the strip  We ate most of our meals on the strip while we visited the various attractions  but it was nice to be able to eat breakfast in our room and also have snacks when we got back in the evening Even better  the price was less than half what the casino hotels charge   let s see  better service  more amenities  cleaner rooms  and a better price  about      nite vs       nite    sounds like a no brainer to me  This will be my first choice whenever I visit Vegas from now on  
P =>  Great Stay I needed to use a timeshare week and wanted to attend a sporting event at the LV Convention Center  so I chose this HGV location  The check in was quick and friendly  My two bedroom suite was clean and roomy  I appreciated the numerous electrical outlets to hookup my electronic toys  My suite overlooked the pool and the front of the hotel  The view across Paradise Road was of the other HGV on Las Vegas Blvd  the Riviera  and the Stratosphere  Although there is condo construction across Paradise Road  there was no noise pollution  Traveling eastward along Karen  I found at the next main street   yland Parkway   two    hour supermarkets   Albertsons and Vons Safeway   The Vons  even  had a gas station  where I filled up twice for       a gallon     I had problems with a dead battery in the in room safe and a backed up toilet  Both problems were fixed quickly  Each bedroom and the living room had separate heating air conditioning system  which was a nice touch  The hotel tower shades the pool area in the morning  making an early morning swim more a polar bear experience  Patio area heaters would have made the area more useable It turned out to be a very long walk between the HGV hotel through the LV Hilton to the LV convention center  particularly on a cold  rainy day  I ended driving most of the time   hehe Check out was also quick with no lines  The quiet  non smoking aspects of HGV was a nice retreat from the noise and smoke of the big casinos  The only negative is the lack of fans in the bathrooms  Bring a can of air freshner I would recommend this location to my friends and family  Because of Hilton policy  I can not exchange for this location for the next two years  
P =>   HGVLV was a Lucky Pick  I had not plannned to visit Las Vegas at this time of year  but lucked up catching a Delta Airlines special          R T from ATL  so I had to go Since I hadn t been budgeting for a trip  I had to look for bargains  I found a good deal for the Saturday arrival at the Las Vegas Hilton  and saw that for about     more for the next two nights  I could move to the HGVLV  I really liked the idea of a kitchenette since I m usually carrying a to go box back to my room after dinners out on any vacation  With no microwave  well   whaddaya gonna do with it     gt  Check in was super  Right away  the Host Concierge Manager Robert took interest in making me feel special and welcome  I was given a wonderful   th floor King Studio overlooking a golf course and facing toward the mountains and sunrise  which I loved  The bed was wonderful  and the kitchenette was just the thing for me to fix myself a drink or snack  or re heat my to go goodies  without having to dress and go downstairs or somewhere else   although I did my share of that as well  I had a rental car and bought myself some groceries and liquor at the Smith s grocery store off North Rancho  By signing up for the shopper card I saved     from my final total of      which included an apple pie  breakfast slice   fruits  nuts  Brie  crackers  chips  a bottle of Stoly Citrus vodka which was on sale for          a bottle of Ecco Dominici Pinot Grigio wine and this neat bottle opener stopper gadget  a bottle of Jose Cuevero ready mixed gueritas  Mr   amp  Mrs  T Bloody y mix  bottles of water  some makeup and a few souveniers as well  I actually brought a lot of this back home with me   no liquor  but the other things I could pack  so my budget trip went very well  Even though I drank only about a third of the Stoly  for     it was definitely cheaper than buying drinks one by one somewhere out  Plus  I had my wonderful view to enjoy while sipping and enjoying my spur of the moment R amp R The room already had a complement of Starbucks coffee pods for the coffeemaker  although I did make a run to the deli grocery downstairs the next morning for more sugar and Half N Half That morning I went to the pool downstairs  Even though it was ember   th  they were saying on the TV News that this near record warmth was due to change on Tuesday  which would be the day I was leaving  The pool was heated  anyway  So I certainly enjoyed a ember morning in the sun by the pool I really liked the hotel toiletries  The lotion smelled wonderful  There was also a ironing board iron  room safe and hairdryer  for those who need these items  In the morning  as a HHonors member  a USA Today hung on my doorknob outside  My room was quiet enough  I did hear muffled voices a few times from the neighbors  nothing irritating  just enough to know I wasn t totally alone up there The room attendants were so friendly and accommodating  Any request I made was immediately and graciously handled I thought I had lost my prescription sunglasses  The day I went to check out  I moved my rental car from the HGVLV parking lot around to the front to load my luggage  When I went around to unlock the trunk  there sat my sunglasses on the back of the trunk  Only in Vegas Great rate  great room  great experience  I hated to leave  and I hope to be back ASAP  
P =>  Nice Hotel Great Location I had been somewhat worried about outrstay here because of some of the blogs I d read  Once we arrived  I was very impressed  We booked a two bedroom which was a one bedroom suite and a one bedroom room hooked together since we had   people in our party  The suite was nice and spacious with a full kitchen  washer and dryer  The master bedroom had a whirlpool  The bathroom had a double sink and large shower stall  The attached room was a little tight  but for two people it was ok  It had a little kitchenette with a small fridge  The hotel staff were very pleasant and helpful  The pool was always clean with lots of fresh pool towels  There is a bar that you can go to right from the pool or sit on a terrace and not be at the pool and still go to the bar  The store had good food even if it was a little pricey   all the food seems pricey in Vegas  It was easy to walk to the Hilton next door for larger restaurants and get to the monorail  We walked to the Sahara also which wasn t too far  The monorail is great for getting around Vegas because traffic does not move  After being in the crowds on the strip it was relaxing to get back to the HGVC and have peace and quiet  Another nice thing about this resort is that you need your card to go to the pool and after   pm to use the elevator  This might seem like a hassle to some people but you felt more secure  Lots of parking was available outside and in the parking deck  We would definitely stay there again  The only negative was that the bathrooms did not have fans in them  
P =>   Hilton   not at its best I agree with previous reviewers about the location  If you want to get to the action on the strip  a car or shuttle are best  If you like the quiet nature of a non gaming hotel  this is a good choice  I stayed only one night in a king studio  I thought the room was pretty small and no different than a typical hotel room  but it did have a fridge and microwave  along with a toaster and coffee maker  The room was clean  but I had problems with my shower and toilet  Neither worked well  The shower faucet was nearly dangling from the wall and the toilet handle required frequent jiggling to get the water to stop continuous flushing  In addition  I had problems cooling the room down to a comfortable temperature  Windows do not open Like another reviewer  I could hear conversations and a baby crying in a neighboring room  not a fun distraction during the wee hours  In the morning  the sounds of people showering in adjacent rooms were pretty loud While the courteous  professional staff were great and the easy  close parking was convenient  I was unimpressed otherwise  and will not return  nor recommend this property  It s likely that the   bedroom suites are much nicer  so I hope future guests enjoy the   brm accommodations  My next stay is scheduled for another Hilton Grand Vacations property  the location on Las Vegas Blvd  I hope to have a better experience there  
P =>  Nice Big Rooms Long Walk My wife and I were contacted by Hilton Grand Vacations Club  to attend a timeshare  They gave us a one bedroom suite  that was nice and large  Full kitchen  washer  amp  dryer  flat screen tv s  the works  We were pretty happy with the hotel  Our only complaint is it is located far from the action  and the cab fare from this hotel to the center strip ran           one way  We Finally purchased a   hour unlimited use pass for the monorail which has a stop next door at the Hilton  The monorail runs every five minutes  and is very easy and clean  I am not sure I would stay here again due to it s location  but we had a great time  
P =>  Great Hotel We stayed here one night with our kids  and loved it  We had the one bedroom suite  and it was a lovely  spacious room  The staff is so friendly and helpful  They have excellent customer service  The pool area is nice  and they have a small bar outside  They have a nice deli inside  with a good choice of food and drinks  We would love to stay here again  It felt small and comfortable  compared to the large hotels on the strip  
P =>   Great stay would love to revisit  I stayed with two other people in a single King with sleeper sofa  I slept on the sleeper sofa  and all things considered  it was quite comfortable  I actually enjoyed not having daily maid service  this is generally a time share property   my friends and I all brought our laptops and there was no concern about items being stolen from our room  The room was very clean and quiet  The kitchenette was a nice feature  although we didn t often have the need for it  It s a bit off the beaten path  but still has a nice view  Access to the Star Trek Experience at the Hilton was great  just a short walk  Also  the monorail was readily accessible  although I didn t use it because I had a rental vehicle  This makes it a great choice for someone who wants to stay off of the Strip but wants to use public transportation Really  my visit was EXCELLENT  My only complaints are the following  Room was on the smallish side   no walking space for anyone with sofa bed pulled out  Downstairs deli sundry shop was ridiculously expensive  
P => Nice rooms good location but too noisy HGVC at the Hilton is a nice hotel with large rooms  meant for their time share customers   Many rooms have a separate living room  kitchen  large bathroom with separate shower and jacuzzi tub in the bedroom  Some rooms have a great view toward the strip The hotel is off Paradise  which means it s not a good walk to get to the strip  However  there is a shuttle  and more convenient  a short walk to the monorail station  The monorail is a smooth  quick way to get to the strip hotels  It should be cheaper  but it can save on taxi fares and kids just love it  I ve stayed here four times  mostly because of the larger rooms and access to the monorail  Check in is always a challenge  they post a  pm check in time  and then expect a   am check out  Recently  I have noticed that the dividing walls between the rooms are too thin  One family was having a normal conversation in their bedroom  and it sounded as if they were standing right behind me as I tried to fall asleep in our bedroom  I complained to the front desk  who called their room to ask them to be a little more quiet  But even after they lowered their voices  I could still hear them  I think the wall construction is the problem  
P =>   Very nice time   HGVC Let me tell you a bit about us before you read the review  My wife and I are both people who enjoy a     star hotel  we are not one s to nit pick at every little thing wrong with a hotel  So please keep that in mind when you read our review  We arrived at HGVC on Tuesday night  parking was a breeze  Not many times you can park your car and walk right into the hotel  Check in was a snap and the staff was quite friendly  no pushy sales pitch to buy a condo or anything  We had a  bedroom suite  witch was clean and had all the little things we needed to make our stay enjoyable  I would recommend a high floor so you can look out unto the strip Both my wife and I like to lay in the sun so the pool was wonderful  a bit small but that was no problem since people seem to come and go  They do have a nice little pool side bar and towels are furnished  Not much more than you could ask for The HVGC is located on north end so if you plan on walking to strip you might think again since it is a bit of a hike  The closest casino was the Hilton right next door   not impressed  The Rivera sits across the street along with Saraha  Both older casino but still lots of action if you are a gambler  If you have have a car I would just suggest just driving down to a local casino and use thier paking garage and accessing the strip from there We did go out the Red Rock Casino   wow   If you get a chance to go out there  We had dinner at the BBQ place  Salt Lick  and then a drink at the outside lounge  It was a perfect night  All and all HGVC is a good solid   star hotel  It is clean has everything you need for a fraction of the price you would pay staying on the strip  Just remember it is not a strip hotel so if you are looking for the hot night life this might be the place for you  but if you dont mind being a bit on the tame side then this place is for you  
P =>   Excellent Hotel for families  Mrs  Gardiner  Kiddo and I spent six nights here in late e  as the two of us were attending a large conference at the Las Vegas Convention Center  This hotel was absolutely perfect for our stay Check in went very well  where we first met some of the friendliest  most helpful hotel employees I ve seen anywhere  and that s a big compliment from me  They continually remembered my name everytime I walked by  and they addressed my daughter by name too  They have an  active  lounge  and a  quiet  lounge  as well as a very well equipped deli convenience store in the lobby  The deli opened at  a each day  and served hot breakfast sandwiches  Starbucks coffee  etc  Full assortment of chips  beer  cokes  vino  etc The pool was small  but that kept things manageable   The Hilton s pool  next door  was an absolute zoo   There was a small pool bar that served drinks at prices very close to the package prices in the convenience store  There are two very nice built in grills by the pool gate We had a Suite  which included a separate bedroom and a fully workable kitchen  more on that later   The greatroom area was also spacious  and had a fold out sofa  Both rooms had large flatscreen TVs  and the greatroom TV had a DVD player  meaning that our traveling Kiddo could watch her Dora DVDs on the big screen  instead of her    portable  Bathroom had a nice sized shower  and Crabtree Evelyn toiletries  A vertical washer dryer unit was nice to have as well  The bedroom had a large whirlpool tub  and a too small  note  only complaint here closet  PERFECT  though  for a small family visit  Housekeeping was sparkling  and everything looked pretty darn new to me Free wi fi throughout the building  and reception was reliably between    and   mbps both in our room and in the lobby area Location is a caution here  depending on why you are in Vegas  It is directly next door      yards  tops  to the side entrance to the Hilton  through which you can walk almost all the way to the Convention Center  The Hilton s monorail stop is just another    feet further than the side door  From the monorail  you can get most places fairly easily  You cannot  though  walk to the strip  at least not with temps in the         range  Parking looked like it was free here  We spent the full six days here without wheels  and had no trouble getting around  The    for   hrs of monorail was a very nice deal  and Kiddo is only    so she rides for free  So  if the Convention Center is your driver for being here  this is a great location  great facility  and great pricing  If you want to be in the center of the gaming action  this ain t it  In fact  there s no gaming in the HGVC at all  you have to head over to the Hilton The HGVC does not  other than the deli  have dining  you have to walk to the Hilton   which is fine  because you can charge back to the HGVC  and get HHonors points   We ate at Quark s twice for lunch  good menu  reasonable prices  and Star Trek characters visit the tables   We also ate at the Paradise Caf   and found the food acceptable  but not great  We had one dinner at the Benihana  as we thought Kiddo would enjoy it  They were helpful with her and her needs  and the cooking show is always fun Should mention that we had one dinner at the Paris Hotel  at Mon Ami Gabi  Third time we ve eaten there  and it really is good  Excellent pricing  and the staff is a lot more friendly than up in the Eiffel Tower  Our waiter there was Dion  and he was superb  see my review at that restaurant for more Back to the HGVC  though  and a further compliment about the staff  While here  we found that an old friend of ours was having his wife and two kids into Vegas after our conference ended  Since we had a kitchen  and they had two boys  we decided that it d be a heckuva lot cheaper to grill out and eat in our suite than to try to feed four adults  with vino  and three kids in a restaurant  I grabbed a cab over to a nearby grocery store  while Mrs  Gardiner visited the front desk to explain what we were up to  within    minutes there were two ladies from housekeeping at the door with another four place settings of dishes  glasses  new silverware  still in wrapper   AND extra papertowels and soap      WOW  One of the housekeepers noticed that I had corn on the cob sitting in a cardboard box and said  You can t serve friends from a cardboard box    then returned five minutes later with a still in the wrapper cooking sheet to serve from  Outstanding  To sum  we successfully prepared and served a full dinner for four adults and three kids    no problem We grilled by the pool  using BBQ tools readily borrowed from the deli convenience store  and carried steaks and corn back upstairs  and ate comfortably while the kids watched TV Net  this was a great hotel for our family  perfect for attending the conference and various meetings  The employees were nothing but wonderful  My compliments to whoever heads HR there  and to the GM  Very  very well done  
P =>   Not a good first stay My husband and I stayed in a   bedroom unit at the HGVC at the Las Vegas Hilton for   nights from il            Due to flight delays we arrived at around  PM  We were then told that the only   bedroom units left were a nonsmoking room on the ground floor and a smoking room on the  th floor  We are not smokers  After checking  and smelling  the smoking room on the  th floor we knew we could never sleep comfortably there so we opted for the ground floor room  We were given room       This would have been a perfect room for us with the added bonus of not having to wait for an elevator EXCEPT for two major problems that really made this an unpleasant stay  the toilet plumbing made a loud banging noise every time we flushed it  really  I felt like I was hearing a performance of Stomp   and the bathroom sink backed up so badly that we used the kitchen sink to brush our teeth instead  Both problems were reported to the front desk within one hour of arrival and then again the following morning but nothing was done to fix it  Front desk said that maintenance was informed but that s all we heard  At checkout we specifically mentioned the problems again and even wrote a note requesting that maintenance fix them before the unit is rented out again  If you re ever given room     at the HGVC Las Vegas Hilton  flush the toilet and run the bathroom faucet first thing before you unpack The full kitchen was nice  We cooked breakfast and had all the dishes  pots and pans to use  Appliances  stove  refrigerator  dishwasher and microwave  were full size  Dishwasher detergent and cleaning items were under the sink  There s an apt size washer dryer unit in the closet in the kitchen with detergent and dryer sheets available  Note that the size of these washer dryer units will only fit a couple of jeans and shirts at most  You ll be doing multiple loads if you have more  Nice granite countertops everywhere   bathroom  kitchen and even on the dresser in the bedroom  Furniture looked upgraded  Carpet  however  was worn in spots and really needs to be changed  Both the bedroom and living room had newer flat panel TVs  Bathroom had a separate shower and jacuzzi tub  I used the tub to soak after a long day of walking the strip  The Paradise Deli was located right around the corner from this unit  which was convenient  They served Starbucks coffee and had a small section of prepared salads  sandwiches and packaged fruits  It s also a small market with a limited selection of toiletries as well as milk  juice and other drinks and some frozen foods and snacks but it s really convenient if you just want to pick something up and don t want to walk too far  We used the gym down the hall from our room  It had a couple of bikes  treadmills and ellipiticals along with some weights  It s a nice size room with adequate machines but really needs to be better ventilated  The Hilton Hotel is a convenient      minute walk through a parking lot  There you ll find restaurants  larger shops with more varied selections and entertainment  The monorail also drops off and picks up there  Monorail tickets can be purchased at ticket machines at the monorail entrance      one trip     two trip      all day pass  Having the monorail at the Las Vegas Hilton was really convenient  We liked the location of this Hilton because it was away from all the action on the strip  It s in a quieter street but with the monorail  has easy access to everything on the strip  This is a good place to stay if you want to be in Las Vegas but not right on the strip  In il       there was some construction going up across the street  Turnberry Towers  but it didn t interfere with the traffic flow or our sleep  With the new Foutainbleu casino going up nearby  there ll be lots of construction around this location in the coming years so don t let that deter you from staying here  The problems I encountered on this stay were specific to this particular room and not indicative of the resort as a whole  I hope Hilton fixes the plumbing problems which are really only minor maintenance issues before renting out      again 
P =>   Great place even if it is a little out of the way I stayed there with my family  amp  fiancee for a week when we went to Vegas this past tember  and what a great place it was  It didn t feel like a hotel at all  felt much more like a home  Flat screen TVs in all   rooms with DVD players  Comfy beds  kitchen was well laid out  sink FACED the living room  it wasn t away from it   the property was clean  pool was nice   I d definitely stay there again  The location off strip was nice too  although it made going everywhere a little bit of a walk  No big deal though  I had longer walks to class when I was at college  Highly recommended  good for families and everyone else  
P => The only place we stay in Vegas My family and I stay at the HGVC at the LV Hilton every time we come to Vegas  The rooms are spacious and clean  My mom is a maid by profession and she was impressed  and have courteous and attentive staff  I feel sorry for the people that stay here one time and have a bad experience  but we have stayed here   to   times and haven t had one problem  Bellman and maid service is always prompt  We love using the grill down by the pool as well as having a full kitchen in the room at our disposal in the one and two bedroom suites  A washer and dryer are included in the one and two bedroom suites as well  Our family loves to go out and we can call down for a minivan cab or walk   minutes to the monorail  You can get your cabbies phone number and call him her directly for a cab  The monorail is a great deal if you want to go down to the MGM as you can purchase a    ride ticket  good for a year  that can be shared by those with you  If its just you and another person thats       one way as opposed to an easy     cab ride  What makes this property so inviting is the fact that it is private and very quiet  The Las Vegas Hilton is a stone s throw from the HGVC and you can catch a cab or the monorail or just plain ole walk to the strip  If you need to be close to the action stay at the HGVC at the Flamingo  but if you like to stay at a quiet  well maintained hotel  the HGVC at the Hilton is the best place to be  
P =>   Great For Mini Getaway  I stayed in HGVC in LV Hilton on memorial weekend  Got a very good rate on a sold out weekend and this hotel is very family welcome  unlike the LV Hilton which is VERY smokey   I am still coughing from the excessive smoke in the casino lobby as of now   The hotel lobby is small but efficient  The staff was very friendly and did find us a room to upgrade us to the one bedroom suite  which is an added bonus The One Bedroom suite have everything you needed  This is what you will get in Living room  Philip LCD TV        quot    a sofabed  dining table for    full refridgerator  full washer dryer with detergient  dish washer  blender  coffee machine  and a stove  and a DVD player and   little bottles of water with a box of chocolate In the bedroom  u get a walk in shower  a king size bed with a tv  non flat   and a spa jacuzzi tub  The only thing that I don t like about the tub is that its in an open area  Which means no privacy to take a bath unless you are travelling with special someone   I think lots hotel in vegas tend to have a tub in an open area   thats kinda odd  As a HHonor member  you ll receive a     voucher thats good for purchase at the deli on the  st floor  which is also very reasonbly priced for a hotel property The hotel also have shuttle  don t know if its free or fee based   and best of all  free wireless internet   Most of the hilton property that I have stayed at don t have this option  and its VERY quiet and not far from the monorail station and pretty easy access to everywhere in vegas  even to the strip  because paradise blvd basically got NO traffic compare to LV blvd  Overall  a great stay  I will this property if they can change the mattress to the new Hilton mattress and update the furniatures  
P =>   Best Place I ever stayed in Vegas I go to Vegas for the NAB Conference each year  and usually I stay at one of the big casinos  This year I brought my    year old son  so I wanted to stay in a place that had a kitchen  From the reviews  I decided to try the Hilton Grand Vacation Club at the Las Vegas Hilton  We loved it This is the best hotel I have ever stayed at  Everything was almost perfect  We had a one bedroom suite and it worked out great  The king bed in the master bedroom was very comfortable  The jacuzzi tub was really nice and great for relaxing after a long day walking around at the convention  The bathroom was huge and the shower was nice and big  Since we were there for   days  the washer and dryer unit in the suite was a big plus  We washed clothes a couple of times  There was a free box of detergent in the room  and we asked for more and got it It was great having a full kitchen  even though we didn t use it a lot  We love eating out The free internet was a huge help  All of the other places I have stayed  charge around       a day for internet  This adds up over a week  We rented a car  so when we wanted to see the sights of Vegas and go shopping  we could get around easily  Everywhere you go has plenty of parking and it is free  The money we saved on internet fees  paid for the car  Also  you park right in front of the hotel and go right up to your room  No smoke to walk through  that was a plus The store in the lobby is very convienient  They sell starbucks coffee and make all kinds of deli items  All in all it was a great hotel  We would stay there again  Probably next year for sure  
P =>   GREAT FOR FAMLIES my wife and two boys stayed from                 we loved the quiteness of the hotel    it is off strip and i loved it    we drove to all hotels on the strip   do valet parking will cost        the cost of the monorail is      pp if you buy the    trip   the monorail leaves you far off the strip and a long walk away   valet leaves you in front of the hotel   worth      to valet  pool area was very nice as well is the store   i would most definetly stay here again in the future   if you want crazy stay elsewhere  if you want quiet after running around the strip this is the place     
P =>   Great stay   Location could be better Not one bad thing to say of the hotel itself  We were in the penthouse suite and loved everything  The location is between the Stratosphere and Circus Circus at the far end of the strip  The trolly stops right at the front and the monorail isn t too far away  Just leave yourself enough time to travel when going to a show or exhibition  
P =>  Great Stay Just returned from a week here  We had the   bedroom unit which was very spacious and very clean  The property is kept in excellent condition  The construction that is going on across the street is not even an issue  We enjoyed our stay very much and would not hesitate to return sometime The monorail stop at the Hilton Casino is a very short walk  Cabs are right outside the door if you prefer that  All of the employees we had dealings with were very courteous  helpful and always greeted you with a smile  A special thank you to ia Teresa in housekeeping  What a special person they have there  I hope the management realizes that     If you re considering going here  do so with confidence that your stay will be very nice  
P =>   Hilton Grand Vacations   Non Resort Hotel ideal for Business Travellers On Karen Avenue Paradise Road a couple of  parallel  blocks from Circus Circus   Sahara  Not too far from the Stratosphere although a substantial hike to New York  New York or downtown  Handy for the convention centre  Although the Las Vegas Hilton is easy to spot  the Grand Vacations are tucked behind one of the multi story car parks that serve both hotels  Major constructions are taking place close to the hotel although this did not disturb the my time here  from   pm to  am for a couple of nights  This is not a resort hotel  a requirement of company policy for some folk  and has been geared to a different  mainly business  market Rooms are standard business size with fridge  microwave  toaster  coffee facilities and enough pots pans cutlery for those that need to do a limited amount of self catering  My room was clean and well presented and afforded a nice view of the sunrise through the mountains  If you are coming from Eastern Time  you ll probably catch this  Hotel has a nice pool area  not too overwhelming  which looked in good order  They provide a free outside grill should you happen to have packed your sausages  The hotel has a deli shop for your immediate needs but does not have any restaurant facilities  Definately no free lunch  or free breakfast  here Very small business centre   one PC  minimum    charge  but free wi fi No queue at the desk and good sevice   my request for a quiet room away from elevators  ice machines and conctruction was met with minimum fuss I paid     per night through company travel web site No complaints and  providing the price was right  I would use again  
P =>   Sedate  Our standard room  no full kitchen or jacuzzi tub  was well decorated and in excellent condition  It included a small kitchen counter with a sink  microwave  mini fridge  and utensils  amp  plates  The entertainment center had doors to hide the TV  and included a nicely sized TV and a DVD player  The hotel was nice and quiet  and not crowded at all even compared with the fairly mellow Hilton next door  However  it was still pretty convenient to get places  because the monorail stop for the Hilton was just a short    minute  walk across the parking lot  The concierge was helpful for little things like getting airline boarding passes printed and letting us know where to store our luggage after check out  they have a bell desk in the lobby  The  quot deli quot  and convenience shop was grossly overpriced  not unlike the convenience shops inside other hotels I had a problem with the bill  which was that the rate I was charged did not match the rate quoted when I made my reservation and paid my deposit on the Hilton web site  The staff could not correct it at check out time  but I was able to get the error corrected over the phone afterwards simply by providing the confirmation number  
P =>  Excellent exchange  Excellent exchange  Great rooms we had two ajoining ones  Superb beds really comfy  Brilliant deli on site  Would definatley choose this one again  
P =>   Great for business travelers Great hotel for business travelers  Twelve minute walk from the conference center  Professional staff  Rooms are clean and full of conveniences  like refrigerator  toaster  sink  coffee pot   Get the      lunch special at Thai Red Pepper at      Paradise Rd     minute walk for a relaxing atmosphere and great food   Capriotti s further down the road has very good subs  
P =>   Great place  Stayed here overnight to see a show at the Hard Rock  We were very  very pleased with these accommodations  Room was very spacious and clean  Had a lovely bathroom and master suite along with a great big tub too  The kitchen  while we did not use it  was nice to have  The washer and dryer came in handy for washing our beer and cigarette smoked soaked jeans  gross   Property was very quiet and easy to get in and out of  We will definitely come back here  It is a great hotel for a family or a group of friends because the rooms are huge  Great price too         for a Saturday night   can t beat that  
P =>  perfect for business traveler Stayed here for   nights  The proximity to the Hilton and the convention center made it an ideal location  The only negative would be the bedding  If they upgraded the linens and provided better pillows it would make a big difference  Other than that  it was clean and quiet which is just what I was looking for  
P =>  Nice and comfortable ideally located We stayed at the HGVC for a week as part of an RCI exchnageThe Hotel is nice and quiet  We stayed on the Strip last year at the Mirage  and felt this year we wanted somewhere a little quieter  but close to the Strip  This place was perfect for that The rooms were of a very good size  we had a   bed appartment with a   bed studio attached  and were very tidy  if in need of a little updating  and very clean  The staff were very friendly and the deli on site was useful  The proximity to the Las Vegas Hilton and the mono rail was great also Nice pool area with waitress service mostly 
P =>  Great Family Stay     Thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Hilton Grand Vacations with my husband  sister and daughter  The kitchenette was very convenient for making something quick in the mornings for my daughter  Spent lots of time at the pool which was very nice and clean  provided towels  though they could have been bigger   The staff was very nice  the rooms were clean  Overall great stay  no complaints  Did not receive any calls regarding time shares as others had noted  
P =>  Great weekend stay   Just returned from a weekend stay at the HGVC Las Vegas  Checking in on Friday at   PM was a breeze  We were the only ones in line  The service was friendly and professional We had a   bedroom suite  The unit on the  th floor was clean and it was nicely decorated  It was only my wife and I along with our   year old son staying in the suite  My wife and son took the main bedroom and I took the  nd bedroom  Each had a king sized bed  The room was slightly dated  but it was nicely decorated and kept in good clean condition  I d rated it an   out of     The kitchen was nicely furnished  We ate out  but if you wanted to cook  all the pots and pans were there along with cooking utensils  There was a sponge and dish washing detergent along with plenty of towels to wash the dishes  The bed was excellent and the amenities were nice  There were plenty of towels  There is also a washer and dryer in the unit  They even provide you with detergent and fabric softener  There were plenty of storage space and lots of room to spread out  The pool area was great  It was mostly family and it wasn t too crowded  Most of the pool was   to   feet with the middle being   feet in depth  My   year old son had a blast  The   Jacuzzi were kind of small and I think it would only fit   or   people at a time  However when we were there  not too many people used the Jacuzzi  I didn t use the gym but it looked well equipped  Parking was convient  It shares the same parking structure as the Las Vegas Hilton  It is a     minute walk to the Las Vegas Hilton  The monorail is also about a     minute walk  We had a car  so we didn t use the monorail  Friday night we ate at the LV Hilton buffet  During check in they give you a     off coupon  It has all the beer and wine you can drink  for those that like to indulge  We checked out on Sunday morning and it was a breeze  Checked out at   AM and there was only one other person in line  Again  very friendly service  Overall  a very good experience  
P =>  OK stay close to the strip We just returned from our stay at the Hilton Grand Vacations Club and enjoyed our stay  This hotel is nice and close to the strip  We requested a smoking room and had a little studio with microwave  mini fridge and whirlpool tub  which was nice after a long day of walking the strip   The   bedroom suites are beautiful have a full kitchen  The pool was very enjoyable Some negatives The furnishings could use some updatingCleaning service came at very inconvenient times  our afternoon nap time  we went two days without cleaning service The timeshare calls to the room were a bit annoying 
P =>  A quiet escape from The Strip We just got back from a weekend at the HGVC at the LV Hilton  Room was great   it was a   bedroom  with a big living room  big bathroom with separate shower and jacuzzi tub  full kitchen  washer  amp  dryer    everything you could need  We got a good price by agreeing to sit through their timeshare presentation The pool was nice  the lobby  amp  common areas were roomy and well furnished too On the downside  this is a condominium complex  It s a five minute walk from the Hilton and the monorail  and a couple of minutes farther to get to the Sahara  It is off the strip  and it s quiet  The only restaurant is a  quot deli quot  off the lobby  and there s a bar at the pool  Most of the people seem to drive to this location  hence taxis have to be called  and they cook at least some of their meals in their condo  The monorail is a godo way to get around  tho   it worked great for us All in all  a good place  and a great place for those taking their children to Vegas  
P => Best Trip Of My Life We visited the Hilton two weekends ago  We had a two bedroom  two bathroom suite  The master bedroom had a jacuzzi  and it was wonderful  Our coach folded out and was very confortable for my sister to sleep on  We had a kitchen with a dishwasher and everything  and the other bedroom had a king size bed  a fold out couch  a full size bathroom  and a smaller kitchen  They had coffee for you to make and clean coffee cups  My husband and I slept in the big room  my sister slept on the fold out couch  and my dad and step mom slept in the other room  and we never had a problem with hot water  My husband  I  and my sister arrived late about      pm   but we called ahead and informed them that my father would be checking in earlier in the day  They had no problem with that and he got right into the room  The best thing about the Hilton is that you don t have to walk threw a casino to get to your room  There is no wating for an elevator or running to people on your way  You walk in the door and can go right up to your room  The casino is about a minute walk  One suggestion that I have is if you are wanting a taxi just allow yourself enough time to walk over to the casino to get one  You can call for one to be sent over  but they don t always come  We had no problem walking over to get one  It was beautiful weather and we enjoyed every minute of it  My little sister went down to the pool before getting ready for her wedding in our room and she loved it  It was a nice size and very clean  They had a little grociery store deli for you to get food and snacks at  If you went over to the casino you could charge drinks our dinner back to your room  and the taxi rides were not very expensive for where we went  we went all the way out to the Palms and Freemont St  We all had the time of our lives  and really enjoyed staying at the Hilton  
P =>  Hotel was just ok I booked last minute on their website and received an AAA rate for one night of        on a Saturday night stay  I arrived early and had no problems checking in early  pm  I rode the CLS shuttle to the HLVC for     round trip  The hotel is far from the strip but the monorail is just a short walk  My room was on the  th floor with a pool parking deck mountain view  I had a king size bed with a kitchenette  If I have one complaint about the room it would be the cleanliness  The trash under the sink was not emptied from the previous guest and there was a used condom in there  Also  the refrigerator door  on the outside looked like it could use a good scrubbing  The dishes found in the cabinet had dried food on the plates They have a nice sitting room near the lobby with a pool table The room has a safe  free of charge   I took the monorail down to the strip and had a ball  It was just an ok hotel in my opinion This was my first trip to Vegas   I stayed at the Harrah s my second night   I will post that review as well  
P =>  Great place with a small  but      The HGVC is a fine resort with excellent faclilties  and ideally located to share the facilities of the Hilton Hotel next door   including the monorail to travel The Strip  However  due to our travel agent s lack of knowledge  and our own inexperience     of us  Mum  Dad and   teenagers  were squeezed into a tiny studio apartment which left hardly any floor space It was bearable as we spent most of the time out of the room anyway being tourists  except for the    year old who couldn t tear herself away from the    TV channels some days   So we had a good time  You will too if you make sure to get room apartment suite which meets your needs  
P =>  Another great stay at the HGVC It s been awhile since we have stayed at this HGVC at the LV Hilton and there have been some nice upgrades to the property  There have been new bedspreads  and reupholstered furniture put in the suites  making them more colorful  It also has the new Hilton Suite Dreams bed by Serta  which is very nice  plus the new Crabtree  amp  Evelyn bath amenities and the new Hilton Clock radio  The rooms are spacious  clean and comfortable  Great location to travel about Vegas by car  If you travel here and expect to be in the center of the action you will be disappointed  for that you will need to stay at the HGVC at the Flamingo  But if you are in Vegas to relax  visit family or on business it is a very convenient location  
P => Very good stay  My wife and I stayed at HGVC at The Las Vegas Hilton from            It was a very pleasant stay  The property is new  We received a   bedroom unit     which didn t bothered us since it has a large living room with a sofa bed  one queen bed in a master room with a bath and a king bedroom  Our bedroom had a king size bed with a large tub with jacuzzi     Everything from the bedrooms to the kitchenette was in excelent condition  We really reccomend to stay here  However  keep in mind that this hotel is not on the strip and a rental car is very useful   regarding the staff  they were very kind and helpful  specially at their Deli where we tried their sandwiches  The only thing I didn t like was the check out time which I think is too early     am  for Vegas  We also got to see the other HGVC on the strip  which has a not so good location  It is next to the Circus Circus    
P => Excellent value for the money We ended up at the Hilton Grand vacations las vegas after the Hilton at Cancun was blown off the map by Wilma  We weren t sure what to expect as we had made the booking very quickly  We were given a wonderful room on the top floor with great view over Vegas  The bed was large and comforTable  The lounge was great and we had a kitchen and laundry facilities thrown in too  It was lovely to be able to wash our clothes ourselves  The bathroom was great with a double vanity and shower and there was a seperate spa hot tub in between the bedroom and the bathroom  We found the staff to be courteous and helpful  The in house store sells all the basics you need and their deli food was very nice though we ate on the strip most of the time  We would heartily recommend this hotel for someone wanting to stay just off the strip but a couple of minutes from the monorail  
P => what a great place      We stayed at the HiltonGrand vacation Club inLas Vegas on Karen St We were very pleased with everything The staff was friendly service was excellent and the hotel was clean and with nice ambiance It was a quiet retreat from all the hustle and bustle of the casino Truly a nice place to relax and be pampered I give this hotel two thumbs up I like to thank my sister in law for giving us this gift to stay at this nice resort Joy Rick and Mike of NJ 
P => Great place to stay  This is the  th year in a row that we have stayed at the HGVC to celebrate a family   st birthday party  I can t say enough about how great the accomodations are   we have always stayed in a studio condo  but several other family members have stayed in the two bedroom suites  We had a luxurious king size bed and a queen sleeper sofa for our two kids  The tiny utility kithen fit our needs perfectly for our weekend trip  The bathroom is also spacious with plenty of towels for     The staff is helpful and friendly  The deli is open at very convenient hours and has great food made to order and wonderful coffee and even vanilla lattes   The pool is good sized and a lot of fun and the cocktails at the outdoor bar are wonderful   The mango peach slushy thingee with alcohol in it is fantastic in the     degree heat   our kids loved playing pool in the lobby guest area  It s nice and quiet  very different from some of the Vegas area hotels  The two room suites are wonderful and have a big living room  dining room and full kitchen  Of cuorse  we did get a great rate      for three nights  with points  but let me tell you  it was well worth it  The close parking  privacy  cleanliness  hospitality and excellent service always makes this a memorable trip  Even if our kids are     now and really don t like sharing the queen couch    but it s a free room for them in Vegas  and they don t spend much time in the room at night   and they get to hang out with the family  Oh also the monorail is within a   minute walk  I highly recommend the    rides for     that can be shared among several people  Easy and cheap way to get downtown with no designated driver  Just remember they stop service at  AM  
P =>  Excellent accomodations My wife and I stayed here the week of e    on an RCI exchange  timeshare   The facilities are excellent and the staff was helpful and friendly  The location is just north of the Las Vegas Hilton and a coupon book was included  The monorail stops at the Hilton and the Sahara  both nearby  We opted for a rental car  based on the weekly cost  and more flexibility We had a two bedroom unit which was luxurious and spacious with a view to the west toward the Strip  That view has been obstucted by the Turnbury Condominiums  the fourth is now under contruction  We will definitely stay here again in the future  
P => Coulldn t have been better  I researched far and wide for a suite in Vegas  and we ended up selecting the HGVC Hilton Las Vegas  We rented a   bedroom suite for the   of us  my sister  niece and babysitter  and we were more than comfortable  Perfect location for families looking for a suite with kitchen  washer dryer and all the amenities needed in the room  The monorail was in test mode  so we were not able to take advantage of that  but will this year  Best of all  it was a little over      for the week    How can you beat that  As for the Hilton Rewards guys comments  he was obviously looking for handouts  which you will not find here  Highly recommend  
P => No place for a Hilton Honors Member I recently booked a room at the Hilton Grand Vacations Club at the Las Vegas Hilton  I am a Hilton Honors Diamond member and I used a honors rewards coupon for one night at the Hotel  My first problem with the hotel is that they are not found on any information at the airport  so it was very difficult to locate  as there are two hotels relatively close to each other   I ended up going to the wrong hotel and vallet parking my vehicle only to find out I had to pick up and go to another location  When I finally arrived at the other hotel  they had jumbled records of my reservation and they had absolutely no clue about Hilton Honors coupons  So I spent    minutes at the front desk while the night manager tried to contact the day manager to find out if this coupon was valid  After all of this I asked if I could borrow a cable for the internet connection and they told me it would be     insult to injury   Furthermore  the HGVC is supposed to offer a free Deli voucher for breakfast to Hilton Diamond members and this never happened and at that point I was afraid to ask with the turnaround time on answers  There was a box of chocolate truffles and two bottled waters on the desk when I finally made it to my room  It would have been a nice gesture except for the fact that the chocolates were addressed to another hotel guest  Did I eat them anyway  Yes  Do I feel like I was a valued Hilton Honors Member  Absolutely not  Will I ever  voluntarily  stay at a HGVC again  No way  The rooms are spacious and clean  The TV remotes didn t function properly  Definitely not worth the        points required to stay there  That is why the Hilton Grand Vacations Club at the Las Vegas Hilton is no place for a Hilton Honors member  
P =>  Great bang for the buck  We stayed at the HGVC in ember       We rented a two bedroom unit  which was a   bedroom unit w a door that opened into a studio suite for the second bedroom   We got the   bedroom unit for one week for       for the week through Ice Gallery w no trade in  Couldn t beat the price   I would never rent a suite from HGVC as it was very small and had only a partial kitchen  However  the   bedroom unit was very nice  Everything in there was new    new furniture  tile floors  linens  etc  The unit had a full kitchen and a washer  amp  dryer  too  Very nice    would definitely rent a   bedroom from there   We didn t spend a lot of time in the room but it was certainly nice to come back to in the evenings  The resort seemed very quiet when we were there    the community rooms had some older teens playing pool and that was about it  The pool spa was empty    probably just too darned cold outside   Staff was very friendly nice and other than the one voicemail message that they left on our phone re  attending a  presentation   we weren t bothered by them at all  The deli had some delicious items that we purchased last minute    it was pretty tasty  although expensive  but that was to be expected   All in all  it made for a very nice  base camp  while in Vegas  Very clean  nicely appointed room  and a very quiet place to come back to  I didn t miss the clanging of the slot machines at night at all    We would definitely recommend renting a car to make it really easy to get to the strip from HGVC   
P =>    Hilton Rocks       We stayed at the   Bedroon Suite at the HGVC at the Las Vegas Hilton from ember              The suite was absolutely immaculate  extremely spacious  well decorated and tastefully finished  It had a supersized California king bed in one room  I think Shaq could even fit in it   a very spacious master bath  and a relaxing jacuzzi tub  The other room had a full sized bed and a living room set  w  a pullout sofa if you need it   and a bar kitchenette  The second room can be a self contained  well decorated studio suite by itself  The main kitchen was well equipped and complete  except no coffee  the only minor drawback   Each room had a TV  and there was a big one in the main living room  Service at the front desk was great  smooth  and professional  We did not get hassled by any timeshare salespeople  It is best for those who have a car  but if there is none  it is a hop away to the monorail station at the Hilton Hotel next door  In all it would be very easy to recommend it to anyone  
P =>  You can do better for the money The hotel was OK  but for the money that you pay you can do better in Las Vegas  It relatively close to the Las Vegas Convention Center  so if you there for a convention it is OK  However  there are alot better hotels for the price  
P =>  Small yet Personable HGVC         First  I shall say thank you merci beaucoup  danke schonn  obrigado  and gracias to the entire staff at the Hilton Grand Vacation Club FOR MAKING MY WELL NEEDED VACATION A REAL VACATION  We  two    yrs old boys and my friend  arrived at the Hilton Grand Vacation Club two hours before check in  The receptionists was polite and professional and directed my three guests and myself to a clean comfortable and well air conditioned lounge area  The bell captain promptly took our bags to the holding area while we enjoyed drinks by the pool  Our rooms were ready within an hour  The adjoining queen bdrms rooms with a full kitchen lvrm  dining area and washer dryer were provided as requested from the initial search  Big cozy and new like furniture was throughout the suite  The bonus was the pool view from the  th floor The Hilton Grand Vacation Club at     Karen Avenue is away from the strip  approx    minutes by cab       The walk to the monorail is about   minutes costing       one way or       rtp  I suggest you pack a suitcase with favorite foods libations  snacks and soap powder  The little store in the hotel have variety but some things are expensive Spectacular sunsets  and beautiful views of the mountains  city lights  Stratosphere  Circus Circus  No slots available here but The Las Vegas Hilton is right next door   min walk   
P =>  A Very Good Value Just spent four nights in a one bedroom suite and we were really pleased with this place as it had everything we wanted  a good full size kitchen with settings and cookware for    a quiet environment overall  ie  no slots in the lobby   an excellent king size bed  jacuzzi soaking tub  en suite washer dryer etc  Really a complete apartment  Eating and everything else in Vegas has gotten much more expensive in recent years so if you have special dietary needs or want to save your bucks for the games then this can be a good value  The place was clean  service was good and it s a   minute walk from the main Hilton and all its activities including a monorail stop  We won t even consider another place on our next trip to crazy town  
P => comfortable Nice place  very clean and comfortable  Deli only and no room service  ent food at the deli sandwiches  salads  etc  Hotel was fairly quiet  which is good to us  Monday through Thursday and alot more noise by Friday  fourth of y weekend   Small pool but attractive landscaping  We used it  the pool  in the morning before       AM and were usually the only people actually in the pool  A couple people poolside smoking away which is unfortunate but Las Vegas is not for nonsmokers  There is a small health club room with a couple of treadmills and a universal type weight machine adequate not fabulous but at least it did not cost       per day to use it  There is also a small red path track that goes around the HGVC hotel  I would recommend renting a car until they get the monorail up and running as the hotel is off of the strip by several blocks and is on the northern end by the Stratosphere  The Las Vegas Hilton is about a quarter of a mile away and you walk through a parking lot garage to get there  I guess you can use the pool there but it was quite crowded and noisy we prefer a more peaceful atmosphere  Several restaurants and casino are available at this Las Vegas Hilton  By the way  don t confuse this with the Flamingo Hilton that is on the strip not too far from the Aladdin  There is another I guess brand new HGVC hotel on the strip that I heard was quite nice  At least four Hilton type establishments on or near the strip  Very confusing initially For those of you who like white noise they have a good fan system and it was pretty quiet in the rooms at night otherwise  
P => Nice  We stayed at the HGVC at the LV Hilton in il of      for a weekend  The suites are nice  and a great value  We paid around      per night for a   bedroom suite  compared to hotels on the strip where suites go for          per night   We generally stay in suites at   and   star hotels  so we re used to great service  superb rooms  etc  The staff was great  very friendly and more than eager to help  The big downer about this property is that is just not a convenient location  It is a        cab ride to everything    and its not the expense that s a bummer  but the hassle  You can t walk ANYWHERE from here  If you don t mind waiting around for the monorail  you re in luck  but we re a little more princessy than that      And although there s never a cab line  there s also never a cab waiting  You have to call for one  Also  the pool at the HGVC is tiny and unimaginative  You can use the pool at the LV Hilton  but we didn t go there  so I can t comment on it  Next time we ll book earlier and stay at the HGVC at the Flamingo Hilton  Great deal  lots of space  much better location  
P =>  Me Too I want to add my voice to those who really liked this place  At this hotel  you are away from all the noise and smoke  The pool is great  A resturant on site would have been nice and it was hard to make a left hand turn out of the parking lot  Overall  however  I would highly recommend staying here  This was my wife s favorite place we ve stayed in Las Vegas  
P =>  Wow Extraordinary  What more can I say  It had everything you could possibly want need or use  I stayed in the one bedroom suite  there isn t a need to talk about all the amenities  because every post before this one has done an excellent job already  I do want to add that our suite had a washer dryer in it which was cool  I guess our only disappointment was a resort this grand should have a shuttle to the strip  I have also stayed at the Bellagio The Orleans  Westgate Flamingo Bay Condo  but when I return to Vegas I ll stay again at H G V C  
P =>  Absolutely Fabulous   After staying in numerous places in Las Vegas  and various timeshares in the US and the Carribean  I have to say this is absolutely the best of all  Most definitely an incredible value   What an incredible view  just a block off the strip so it was your choice to be part of the hustle and bustle crowd or relax away from it  Quaint deli in the lobby  pool table  TV lounge  and very nice  clean pool area  All employees were friendly and made every effort to accomodate our requests  We had a   bedroom which consisted of a   bedroom unit with attached studio  would comfortably sleep    a nice kitchen and addt l kitchenette    tv s  washer dryer  great jacuzzi tub in master  beautifully decorated  Remember this a time share  and compare accordingly  While you may not have the gourmet room service  you gain a home away from home where you can be very comfortable and have anything you want nearby  
P =>  it is the best hotel in vegas this hotel was awsome  i stayed in the  bedroom suite  this thing had a spa bathtub  a sleeper sofa  quot in a living room quot   kitchen  quot i mean a real kitchen quot  and last but not least a master bedroom  i went when it first opened in nov       i got the suite for only        a night  you ll never see that agian but it is still low priced  if you just wanna have fun and come back and relax this is the place  it would really be worth it if you brought along     people  
P =>  Good Hotel Good Hotel with very nice rooms  The are spacious  and have large kitchens  which is a nice surprise  Not much in the way of dining  but we walked next door to the Las Vegas Hilton  so that worked  If you don t mind a couple minute walk then you are fine  No room service here though  Nice pool area  Very comfortable  
P =>  Great value at Hilton Grand Vacation Club on Karen Ave   
P =>  Great Condo Near the Convention Center  
P =>  Great Suite    Best Value I ve seen in LV yet  
P =>  Nice for the price   
P =>  Very Very nice quiet comfortable and big rooms   
P =>  Nicest Suite in LV  
P =>  vakantie Las Vegas  
P => 				  
P => 
P => Excellent value friendly staff great breakfast  Stayed one night  visiting relatives  Great and stylish room  Good to know you can pay less  and still have a stylish updated room to stay in  Stayed last year when the hotel just opened  was so impressed  stayed again this year  Great breakfast included  
P =>  Highly Recommended Stayed           The beds are a dream   the best of the   hotels of my trip out west  Overall a very clean and comfortable place with nice  up to date decor  When I had a little issue at the desk the manager came through with good customer service  The breakfast was very decent  cheese omelette  prepared in advance   bacon  hard cooked eggs  yogurt  muffins  juice  cereal  bagels  etc Regarding location  I didn t mind being off the strip  about a       minute drive on city streets  straight up Rainbow Blvd  then turn right   depending where you want to be on the strip       in fact I preferred being away from the hustle bustle  though I m not a big casino person  We flew into Vegas  rented a car  amp  came here from the airport for an overnight stay prior to departing for the national parks   we only visited the casinos briefly  
P =>  Outstanding Help in Our Hour of Need My wife and I were booked in for one night at the HI Express on the Beltway on arrival in Vegas  The flight was delayed by   hours and we finally arrived at     am  just as the sun was coming up  The hotel was esy to find despite being sleep deprived and the duty staff could not have been more helpful  giving us a late late checkout time of  pm  Breakfast was fresh and served with a smile   just what we needed after    hours without much sleep  The room was really clean  quiet  large and well appointed  with a hyper comfortable bed  Those   hours were the best sleep we had in   weeks in the US  We cannot praise the hotel enought for all they did for us   if only they had been running the airline  
P =>   Great Hotel Great Value  I consider myself a very picky traveler when it comes to choosing hotel accomodations  I stayed at this location for New Years      and it was clean and the staff was quite pleasant  The rooms were cleaned promptly and toiletries replaced as necessary  The free breakfast was a plus  Would most definitely stay again  Beats the Las Vegas strip prices tremendously  
P =>   Comfortable Beds  Holiday Inn Express always has comfortable beds everywhere I have stayed  The free breakfasts are always served with protein and not all just bread  But the comfort of the beds is the most important thing for me  
P =>   Loved the Rooms Breakfast and Nice Service One of the Best Hotels to Stay  Good Spacious Rooms  Newly built and Good View of the Strip from the Windows 
P =>   New Quiet Off the Strip by Nearby This is a fairly new HIE located away from the Strip  but close enough to drive to the Strip easily  And the price isn t bad for Vegas The room was pretty average     clean  everything fine except lighting which was only Fair  Same with the bathroom     all OK except for the Fair dim lighting  Since the place was fairly new  it was neat and clean  and security was good  Reception staff was Very Good     friendly and helpful We did have three negatives about this hotel  the AC was noisy  the WiFi reception was poor  and the lobby coffee in the early morning was old and cold  We look for coffee available and maintained in the lobby       especially since we re usually up and about at   AM   and most of the chain hotels are very good about this  we never use the in room coffee pot because we once saw a maid at another hotel rinsing the coffee pot out using a used wash cloth and hand towel  and it occurred to us that this is probably standard practice    Overall  using our own     rating scale  we give this hotel a      Good Average  
P =>   Perfect in every way We stayed at the Holiday Inn Express y    amp          It was wonderful  Upon arrival they gave us a box of chocolates as I am a Priority Club member  There was also always a bowl of fresh apples at the reception desk all the time  At night  they put out individually wrapped freshly baked cookies at the front desk  The room was immaculate  the hotel is quite new  The bed was extremely comfortable  They serve complimentary continental breakfast every morning in a beautiful dining area adjacent to the lobby  Breakfast includes some hot items like cheese omelets and French toast  There is a large Plasma TV in the breakfast room  There is a complimentary shuttle that will pick you up and take you back to the airport  The shuttle will also take you to the Strip and pick you up for free  We drove our car from Los Angeles  so we didn t use this service  The front desk staff couldn t have been more helpful and pleasant  There are two computers adjacent to the breakfast room with free internet access       If you have your own laptop    I don t    there is free interenet access in your room       We used Priority Club points         per night    to  quot pay quot  for the room  So for us all this was FREE It is about a   min drive to the Strip from the hotel  While the Strip is noisy and crowded  the Holiday Inn Express is quiet  serene and relaxing  They also have a small no frills outdoor pool and jacuzzi  and a small fitness room with a few state of the art machines With the money we saved on the hotel and breakfast each morning  we got tickets to see Bette Midler at Ceasars  She was fantastic   She got   standing ovations  had me laughing at her banter and crying when she sang her famous ballads   quot Wind Beneath My Wings  quot  and  quot The Rose  quot Also  there is a great Chinese restaurant called Grand China just up the road from the hotel  It is one of a chain in Vegas  The food is excellent and reasonably priced   We paid about     for lunch for two Also  because I am a Priority Club member  I called and asked for a complimentary upgrade  They upgraded us to an  quot Executive Suite quot  which had a separate sofa seating area  a microwave and small fridge  Also had in room coffe  which we didn t use because there was complimentary freshly brewed coffee available all day in the dining area Loved this place  Highly recommended  
P =>   Great Stay I had read on tripadvisor that this was a good place to stay in Las Vegas  and I wasn t disappointed  My top priority is that the place I stay is clean  and my room was very clean  My room was large and spacious with a desk and desk chair in addition to the usual motel furniture  The entire motel was non smoking which I really appreciated  I also chose this motel because I could park my own car  instead of valet parking   the refrigerator in the room  and free wireless Internet in my room  The price for the room was below what other places with such amenities would cost  The service from the front desk was excellent and there were no hidden fees  I just had to pay the agreed upon rate for the room and tax  I would certainly recommend this motel to others   I should say that I am a Priority Club member   
P =>  Nice place  Recommended  Very nice place to stay  Clean rooms  fairly new  We re picky and would definitely stay there again  Several restaurants within a block or two  
P =>  Very Impressive  We were pleasantly surprised at the upscale decore  The room was very nice  the bed comfortable  Even a rain showerhead  And just a skip from an exceptionally tasty restaurant with reasonable prices  Blackjack Lodge   We arrived totally exhausted from our long flight from Maui  so weren t interested in more than rest and relaxation  thus I can t comment on the convenience of the strip  but if you are looking for exceptional value  a friendly staff   and comfortable  attractive surroundings THIS IS THE PLACE The internet worked well  the FREE breakfast although  slightly  limited  was very tasty  and appreciated the shuttle to the airport  They even gave us a   hour late check out with no extra charge when we requested it because of our flight times  I have been treated with less consideration by much more expensive establishments  Will I stay here again  Absolutely  Will I recommend it to other travelers passing through  A resounding YES  We were very happy with the service and accomodations provided here  
P =>   Clean New and Four Miles To Strip Holiday Inn  Rainbow  amp  I      Las Vegas Booked a two night stay in an Executive Room  and was very pleased  Hotel is only a few months  quot new  quot  and is positively spotless Beautiful and dramatic design  colors  and textures abound  both in guest room and common areas  Room is somewhat similar in appearance to  quot The Hotel  quot  at Mandalay Bay  albeit on a lesser scale Although hotel offers limited shuttle service  you would be well advised to book this room in tandem with a rental car From McCarren Airport  take I     WEST to Rainbow Blvd  Hotel is just North of exit  While driving to the Strip  I found Russell Road  just   blocks north of hotel to be a quicker conduit  A   mile drive door to door brought me to Mandalay Bay  which is the Southern most Casino on the Strip proper   I actually passed by the other Holiday inn Express on Polaris Avenue   which appears to be appx    blocks to Strip This is a non gaming hotel  but there is a small Restaurant  Bar with limited gaming just a few feet from the lobby entrance Across the street is a sandwich shop  and a    hour convenience store  This is an area of new development  with only a handful of alternate dining options in the immediate vicinity of hotel  Computer kiosk off lobby  nice small pool and jacuzzi  suitable for a dip and not much more  Typical HI Express breakfast fare  muffins  cinnamon rolls  h b eggs  yogurt  cereal  toast  fruit  etc All in all  a very positive experience  
P =>   Good option I choose this hotel because the week i planned my vacations  there were some sort of convention and all the rooms in the strip were above          per room The rooms at the HI express southbelt are clean and spaciosus  there are a shuttle betwen hotel and Mandalay Bay at       am  without return  so it s necesary to rent a car  The duration of the trip betwen the hotel a to the bellagio took me    to    mins  in my rented car  There is a complementary breakfast with hardboiled eggs   yogourts  cinnamon rolls  etc  Just outside there is a good restaurant Black Jack  that opens    hrs  and serves breakfast  lunch and dinner  Good Option   Overall it was a good option due to the rates on the strip  
P => 
P =>   Nice clean hotel in the middle of a ghetto Stayed here over the weekend for another softball tournament  If you are here for gambling I see no reason why you would stay here since it s    miles to the strip and rooms can be found for     there  But we were here for the tournament and thankfully we found this  quot oasis quot  in the middle of what can only be described as a ghetto  The area is crawling with steetwalking  quot hookers quot  and other seedy looking people  Had to get gas twice and was approached by one guy who wanted money for gas and the second time a homeless guy was pushing his cart just feet from my wife and kids  The hotel itself is very nice new and clean with friendly staff  comfortable beds and really nice showerheads  There s a small  quot business center quot  where you can surf the net if needed  As I said  if you NEED to stay in this area  this is the place to stay  Otherwise  the area is not that safe  
P =>   Great surprise  Nice  clean  updated   but the AC failed while we were staying there  They got it up and running within a couple of hours though  The customer service was superb  Would definitely stay there again  Right around the corner from the racetrack yet still close to the strip  
P =>  Love my stay  nice  Excellent hotel  very clean and comfortable After staying   nights at circus circus in Las Vegas  Cirucs Circus was sooo BAD  all the bed sheets and linen was had clearly visible HOLES      However our stay here in Holiday in express for   night and we felt like we are in heaven  We slept so well on SO COMFORTABLE AND CLEAN BEDs This place was so clean and had a nice heated pool outdoors and nice indoor whirlpool  bigger than most other places I have stayed  Staff was friendly and courteous   prompt It is abt    miles from the strip  If you prefer quite  clean place away from strip I would stay here They have free breakfast   Cinnamon Buns  Bagels creamcheese  Fresh cut Fruits  Banna  Orange Hard boiled eggs  Oange and Apple juice  Waffles   cold storage  Nestle Hot chocolate and Oat meal packets  coffee tea and flovaoured Creamers  Irish cream  Hazelnut etc      This is truely an undiscovered GEM   I WILL NOT STAY IN STRIP instea will stay here and drive to strip  
P =>   Interesting and quiet hotel Nice room  clean  nice bathroom  quiet and friendly staff  Hotel  hallway and room had a funny smell in it    weird awful smell  Breakfast and coffee were very good  
P =>  Quite Pleased  The only thing we were concerned about were the warnings about parking outside  That said  it didn t seem like the type of area that would attract a lot of unwanted attention  The room was very nice  loved the shower  and I don t see how the make anything you d make at home breakfast could reasonably have been better  I d readily stay there again  
P =>   Nice enough but further away than you might expect  The hotel itself is fine    clean and comfortable  There is a pretty strong emphasis on security  so I assume it s safe  Signs in the parking lot warn you against leaving anything of value in your car  The breakfast is great  typical bagels  cereal and yougurt but it s free and plentiful  This is hardly an  oasis  though  unless you like being really  really far from the strip  Forget staying here if you have morning business at the convention center   traffic is murder  There is a very well equipped business center with Internet access and a computer with common software and a functioning printer  Probably a great place for a soccer team  There is a small but clean looking swimming pool  The only restaurant nearby is the McDonalds across the street  You could do worse for the money  the rate was pretty reasonable considering that everything else was booked  
P => 
P =>   Pretty ent This hotel has a surprisingly good view of the strip if you are on the right side of the hall  The room was pretty clean  the staff was pretty nice  and the hotel seemed to always be packed with cars at night  which I find comforting knowing that I m not the only one there  However  the security probably needs to be improved a little  About     times a day  there would be a pizza flier slid under my door  probably from some kid the pizza business hired to improve sales    And on the door  going in the side of the hotel  it clearly states  quot no soliciting quot      So either the hotel doesn t care that these people are just coming in and soliciting  or they are really oblivious to who are their guests and who are not     I would never buy pizza from a company that does this by the way They have a shuttle that goes to Mandalay Bay and MGM which is good  I did not use that service  since it only goes till   AM    Which is odd  since most people in Vegas stay out till way past then  I d assume  The bad part of the hotel is that there was NO fridge        I hate that  I mean  you re in a desert and they have no fridge    like wtf  I paid like     plus     or     or so for taxes each night    I think that s probably just about the right price  although it d be better if it was lower    It s a good place to stay at if you re in Vegas for more than a few days  because it gives you a chance to get away from the rustle and bustle and hustle of the casinos  
P =>  clean and new Found the hotel to be worth the      for   nights  ent free breakfast  shuttle service to the strip was excellent too  Rooms were clean and the facilties were fine  The pool area was also well maintained apart from the plunge pool being out of order  If your on a short trip to LV and looking for a clean affordable hotel then i would go for this place  No complaints what so ever  P s try the bar at the top of  quot the hotel quot  for a great view of the strip  The shuttle drops you off there  Fab  
P =>  Fantastic Service Having driven from the Grand Canyon where we stayed at the Holiday Inn Express  we were delighted with the service at this one which was so different from the nights before  No criticisms at all  Really good time and a fantastic selection of in room dining too which was great with small children  
P =>   Fabulous  A very clean hotel  with friendly staff  Free internet access was brilliant  and we were grateful of the shuttle  Breakfast typical  but plenty of choice and ample to eat  Swimming pool was brilliant  we were often the only ones in it  Room excellent  we had a room overlooking the airport  no notable noise from this  in fact we enjoyed sitting on the end of the bed watching the planes take off I m glad we didn t stay on the strip  it was nice to get away from the hussle and bustle  Would definitely stay here again  oh and the price was extremely reasonable  
P =>  Top Notch The hotel  service  and most of all everybody is smiling Just gets you feel welcome and comfortable  
P =>   Great Location Clean Reasonable Price An absolute pleasure  I m so glad I didn t stay on the strip  I ve heard and read horror stories   The staff was friendly and helpful  check in was quick   The room and bathroom was clean and appropriately sized for the price  I was on the  rd floor facing the strip  so the view was amazing I appreciated the free parking  free internet  and free breakfast  The place was easy to find and there was plenty of parking available right in front of the hotel  Not only did I have free internet in my room  but they had a free printer in the lobby  I ve had minor issues with HIE in other cities  but this one was great and I have zero complaints  
P =>   Excellent for the money I was very pleased with my stay at the Holiday Inn Express  The staff was pleasant and helpful  the rooms were relatively spotless and the continental breakfast was above average  The location off the strip was great  especially since it was only a    minute shuttle ride away  It was also convenient that they had an airport shuttle  I would positively recommend this hotel for your next Las Vegas visit  
P =>   Want to go Off Strip  This is the place to stay  We stayed at the Holiday Inn Express for   nights including Christmas Day  The location  whilst off the strip was merely a    minute free shuttle journey to the Mandalay Bay or MGM Grand Hotel on the strip  It is very conveniently located for the airport and Eagle Riders  if you are into hiring motorcycles  The staff was very helpful and friendly  the room was clean and reasonably spacious  The bathroom was well equipped with a decent hairdryer  the only minor thing was that the bath was very shallow not good for wallowing in Breakfast was a rolling program hot cold buffet  perfectly adequate without being excessive  carry out bags were available for early starts or mid morning snacks We were very impressed with the level of customer service  we were waiting for the shuttle one very cold evening at the MGM Grand when it became apparent that it was never going to appear  One quick phone call to the Hotel Receptionist and we were in a taxi that they paid for  including the tip   
P => Clean Comfortable and A  C too  After a bad experience at a striip hotel   no A C    we checked out of that hotel  and into the Holiday Inn   we visited out friends the next day at the Westin  and they still had no A C in the lobby  the restaurants  casino and lounge  We never noticed any airplane noise  but we always carry several pair of earplugs  anyway  We rested so well after the HOT room at the Westin   the Westin employees said that it had been hot for about three days prior to our arrival  also  We had a lovely stay at the Holiday Inn and would now consider staying there next time  
P =>   I would stay here again  We  i e    adults and   teenagers from UK  wanted to stay somewhere that wasn t totally focussed on gambling and we achieved it with this HI Express  Stayed here   nights  and really pleased we didn t stay on the Strip  It was really convenient though because a complimentary shuttle bus runs every   mins to the nearby Mandalay Bay  and hourly to the MGM Grand Hotel  delivering you to the heart of the action  But the noise of the Casinos can drain your energy if you re not into gambling or if you re with kids  so it is really great to stay off the Strip as I said  We had a   Queen bed suite with sofa bed  and the sofa bed was all rusted and the springs were broken  Room      We told reception and they sent up a roll away bed  but this was all broken too and actually held together by a polythene bag  Anyway  the next day the staff moved us to a room with a safe and functioning sofa bed  room     for info   and from then on we had no problems at all  The breakfast was standard HI Express fare  and coffee was available most of the day in the lobby  Laundry facilities  powder was provided for us   ice  vending for cokes  etc no problem Reception staff were fairly friendly  but everything and everyone in Vegas is larger than life  somewhat brash and loud to the point of enjoyable  Hotel pool smallish  but adequate  and a welcome cool off in the heat  It was always quiet round the pool  Overall  excellent value  and as other reviewers say  the money you save by booking here lets you spend on Cirque de Soleil  Grand Canyon etc   By the way  saw  quot O quot  and it was fantastic  saw Blue Man and it was good  If I visited Vegas again   which I won t  I would stay here  
P =>  Excellent Stay at HI Express What a wonderful gem in las vegas  Peaceful  easy to find  and a great staff  The hotel is situated right off of the end of the strip  about a   minute drive from Mandalay Bay  It is great because you are so close to the strip  but you dont have to walk for miles through a casino to find your room  The rooms were nice  standard holiday inn express rooms but always very clean and comfortable  The pool and hot tub were very nice  and the times I used the pool there were hardly any other people ever there  They had outdoor showers and private bathrooms right by the pool which was very convenient  The hotel sits near many main roadways  but I never heard a single noise from the roads  If you get a room facing the front of the hotel  you will also get a wonderful view of the strip  Quite a view at night time The hotel does offer complimentary shuttles to Mandalay bay but they only happen every hour and stop around   PM  There also is a free shuttle to the airport that departs every hour which was very convenient  Breakfast was standard HI express fare  and they always had delicious cookies out for guests during the day and evening  The staff was extremely helpful as well with directions and advice  The one girl even remembered my name and always said hello to us  Overall  a clean  comfortable stay without all the craziness of being on the strip  I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it to anyone  
P =>   Yet another positive Holiday Inn stay As always I am very pleased with the Holiday Inn Express chain   Met my expectations  Free breakfast  close to the strip  easy check in  nice clean bathroom and short walk to room    The staff was also very friendly   The only problem I had was with the hide a bed   the linens that they gave us were WET     When I called in to get more linens they brought back more WET linens  So i sent those back   On the  rd try I finally got some sheets that were dry to put on the sofa bed   The room was very comfy and quiet when we went to bed   I did not notice the walls being thin at all    we also had the air on most of the time    The holiday inn breakfast was great as always  altho the new omeletes kind of suck     I love their cinnamon rolls   The pool and hot tub were very nice as well and each time I went to them I was the only person    which I love      The gym however was lacking  They had a treadmill  eliptical and a stepper  And a SMALL dumbell tree with dumbells only up to   lbs    the holiday inns usually have a universal weight machine  but this one doesnt     This place is a must if you rent a car as you can escape all the craziness of the strip when its time for bed   
P =>   Great Alternative to the Strip We usually go to Las Vegas each year for a business convention and have discovered the great deals of a few years ago no longer exist so we decided not to stay on the strip and opted for the Holiday Inn Express South Las Vegas  It was a good choice  just far enough away from the frenzy that is Vegas  but close enough to get to shows restaurants etc  The hotel proivdes a shuttle service to the Mandalay Bay Hotel  where the convention was being held  every    minutes  and to the MGM Grand on the hour  so both my husband and I made good use of both these services  The MGM Grand was a better destination for me as it put me closer to the monorail or the bus service  whereas  getting off at the Manadalbay still meant a good    minute walk to the strip or to the monorail to the Excalibar Hotel The hotel itself is standared Holiday Inn  rooms are functional but somewhat impersonal  but the beds are FANTASTIC  most comfortable bed I think I have ever slept in and the pillows are great too  They offer an express breakfast which is ok  cereal  yoghurt  toast etc  all on throwaway plates but it is included in the room rate  I would definitely stay here again  just for the simple fact there is no casino to have to walk through to get anywhere in the hotel is a bonus for me  
P =>   Not bad overall but some problems I think this is the third time I ve stayed here in three years and it has been relatively consistent  though I think it is a bit overpriced for what you get these days The Good  hotel property and the rooms well maintained and clean  Friendly  helpful staff The Bad  Thin walls   you can clearly hear conversations and the TV from the next door rooms  The breakfast leaves a lot to be desired  I didn t touch the hot food since it looked very unappetizing and I didn t want to risk getting sick on the plane home  The cold food was all on the cheap end of the scale  Not the worst  free  hotel breakfast I ve had  but nothing better than middle of the road   I expected more for the room price  Though the surrounding area seems relatively safe  it is mostly light industry and  if you are not spending time on the strip  it is a bit of a drive to find a decent restaurant  The wireless internet connection was decently fast  but was out in the morning which prevented me from printing my boarding pass and completing some last minute flight preparations Overall  I give it an average rating  More care given toward breakfast would put this hotel into the above average category  
P =>  Great budget option We split our stay in Vegas moving off strip for the expensive holiday weekend  We were pleasantly surprised with the hotel and would definitely recommend it as a budget option  The staff were really friendly and helpful  We had the hotel pool and hot tub to ourselves most days and it was lovely and peaceful after the chaos of the strip  The hotel was clean and the other services   free internet and buffet breakfast were great  The hotel also ran a shuttle to the MGM once an hour and Mandalay Bay every half hour which was really handy  
P =>   Great place for Race fans My sister and i were in town for the Nascar  really  and chose the Holiday Inn for our   night stay largely due to the reasonable price  Having spent the first part of our stay at the MGM we were not bothered about being off strip as most of our time would be spent at the racetrack We checked in mid afternoon and although we did not have to wait in line  the phones rang non stop so it did take a while to get checked in  To complicate matters our stay was split over two bookings  however the check in agent did a great job to keep us in the same room for the duration of our stay  This was much appreciated and only required us to get our key cards reactivated next morning Our room was on a non smoking floor and was a good size with plenty of counter space and featured a TV and coffee maker  The beds were very comfortable and came with a selection of firm and soft pillows  The bathroom was also a good size with a hairdryer and had plenty of space for two girls worth of toiletries  The Holiday Inn s free breakfast did not disappoint and contained a varied selection of cereals  bagels  muffins  cinnamon rolls  yoghurts  eggs  bacon as well as juices and tea and coffee  It did seem to take a while for items to be replenished though when they ran out  There were staff around so i m not sure what the cause of the delay was As i mentioned this hotel is not located on the strip and is a good       minute walk to the Mandalay Bay Convention Centre on the strip  This is when the free shuttle comes in to its own  Running twice an hour to the Convention centre at the southern end of the strip and hourly to the MGM Grand this gives easy strip access for all  We found the shuttle drivers to be friendly and accommodating of everyones needs  especially the guy who dropped us right at the bus stop on the strip at  am on Sunday morning to catch the bus to the track    The complimentary return shuttle ride to the airport leaves one less thing to worry about The Holiday Inn also has an outdoor pool  guest laundry and the free internet access in the lobby enabled us to get checked in for our flight home on our last day Overall we enjoyed our stay and the Holiday Inn and the hotel more than served its purpose  I would primarily recommend this hotel for those on a budget and or those with their own transport  The shuttle is good  dont get me wrong  but for first timers nothing quite beats direct access from hotel to strip  
P =>  Great Hotel says   Aussies  My husband and I and another couple stayed here for   nights in a shared room with   queen size beds  The   of us were all of the same opinion great hotel  friendly staff  location was great away from the strip  no problem with catching shuttle  Shared a taxi back in the wee hours so cheap between   of us  I had some queries before booking this hotel and emailed them direct  They were very prompt at replying and information regarding buses  weather  restaurants etc  also helpful when we hadn t visited Vegas before  Staff very friendly and helpful during stay  Returning to Vegas in tember      with my husband      year old mother   sister and will certainly stay here again  
P =>   Good hotel Stayed here for   nights at the end of our vacation We stayed at the Bellagio for the first   nights but preferred our stay here A good breakfast without having to queue or pay extra for  No lengthy walk through a smoky casino  Comfy beds and pillows  helpful friendly staff Although we had a car we used the excellent shuttle services to Mandalay Bay and found the restaurants there very good cheaper than the Bellagio and no queues even at Thanksgiving  
P =>  Love this hotel We stayed in this hotel from   rd  to           It is a friendly  clean  cosy hotel for a family of three    adults and a   year old boy   The bed and blanket are very comfortable and clean  The room is spacious  The carpark is convenient  Their breakfast contains a varity of choice and most important yummy and free  The self laundry service is cheap and convenient  It is located on the  nd floor of the hotel  Staff there are friendly and helpful  Though it is off from the Strip  the service of their shuttle buses are frequent  We did not find any problem to find easy and free parking in the Strip area  therefore did not worry about the transportation from Strip  Actually  we enjoyed the quiet and residential feeling of the neighbourhood than Strip area  The gasoline station is near and it is convenient for us to go any scenic and shopping areas  like the Red Rock Canyon  Lake Mead  Hoover Dam  Blouder City  There is a cafe pub called Pizza    in Blouder City where the pizza and pasta are very delicious and yummy    Premium Outlet  etc etc  The only complaint is that the wall of the rooms are a bit thin and the sewage of the bathtub did not work very well in our room  however acceptable  I will definitely go back to this hotel if I go to Las Vegas next time  
P =>   Loved It    My Husband and I  stayed at this location for   week the first week of ember  We absoutley loved it here  It was our  th trip to Vegas in   years and we have stayed at the Excalibur and MGM Grand previously  However we were very happy with this hotel  It is locoated about half a mile from the strip  They do offer free shuttle at the top and bottom of every hour to and from Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand  They also offer a free shuttle to the airport for departure only  The hotel room was large and very clean  Two large queen beds  which were very very nice  The was a large dresser and a desk and sofa area  The room also had a coffee maker  microwave and mini fridge  The washroom was very clean and pretty big as well  We were on the third floor and asked for a  quot strip quot  view at check in and were upgraded for free to a room which faced the strip  It was pretty nice The hotel does offer free breakfast every day which included  waffles  cereal  oatmeal  toast  yogurt  etc  There is no restaurant in this hotel  but there is a gas station next door where you can purchase snacks  etc  and the prices are pretty cheap  overall we loved this hotel  It was very quiet  non gaming hotel  The staff was very friendly and always smiled and said hello  We would diffently stay here again  
P =>   More than meets expectations If you just want a nice  quiet  non casino place to stay in Vegas  then this place IS IT  We have stayed on other occasions at on strip  off strip and non gaming hotels and this one comes up tops  previous stays at the Golden Nugget  MGM Grand  Aladin  Courtyard  Candlewood Suites   Parking area was brightly lit The front desk staff was friendly and professional  Check in out was a breeze  The hotel lobby area was brightly lit  The room was large and functional  Both the room and bathroom were EXTREMELY clean  The bed and bedspreads were great  Very good mattress which was of medium hardness softness depending on how you look at it  A big plus is the HIE touch to offer   of each kind of pillow  both firm and soft   The front desk mentioned that they are planning to upgrade their    quot  TVs to flat panels soon so do feel free to check with them if that is something important to you  wasn t a big deal to me since the TV worked very well   A reviewer earlier mentioned aircraft noise at this hotel  We didn t experience this at all  I really doubt that we would have missed the aircraft noise if they were  quot booming quot  overhead  try Hilton LAX for that one    The free wireless is always great   
P =>   good hotel rude guests We stopped here for one night on our way out of Vegas  We had come from the MGM Signature so expected the HIE to be a low quality  Surprisingly  the hotel was very pleasant  with a large  clean and comfortable room  and typical HIE facilities  The guy at the front desk was polite and helpful  Unfortunately  the hotel was hosting a group of K   Police officiers who were on a training exercise  We got to see rather more of them than we would have liked as they were spending the afternoon next to the pool just like we were  They dominated the entire pool hot tub area and were thoroughly obnoxious   swearing  drinking whisky from brown paper bags  shouting  fighting  and spilling alcohol in the pool  It s amazing that police officers could behave so appallingly  Although not a direct reflection on the quality of the hotel  it s a shame the staff didn t tone down their behaviour  However  what would they have done   call the police  We d stay here again   but would check they weren t hosting any cops first  
P =>  Nice hotel Good quality hotel  Superior beds and good breakfast  Excellent choice for those wanting a casino free hotel  One small improvement would be the inclusion of an airport shuttle pick up given the pricing position of the rooms  
P =>   plane spotters dream We found this hotel to be far noisier than staying on the strip  we stayed one night prior to flight back home and so wanted a quiet night  Planes were taking off almost overhead every    seconds or so till late at night and from early in the morning  Apart from the plane noise the air conditioning unit was very noisy and the walls are very thin good points rooms clean and tidy pool ok and free breakfast buffet There is a useful shuttle bus every half hour to and from the Mandalay Bay Hotel but too far from the strip if you want the  quot vegas experience quot The hotel is in the middle of a developing business park close to the I   on the other side of the strip  as for value for money can t complain at     per night but if wanting to get the best out of your stay pay more and stay on the strip 
P =>   Great location Our family stayed at this Hotel not having been to Las Vegas previously  The Hotel is   minutes from Mandalay Bay and is reached via the free shuttle running every    minutes until midnight  A taxi fare is approximately   USD The staff at the Hotel were amongst the best I have ever experienced in both attitude and service  Particulary Brian and Brett on the front desk and the two regular drivers another Brian and Pierre The free breakfast was basic but sufficent and free tea and coffee all day  There are additional vending machines for drinks and snacks  Note there is no restaurant at the Hotel but you can easily order food in  The pool is not special but very nice and is often empty and feels like your own pool  plenty of clean towels provided On the strip if you need transport take the Deuce bus but if you are in a hurry you better just walk as it was so slow  Recommend you visit the half price ticket booths for shows saving a fortune  Sky diving was fantastic with Sin city and worth the money as is the Dolphin habitat at the Mirage Would definately recommend the Hotel and is close to the strip for the action but also far enough away for a rest  When we go back we will stay at this Hotel which is child friendly  
P =>   Excellent   This hotel proved to be the perfect stop over hotel for us in Vegas before we started our tour of Utah and Arizona  The rooms were spotlessly clean and extremely spacious  The beds and pillows  in particular  were very comfortable after our long haul flight from the UK  The breakfast was more than adequate with a good selection of cereals  bagels  pastries  etc  The staff were very helpful and friendly  We did not use the pool so I cannot comment  We would definately stay here again and I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good value hotel which is near too  but not located directly on the Strip  
P =>  Great Hotel Great Value The location is excellent  Internet is free  Don t expect to walk to anything as it isn t on the strip  But they do have a free shuttle to Mandalay Bay  The rooms were clean  The maids very nice  This hotel is a good value at any price around     Dollars  Negotiate  The pool was is nice and uncrowded   The breakfast is good  I will use this property again  
P =>  Nice Clean Hotel We arrived on y    for   nights  We found the hotel to be just what a hotel should be  Clean and comfortable  The staff were fantastic especially Brian  who supplied us with bottled water when the vending machine was empty and even baked cookies and supplied a cold glass of milk for our daughter one night  I have to say  that was above and beyond what we expected The rooms are spotless  as said in other reviews and I am really fussy  The walls are really thin though  I heard in detail  through the wall  from some guys in the next room  all about their  quot show quot  experience  I am glad that they didn t wake my daughter up  However  someone must have complained about the noise  as the staff were up quite promptly to sort out the problem The pool is quite and clean and there is a safe relaxed atmosphere there I see this as being a hotel for families with younger kids staying in Vegas and people on business  Our family would definitely stay again  but if my husband and I were in Vegas without our daughter  we would stay on the strip  The shuttle bus they put on there is great  but if we were there to gamble  I enjoy being able to easily walk back up to our room without the hassle of buses and taxies  We all definitely give this place a big thumbs up  
P =>   liked this hotel enjoyed our stay here although we had some difficulty finding it as there are   roads called polaris avenue and we cruised up and down the wrong one  once we found it we were very happy with it  Nice room  good size  clean  We had a car so were happy with the location  Nice breakfast  not too busy  good price for Las Vegas  would stay again 
P =>  Very overrated taxi rides will cost you a fortune  Stayed at the Mandalay Bay mdiweek until it got to expensive and booked this on Hotwire at         after seeing it had the  th best customer satisfaction rating  First off  the person checking us in insisted on putting my    year old daughter and I in a king size bed with me because  quot that was what Hotwire had us down for  She did not seem to understand that there was something quite wrong with that  After going over her head and having the great vibe of our vacation taken away  we managed to get two double beds  This hotel is fine for someone resting their weary head on a business trip  however it is not suitable for a vacation style hotel  The pool lacks any charm and the area is  quot devegetated quot   For a few more bucks I would strongly suggest booking a better hotel  This hotel is in the middle of nowhere and any savings on the room will be eaten alive by taxi rides  I have been to Vegas over     times and this place is truly near the bottom  They do have free wireless which is nice and a small size workout room  
P =>  Just one negative I have to agree with most of the reviews  A nice property and the staff was just great  Especially keeping in mind that this is Las Vegas  I enjoyed not being in a casino hotel for this trip  The only negative for us was that the walls are thin  Noticable sound from the next room  Guest there seemed to think that you have to yell into a cell phone  Sound problems from other rooms is not typical for HIX 
P =>  Fantastic hotel Stayed at this property for two nights during our month long road trip of California and Nevada and we were not disappointed  Charming friendly and very helpful front desk staff  all of them   Fabulous room  large  extremely clean and with lovely new fresh white bedding  you can buy this online after you leave   Perfectly adequate free breakfast We asked for a room overlooking the strip on a high floor  about   mile away  as suggested by a previous reviewer  These are to the front of the hotel and we were surprised as to how close the strip seemed  great pictures taken at night  but without the incessant noise and hustle and bustle  Be warned however  there is a building plot directly in front of the hotel and once built on will obliterate this view completely  Building works next door but no noise heard at all  All in all a wonderful experience and we would not hesitate to highly recommend this property and it s location  
P =>   Good value off strip haven  Stayed here at the end of il after flying in to Vegas from the UK  I wanted somewhere off strip so that the noise and madness was optional  and that s exactly what we got  I d echo all the positive comments below about comfort  cleanliness  value etc and there s not much more i can add on that front  we stayed here two nights  then did a driving tour of California  then back to Vegas for two nights on the Strip  so can compare both options  In summary  i d suggest this place is perfect for independent minded people who want to experience Vegas without the inconveniences of the big Strip hotels   lines for everything  hit and miss service  etc  Oh  and who don t mind at least one person not drinking at dinner so they can drive back  tho a cab is only     or so from the near end of the strip  and the HI do provide a shuttle bus option too I heard no airplane noise either  Really don t know what s going on with that  unless the flight path changes based on wind direction or something A few particular positives about this hotel  and i guess being off strip in general   no long traffic queue to get to the hotel  no long walk from the car park  and no lines to check in  We could have been in our rooms within    minutes of picking up the rental car   it s quiet   no drunken groups in the hallways at night  or shrieking cleaners in the hallways in the morning   breakfast included   and by UK standards  a large and thorough breakfast  yes you might want to go pig out at a buffet afterwards  but it s nice to have the option of at least a quick coffee   snack first if you want a slower start to the day   POOL  amp  hot tub were a big plus because there was never anyone in them  You ll never get any part of the pool to yourself in one of the big hotels  And  it was open until midnight if you fancied a dip before bed  which i love  Strip hotels tend to close their pools quite early  i guess to stop drunk people falling in them or something  i don t know Only negative we found   aircon was pretty much on or off  and a bit noisy  
P =>  A great hotel for the money  I searched long and hard for an affordable but clean hotel for our three night Vegas stay  Trip Advisor reviews were very helpful   Our room at the Holiday Inn Express was squeaky clean  All amenities were as described  The beds were quite comfy despite my bad back  Staff was friendly and helpful  We enjoyed the varied continental breakfast each AM and what a timesaver   no long lines at a casino breakfast buffet  Some reviews spoke of airport noise but the a c fan drowned out any plane noise  which was sparse to begin with  We had the spa and pool to ourselves each evening  Parking was close and convenient and no lines at the front desk for check in  Sure  it s not on the strip  but only a short drive takes you there  We did not use the free shuttle to the Mandalay   Quiet  clean  and just         per night  AARP price    who could ask for anything more  A good birthday trip  
P =>   Great place  We are currently guests at the Holiday Inn Express On Polaris in Las Vegas  After having thoroughly read all the reviews for this hotel  I decided it sounded like a good deal to me  We were able to book this room with       Priority Club points per night  We found the hotel very easy to get to from the car rental station at the airport  The whole hotel smells clean and fresh  and the beds here among the finest I have ever had at any hotel  Although the hotel is very airport handy  and others have written here complaining of airplane noise hindering their sleep  I can say that I never heard a plane fly over the entire   days we have been here  The Air conditioning units have a fan setting that allows you keep the fan running constantly   heat or air  and that must act as white noise to cover the noise from the airport very well  The AC is a window type unit  but it is controlled by a thermostat on the wall  Always a plus staying at any HI Express is free continental breakfast and free in room wireless hi speed internet  Breakfast is identical of course to any HI Express  I am in room      and the view from my room includes several hotels on the strip   from the backside  including the Bellagio   My view also includes the interstate  so don t think I am saying it s just like staying on the strip  We are in an  quot executive quot  room  which does have a small refrigerator and microwave and coffee maker  along with a sofa sleeper and coffee table  This the last night of my   night stay here  and I have slept like a baby the last two nights  The front desk staff has been very helpful in offering information about the hotel and the area  the shuttle to Mandalay Bay  and back routes to strip hotels during rush hour It s just been a great place to stay  and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable and clean place to stay in Vegas  i you don t mind being a little bit away from the strip  
P =>  Great   If you want to live at the end of a runway   We booked this hotel because of all the great reviews on here about it   What a mistake   The hotel is nice  furnishings  clean etc   however WE COULD NOT SLEEP  The airport is about   blocks from the end of the Mccarran Airfield and there are planes taking off literally every minute all day and all night  less frequet at night but we counted    between midnight and  am  Because it is so close to the airport there is so much noise from airplane engines  The pool is not a relaxing space because of the noise from planes constantly droning  If you want a relaxing hotel and the use of a pool avoid this hotel at all costs  true  it is great inside but the noise from plans ruins the whole place  
P =>  Good  but   Having stayed at Holiday Inn Express in Detroit and Solvang  California  I knew that the one in Las Vegas would be a pretty safe bet  But I must say I m a bit surprised that Tripadvisor members rate this as the    best hotel value in Vegas  The rooms are perfectly fine  and the staff is friendly and efficent  I agree with most of the positive comments about the hotel  but here s why I can t give this hotel more than three points    Some advisors say that the noise from the airport isn t that loud  All I can say is that that depends on in whitch direction the planes are taking off  If they take off over the hotel the noise is quite bothersome    The AC   at least in my room   was very loud    In a time when many budget hotels in Vegas offer    quot  flat screen TVs  HIE still has old school TV s  And the reseption on mine was pretty bad on several channels     The location  I desided to stay at this hotel because I wanted to stay off the Strip  But the area is dull  you can t walk to the strip  so you do need a car  Unless you want to spend money on taxis  or wait around for the shutle that runs to Mandaly Bay every half hour until midnight that is     The price is good  but not great  compared to other great off strip deals like The Orleans or South Point  However there is one thing the others can t beat HIE on   the beds  I m a regular visitor to Las Vegas and have stayed at more than    different hotels  Only at Paris have I been as comfortable in bed as I was here  And a room at Paris cost twice as much The Holiday Inn Express is a safe bet for an off strip hotel  But be aware that everything is not as perfect as some advisors seems to think  Have a nice trip to Vegas   and good luck  
P =>   A great value What a surprise  This is a well run  nicely equipped with upscale furnishings establishment  Honestly expected this to be quite basic  but excellent service combined with no casino and lovely interiors will bring me back next time I m in Las Vegas  
P =>   Excellent hotel Stayed at this hotel              Was very clean and in very good condition  newer hotel   Staff at front desk very helpful  The breakfast was very good  Easy to get to the strip as the free shuttle left every half hour to the Mandalay Bay  You can also catch the shuttle back to the hotel from the Mandalay Bay but make sure you wait for it on the lower valet level where the shuttle sign is  Safe area to do your morning run if you are a runner as it is located in a nice commercial area  Booked this hotel by reading all the previous reviews and was not disappointed  The reviews are right on  Pool is very good and hot tub very nice  See pics in this review  Very good value for the money  
P =>   Good value close to the strip I was attending a conference in Las Vegas  I could not get the group rate for the Mandalay Bay and their best public rate was more than double the rate for the Holiday Inn  The Mandalay does not include HIE free breakfast or the free internet access  there is wireless in the rooms and a PC and free printer in the lobby   I have stayed at several Holiday Inn Express hotels and the formula is pretty similar  but this one was by far the nicest  The beds and pillows  choice of hard or soft  had been upgraded and were a dream to sleep on  The rooms look almost new and bathroom  shower etc were in great condition  The holiday inn continent breakfast is typically a bit limited  but here they had a better choice with Yogurt and fresh fruit  There was a free shuttle every    mins to the Mandalay bay  which is just the other side of the freeway     mins  and it you have plenty of time you can take the free shuttle train from Mandalay to Excalaber then walk from Excalaber to the MGM and then catch the monorail into town     single      all day   The location is really the only downside of this hotel if you want to be able to walk out of your hotel onto the strip then this isn t the place for you  If you have car or take the shuttle described above then just look at how much you will save  None of my friends were impressed with their rooms  mostly at the Mandalay bay    at the price they paid they all complained about taking    mins to walk through the casino to get from their room to the car park and rooms which were tired and even dirty  The other great feature of the holiday inn is the pool spa  Even in  it was warm enough for swimming the in outdoor heated pool and the spa was great  
P =>   Secret off the Strip  I stayed   nights at Luxor then   nights here  A free stay as I transferred Amex points to Holidays Inn s Priority Club Rewards Points   I would have paid the going rate here  This hotel is less than   minutes from the strip  NO Valet as parking is right outside the doors  NO long walks to rooms  I was in room     directly across from the elevators and heard nothing  I had an executive suite with a mini fridge  coffee pot and microwave  Bathroom was nice        extended shower curtain and and a  quot rain drop quot  showerhead  Beds were like sleeping on clouds  Very  very comfortable  Duvets with   pillows  Bedding was top notch  You can request soft or firm pillows  FREE internet access in lobby  Free continental breakfast and a newspaper    minutes after we checked in our room  the front desk called to see if we needed anything and if the room was up to our liking   Nice classy touch    Thank you management   Having done the strip hotels numerous times         we will definetly be back  They also have a free shuttle to Mandalay Bay twice an hour         And on the  nd floor is a laundry room  Nice touch considering I hate the smell of smoke and it was nice to wash everything before packing to go home  It was a nice switch from walking through chimney smelling casinos  Front desk always smiling and ask if you need anything                 Can t say enough about my stay here          except it was great      
P =>  A good stay This is a newish hotel  and the d cor is clean and bright  The staff are all very courteous and helpful  We had never been to Las Vegas and didn t really want to stay on the strip  This hotel is a good alternative   it s just on the other side of the interstate  but there is a shuttle to the Mandalay Bay resort which runs on the half hour and works well  from Mandalay Bay you can catch the free tram to the Excalibur  walk across the road to MGM Grand and the monorail and head up the strip  You can walk to most spots from the monorail stations  The noise from adjoining rooms was noticeable  but not bad  When the iron in our room didn t work  a new one was provided within minutes  It s probably time that hotels like HIE stopped using disposal plates and cutlery for their breakfast though  it s wasteful and probably irresponsible in this era of environmental awareness  
P =>   This place is awesome  I can t believe I would say that about a Holiday Inn  but this is the first time I ve stayed in a HI Express  and I was very impressed  I ve travelled quite a lot in the past year  and this was the newest  cleanest and most comfortable room that I ve had  no questions  This hotel is still new  only about   years old  and is in very good condition  My husband and I stayed here over the Thanksgiving holiday  and even at such a busy time the pool was empty and the breakfast room always had seats available  This seems like a small thing to be grateful for  but majority of the times I stay at a hotel with free breakfast the room is so crowded that there is no place to eat  and I often skip it altogether  My extended family stayed at the Flamingo  and for the same nightly rate I got free internet and free breakfast without having to walk through a smoky casino  so I think I got the better deal  
P =>   An oasis just off the strip My recent experiences at this place match those of many of the others who have commented about this place  It is a nice  quiet hotel off of the hustle and bustle that is the Strip  My stay was from           The good   ent location  Off of the strip  so it s actually quiet and a welcome retreat off the Strip  Easy to get to from the airport  and easy to catch I        to access the other parts of the city Free shuttle to Mandalay Bay  Ran roughly     and     past the hour most of the time I was there  Operated from  am to   pm  so late night excursions are limited  Taxi s are a better option for late night  but for morning and afternoon excursions  the shuttle works well  Helpful  curtious staff  They went out of their way to make sure I was being served well  No real complaints hereThe not so great  Did wish the breakfast bar was a little more robust  It s an okay way to start out the day and probably will tide most people over til they can hit the buffets at the casinos  but I m a little picky   One pc in the lobby  Did wish they had another  since it was busy most of the time I tried to use it  If you have a notebook PC with a wireless card  or even if you don t have a wireless card  they encourage you to use that option by giving you access infomation   checkin  Will be considering that option next time I stay there I would stay there again  when I do make it back to Vegas  It s definitely a great place to stay  
P =>   After a lot of searching we made the right choice   Demographic  Middle aged  middle class husband and wife  looking for a good  value  for our accommodation dollars I have a lengthy review below because I like to read indepth reviews  For those of you who are here to skim  here s the money shot    Book a room there  now  So  we were going to Vegas for the first time  We are simple Midwestern folk who live a normal  middle class life  Live in a modest home  couple of kids  dog and cat  We wanted to stay in a clean  nice place where we would feel safe I searched  literally  for over    hours before settling on this property  The reason I didn t find it sooner was because for some unknown  unfair reason it was rated as a   star property  users rated it     stars   In reality it is at least a   star in my opinion  Details follow below Firstly  we booked through the hotels web site about a month and a half in advance  We paid     a night for a Mon Friday stay After finding out the hard way that Polaris Street is not continuous and we were on the wrong side of the break  a call to the hotel yielded the needed directions to rescue us Upon arrival we were greeted with a nice  clean  orderly looking outside of the hotel  So far so good  Going inside we were welcomed by a very nice gal who was courteous and helpful  I requested a strip view room  but she already had us in one facing the strip  Things were going well Up to the second floor and opening the door revealed a nice clean smelling room   All rooms are NON smoking   They have a      charge for anyone who defiles the room with smoke  Good for them  I apologize if you smoke  but we who don t are sickened by stale cigarette smoke smell  ugh The bathroom was spotless and the rest of the room didn t show any appreciable wear and tear beyond a cracked wall socket plate  Holiday Inn Express  HIE  makes a big deal about the bedding setup  We chose a King bed and it was comfortable  has   pillows    soft and   firm  and some fancy sheets and stuff  Who knows  I m a guy so not real important to me The towels were kick a    Very nice and fluffy One of the primary reasons I chose this property was the FREE in room high speed Internet Access  I am a computer geek  but frankly  my dad could have set it up  it was that easy  The access speed was adequate at    Kbs  There is also a complimentary computer and laser printer in the lobby if one does not carry a laptop A FREE breakfast bar is available from              If I remember correctly   Cinnamon rolls were very good  They also had a ton of other eats and drinks  Cereal  bagels  toast  fruit  hard boiled eggs  OJ  milk  coffee  etc We interacted with the staff a few times and each time was outstanding  One word of warning  the wake up call service they use was running   minutes or so behind and the first morning did not call at all  There is an alarm clock in the rooms so it is not that big of deal  but since I have been gushing I thought I would mention the one little flaw I found The location of the hotel is off strip somewhat  You  could  walk it  but it would be a jaunt for sure  We rented a car from Alamo  very good experience there also  and just drove over since there are     locations to park for free once you get there The first night we took the hotel sponsored shuttle  It is free  but be advised it only runs until        so for most people that will be way too early  The other issue is it only drops off at the Mandalay Bay which is severe south strip  It is a  long  long  way to the other end  The first night we walked until we were about to fall over  The next day we found we had made it just about     of the way up the strip  I forget to mention they also provide a free USA Today for those who want it So  to close  we were extremely happy with this hotel and would absolutely stay here again  It may be rated by Expedia as   stars  but it is much nicer than that  Since it is a small property  the service the staff provides is more like the Midwest service we are used to back home One last thought  if you go to Vegas you  have  to eat at the Rio s seafood buffet  OMG  all you can eat lobster  I was such a pig  but my God it was great   Hint  Get a fun book from Harrah s  It has a     per person coupon for the buffet  Which is     a head normally  and they will shuttle you from the Harrah to the Rio for free Also  if you find this review helpful or just want to ask me a question  feel free to contact me at  tomrakers programmer netCheers  
P =>  Clean Convenient and Very Nice  We only spent one night in Vegas before we headed to the Grand Canyon and northern Arizona  It was a great hotel at a fantastic price  We got a huge discount by paying in advance through their website  There was a wonderful free breakfast  hard boiled eggs  cereal  bagels  waffles  yogurt  juice  coffee  hot chocolate  etc  The rooms were very modern and very clean  The bed was extremely comfortable  It reminded me of the  quot Heavenly Beds quot  that are advertised at Westins  The shower was wonderful  The view was a nice panorama of the strip  It was convenient to the strip without all of the hassles of the strip  Overall  the best hotel I ve stayed in for a few years  
P =>   Perfect spot This was the first hotel that we stayed in on our   week driving trip around the west coast  The room was clean and was big enough for the   of us  The location was great  we drove to the strip self parked for free without any problems and explored  We left the strip of an evening and went shopping and had dinner off the strip  We left the hotel for one night to go to the Grand Canyon and left our things in the room without any problems  The breakfast was self service and was a great light healthy start to the day  I am so glad that we didn t stay on the strip but stayed here  The children got to see Vegas but were away from the strip at night  
P =>  We ll be back  I took a gamble on this location  and it was the best bet I made in Vegas  My husband had a   day seminar at the Mandalay Bay in early tember  and after seeing all the good reviews on this site  I decided to take a chance and stay here  saving     per night off the  quot special seminar rate quot  at the Mandalay  WHAT A GREAT CHOICE  The rooms are spotless and comfortable  relatively quiet  especially being this close to the airport   and the bathrooms are hospital clean  Free continental breakfast  free wireless internet  huge for us   super helpful front desk staff  and a free shuttle every    minutes to the Mandalay  Great pool and hot tub  and unlike some of the trendier places on the strip  no fighting for chairs  A huge bonus for us is that you don t have to wander around in a smoke filled casino for    minutes to get out of the building  or down to the pool  It is away from the action  yet close enough to be in the middle of it within    minutes  If you aren t in Vegas for the gambling  or want to get away from it when you are finished   you won t regret the Holiday Inn Express  
P =>  Great one night stay We stayed at the Holiday Inn Express for one night the first part of tember  Check in was very smooth and the desk staff was very professional  When we got back to our room following some time at a local casino  they d left a message making sure that everything was meeting our needs The room was wonderful  Very comfortable beds and pillows  I couldn t decide which I liked more    the bed or the shower  which was also great  The breakfast bar met our expectations  Several different kinds of muffins bagels frozen waffles pastries  along with fruit  coffee  juices and cereal  We would definitely stay here again  and will also be looking for other Holiday Inn Express hotels for our future travel plans  
P =>  Nice Hotel   Would stay again Spent a three day weekend at the Holiday Inn Express  Very clean rooms and pleasent staff  Very quiet and the bed pillows rocked  A C was perfect  Holiday Inn Express is becoming my favorite place to stay everywhere  The shuttle to the Mandalay Bay saved a    cab fare  From the Bay  you can take tram to the Excalibur and then take the Monorail from the MGM all the way to the Stratosphere  Very easy and you save some dough for cab fares  Ask the shuttle driver the day you have to go to the airport to see if they can take you  Most likely they will and its free  Only bad thing was that a vending machine at the hotel took my money  Certainly not a big deal in Vegas compared to what the slots took  
P =>  Perfect After spending   nights on the Strip  we needed a cheaper hotel to spend our last night before our flight home  Having read the reviews on Trip Advisor I went ahead and booked a room for my family     adults  amp    teenagers  Very spacious  modern  clean and well equiped room  Complimentary continental breakfast  internet access and shuttle to the strip  The staff were very friendly and helpful  offering local info   even though we were only there for one night  The kids loved the pool and hot tub   again this area was spotlessly clean and tidy   nice shower area and toilet facilities  The only drawback was construction in the area   much like the rest of Vegas at the moment     but this didn t cause us any problems  I would highly recommend this hotel   if you aren t bothered about staying on the Strip  having done so for the first   nights   it s not all it is cracked up to be    this hotel is perfect   the complementary shuttle service gets you to the strip   about   mins drive away  You can then hop on the deuce bus at    for the day   you can just hop on and off where and when ever you chose   This hotel was also    mins from the airport   but plane noise was not a problem  
P =>   Good location good front desk butpoor housekeeping  Let s start saying that this hotel  even if not directly on the strip  has an optimal location  If you can move with your own  or rented  car  the strip is   minutes far The swimming pool is good and not very busy The breakfast is almost the same you can find in any other holiday express hotel  Talking about bad things  we ve been very unlucky with housekeeping service  during our four days stay we found our room undone after     pm for three consecutive days  The last day  our room was still undone at     pm Said that  we found our rooms always very clean Overall  the front desk service is good  but housekeeping organization needs strong improvements  
P =>  Good alternative to strip Stayed here for one night in ust  Nice  clean room with new bed linens and showerhead  This is a good alternative to staying on the strip  Less expensive and easy to drive to any casino on strip  All the casinos have free self parking so you can leave your car and walk up and down the strip then drive back to hotel when done  Free wireless internet and continental breakfast are plusses  Only negative was loud group in hallway in middle of night  but it is Las Vegas so I guess you have to expect that    minute drive to airport  They have a shuttle to Mandalay Bay but we had car so did not use that  No restaurants within walking distance at least none that I could see   
P =>  Great family holiday We stayed here for four nights on a trip to the USA  we are used to staying in five star accommodation and only stayed here after such great reccommendations on Trip Finder and we were not disappointed  The hotel is clean  quiet and comfortable and our family room comfortably accomidated our family of six  The staff were friendly and helpful and staying off strip was a great decision  We had a ball in Las Vegas and will stay here again in a heartbeat  
P => Always Very Nice We love this hotel  It is always extremely clean and fairly quiet  if you can deal with the sound of airplanes nearby  which is blocked pretty well when the air conditioner runs   The bathroom is large  with a massive granite counter inside and a hot shower with excellent pressure  The breakfast selection is great and convenient  as in the computer in the lobby with internet access  The shuttle is hit or miss and they re working on that problem by having it now only drop off and pick up at the Mandalay Bay  They also have brand new linens with a top sheet covered down comforter and a choice of either soft or firm pillows on every bed  We ll stay again  
P => Nice place Should you listen to me  I m someone who usually stays in a modest hotel   Hampton  Fairfield  Holiday Inn  Will do a Ramada or Hilton on occasion  A Lodge or resort spa is a treat for me  Mostly I want a CLEAN ROOM and I prefer a new hotel or a recently renovated one I didn t get to use this hotel like most might  Checked in at  pm and was gone by  am  Room was immaculant  Very clean  nicely decorated  Bed was a bit soft but they had option of pillows  firm and soft  and the bedding was first rate The staff was friendly and very capable  The provided great directions to eat dinner   something simple   Chillii s  The drive to the airport was very simple  about   turns and there you are The only negative thing I can say about it was that it doesn t have an airport shuttle  I wanted that and mistakenly thought they did   but that is my fault  Otherwise  very clean  nice lobby  quick elevators  helpful staff  no problems I d stay again  
P => Very clean My husband and I were on our way from Florida to the Grand Canyon via Las Vegas  We really just needed a room for the night before starting our drive to the Grand Canyon  I chose the Holiday Inn Express on Polaris because I had never been to Las Vegas before and I wasn t sure about staying right on the strip  Las Vegas honestly isn t really my idea of a vacation destination  Holiday Inn Express was very clean  Our room was nice and comfortable  Breakfast the next morning had all the basic necessities and was great  They kept the area well stocked and clean  The hotel is very close to the strip  which  yes we did go to for a few hours  It is a very easy drive  I think we only made two quick  easy turns to get there  I would definitely recommend this hotel  
P =>  Very nice hotel We were very pleased with our one night stay at this hotel  It s off the strip  just west of I     but within   minutes drive of the MGM  Mandalay Bay  etc  Price was much cheaper than the strip hotels and it included an excellent breakfast with everything you need to start the day off on the right foot  It was really nice not having to walk a mile to get to your room like you do with most of the big strip hotels The hotel offered shuttles to the strip  though we didn t use this service so I can t comment The only negative experience we had at this hotel was the construction going on next door on the freeway side of the hotel  They even worked on weekends which surprised us  But it wasn t that loud  just the occasional back up sounds from the tractors and cranes  A room on the western side of the hotel might alleviate this concern if absolute peace and quiet is required  Otherwise  it really wasn t that big a deal for us  
P =>  Great off strip hotel I agree with just about everything the last couple of reviewers have written  This is a great choice for your budget  especially on a weekend  The room was very clean and comfortable  and the staff was very friendly and helpful  Wireless internet connection in the room worked perfectly  and there is a computer in the lobby with a printer  I arrived at   am on a Saturday and was able to check in early with no trouble  The breakfast bar is great and they have lots of seating  including a sofa in front of a fireplace The one small complaint is about the free shuttle that goes to the Bellagio and Mandalay Bay  It s very popular and has to deal with traffic  so it s rarely on time and is sometimes full when it does come  Still no seating outdoors for waiting outside  but you can wait in the lobby and the driver will come in and announce that the shuttle is there  If you re not in a hurry  the shuttle is a nice convenience If you don t want to wait  the front desk is great about calling a cab for you  and we paid    to get to the strip  The cab to the airport was      Plan on the expense of a cab to and from the airport if you aren t driving  because none of the airport shuttles come to this hotel The value  quality and service this hotel provides more than make up for the transportation issues  I d definitely stay here again  
P =>  just the place at half the cost my husband and I stayed here in january      we had a great stay here  the hotel was very clean and the staff could not have been more helpful  however the only blot on the copy book was that the courtesy shuttle was nt very good at arriving on time anything from       mins late also they could have done with a seat seating outside for guests that were waiting  but despite this it was well worth its money and we would happily stay there again next time  
P =>  Great Value  Super clean rooms and tasty breakfast I picked this hotel after I read the raving reviews and wasn t exactly sure why a Holiday Inn Express was much to rave about except for the price  With exception to the distance to the block  which you would either drive or take a shuttle   this hotel is one of the best value in Las Vegas  The rooms look clean and new  and the breakfast offered large selection and was included in the hotel room price  This is a great hotel at a budget price  much better than some of the hotels on the strip  The parking is free  so this hotel is more enjoyable if you had a car to drive to the strip  
P => nice clean hotel  
P =>  Perfect for quick access  without immersion  to the Strip  
P =>  Isolated  
P =>  Great Hotel  
P => New friendly and well kept  Buffet breakfast is great   
P =>  Brand New Hotel   Just a little from the strip  
P => Genial  
P =>   tolle Adresse sich nach einem erlebnisreichen Tag auszuruhen  
P => 
P =>  quiet a bit off the Strip which makes it perfect enjoyable stay  nice restaurants  steak house  italian  right next door 
P =>   Good West Suiburbs Business Option   If Cleaned Up In the west suburbs  the location was perfect for my business meetings at that end of town  Nice to be away from the hussle bussle of the strip and feel like I was in normal suburbia   shopping   Do not consider staying here if you want to go to the strip     too far via too much traffic    lots of other options closer to the strip if you want a non casino hotel motel   Spacious room   mine larger than many   and on the top floor  the ceilings slope to    or     high at one end  adding to the feeling of spaciousness  Bed and bedding were really comfortable   slept like a log  Hallways never seemed to get vacuumed in the week I was there   little bits of stuff everywhere and carpets just looked like they needed a shampoo  My room was tidied nicely daily  but my white gym socks were black on the bottom after walking in the room stocking footed  Yuck  Internet worked well   high speed wireless G  Limited cable selection  Heard every sound coming from the adjacent room via the connecting door   even though both doors were closed and locked  Pretty basic continental breakfast  Have been at other HIExpresses that have some hot items   like toaster waffles  scrambled eggs and saussage or bacon  Pure continental here   carbos and liquids plus yoghurt  I can t eat dairy  and hardboiled eggs  pre shelled     like how fresh are these    Small  but useful gym  with bottled water  and small but OK indoor pool  but didn t use the spa since it didn t feel hot enough to bother  Grocery store and a couple of restaurants in walking distance  Better restaurants  Iincluding a Roy s  and Whole Foods ket about a mile away on Charleston  Movie theaters about a mile away  At      night  it was a good deal  but I m going to try the La Quinta   mile further west next time to see if its cleaner and has a better breakfast  
P =>  Nice Way Off Strip Property Holiday Inn Express   The Lakes   Las Vegas  Sahara Avenue just West of Durango  If you re in town to see the Strip  this is not at all close  If you re in town to visit family or friends  it s perfect in many ways  Clean rooms and public areas  Adequate breakfast buffet  Very nice indoor heated pool  amp  jacuzzi  I live in Las Vegas and escaped here one evening while my wife was hosting a  quot Girls night out quot  baby shower in our home  The rates on the Strip and downtown were cost prohibitive that evening  so I opted for the tried and true Holiday Inn Express chain  Easy access to the bus on Sahara Avenue  which can take you directly to the Strip  and deposit you adjacent to the Sahara Hotel on Las Vegas Boulevard  I would say it s a         minute ride Nice Restaurants nearby the hotel  walk across the street to Teddy s Greek Bistro for a great time including music  dancing and plate tossing OPA  Free parking and all that  Nice and clean and a great choice  
P =>  Excellent Value Clean Room The highlights of my stay were the cleanliness of the room and the free continental breakfast  I was very pleased with the condition of the room   very clean and fresh  at other     star hotels the decor  linens  and facilities can be dated or need refurbishing   There was a mini fridge  wet bar  and coffee maker in the room  The continental breakfast offered an excellent variety of coffee  juices  pastries  cereals  fruits  and eggs  The hotel also allows small pets and laundry facilities that are open      which is very convenient for families  I paid about      a night  Memorial weekend  and I definitely got more than I bargained for  On the Strip  I would have paid at least double  plus dealt with parking  crowds and lines  
P => 
P =>  You get what you pay for       This hotel was cheap  and on the Strip  northern Strip  right across from the Stratosphere        but boy  was it seedy  It had a    hour pool  but you couldn t have paid me to go in  I killed two roaches during a two day stay  If you re looking for a place that s on the strip and CHEAP  this place is it    and it does have free parking    but it s a pit  no two ways about it  My boyfriend wasn t as offended by the roaches and general seedy atmosphere  so perhaps if you re a group of guys going to Vegas and you re looking for nothing more than a cheap bed and shower so you can blow money at the tables  this might be your place  I do NOT recommend it for a romantic vacation  I felt a bit like a  quot working girl quot  after a couple nights in this place  
P =>   Das Motel etwas  lter jedoch sehr sauber und g nstig   
P => 
P =>   it s worth the value  The only thing is the room  especially the rug  wasn t clean enough for us who has a crawling baby  The room was cozy and fairly close to the Strip  Actually  it s very close by private car  but two bus shift is necessary by public transportation  
P =>   Great place to stay if looking for low price cleanliness and friendly staff i stayed at Homestead for second time in two months  due to relative in hospital  then in therapy facility   it was much more reasonable than Strip hotels  had complete kitchen so that I did not have to eat out every meal  It is quiet and clean and i have always been made to feel welcome  The maids do not come every single day  as it IS an exended stay hotel  but how many times do you change your sheets in a week  IF one would want to hit the casinos or see shows  they are mere minutes away  There is a Denny s next door and that is very handy  as well I am going back in two weeks and will stay there again  as it is perfect for someone one in Vegas for business or personal reasons  
P =>   They were Great     I had to stay at this hotel for a surrogacy we transferred next door with Sher Inst  this hotel was awesome and the people there were so sweet  I highly recommend this hotel  I will be there again and praying for same luck as we had before  When the couple I am working with asked about a Hotel I told them about this one and how great they were  They booked rooms with NO issue what so ever  
P =>   In Vegas  This is good for the money  With weekend prices on the strip of      per night or more  the Homestead Studios Suites hotel is a blessing  I stayed here last weekend for a price of only     plus tax  It is my second stay at this hotel  It s location is about five blocks from the strip in an area where there is a hospital across the street and the UNLV two blocks away  Mainly business around with a smaller of amount of residences  It is an extended stay hotel for business travelers  contractors  agents  etc  Therefore there is no luxury  fancy suites  puffy drapes or concierge downstairs to wait on your every wish  It is a simple  clean  studio hotel with a kitchen and a bathroom  A rental car or taxi is required to get to the strip  The travel area between the hotel and the strip is not something I d want to walk through at night  but perfectly cool in a car  On convention weekends this hotel can jump up pretty high  around      per day   but for regular weekends it is bargain  I do higly recommend it and will stay there again on my next visitThank you GT 
P =>  Homestead I stay in this hotel frequently for business and the management always is friendly  The location is convenient as it is near a mall and many restaurants  
P => 
P => Good choice off the strip Stayed in a two bedroom suit with four adults total  Each room had its own bathroom  There were nice     flat screen TV S in each bedroom and one in the living room  Room were clean and looked nice and modern  Hotel staff was helpful and friendly  The free continental breakfast was good  Hotels location was good if you have a car  It is only about a Mile to the strip and there are a lot of choices for dinning and shopping within a mile of the hotel  Would highly recommend staying at this hotel  
P =>   Near the airport but not near the strip If you want to be near the airport  this hotel works great  If you want to be near the strip and don t have a car  you ll be disappointed  For me  being near the airport was important  though as mentioned by someone else  Hidden Well Road is hidden well  Thank goodness for GPS  Once you know where it is  it s easy to get to and from  As with all Homewood Suites  the breakfast is good  
P =>   This is the spot ober in Las Vegas was great   although the sun was still a bit strong  the temperature was perfect  We participated in an outdoor sporting event but we didn t combust in to ashes like we almost did in ust  don t ask what we were thinking   When we checked in  there were two people working at the lobby hence processing two sets of guests at a time  I wasn t worried too much about the security issue since I was with two Chippendale types  ok  not exactly  but the staff who processed us  Brady  I think and I believe he is the manager  was alert cautious discreet enough not to read out and announce our room number when he gave us the room key there   I was very happy with the hotel from the get go because of that  It turned out Brady is a hardworking  and or overworking  guy   he was there when we checked in  during our stay  and when we checked out  I hope he is getting paid well  He was doing a great job  We booked a non smoking    bedrooms   baths suite for   adults and   children  In our room         bedrooms were joined by a small kitchen dining living room  There is a full size refrigerator in the kitchen that we packed it with snacks and drinks  The room was also equipped with a coffee maker  a microwave oven and even a toaster  stove and dishwasher  This hotel is not a smoke free hotel but we weren t bothered by any smoke smell at all  The room windows were at the freeway side and the traffic noise was a bit loud for me  but it was no issue for the rest of the group  The airport noise didn t bother us at all  The complimentary breakfast was great  it accommodated light to heavy eaters like fruit to burritos  The kitchen staff was efficient and they kept the food well stocked and countertops and tables clean  The swimming pool was heated and the children were very happy dipping in the early nippy morning  This hotel suited and satisfied our trip needs  price  amenity and location  If your Las Vegas stay is mainly non gaming  this is the spot  
P =>  Luxury at an affordable price The property was spotless and comfortable  The staff was friendly and helpful  The hotel was at the airport on Hidden Well Road  We got a laugh out of that because we had a time finding it at first  but it was near Walmart and other stores where basic necessities could be purchased  This hotel is the next best thing to home  
P =>  Great Value  This is a great airport hotel  It offer great value along with a super efficient free shuttle bus service to and from the airport along with Mandalay Bay  Our room was spacious and clean  The free breakfast in the morning was a pleasant suprise  There were eggs  bacon  waffles  cereal  fruit   amp  toast  not your usual continental breakfast affair  The staff was very friendly and helpful  I would recommend this airport hotel to anyone  
P =>   Fantastic Hotel Brand new hotel  off the strip but not so far  a plus that they have a shuttle that takes and picks you up from THE MANDALAY BAY  The room decor was really trendy and clean  and the bed was to die for  The kitchen was impressive for a room and had all that one needs Quiet and spacious room  A yummy breakfast in the morning with good variety  However u have to wake up sorta early to get the best of the layout  Regular pool but very clean  and even though it is   min from the airport I slept like a babe and could not hear anything  Will be booking again whenever I go to Vegas again hands down    
P =>   Poor service bad iron burned blouse and empty promises During a four night stay at Homewood Suites Las Vegas  my room was not cleaned    despite me asking on the third morning to have a thorough cleaning  There were crumbs on the floor  crumbs in the carpet  the toilet seat had the same spot on it for three days  the trash was not emptied  the shower had the same marks on them  I can understand not changing the sheets every day    but not cleaning the bathroom  when clearly in need  is ridiculous  Especially  when I went to the front desk on the third morning  asking why the room wasn t clean  I was told they only do a thorough cleaning on check out or if requested  I requested it    still not done  Then  the iron had something burned on it  and it burned a hole in my blouse that went to my favorite suit  The manager assured me herself that I would be reimbursed for the blouse  provided I send a receipt  I sent the receipt    six weeks later  still not reimsbursement for my blouse  For a     blouse  they officially lost a customer  Exactly what is the value that is placed on keeping clients  I guess it s less than        my worth is offically     or less in their eyes  I used to be their biggest fan  staying at Homewood Suites wherever I could    riott here I come  If you weren t going to reimburse me for my blouse  don t lie about it  Several calls and conversations later with Jennifer  the manager  with excuses of the check s in the mail  the check must ve gotten lost  and I have to stop payment on the first check    is all lies  
P =>   I ve Been Spoiled   OK   I loved this place     Here is my review   Short and Sweet   I was traveling alone   leary of many things    I looked and looked and found this hotel online and after reading the reviews I thought I d sleep on it and decide in the morning     Well    I m glad I did  This place had the most spotlessly clean and fresh smelling new rooms you could imagine   The bathroom was just like home   it was designed beautifully  The shower had a shower massage head that felt like a dream     FULL FORCED WATER     no little drips that you had to run under to catch and get aggravated with and when all was said and done it felt like you needed a shower      It was a pleasure to fall sleep on a new beautiful clean king size bed    just like home    No smoke smell anywhere   Not a drop of noise in the place   any where   Full kitchen   Coffee  or tea  in the morning without having to get dressed and go out    OMG  Fantastic   Secure building with a very friendly and helpfull staff     Just one phone call to the front desk and you have the shuttle to take you to the strip    there s so much more     I would recomend this hotel to ANYONE who appreciates a home away from home    
P =>   Great Value If you are traveling by car to Las Vegas  this hotel can not be beat  It is just south of the Airport  no noise though  and near to a Whole Food ket  The main problem with the Strip hotels is that there is always traffic jams  no matter the time of day and hotel parking is a fair distance from your room  usually meaning a trip via the casino to get to the guest elevators  At Homewood Suites  no traffic jams and parking is simple  right outside the door  The one bedroom suite has a kitchenette and living area  The breakfast is the usual fair  during the week they do provide evening meals  but we did not sample them  All in all  if you have transport  this hotel provides all that you need at a very reasonable cost  
P =>   Fabulous comfort and value  We stayed one night here in the middle of our trip and were pleasantly surprised  The suites were large  the furnishings excellent and the beds the most comfortable of our entire trip  OK  you don t get the service of the top hotels but for the price it s hard to beat  The complimentary breakfast was great  and they offer a shuttle service to the strip  which makes up for the location  Highly recommended  
P =>  Wonderful new hotel This is a new hotel near the airport  The noise from the planes is almost non existant and never did keep us awake or wake us up in the morning  The beds are super comfy  The shower is very nice  The bathroom amenities are  st rate   Didn t use the kitchen at all but every thing was there if needed  Big LCD flat screen TV  Ok sofa and chair  Free breakfast was this side of yucky and the coffee provided in the room wasn t much better  I saw many families with small kids eating like it was their final meal  so be forwarned  The breakfast room is very small and you have to walk through it to get out of the hotel if you re in the back building  If you re going there to  chow down  you ll be disappointed but if you want a good nights sleep you ll be in the right place  Close to the airport with a free shuttle  Great location if you need to catch an early flight or arrive very late at night  We arrived at  am and had no trouble checking in  Front desk is very helpful and friendly  
P =>   fantastic It is a great place for business trip and family  The internet is free  The complimentary breakfast is the best I had  The also provide free shuttle bus to the airport  This hotel is brand new  The bed is a real king size one  The prize is very reasonable  We all like it  
P =>   Home Home on the plain Homewood Suites by Hilton  Las Vegas  Hidden Wells Rd   To do Vegas right on a budget   what  you don t have       to drop on slots  me neither   I always get a car and do the casino crawl during the day  retreat to a quiet suite here for a swim  food and rest  then back out at night  In three days you will be broke and exhausted  Mission Accomplished  Homewood Suites near the airport is an excellent choice for smart travelers who want to avoid the noisy drunks at the casino resorts  I got a studio suite          with full kitchen for     by calling direct  You can avoid the crowds  avoid the smoke  cigar smells  avoid the hideous cologne soaked hillbillies and avoid the late night hallway shenanigans that keep you awake in casino rooms  This place has free shuttle from airport   but you get your rent a car right across the street in the new Mega Car Rental Universe  Free shuttle to Mandalay Bay  The buffett B fast is OK  The full kitchen will do just fine after a stop at Safeway and you can get local restaurant delivery  Fitness room to burn off the pizza tostados  Get a room away from noisy elevator  Two bedroom suites are great for families  or just for that  executive  lifestyle at a great price  Click on  hotel by name  in a package deal search  
P =>   Great for Large Families This hotel was a great bargain  Our family of six adults and three children stayed comfortably in the two bedroom suite for only         a night  There were two bedrooms  two bathrooms  a living room with pull out sofa  a kitchenette and three T V s  You can see the Strip but are away from the noise  The hotel offers an hourly shuttle to Mandalay Bay  There is a Whole Foods and an open air mall nearby  They offer a hearty free breakfast and have a small convenience store near reception  An extensive selection of take out food can be delivered to your room  I am glad to have found this place  It seems all other  quot suites quot  hotels are really one bedroom and a living room  This was actually two bedrooms and a living room  Everything still smelled new  I hope their prices stay reasonable  
P =>   Loved This Hotel      We loved the Homewood Suites   we checked out of the Tropicana   after staying for   hour because we were so disgusted and booked at the Homewood  The rooms were so clean and nice and with the two bedroom suite   we had everything we needed  We parked close to our room and had a full kitchen and everything else we would need  The breakfast was great  waffles  fruit  bacon  eggs  cereal  etc  We would definitely stay here again  It was very close to the rental car return so it was easy to get there in the morning when we were leaving Las Vegas  This hotel is one that we will definitely look at next time we travel  
P =>  Brand New  We stayed at this beautiful and new  opened   months ago  hotel in t  on a return trip from Utah  We booked a   bdrm   bath suite  It was gorgeous  One bedroom had a king size bed and the other bedroom had   double beds  There were sleeping pillows galore on the bed from which to choose from  The bathrooms had tub shower combinations and a toilet with a door separating it from the vanity area  Neutrogena soap and lotion products were provided along with hair dryers  the hair dryers also had nightlights under them so you could have a bit of light at night   There were tv s in both bedrooms The kitchen living area separated the   bedrooms  The kitchen had a   burner stove  full size refrigerator  coffee maker  toaster  dishwasher  dishes and microwave  They provided   pods of regular  amp  decaf coffee for the coffee maker  most hotels only give you     The kitchen also had a beautiful granite countertop  There was a small sofa  ottoman and tv in the living area The breakfast in the morning consisted of eggs  bacon  potatoes  cereal  waffles  fresh fruit  yogurt  toast  amp  bagels  along with several types of teas and coffees  Real plates  cups and silverware were provided  no plastic   The breakfast area was large and not overly crowded when we were there  and this was a Saturday   They provide shuttle service to the airport  but do not pick up from there  They also provide shuttle service at the bottom of the hour to Mandalay Bay hotel  I think you have to call them when you want to be picked up if you are the only ones going  The front desk personnel were very friendly and helpful  We would love to stay there again  
P =>   great new hotel but one problem    Greetings Stayed at this hotel right next to las vegas airport on y   nd Very nice hotel  this is obviously some brand new construction  the rooms are super clean  and all have full kitchen equipment and a small living room area with sofa and tv  It is really well located for people that need to catch an early flight from las vegas mccarran airport and this hotel provides a shuttle service to the airport for free So everything positive  except for one major problem  The noise  We had a room facing the hidden well street  The street itself is not noisy  the issue is that right next to hidden well street is a major highway     or      underpass and basically it was impossible for me to sleep during the whole night with this constant strong noise  The other members of the family apparently managed to sleep somehow decently  but if you are a traveller like myself that is sensitive to outside noise  than you may be in trouble So bring ear plugs and or make sure you get a room not facing the hidden well road and perhaps you will be ok  family from montreal  canada 
P =>  Great non gaming extended stay While I had reservations about staying someplace that just opened its doors  this place was ready for business  Located just south of the Mandalay Bay Hotel and east of Las Vegas Blvd  just a couple of blocks fromt the airport car rental center  this place great  The rooms were top notch  the breakfast and evening fare were great and the staff very helpful  A non gaming property with no casino nearby  this is a great place to stay if you are not a gambler or prefer not to stay in a gaming hotel  All rooms have a small kitchen  Although I didn t use the pool  it looked inviting  but it didin t appear that you could do much tanning during the day  except at high noon  as the pool is located in an area surrounded by the hotel building  As I said before  this place is new  very little noise from the traffic or airplaines  This place is very similar to the same property located in Henderson  NV  
P => 
P => Hidden Secret This was my  rd visit to Hooters The staff is freindly and helpful  beds and pillows are comfortable  They have cable television and complimentary bottles of water in the rooms  Dan inos has the      prime rib    hrs and the Hooters hot wings are great  The price is right   
P => Cheap weekend getaway Got a great deal from the slot club for Sat and Sun  Made for a nice quick and cheap getaway with wife  
P => Great views and Excellent Housekeeping My wife really liked the prime rib special  I enjoyed the breakfast buffet and the fresh fruit and with biscuits The housekeeping service was very good and thoughtful  she brought my daughter extra sheets w o asking for them on the second night Hooters restaurant waitress were friendly and helpful  Although menu was different  prices and sauce choices were minimum  Food was very good and beer too Dixie bar did not have the great looking ladies that were pictured  only couple of bartender guys  be seasonal Casino girls were nice and nice looking  Machines need updating like the MGM across the street The room AC was VERY old and HARD to maintain a consistant temperature makeing sleeping difficult at times  It is VERY LOUD and either Very HOT or COLD no in between Although  we did not win the      we will likely return if price is good  
P => Good Value with a good location The room itself could use some attention in that there was peeling paint and a slightly damaged drain in the bathroom  The hallways were rather dingy and did not feel very welcoming  The casino itself was good  Sure  not as upscale as many of the other casinos but the service was excellent and the staff were very helpful and welcoming  The gem of the hotel casino was the gym  though I couldn t figure out how to turn on all the lights  
P => You get what you pay for I was suckered in by the Internet special  The casino itself is small but relatively clean  the rooms however were dirty and dated  I do not reccomend  
P => Great place to stay for the price      I have not one complaint  My family and I always stay at hooters   They are always accomodating our every need   In this day n age   with the economics the way they are u just can t beat the prices of the rooms at hooters   
P => Stay anywhere but here  The young man at check in wasn t at all helpful  never mentioned a kids area which is listed on the survey card  The hallway on the  th floor had an offensive odor  the rooms and carpet are tired but adequate   certainly nothing to write home about  Elevators  garage  amp  room  were frightful   they did not always work  The slot machines were dirty  Security  housekeeping  and maintenance were helpful and pleasant  They do have a heated pool  The bed was comfortable  
P => Not too bad for the price We were expecting a total dump based on the price we paid  but were pleasantly surpirsed  It is a small casino with a lot of penny and nickle slots  There was a restraunt  club  and show on site  The food was pretty good  so were the drinks  just don t buy a drink  they are very expensive considering you can sit at a machine and get them for free  The gym had pretty good equipment for such a small hotel  The pool area was cozy with fire pits and different seating areas for visiting  The rooms were typical of a Howard Johnson or equivalent  The beds were comfortable and the rooms were clean  However  there were food trays sitting outside someones door by the eleveator for   days which was anoying  We were in walking distance to many of the bigger hotels which was nice  All in all I would stay here again if I didn t want to spend the money at a bigger hotel  
P => Great Hotel with Mates Stayed here for five nights on a trip with mates from the UK  Overall this is a smaller and more friendly hotel which means it doesn t take    minutes to get back to your room if you forget your camera Yes it is not as plush as other hotels  yes the fascilities are not as up to date but if you need a hotel as a place to crash with mates then this is the place The staff were all really friendly and helpful  there was a party going on all day  the pool and bars were excellent  and last but the not least the hooters bar is top class Other reviews say this is off strip  it is but only     yards off strip  It is located next to the MGM and in a real good spot for getting about Vegas Would I go back  hell yeah  would I go with my Wife  Hell NO  butu saying that her and her friends are staying there next year  
P =>   Quick easy and the stay was clean I enjoy staying at the hotelThe service and food was pleasant 
P =>   great hotel for the price good value for being right off the strip good service perfect size not too big and over the top Like the other hotel s on the strip perfect walking distance to the mgm and others  
P =>   Seemed like best price but        I searched the web for a good price on a single night stay in Las Vegas  Hooters was offering a low price and what seemed to be a good location  So I booked the room  When we got there I learned that there was an extra  quot cleaning quot  charge of     per night  This increased the cost of the room by nearly      The drinks were very expensive     for a cocktail      for a double shot of name brand rum  Internet service is     a day The hotel is located across the street from the MGM but you have to walk down the street a     mile to cross over on a pedestrian bridge  Then you have to walk the entire length of the MGM to get to the Monorail  The funny thing is I could see the monorail station straight across from Hooters  Finally  the rooms were functional but seemed to be converted from another hotel chain  There were no bedside lamps  only floor lamps in the corners  Wood  quot patches quot  were applied where the bed lamps used to be attached to the wall  But the room was clean So beware of the price and be aware that the location is not as good as it seems  
P =>   Won t go again  I booked this hotel through Priceline com  Unfortunately I wasn t expecting to see Hooters as a result  The front desk though it was quick to check in  the service was bad  Also  the hotel charges an additional       as a reserve fee that is also added onto the price which I wasn t expecting  Therefore  it ended up costing more then what priceline promised  The housekeeping staff charged me for water that I did not drink  I will definitely think twice before booking Hooters  You mind as well pay a few more dollars for a descent hotel  
P =>   Great for the price We are frequent travelers to Las Vegas  The Golden Nugget is our favorite place to stay  however  we have stayed at many of the hotels on the strip in our     times to Vegas  Hooters was decent for the price  We paid     for sunday night which included a buy one get one free breakfast buffet at dan marinos    complimentary tickets to Todd Paul and      in promo slot play  The casino is small  however  Tropicana  MGM  Monte Carlo  New York New York casinos are close by  The rooms are clean  however  the entire hotel   elevators  carpet  rooms  bathrooms are in desperate need of updating  The pool and hot tubs are nice  If you are on a budget this is a great option in vegas  
P =>   Better than I expected from the reviews I read Some friends of mine were going to Vegas so I headed out as well at the last possible moment  Was looking for a room on the cheap decided to give Hooters a try glad I did  The rooms are pretty much like a motel   room with Hooters trim  My room was fine and very clean house keeping did a great job  The room service was great as well both the restaurants were excellent and thrift priced compared to a block away at the strip  I am a person that likes a luxury room as much as the next guy my wife and I stayed at Bellagio in  in a suite for      a nite and it was luxury this room averaged     and was well worth the price  The       prime rib was great as well as the steak and eggs For        
P =>   Would stay again Not luxury but comfortable economy  Hotel is older and well worn but clean  Don t expect excellent room service  Our hair dryer broke and it took    hrs to get a new one delivered  we left after an hour so I m not sure how long it took   Hotel atmosphere is fun and laid back  Nice music playing  Room was clean and bed surprisingly comfortable  Walking distance to several other hotels  If you have the time I recommend visiting the VooDoo Lounge  on top of The Rio  in the evening  You get a beautiful view of the city and great music  If you get there early  you might even get free entrance passes  
P =>   BED BUGS    I stayed in the Hooters hotel in LV  NV from oct         to oct          I started getting itchy bumps  and i didn t know what they were until i found one of the bedbugs  It was disgusting  when we checked out i told the manager at the front desk about it  and she offered me     off  The bites got worse  like i had an allergic reaction  Also  i am very scared i might have brought them back The work experience of my life  I have already called the hotel and left a message with the main manager  and am hoping to be re compensated for my stay  
P =>  budget hotel Good hotel for the money  However if I had to do it over again I would spend a little more and get a lot more  the people were really nice  The food in Dan ino s was horrible  The prime rib had more fat on it then meat hooters food was normal but of course you paid more for that No coffee maker in the room and no coffee in the hotel  The room was average but severely lacking in outlets  The rooms were called beach side so I thought I was going to see at least a view of the pool   nope a view of the parking lot The pool was very nice and the staff including security by the pool were awesome the hotel very quiet in the room areas so that was really nicesign up for the free chips just to get the coupon to see the comedian for       I laughed from the beginning to the end   hilarious 
P =>  Perfect for what we needed We stayed here for   nights on a quick cheap trip in        We got a dirt cheap bungalo room and it suited our needs just fine  The pool area was a nice place to relax at night  the staff was friendly and more importantly it was like     night  If you want something that just works well for quick trips or if you re not planing on spending much time in the room this hotel was perfect  We re staying one day here again in ember for nastalgia before moving on to the Bellagio for the remaining   nights  Cant wait  
P =>   A HOOTING TOOTING HOTEL we stayed at the hotel in        the hotel was nice  the down side was that the towels they provdided around the pool were very small to say the least  best take your own  the room was ok but it would be a lot better with fresh painted walls and a new carpet  the wardbrobe doors didnt work either  the breakfast buffee was ok but we found another hotel that was a lot better   the next one up  the location was ideal it didnt take you too long to be on the strip about a  minute walk  all in all the budget hotel gets my vote for the next trip  
P =>   Great location it was a hoot  Although off strip this hotel is in a great location  Check in was fast and easy  our room was standard but clean  Our window looked out on Tropicana and the strip  great views of NYNY and MGM at night  Our safe was faulty  i think the prveious guests left if locked but we called security and they were up in minutes to fix it  Weather was quite cool  even for us Scots  so we didn t spend much time by the pool  We did spend a wee while at the jacuizi next to the pool however  The pool area was clean and towels were available  The casino itself was very small compared to the others and got quite busy on the weekends when it filled up with guys  We ate a few times in Dan marinos which did a good breakfast  The beds were comfy and hotel noise was pretty minimal  Hooters is in walking distance of a lot of the major hotel casinos so taxi and bus journeys were kept to a minimum  If I return any time soon and hooters is still stnading i will definately consider it  
P =>   Great value for money After reading some negative reviews on this hotel before arriving i thought it only fair to say how i found this hotel Great location  clean rooms and exactly what i wanted for what was paid for the stay Next year am thinking of going for   weeks to hooters very satisfied  
P =>   great stay Was shocked to read other bad reviews for Hooter Las Vegas  We had a great stay and enjoyed our three nights here  We did have to queue for check in and it was through the Pokie Machines in the casino but it was resonably quick and nothing like the queues in the other hotel we had looked in Great room and decor  very clean and tidy  Very close to The Strip and gas station  convenience store and Coco s Resturant  Also used both Hooters Resturants and brought souvenirs from Hooters shops  Our room over looked the pool  which we didn t use but plenty of people were and we did have drinks by it  very nice We used the casino and enjoyed the free first drink when using a machine  not serious gamblers   had to say we had  Been there done that  in Vegas   I would say this hotel is more suitable for young people in party mode  although saying that we are in our    s and still enjoyed ourselves  
P =>   Great for the young crowd   We stayed one night here and loved the amosphere  it is not the highest paying casino on the strip but great to kick back and relax in  great for people in their   s and   s  Pool was cool  several seperated pools and hot tubs  one with a waterfall  didnt go in the hot tub  didnt look as clean as the pool  stayed in thr bungalow rooms off the pool  nice view  basic no frills room  bed was comfy  room was clean  a little outdated  but for our purposes it was great for     a night   
P =>   HOOTERIFIC  Came out with some friends for a softball tournament  had a blast at the pool party and the specials around the casino  Thanks for a great time  
P =>  Hooters        it was ok  As far as the rooms go  the rooms are actually quite nice  The beds are comfy  there is a nice atmosphere in the rooms as well   The casino is average and isn t nearly as big and glamorous as others on the strip but works well if you just want to play a couple of video machines and they have a few reasonably priced table games   The pool is just fair  if your looking for a nice pool there are a lot of other places to go for a great value ie   The Tropicana right next door has a fabulous pool for the money  location it is a little off the strip  so if you are looking for a lot of time on the strip it would be wise to get a hotel right on the strip    the flamingo  harrah s all for around the same price  Restaurants  Hooters restaurant is good of course  Dan ino s is just fair   Overall it is just a run of the mill hotel in vegas  Its not the best but isn t the worst especially for the price on near the strip  
P =>   Not that bad My fiance decided at the last minute to leave to vegas a day early so we booked Hooters for     and were on our way trecking the desert in the night  We arrived at  am and quickly checked in  We were upgraded from a bungalow room to a tower room on the  th floor of the bay view tower for free  we also got   free breakfast buffets at Dan inos but i suggest you skip that unless you are low on money and want a free meal  Not much selection and the food was bland but hey its free  The elevator from the parking garage into the casino is pretty old and dingy  Yes the casino is small but there is not much that Hooters could have done with it  San Remo was a tiny casino and Hooters looks like they have done the best they could have in making it over  We played craps after dropping our bags off in our room and the craps dealers were extremely nice and helpful  Easily the nicest dealers i have been around in vegas  Thanks for everything Vee and Andrew  You have to remember that Hooters doesnt make itself out to be amoungst the belagios and venetians of vegas  They are a mid level hotel were you can relax and have fun  if you are a picky person who finds flaws in many things then you should definitely not stay here  if you like to kick back and have fun  i would recommend staying at hooters 
P =>   Stay anywhere else This place is going downhill  The rooms are small with double beds  The casino is small  Hooters restaurant is not even open    hours  Dan ino restaurant has the worst food  The staff is very friendly and the location is fine  I just wouldn t stay here again  
P =>  Great deal  I booked   nights at Hooters during the winter for a really great deal  less than     for   nights   Originally  we booked for a bungalow  but the staff was kind enough to upgrade us to a room inside the hotel  the bungalow is separate from the hotel   I was easy and convenient to get from the elevator to the room and very comfortable as well  The room was very beachy themed and the bed was well cushioned  It was a quick walk to MGM and the people there are accommodating  
P =>  Good value We stayed   nights in y   we had stayed at this hotel before  in      and went back because of the relaxed atmosphere and cheap room prices  This time around it seemed the Hooters girls weren t quite as happy and chirpy however  Room was a good size  clean and comfortable  Staff at the reception desk gave us the bare minimum in terms of welcome and pleasantries  This is a smaller casino which we liked  as it doesn t take long to get from your hotel room to the Strip  The pool area had security guards which was good as there were a few that had had a bit too much to drink   they took care of any unsavoury characters quickly and discreetly  The only complaint I have about the pool is that there were no pool attendants to clear away used towels  empty drink containers  debris etc  Great value and a fun place to stay  If you don t want your boyfriend husband looking at girls in skimpy shorts and tight singlets  this is not for you  Great for a boys girls trip away and couples if your wife girlfirend is not the jealous psycho type  
P =>   Grea Place to Stay If you re not looking for a resort I have stayed at this hotel with my girlfriend many times  We are able to get many comps to shows and museums because of my girlfriends connections  so we don t like spending money on a hotel because we frequent the city so much  The rooms are nice and clean and keep with the same hooters style as the restaurants  The rooms and the casino aren t too fancy  but it s hooters  it s not suppose to be fancy   I would not stay here if I was planning a big trip  but for the Vegas regular or spur of the moment Vegas trip  this hotel should do nicely  My girlfriend likes the place  but I m sure its a much bigger hit with the guys than the ladies  Nothing can beat their    cent midnight chicken wing special also tip the drink girls in casino and the drinks come non stop   You can also get ridiculously good rates on this hotel if you look and even cheaper if you frequent the hotel  We stayed for three nights  which included new years eve and new years for less than       I booked a four night stay this summer for a total of      I have only stayed in the tower rooms  be careful about the bungalow rooms they are detached from the casino and seem a bit seedy   I missed the earlier special this year which was half the price  You also receive a coupon book if you sign up for their players card  many buy one get one free   They give you free show tickets with the purchase of one drink  just look for the special  Just remember don t expect an over the top Vegas hotel room here  this is not a mega resort  It s literally around the corner from strip  what more could you want  
P =>   average hotel good location We stayed here   days in        Hotel is average   Location is good behind MGM but in the point that nobody pops in accidentally  Probably that is why it wasnt that lively  there were only few people in the evenings    The pool area is nice  Also the small gym is somehow adequate for little working out  Food wasnt that special  normal junk  That time there was nothing special going on in the evenings  Rooms were okIt was pretty much what we ve expected for that price  Less lively though  
P =>   excellent dollar valueS Stayed e    to y  everything was perfect  A     ft  walk to the strip  a clean air contioned room  agreat atmosphere especially at the pool with excellent bartenders and lots of meals under        plus the usual wing promotions  Dave J Ottawa Canada 
P =>   the friendliest place in town I have stayed at Hooter s twice now and found it to be the most friendly staff around  The receptionist  the waiters and waitresses  the barmaids  etc  The atmosphere there is fun and exciting with attention to customers  My boyfriend and I always come back here  We will be coming a  rd time soon  The rooms are very comfy and make you feel like your in a tropical climate  We have gambled in many other casinos in town and the Hooter s is best because the atmosphere is so fun  We are not big gamblers so we don t get perks  Its just nice to be waited on so well  We have eaten at Dan ino s rest  The food is awesome  Location is clooose to the strip  Great value and service  
P =>  Avoid  went open minded after reading reviews on here before and seeing it was down as   star  I d give it   star  Casino and first impressions on arrival good  however after checking in noticed how seedy and grubby really is  the corridors to rooms dark and smelt of dope also stained grey carpets  The room no quilt covers on for say   out of   days  stained horrible brown carpet in room and cheap wooden furniture  Eating in Hooters  avoid buffet breakfast or any food at all in restaraunt  looked like it had been there days and not much choice  surprised me people eating in there  Round the pool area dirty never saw it cleaned round whilst there  chicken bones old straws etc   all over floor  Brown padded seats all stained no way would you sit in one in shorts  So all in all hotel to avoid there is better hotels cheaper  only thing going for it location opposite MGM  good for going over for breakfast  
P =>  Ticks every box and cheap I have stayed at Hooters   times now  I think it is brilliant as it is always very cheap  and is in a great location just across the road from the MGM  The rooms are very similar in size to the other hotels I have stayed at in Vegas   Paris  Luxor  MGM  I have never had a problem with my room  the beds are large  and I have never had a reason to complain about anything  The bathrooms are fine too  The pool area is decent  small  but there is a pool side bar  and although the pools are small  they are decent enough  and some of them are heated  The casino area is small  and the bar near the entrance of the hotel is tiny  but we only really use it as a meeting point  or for a quick drink before heading out elsewhere There is a restaurant called Dan ino s  I have eaten there a few times for breakfast  and it does good food and is handy late at night when you ve got the munchies  There is a    hour shop next door to Hooters too  so you can get drink and snacks to have in your room from there  as well as toiletries etc  so that s handy The gambling area is very small  and the only negative about Hooters is I don t view it as a hotel you d go to for a night out  as it is small and doesn t have a proper bar  I just like it because it is cheap  good value for money  and the rooms serve their purpose  I might go back to Vegas in ember and I will stay at Hooters again  I d always stay there in the future  unless I win the lottery or go with a girlfriend  
P =>  Nice Pool O K hotel for a quick night We pre booked a very cheap rate at Hooters because our plane was getting in at midnight and we needed a cheap place to crash  If you re looking for the same and you can get a really low rate then Hooters is fine for a quick night  It s on Tropicana Blvd across from the MGM hotel and monorail station   about a five minute or less walk to the strip  Check inThe Attached parkade didn t appear to have an elavator but there is parking out front  My wife and I checked in and they were out of the bungalow rooms we had booked so they  quot upgraded quot  us to a tower room for the same rate  Check in was quick and friendly but be aware they charge you    each night for a resort fee  It s not a resort     The casino area is all right  basically a hooters restaurant with slot machines and tables  RoomsWhen Hooters bought the hotel they threw down some new carpet  painted the walls and nailed up some surfboards in the halls  Be warned the halls are dim and and the dark paint doesn t help much  The rooms aren t anything to write home about  the beds and sheets were clean and comfortable  the linoleum was old and peeling in the bathroom  the fixtures were old and stained  the walls were thin and the sliding window to the false deck didn t lock  A typical budget motel room Public areasThe casino was fun with a party atmosphere  lots of good games  and access to cheap drinks if your not gambling  The free form pool was built when they bought the hotel and is the highlight of the property with a bar  a few hot tubs  a waterfall and sandy areas for lounging  Dan inos is a    hour restaurant with a late night wing special and a breakfast buffet   get the     coupon for signing up for the Owl Club players card   They also have a Hooters restaurant  comedy theatre  Dixies country bar and another casual bar  Overall  Hooters is O K for a night for the under    crowd  I would recommend it to a friend for a cheap place to stay close to the airport  it would be great for a bachelor party but I wouldn t recommend it to a single women because of the dark halls and laxed security  
P =>  Worth a look for those on a budget  The casino is fun  the pool is decent and the price is right  The rooms are very basic  but clean and a good value  The pool loses the sun around mid afternoon  so plan on getting your sun early  The casino is allot of fun  the brunch at Dan ino s is decent and the hooters restaurant is a hooters restaurant  Close to the monorail station and a      minute walk to most of the south end strip casinos  this is a good option for those on a budget The parking garage is brutal and needs to be cleaned up  it is by far the worst part of the property  
P =>   Fun Place to Stay  My boyfriend and I stayed here during the week of Memorial Day       We were upgrade to a suite on the top floor when we checked in  It was beautiful with a great view  There was no line at all at check in  The line to get their players club card was long and moved slow  The hooters on site is on par with any other Hooters  It a fun place to stay on a budget  My only complaint at all is the parking garage  It stinks and it s a little scary at night  
P =>   Dirty Dirty Dirty Ok went there with my family  Wife and   kids    and       The elevators from the parking garage down to the hotel stunk of vomit and were covered in obscene grafiti  The staff was less than enthusiastic about helping you and seemed to make you feel as though you were bothersome for asking questions or requiring assistance  The rooms were dirty  Over an inch of years worth of  quot Dust bunny quot  dust built up completely around the entire floorboard and corners of the rooms  The carpets were covered in Cigarette burns   quot on a non smoking floor quot   and the other guests would be sitting in the hallway  smoking and drinking and blasting music as though this was their freshman dorm in college  The kids liked the pool  as long as the smell of sewage doesn t bother you  Overall I have been to better in third world countries  but as with all the reviews    WE GOT WHAT WE PAID FOR    
P =>   Great value better than expected I chose Hooters for our   night stay due to the value      per might  and the location  just off the strip caddy corner from MGM Grand   I had read the reviews and was prepared for a mediocre place  thinking we d be spending most of our time outside the hotel anyway  so the hotel itself didn t matter much But I was pleasantly surprised   the room was fine  plenty of pillows  no waits at the registration counters  no extra charges  a great view of the mountains  extremely polite housecleaning staff  Great value if you ask me  Here s the rundown Casino  Very loud sports bar ish  nothing upscale or elegant about it  But considering it s Hooters  what do you expect  One drawback    the elevators to our room were at the far end of the casino  so you had to walk the entire casino every time you wanted to go to your room  Luckily it wasn t a huge casino like some others  but would have been nice to have the elevators a bit more convenient Restaurants Bars  Ate at the Hooters restaurant the first night  Felt like a Hooters  Went to the Dixie s Dam Bar the first night also  Somewhat strange experience  Lots of blaring hip hop music with a few gorgeous dancers clearly employed by the bar  surrounded by a bunch of middle aged men just standing and staring  We didn t stay long Location  Was fine    had hoped for an easier trip from the airport  given that it s IMMEDIATELY next to it  but the cab ride from the airport is still      and the airport shuttle bus  at       per person  drops off at Hooters last  making it a long trip  But walking to the strip wasn t hard    Just go through the Tropicana parking lot and you re on the strip  with elevated walkways taking you to New York New York and MGM Grand Pool  Looked nice and seemed fairly popular during the day    only one of the two hot tubs worked  but it was pleasant enough the one night we used it Parking  Had a small parking lot right in front  and we never had any problem finding a spot  It was easily the most convenient parking of any hotel we visited Cleanliness  A little mildew around the tub  and the window was little dirty making the view not quite as nice as it could have been  but otherwise no complaints    and certainly clean enough given the low price Service  We had no bad service experiences    I was actually blown away by the friendliness of the maid in the morning  When we accidentally locked ourselves out of the room bathroom they sent up someone to unlock it within about    minutes Loudness  There were a couple times when people from the pool were pretty loud  even from our room on the   th floor   but it didn t bother us  We were in Vegas for a good time  with no kids  so a little bit of drunk singing wasn t an issue  It didn t go on too long or too late  and the other rooms around us were perfectly quiet Overall  Giving this hotel a   star rating based on the value of what you get for the money    if it were more expensive  the rating would probably be a three  If I were coming to Vegas for a fun trip and needed something cheap  I d stay here again  
P =>  The only good part was the beds and Brandon who checked our bags and car  The front desk was not able to help without constantly going and asking the manager for help  The casino area was tiny and the music way too loud  The Hooters restaurant was overpriced and the food was not nearly as good as the regular restaurants food  Dan inos restaurant was a better deal and had mush better food  The best employee there was Brandon who checked in and delivered our luggage to our room and also did double duty as the valet for our car  
P =>  The beds are so comfy    Don t expect too much  The place was just slightly improved from what it was  But the beds are super comfy  If you re in Vegas and just need a bed to crash on   this is the place for you  
P =>   Do not stay here  This place is the worst of the worst  Dirty and run down  Lots of drunks and just a terrible place  I had paid for   nights here thru a package deal but I left after the first night and got a real room at the MGM  Trust me    do not stay at Hooters unless you are a scum and love rubbing elbows with other scumbads and dirty walls  fllors and furniture  I want to throw up thinking about the place  
P =>   who can complain for      We stayed for   nights with our  mo baby  We paid     per night for the room  plus a    resort fee  and we got a fantastic room with a view towards the strip Hooters is located just off the strip  opposite the MGM  so all the tourist buses are just across the road  We ve stayed here before  when it was the San Remo and you seriously can t complain for the price  The room was clean  the portacrib was provided free of charge  My only complaint was no fridge  but we could have upgraded for     if we really wanted one  Oh  and you have to pay for WiFi  but that s about it  
P =>   Too dumpy to pass muster I ve stayed at    hotels in Las Vegas  and I think this is the worst one I ve stayed at This is a very old hotel that was purchased by Hooters  They put a Hooters restaurant on the first floor  put some surfboards in the elevator lobbys  and that s pretty much it  When I stayed there  I got free breakfast every morning  free show tickets to see the Mentalist and Bobby Slayton  both of which are no longer performing there   all that for      and that made it tolerable  
P =>   Pleasantly Surprised   It was a lot minue booking for my bday celebration weekend  I already did a lot of online hotel bookings but was not fully satified  I am usually a budget traveller and not to gaga with Big hotels  I usually just want a hotel with nice location and clean rooms to stay after a long day of strip stroll I was pleasantly surprised with Hooters For     nite for the weekend its a good value What i really like if the nice touch in our room we stayed in  NIce queen bed with summer decor  They also grant our request for view of the strip  I usually look for nice bedding and restrooms in the places i stayed  They meet my expectations  Im planning to stay there again due to its location  value and service  
P =>  Certainly Good Value   Well Happy Me and my adult son stayed in a room here when we went over for a boxing match and we were well happy with it  Ok  if I took my wife to Vegas she d want to go to somewhere a bit more  swanky  but I was well impressed with Hooters for the price  We paid for the cheapest of rooms  bungalow  and then tipped the reception guy well for an upgrade and ended up with a tower room with Strip view  A couple of small marks on the carpet is the only fault I could find with the room and otherwise it was ideal for us  A   night stay cost us under      and so less than     a night      per person  That s value in my book  The casino is only small by Vegas standards but one advantage was the waitresses on the casino floor soon get to recognise you and know you re a resident  in which case they re well free and easy with the drinks  You don t even have to be actually playing a table or a machine and they ll bring you whatever you ask for  Dan Morhino s Restaurant was a bit of a disappointment frankly   nothing more than average  However  it was my first introduction to the Hooters Restaurant and their variety of hot chicken wings  fries with chilli con carne and cheese etc  Delicious  I d definitely go back here and all the staff were perfectly helpful  albeit we didn t have any specific problems  Great location too   right end of the Strip for all the action and directly opposite the main entrance to MGM Grand  which is where our Boxing match was  I give Hooters      overall  provided you always know it s pretty damn cheap and you re not expecting to be treated like royalty for that price  
P =>   HOOTERS HOTEL is     Its very hard to find a hotel that is so inexpensive in the strip or near the strip  I did some serious research and found out that the Hooters Hotel is next to the MGM Grand Hotel  right across from each other  I was sick of paying for taxi cabs in Vegas  I decided to walk from Hooters to anywhere in the strip which was fun because you walk through hotel to hotel which isn t bad at all  The price is super cheap  the rooms are comfortable  The rooms are always clean  you can ask for queen beds which they give you two of them  There is    cent wings from    midnight to   a m  at Dan ino s  The wings are big and breaded which is a plus and taste awesome  So why pick Hooters  if your a person that is all about not being complicated by your hotel and walking a lot you should come to Hooters  In Vegas your goal is not to spend a lot of time in your hotel but to go to clubs or check out the nice hotels and use the money you saved on the clubs you want to go to  The poker room is amazing being a      table  The sports room is small but you can place sporting bets which is nice meaning they have that  The girls that work there look great  they really stand out  Hooters is a great headquarters to where you can eat and sleep there but then go out and party in the big hotels and clubs and come back to a relaxing quiet hotel  You will not find any hotels on the strip that come close to price and hospitality as to the Hooters Hotel  Just remember the hotel is small but that make you their primary focus  They have fun card games  they offer comps if you earn them  Hooters Rewards have a coupon sheet given to new Owl Rewards members which is awesome  You can hang out and talk to the pretty girls dealing cards at the hotel  build up your coinfidence and meet other nice ladies throughout the city  its a win win situation  There are plenty of free drinks if you gamble so you have nothing to lose  All these reasons make the Hooters Hotel      Be realistic  stay within your budget  your not going to spend a lot of time in a   or   star hotel and spend     to     dollars a night  realize that your playing for what check in at   at most   or   star hotels to leave at    or    am  thats    hours by     dollars means your losing    dollars a hour or go to Hooters and pay    to    dollars a night and that works out to   to   dollars a hour so do the math  I rate Hooters a     out of   stars  Hooters is a hotel that constantly rewards its customers with coupons  comps  and inexpensive food and inexpensive room rates  
P =>   Nice beddings A little bit off the strip  I once went to this casino to walk around and thought it was overrated  Second time around  still think the casino  and the girls   are overrated  But spending a night in one of their regular rooms   oh my  I loved the bed room so much  The room we got had great views of Luxor  It had fresh interiors  lighting was nice  and the colors were cheery  The newly renovated pool area looked pretty cool too  Bathroom was a little cramped  The part I loved the most were the sheets    my  oh  my   sheets to sleep in for Cons  incovenient parking  off stripPros  Bed sheets to die for  Reasonable prices  got our room at a special rate of     a night on a weekday   Close enough to the stripWould definitely consider staying again in the future  if only for the price and the sheets  
P =>   Absolutely fantastic  I d never been to Hooters before  I d normally stayed at the Luxor or the Venetian but we decided to stay here as we d heard it was very good  and it was brilliant Having stayed at whats seen as the  posher  hotels  I d say Hooters surpasses them all  the rooms were brilliant and the comfort was fantastic  only   minute walk from the main Vegas  situated right outside MGM  The pool was brilliant  we went in ember when it wasn t so busy so a late night swim or sit in the Jacuzzi was bliss  Loved every minute of the hotel  well worth the money and will definitely be booking there again  
P =>   Awful dirty disgusting Ugh     Where do I start  We stayed in a bungalow room that faced the pool  instead of the parking lot  which you think would be nice  Well  think again  If you love music at a level    from morning until after midnight  amp  the sound of children screaming this is the room for you  I called the front desk manager  Frank  who told me that the music was only played from    noon until   pm  Well  the next night  the music was on way past   pm and the manager  some woman  told me   quot Oh no  it can go on after midnight  especially on the weekends  I had to leave a note to housekeeping what to clean every day because somehow they missed the mold in the tub  the light bulbs that needed replaced  which never got done  and to unclog the tub  And God forbid they leave you more than one roll of toilet paper in the room  One on the spinner  that is all you get  We had to let the shower run about   minutes before the hot water ever came on and if anyone in the surrounding rooms is using their shower  forget it you aren t getting any hot water    of my   days  I had to take a shower in the gym locker room to get hot water  There was NEVER any hot water out of the bathroom sink  The site claims that all bungalows come with safes  hair dryers  and coffee makers    No they don t  I had to call for a hair dryer and it s curcuit clicker on it was a hassle  I had to keep clicking it like a lighter to get it to work  The carpets are filthy  I walked from my room at one end of the hall to the ice machine in my socks  When I got back to the room  they were black  I accidently locked myself out of my room  When security showed up  they didn t have me listed as being in the room at all  The gym is good but there is nothing to clean the equipment with after you are done    gross  The location is the only good part about that place  It s a quick walk to the strip  
P =>  Crappy room The rooms  hallways  and elevators are filthy and run down  The room smelled and was dirty  The hotel does have a nice pool and is in a convenient location near MGM  New York New York and Tropicana  
P =>   Great Value  Very Good pool area  great location  non typical Vegas rooms The bungalows are going for        a night      resort fee  Rooms are small and more like a motel than your typical Vegas strip room  Location is great    right across from MGM and   min from monorail Casino is very small   but fun  Outside Pools and area are great If you want to get to Vegas  have fun  not worry about all the amenities of a      room    and find a great value on our room  so you can spend your money on shows  casinos  et al    this is the place for you My wife and I have been here     times over that past couple decades    and stayed in the top end places and now Hooters     we had a blast in all of them  Just know what you want and what you re paying for and everything will be great have fun they have hi speed internet  but charge        a day for use 
P =>   Small fun close to the strip   great place to stay Let me begin by saying that if you want to stay in a ritzy  ultra classy hotel then this is not the place for you  On the other hand  if you are looking for an inexpensive room in a fun hotel casino that you are not likely to get lost in  this is your place  It is a small  fun hotel and casino with brightly colored lights  fun music and a party atmosphere all around  The whole hotel is a bit reminiscent of a beachy surfer atmosphere down to the surfboards hanging on the walls and the  quot sandy footprints quot  in the hallways My trip was a   day stay from Wednesday through Monday during Spring Break ch Madness so the city was hopping  I went with three college friends and even with being four    something girls staying at Hooters  we had a blast and really enjoyed the hotel  We also felt extremely safe  as we had difficulty with an obnoxious drunk guy harassing one of our friends one night  The security  casino  and hotel staff were wonderful and took care of it immediately  The room cost us      Wednesday  Thursday  and Sunday nights  to     per night  Friday and Saturday nights  The rooms were nothing terribly special  similar to a Holiday Inn or any other basic hotel chain you might stay at  also similar to your average room at Excalibur  Tropicana  etc  but the room was clean  the beds were comfortable  in room safe was provided  and our view was of the south end of the strip   NYNY  Exalibur  Mandalay Bay  the Luxor  the MGM  and the Tropicana and was stunning at night  Some people say this hotel is off strip and technically it is  but it is basically like being on the strip  It is next door to the Tropicana and across the street from the MGM grand   it is about the same walking distance to the strip as from either of those places once you account for the fact that both of those casinos are much larger and it takes a long time to get to your room once inside  We had friends staying at Excalibur and the Tropicana  and it didn t take us any longer to get back to our room from an activity than it did for them  The pool was warm   a bit small  but fun and PACKED when we were there  It was definitely a party atmosphere in the pool area  lots of people in our age range and high energy music playing  The pool bar  nippers  served great frozen drinks and there was towel service  In the casino  all of the dealers  a mix of Hooters girls and regular dealers  were friendly and helpful  The casino is small  but laidback and fun and a good place to wind down the evening  Everything is decorated in bright lights and light pine and the music is always jamming  The only real complaint we had was about the restaurant  not the Hooters one    we went for brunch our second day and the service was slow and the food overpriced  I like to stay in a new place everytime I go to Vegas  but if I got a good deal here I would go back  
P =>   Loved it Loved it Loved it   My husband and I decided to make a quick trip to Las Vegas kind of spur of the moment  Got a FABULOUS rate at Hooters and thought why not  We appreciated the smallness of it all  We could make it from our bungalow room to the front door in two minutes  Some of the bigger hotels in Vegas take you    minutes to do so  Our bed was very comfortable and the room was clean and spiffy  It is a quick walk to the strip  Staff was friendly and helpful  The pool was unintimidating and relaxing  Having stayed at   other hotels on the strip  I would definitely consider staying at Hooters again  
P =>   Don t stay here if you have breathing problems The hotel and staff were all great  lots of sexy beautiful women  Room really nice  A little noisy from some ignorant guests one of the three nights  they need some signs up asking for guests to be quite at certain hours  Everywhere on the first floor stunk of cigarettes  even inside of restaurant  If hotel was non smoking would go back in a second but no where in Vegas is  will never go back to Vegas because of this reason  couldn t enjoy ourselves still choking a week later   Paid a high rate for first   nights due to Nascar but on the return got an incredible deal  
P =>   Hooters is not for party poopers Hooters is indeed a busy hotel  it was fun staying there as we got to meet new people  also have a friend who works their who tells me that once clocked in they are on the go from the start time  Hooters prices were reasonable so could not complain about that  the only thing that got my goat was the room was a bit muffy as though the sheets had not been changed in over a week apart from that I would recommend the hotel    the staff were superb  very friendly   I felt as though I d known some of them for years  
P =>   Great location and great chicken wings    This is my  th visit to Vegas and everytime i go I try stay at a different hotel  Although the building it has gone thru some serious changes I can honestly say i was not impressed  It all depends on what you are looking for  in my honest opinion and in comparison to the other hotels it looks tired and run down  As all my other reviews  as long as the bed is clean and an hot water is available I am happy and since i got a great deal thru expedia I cannot complaint  However if you are used to more formal and structured hotels and resorts I do not recommend it  Having worked in the Hotel industry it can be a bit of a shocker as there is no formal lobby  The reception area is flushed to the left and not visible as the casino floor is immediately in front of it  I figured that the check in agents would have been HOOTER girls  sadly it wasnt  far from being hooter girls  there is plenty of then in the casino but none behind the front desk   guess it would be too sexist None the less like i said the room was good size  the beds were very comfortable and the bathroom spacious   safe in the room and iron and ironing board  Never took advantage of the pool since it was too cold to enjoy outdoor activities but looked good from my bedroom window  Only complaint i have is that the housekeeper forgot to take out the trash on the first day  and the hostess of the restaurant was miserable  we got there at       pm to go for breakfast on Sun morning and she did not even look up  all she said was that the buffet was cleared and when we pointed out the info in the elevator all she said was that they were old and have not been updated  but apart her everyone else was pleasant I will recommend this place as long as you are not looking for fancy decor  fine dinning  if you are in the mood for a good burger w  fries  chicken wings and a cold beer its awesome  as long as you are willing to share the room with    yr old frat boys out to play    lol 
P =>   Good Beer  You deserve better The wings are good  the waitresses are sweet  But the owner managers should get out of the business because this place is dirty and falling appart The scoop    of the   Jacuzzis are ice cold   The third has no bubbles and a broken timer switch  Not only an electrical hazzard  but a slap in the face ALL of the pool area lounge chairs are filthy dirty with large black stains like something that came out of a dumpster  Dirty used pool towels laying all over the place  no pool attendent or anyone on site to clean up the place  Looks like a frat party took place two days earlier and no one cleaned up My advice  Don t stay here  Call in for the wings  pick em  up and run back to Motel    its cleaner M  
P =>  Bed Bug Bites at Hootters Get another hotel if you can   This Hooter hotel is dirty  Beds are over used  un sanitized  rooms are smelly  elevators don t work most of the time  I paid      a night that supposedly in the tower   they book me to this room     that has the ceiling and wall joints cracked open you can hear the room next door like without walls    days stay I got Bed Bug Bites all over my neck  arms and back  Managers employee are rude  And by the way  READ THOSE FINE PRINTS THEY ASK YOU TO SIGN  
P =>   Perfect for bachlors not for bachlorettes For my friends   th birthday we selected Hooters for the cheap price  and relaxed yet different atmosphere it advertised  However after   nights there  I was happy to return home  I selected the tower room hearing it was nicer than the free room  and it reminded me of a cheap Motel   room from the   s  The furniture mimics the Hooters resturant  with the orange lamps and official Hooters magazine on the desk with suggestively posed Hooters girls throughout it  Although advertised as Floridan style  the fake palm tree and bedspread were probably the nicest attractions in the rooms  The artwork is guy related with Hooters bar paintings and boats  Stains litter the hallway and bedroom rugs  One of my plug outlets didn t work  and although Hooters website says coffee makers are included in the room you have to request it  I requested mine   times over the course of   days    times by phone and   time at the main desk  You can hear everyone s conversations as you walk by their rooms  The ultimate kicker was that the website states the tower rooms have a view of the strip  Well mine   was the view of the airport landing strip  The plus is that Dan ino s resturant is excellent and if you want some  quot Coyete Ugly quot  dancing and drinking try out Dixie s which you will be sure to get a free admission card from the guys advertising the bar outfront in the lobby  In retrospect I can see where the hotel is a great idea for bachlor events or a guy outing  however for the girls I suggest avoiding this one  
P =>   We actually had a great time here  I was pretty skeptical of this hotel at first  partly because of the bad reviews I had seen other people write and partly because I am a    year old female who was traveling with her boyfriend and friends  BUT    This hotel is a GREAT value  I loved the atmosphere here  which is beachy  tropical and laid back  Yes  the casino is small  but I actually kind of liked that  The cocktail waitresses paid attention to me  even at the   dollar blackjack table  It s within walking distance of the MGM Grand  Excalibur and New York New York  The Owl Rewards Club we signed up for was pretty decent on the comps  We got a little orange book full of comps  but only used the   for   breakfast buffet       in free slot play  and free tickets to see The Mentalist  Not a bad place  despite it s bad rap  I d reccommend this place  
P =>   Clean and Close   Good Value The hotel is located just off the strip near MGM Grand  The room was about average  It was clean  however  it took them till    pm to get my room cleaned on Monday and they acted like this always happens  The walls are paper thin and if you get noisy neighboors it will be a problem  If you complain to the staff they will take care of it as they did with my friends that were staying on another floor  Would strongly recommend joining there rewards program  It is free and the coupons alone are worth it  We saw both shows they offer for free with the coupons and both are very good  
P =>  Disgusting   This  quot remodel quot  is       This is the most disgusting hotel i ve ever stayed at  everything was dirty the bathroom floor was really sticky  the bathtub had nasty hair in it  Also the toilet was like six inches off the floor it was made for kids  The walls are paper thin you can hear EVERYTHING your neighbor is talking about or doing  I m very disappointed  If you plan on drinking expect cheap alcohol for a expensive price  The girls also look cheap  
P =>   Pleasently Surprised Very clean  We have stayed at Hooters on         The hotels is located just a little bit on the side from the strip  It was very easy to access the strip and we walked many times during the day and night  At times when we got tired we took the bus that runs on the strip  and it stops at the Excaliber hotel which is practically across the street from Hooters  The hotel itself was great  The rooms were clean and comfortable  Our room was on the   th floor and faced the pool    very nice view compared to the views that hooters can offer  The service staff was very friendly  We arrived around     am  and a room was already ready for us  Check in didnt take more than   min  The breakfast buffet is alright  It is located in another restaurant not the Hooters one  If you get the coupon book with your  quot  hooters rewards quot  card  you pay     for   people   so you cant really expect   star meal for   dollars a person On our third morning  we didnt have a coupon to use for the buffet  but the waiter was kind enough to  quot find quot  an extra coupon in his pocket  We didn t try the restaurant for any other meals so i can not comment on that  The food at Hooters restaurant is your average american food  We went to the Mentalist show that the hotel gives you a free ticket to   well you technically pay       per drink per person  so we paid about     for the two of us for the show  The show is entertaining and we actually had a good laugh out of it too  Would recommend The casino is very small compare to other hotels  bets are low and it was enjoyable for us  We spent a lot of time there and the dealers are friendly  Overall i would stay at the hotel again  BTW  when you check out they will charge you an additional     fee for the pool  gym  and something else  So be prepared to see that on your credit card even if you book this hotel from a website  
P =>   Bugs on my face yes BUGS A now ex boyfriend took me here over the last summer  I saw multiple cockroaches crawling around outside the restaurants and rooms on property  I found multiple crickets in my room  even one crawling across my face in the morning  Two calls to room service on two different days ended in wrong information  no delivery  and wrong food  The massages were ok  as expected but the  quot spa quot  is pretty lame  The location is at least close to the strip  The rooms are very old  so do not expect much  I tell everyone I know to avoid this place  I suggest you do too unless you like lounging by the pool with the stereotypical  quot trailer trash quot  and their rude children  
P =>   Exactly What We Wanted I am still staying here at the hotel  but would like to add my   cents  We checked in on a weekday and there was no line at check in  The agent was friendly and effecient  The casino is a bit small  but we had great luck at the tables and the dealers were very friendly and helpful  Our package included two free breakfast coupons which we used at Dan inos  The menu looks like it has changed a bit from the last time we stayed  but our rib favorite was on there  Our favorite part of our trip so far has been the two massages we received at the Salon  It s small  but full service and the girls in there really make you feel welcome  We will definitely be coming back here on our next Vegas trip  The value for our dollar was exactly what we were looking for  
P =>   Great time   great price   great location We really liked Hooters  It was in a great location  pools were nice  nice atmosphere  and great breakfast  Dan ino s restaurant   
P =>  Best Sevice and Views in Vegas Wow Great hotel      we had the best service out of any hotel in vegas  the breakfast buffet is okay for the price  if you go to guest services you apply for a club card  it s free  you get a coupon book with some really good deals in it one is   for   breakfast buffet  it s okay but i wouldnt brag about it  BUT the all you can eat ribs for       is totally worth it DON T EAT THE MUFFIN THEY START YOU WITH OR YOU WONT HAVE ROOM FOR RIBS       the wings after midnight are also incredible and the hooters bar is also incredible food    the rooms are VERY clean  and all the staff are VERY friendly  the show with Jerry that plays at night is a must see and if you get that card you also get to take the show in for free yeah that s right free but go early if you want a good seat like      as the line forms early  he messed big time with my mind and we still talk about it everyday  this hotel is a great deal and it s right across the street from MGM and next to Tropicana  enjoy your stay  
P => Truly a Dump  I booked   rooms for       and   st  and I was thankful the MGM was right across the street  The place is a daycare center  nothing but early    somethings  I d been here a few years ago when it first opened and they actually were trying  now it s quite clear the management has no interest  The table games suck  most of the players have no idea how to play  so if you like at least somewhat of a semblance of a blackjack game go elsewhere     to     minimums   The maid worked hard and the waiter in ino s was friendly and efficient  Walk fast through the casino after your shower so you don t have the lingering scent of chicken wings  I m not a snob  but there are so many other places in Vegas to stay  Don t waste your time here  Delightfully tacky  yet unrefined is an understatement  this is not the cure for the common casino     the common casino is much better  The hookers don t even work this place     
P =>   You get what you pay for  I guess you get what you pay for with Hooters  I paid    dollars a night  plus a   dollar  resort fee  for parking which I didn t use becuase I used Public Transportation  and a pool that wasn t even open  But coming from New England that is penuts compared to what Hotels cost around here   so I m not complaining about that  My complaint is with the whole  quot Vegas Strip quot  in general  much prefer the Downtown Area over the  quot Strip quot   and will be staying downtown next time at either Binions  Golden Gate  Fitzeralds  Golden Nugget  Four Queens Etc  all which were excellent  But do stay stay away from El Cortez  it is as shady as the reviews say  Downtown is much more friendly to people who are on some type of budgets  I was able to find decent Poker and Craps games in comfortable atmosphere s at the above mentioned Casinos on Fremont St  Also the people are more friendly all around  and there is a great cigar shop  souviener shops  and plenty of excitement in a safe atmosphere on Fremont St   As for Hooters  I will not be staying there again  it was just too mediocre for all the great places in Vegas  there are much better places than Hooters even for the budget minded traveler  
P =>   Cheesier Than Cheez Its I was within a hundred yards of this hotel  Hooters  Las Vegas  and knew I had made a huge mistake by booking two nights here on a business trip  The place is run down  poorly maintained and filthy  They must have layed off there maintenance and housekeeping staff  The place looked like it hdn t been painted in    years  cheesy orange chipped paint all over the place with a drab gray paint on the building  Rotting wood and elevators that had graffiti and smelled awful  All of this before I ever got in the place  The check in staff are all kids with major attitudes  Going to my non smoking room I found black grease in the sink and tub  The shower still had pubic hair in there from the previous guests  I found out why  it was because of the poor drainage in the tub itself  A    minute shower left me with water up over my ankles  The towels all smelled like cigarette smoke and the blanket under the comforter had dried blood on it  My room had a locked connecting door to a second room in it and I spent my first night listening to a couple getting it on through paper thin walls  I ordered a Philly Cheese steak sandwich at the Hooters Bar and it gave me food poisioning  Need I say more    Oh  their      free play money was also a joke   you can only use your      on pre selected    slot machines and you cant win money unless you earn       points  then you get     bucks  Save yourself some anguish  dont stay at this place   there s only so far you can rest on a trademark of girls in skimpy low class outfits  
P =>   Good location and good price I had read a lot of bad reviews so I was a little afraid but went there with an open heart  We had booked the cheapest category but got upgraded directly to Ocean view which I guess is the best category We got a quite large double room with a great view of some of the large hotels at the strip  The beds were comfortable and especially the pillows  The room and the hallways are a little worn down but not that much that I thought about it The casino is small but okay for just hanging out a bit before hitting the strip  The location is really super  very close to the airport   a cab takes   min and costs like    dollars  Walking from the hotel you are on the strip in   minutes  inside MGM in   minutes and it is also located just by a small supermarket if you need to buy sodas or stuff We paid    dollars a night and for that price it is a supergood value  
P =>   Sedsy s Hooters Review We had been discussing going to Vegas for a while and I somehow managed to find a cracking return flight and hotel package To keep costs down we decided to stay at hooters hotel as they gave us the  th night for free I waited all year to go on the trip to Vegas and in terms of my expectations to be honest I was expecting to simply sleep at Hooters and not really do anything else there  I didnt expect anything from this place at all  maybe it was unfair to jugde before I got there  After a Long and mingin flight  when the plane finally landed at the airport you could see the hotel which certainly didnt look to impressive due to the fact you have the monster of the MGM Grand directly behind it  But the look form the outside should not be taken into account as it is inside where the Hotel really impressed me and was well beyond my expectations when I booked The Main floor has a decent sized Casino complete with Roulette  craps  Blackjack  poker and good selection of Slots to gamble    months worth of savings away  GET IN The rooms are clean i d probly compare them to a Travel Inn or Travelodge or similar back in the UK  The rooms are themed in a tropical style with a good selection of TV channels  a good sized bathroom with powerful shower  a electronic safe  crucial so you dont take your full wedge out with you and blow it on Black on the roulette  The only downside was our view as we got the airport  but to be honest it wasnt load enough to wake you as the airport seems busier in the day anyway  but if you are a plane spotter this room would be great for you But again I didnt go Vegas to look out me room and admire the view  i went up the stratosphere for that The hotel has a good sized pool area with an outdoor pool bar  The food and drink facilities were also better than expected here with A Dan inos Restaurant  a hooters and a couple of bars including the notorious dixies country bar with its    Bud light drafts and free for birds between     pm wednesday and thursday If you are going to vegas on budget I would certainly recommend this Hotel  it offers a good room in a good location to access the Strip and others hotels  I certainly would stay here again in the future  If you are going with a group of lads or a younger crowd of people this would be a great place to stay  I ve stayed in plenty of hotels in different places in america and Europe and I have certainly stayed in worse places and paid more for the pleasure  
P =>   Loved Hooters I recently stayed at the Hooters Hotel and Casino the first week in ember  I was with my spouse and   other couples  We have stayed there in the past when the property was the San Remo  and found it to be convenient and nice place to stay and we like the location  so we thought we d give Hooters a try  We were very impressed with the  quot makeover quot  to the casino  lobby  and bar and restaurant and pool areas  The place was filled with  quot regular quot  people like us  in Vegas for the National Finals Rodeo and enjoying this small casino and hotel on a  quot budget  All of the staff and dealers that we met were extremely friendly and the whole place was very comfortable  late at night the casino was busy  but not too crowded  and they played great music  and you could also see great live bands in the Dixie Bar without paying a cover  The rooms were clean and refurbished  and the beds were extremely comfortable   everyone in our group commented on that  We all had rooms in the Tower areas  There were only a few things which I would consider needing improvement  The carpet in the halls and rooms was not  quot new quot  but had been cleaned  but showed it s age  The doorways had some paint chipping and general scuffs here and there in the rooms  but nothing bad where we stayed  The prices have gone up some for food and drinks  since the San Remo days  but so has every place in Vegas  Hooters is still a VERY economical and convenient place to stay  It doesn t take you an hour to get to and from your room  or to make your rounds through the casino to find your friends  The drinks were very good  actually WITH alcohol in them   unlike some  quot big quot  casinos serve  and the pool area was nice and cozy with a hot tub and a fire pit with benches around it  This place is NOT the MGM or the Bellagio  but it s comfortable  and fun  We all said that we would definitely stay there again  it fit the bill for us perfectly  
P =>  Great Low Budget Experience Once again  my girl and I pack up the car  leave the kid at grandma s house  drop the top on the Eclipse and head for Sin City  This was a pure mental health trip as we both needed a break from work and kids and you name it  Las Vegas has a good way of balancing things out for us  This trip however  presented a new challenge for us Vegas on a budget  Cash was a little tight for this trip  so we split gas with some friends and found a killer deal on a hotel  Hooters Hotel and casino presented the perfect opportunity  As travel professionals  we managed to get the room at half the usual weekend rate  That brought the price down to         for the weekend  can t argue with that  The d cor at the hotel can most readily be described as a type of  Spring Break  atmosphere  Amidst the gambling tables and machines is a very welcoming beach atmosphere complete with decorative surfboards  grass skirt style paneling on the walls  palm trees and a beach concert style stage with dance floor  Not particularly incredible to look at  as compared to neighboring hotels  but not bad at all  For the money we paid as well as the money they asked for  I d say it was well worth it  Of course there were the  Hooters girls  walking around in their tank tops and short shorts  but all done very tastefully  nothing scandalous  That surprised me a bit  I though Hooters in Las Vegas would be way over the top on the T  amp  A scale  but it was very low key and subtle  There s still plenty of flesh to feast your eyes on if that s what you re after  The rooms were really interesting  The presentation itself follows the rest on the hotel in that Spring Break feel  They re very warm and basic  giving the feel of a beach house with bamboo trim on the walls and a hardened wicker cabinet for the TV  The bathroom was standard size  nothing special  however they do provide perhaps the best hotel soap I ve ever used  It didn t leave your skin felling strange at all  very soft  Everything else about the room was great  No bad smells  everything was clean as a whistle  plenty of toiletry items and not a bad view of the pool area   The elevators may be a little scary for you claustrophobics out there  They were very tight and a little shaky  no big deal though  My girl got a little worried   We re not going to fall are we   She s a crack up  The restaurants were pretty good  Nothing fancy  just what you might expect from a building with the Hooters logo all over it  nice bar and grill atmosphere  The food was really good and moderately priced  The thing that sticks out most in my mind was the fact that their restaurant was open all night  This was perfect after it was too late to venture out and things were closing up  It would have been a long walk from where Hooters is to get to our favorite eateries  Having a    hour spot at the hotel that didn t cost and arm and a leg came in handy more than once  This may have been the perfect place to have a low budget Vegas trip without sacrificing the action of being on the strip  Hooters still boasted an on strip location making things accessible  We had a lovely time without breaking the bank and we didn t have to stay in a dump either  I d certainly recommend Hooters for anyone looking to do Vegas on a modest budget and still be close enough to the action to not have to drive everywhere  
P =>  Great Location and Inexpensive Stayed for four weeknights at the Hooters Casino Hotel in Las Vegas in the bungalows which is what we asked for  The location is great  one block from the strip  MGM and the walkovers to NY NY and Excaliber  The rooms are small but clean  housekeeping staff is very nice  Had one small maintenance issue and they came in    minutes to fix it  Parking there is easier than most of the very large hotels  Pools are very nice too  If you want luxury like Bellagio or Wynn  this is not the place for you  We get up around    or    and stay out till midnight or later so as long as the room is clean and fairly comfortable we are fine with it  Would have liked another chair beside the one in the room and maybe a small table  but not complaining  We had a king size bed and it was very comfortable  Had the breakfast in Dan inos one morning that came with our package  It wasn t the greatest but for comp  it was just fine  We ate the    cent wings after midnight one night in Dan ino s and that was just fine too  There was never any line at the front desk if we needed anything  Heard horror stories at some of the others just about trying to check in at the huge places  I work at a hotel in a resort area and a     room place would be considered large but for Vegas  it is small  Makes it more intimate They charge for wireless internet  but we were on vacation and didn t use it  but most of the other more expensive places charge for this too  It would have been nice and some hotels do this even though they charge for internet access  they let you print up your boarding passes free  Hooters didn t so I paid the       and the girl in their gift shop was very nice in helping me with the computer to print it out  
P =>  My last time staying here Stayed in this hotel over Thanksgiving and I took advantage of some of the freebies they had offered  ie free breakfast buffet for   and          free slot play  Me and my wife ate at the buffet the first morning using the free coupon  it was ok but we could not see going back the next day and spending       a person on that buffet  It was a combination of ready to serve quick heat food and dry danishes  I have stayed at a rott hotel and the  quot free quot  breakfast there was much better  The elevators going to the garages were filthy  We didnt even try to eat in the Hooters Restaurant there becouse the last time we were there earlier this summer the service was extremely poor  The second morning we were there the maids were out in the hall in the early morning cleaning the rooms  We left and got back around  pm and discovered our room wasnt even cleaned  I had to go to the desk  wait in line    mins and complain about it  An hour later   maids showed up to clean the room  Bottom line        this is a dated hotel that the Hooters Corp has bought  threw some surfboards in the hall and decorated in wood  Ive been here twice and the service has been poor  My advice is take your money and for about the same price     usually less   stay down the road in the Orleans  I will never go back to the Hooters Hotel in Las Vegas and will recommend the same to my family and friends  
P =>  Hooters      Dixies draught   Can t complain So  a group of us booked a trip to Hooters in uary     months down  and we hit Vegas  Hooters of all places  I thought all a long this deal is too good to be true  and Hooters is going to be a let down  I read some pretty poor reviews  and expectations where certainly not high  But all I wanted was a roof over my head  a clean room  and some reasonable food and service Firstly the location  I knew it was near to the MGM grand  which is huge  but right on the strip  You are literally   minutes walk away from the main strip and have good access to New York New York  MGM  Excalibur and many more hotels  It cost us just     from the Airport to the Hotel  and you can see it as you land Secondly  the staff      of the time great  Everyone was very friendly  and more so with it being Thanks Giving  I find some of the reviews people left saying the staff where moody and bad is probably a reflection on the reviewers personality  The staff where great with me and my friends  always a good morning  and always offering assistance  There was the odd one who was a bit moody  but you get that everywhere  Also on the staff  the Hooters girls got progressively better as the week went on  The girls in Dixies where just phenomenal to look at  and again  very friendly  Food and Drink was very well placed  like it was in most of Vegas     for American beers  and    draught at night in Dixies is great value  Even with the weak pound to dollar  We ate in the Hooters restaurant one night  and again  service was great  and the food very good The room was much more than I expected  We had clean towels every day  a reasonable selection of TV  and it was clean and tidy  Some people must have got a dodgey room  because mine was spot on the mark  If I had one complaint is that you get a       of what your view is  One side is the strip  one side is Motel   and the Airfield  Shame that  but did you come to Vegas to look out your window  No  the real reason we went to Vegas was to gamble  And while you want to big it up in the big casino s  Hooters is a great place to start and end the night  And as said earlier  the location is spot on near the strip  and near the monorail stations into the middle of the strip also Overall  did I expect a lot  No  Did it go beyond the expectations  Yes I would have no problem recommending Hooters to friends  and I would have no problem staying myself their again  The only reason I wouldn t is so that I could see the rest of the fine hotels in Vegas  but when I return if I don t stay at Hooters  I will certainly pay a visit  
P =>   I just can t reccomend this place We usually stay at some simple place to save money for other things on our trip  My motto is safe and clean and I am happy  I want to say this was the case here  but can t  The room was smoking even though we asked for nonsmoking  The tub faucets fell off all the time and the room was at best tiddied up like a    year old tidy s his room when forced  The hallways weres simply dirty and the elevaters worked only slowly and sometimes  The pluses were it was super close to the strip and other than not being RIGHT ON the strip was super convenient  Being smaller  parking was a breeze and getting to our room took under   minutes comparesd to a half hour at some of the big places  Staff were polite and our room for the most part was quiet  In the end though i just can t reccomend it  With all the choices there  you can either stay a bit off the strip and save money for nicer rooms  no big deal if you have a car  or pay maybe    to    dolllars more a night  things are very competitive now with the market in Vegas  and stay at nicer place on the strip  We dresssed up to go out and felt a bit like freaks going through the casino to the car  It is a very simple casion with casual people  A suit and cocktail dress couple walking through here really stand out  
P =>   Good hotel we had a nice stay here  We stayed here   nights at the end of ober  Room was big and clean  They gave us clean towels every day and changed the sheets once  The hotel and casino is layed back and there is a lot to do  On certain days ladies drink for free from about     pm in the Dixie bar  You have to take the      gameplay you receive with a grain of salt  of course you re not going to win on those machines in the roped off area but hey  just have fun with it for    minutes right Unlike the comment further below  the girls were curvy enough for us and they were all dressed up during halloween  We did not run into any rude staff members at all  everyone was friendly  
P =>   Not Too Shabby    Ladies and i went to HOOTERS hotel for a quick cheap Vegas getaway  The Hotel was okay  Obviously an older hotal that was re vamped with tropical decor If you are looking for Clean  Neat and fancy  this isn t the place for you  Bar stools were broken  bathroom counters were stained  the drian in the shower backed up  Other than the above it was pretty decent  After all  it s just a place to sleep after a long day on the strip We had a Bungalo which is the way to go if you are there in the warmer months  It backs up directly to the pool  Music at the pool turns on around       which can be annoying If you are looking for CHEAP  and EASY   Go for HOOTERS  
P =>   Thought Hooters was supposed to have women  I stayed at the Hooters Hotel and Casino for the Hooters experience that I get at my neighborhood Hooters  The majority of the Hooters girl here are frail thin with no curves at all except for the ones that have obviously gone under the knife  Not sure but most of the girls don t look old enough to be working in the casino or serving drinks  No curves at this Hooters  Very disappointing  
P =>   Hooters was truly Fantastic My wife and I stayed for    nights recently on our first visit to Vegas from the UK  We were amazed after reading some bad reviews at how fantastic the hotel was  The room was very clean and spacious and the bed was enormous  It was ideally placed both near the airport      in a taxi  and also in walking distance of the strip  While the      free slot play is limited to the promotional machines  only a jackpot win pays  we took advantage of the free show and saw the  Mentalist  Gerry McCambridge  What a fantastic show and completely free  no catches  The pool area was extremely clean and very relaxing  my wife especially enjoyed the hot tubs  The staff were very friendly and we ate in the Hooters restaurant a number of times  on each visit the food and service were excellent  On our last night we paid for a picture with the Hooters girls from the restaurant photographer and she very generously gave us two pictures for the price of one  A tip for others  the Excalibour Hotel offers time share tours with some excellant prizes just for going  We spent   hours  yes I know  but as we were there for    days it didn t matter really  listening to a woman talk with no intention of buying  At the end we got free Lance Burton tickets  tax had to be paid on them  and   x     vouchers for food gambling at the Mandalay Bay  The Luxor  The Excalibour  The MGM Grand or The Mirage  If you can afford to lose a morning and know how to just say  quot no thank you quot  then I would highly recommend it  we had three excellent meals and made a profit on our gambling   
P =>   Great room great staff and great surroundings I stayed at the Hooters and being a travel agent  I hear a lot of positives and negatives about many hotels  I personally stayed in the Hooters and would recommend it to anyone  The staff are super nice and friendly  The beds were comfy and the room was spacious  The best thing and a lot of people notice this  it dosen t take    minutes to walk from the front door to the rooms  the casino isn t huge so there isn t a lot to walk through I look forward to my next stay at the Hooters  
P =>   very good got a       per night rate  It really was a good room  I thought it was clean and the bed was very comfortable  The place was very quiet at night  it is close to the airport so there was take off and landing noise during the day but no airport noise at night  The casino is fun  The pool area is nice  We would stay here again  
P =>   Pleasant stay Not awful Not Excellent I recently stayed at the Hooters casino hotel  Was a bit apprehensive at first after reading all the negative reviews bu booked through priceline so it was take it or lose out Thankfully I was suprised when I got to my room in the tower was a spacious twin room plenty of room and most importantly clean  didnt see any of the dirt othes mentioned The pool was great but did tend to get crowded sometimes and I wouldn t like to be in the bungalows with the music on from dawn till dusk  could only slightly hear it in the towers Found th staff friendly enough but didnt really have loads of dealings with them so cant say how they would have handled any complaints Oh and the shampoo and conditioner smells really lovely Its in a good location only a short walk from the tropicana and MGM  the walks prob less than getting out of some casinos from your roomFor the money they charge you get what you pay so dont go in expecting some swanky hotel  
P =>   Brilliant time at Hooters We decided to stop at Hooters as last year some of the party that we went Vegas with stopped there and really enjoyed it I can honestly say that i didn t have a problem with the hotel at all The location was great the room was large and spacious and had the most comfortable bed I ve ever slept in  The pool was also great Its location at the southern end of the strip was really handy and considering the price of some of the hotels in the vicinity it was really good value for money The main benefit though was the size of the hotel it was not too big I ve been to other hotels in Vegas and it takes ages to get to the room We had a brilliant time and would definately stop again next time we re in Sin City The only compliants i can make are the dirty carpets in the corridors and Dan inos wasn t the best but who cares Vegas is full of restaurants  
P =>   You get what you pay for We stayed at Hooters in tember       Had booked the bungalow category by the poolside which had some downsides but then  on the other hand  was really cheap  I guess you get what you pay for  The room was clean  however  the carpets in the bungalow part of Hooters were horrible   both on the corridors and in the room  Dirty and smelly  Another downside was that there was no fridge in our room  We did  however  really like the pool are  Had great fun at the casino  too and enjoyed the restaurant  Service was good  It is very close to the strip but a real budget alternative if you do not want to pay the prices for the big hotels on the strip  Overall  I can recommend this place  You might not want to chose the bungalow category though     
P =>   Three Nights at Hooters Las Vegas I arrived at Hooters at  am  but was not allowed to check in until  pm  This is a somewhat small hotel in Vegas standards  so do not plan for an early check in The casino is rather small  but the hotel is in a nice location being near to MGM Grand  New York New York  Tropicana and Excaliber The hallways are dark with old stains on the carpeting  But the rooms are decent  clean and lively with the Hooter s orange decorated interior  Not too many outlets for portable radios and charging for cell phones  The bed was very very comfortable  The floor was very quiet  Housekeeping service efficient Hooter s restaurant was great with the best chicken wings Cocktail servers were great and Hooters has the best spicy Bloody ys  The S A S S  spa was great  I highly recommend either massese  Danielle or Lora  They both have different techniques but Lora was rather rough with the shoulder massage  I would recommend Danielle There s no TV checkout  so plan on going to the front desk to handle that Hooters is near McCarran  so I would suggest that visitors cab it instead of using an airport shuttle  
P =>   Fun place to Play but not to Stay I was comped   nights based on some play I had done earlier in the month  I played for     hours or so and only earned about     points yet they still sent an offer  which is nice I was given room     in Bay View tower  which is the older tower  I was walking down the hallway realizing my room was at the very end  I thought  quot hey  they must have given me a suite   quot   No such luck  In fact  I m sure I had one of the worst rooms in the hotel  I enjoyed a lovely view of a large AC unit  parking lot and the Motel   across the street  in that order   lol It s true the bungalow rooms are run down  more like a basic motel but the beds are very comfy pillowtops and they do have    hour a day room service B          L         D         per item   There is a small balconey too which is nice  I watched planes land at McCarran for awhile while enjoying a drink  Oh  the sheets and towels were stained with what looked like coffee  A nicer hotel wouldn t put out stained linens To be fair  the hotel isn t part of Hooters  it is run by another company  I think it is the same one that runs Sam s Town as they use the same toiletries  They also run Saddle West in Pahrump  NV  which I have stayed at several times Also  the walls are very thin  I was woken at  am by the couple next door having an argument  I would usually enjoy hearing a couple fight but not at that time of day night  Hooters restaurant serves good grub at OK prices  It s nothing fancy but the portions are large and tasty  and they bring you drink refills without you even having to ask The casino was fun  I didn t make money but hit enough good bonus rounds to play for a few hours and drink the free Michelobs  Drink service is very good here I got a comp ticket to see Gerry McCambridge  The Mentalist  What a joke  I left after    mins  Don t waste your money  Wait til  pm and see Bobby Slayton instead  You know you re in trouble when the guy has to ask for applause  Funny  most of the audience was really into it  be they ve never seen a real Vegas show before  This wasn t it Bottom Line  I ve stayed at The Orleans  Bally s and Main Street Station in the past year  I would recommend any of them waaay before I would rec Hooters  even if it cost a little more  Hooters is fine if you re counting every dollar my type room goes for as low as     sometimes but for a little extra  you get a much nicer room at one of those properties  Stay in the Ocean View rooms  which is the new tower if you can  It costs more but I m sure it s worth it  
P =>  We had a great time  Read some of the reviews and I was frightened at first but after staying there  I would definitely stay there again  We stayed at the Ocean View  the room was clean and spacious  The beds were super comfy  had the best sleep after a long night  For the price I got it for  it was a great steal Not on the strip  but close enough  Didn t mind the walk at all plus the monorail is just across the street which was very convenient  Sure  you can stay at a better hotel for a higher price like the MGM  but hooters is perfect for the laid back mid     to     s who don t mind a fun crowd  Plus  when you are in Vegas  don t waste your time in your hotel  get up  use the pool  walk around the strip and have fun at the other casinos which are everywhere Overall a two thumbs up    
P =>   Great for some but not everyone  Overall my stay at hooters was what I expected Don t think of this hotel and casino as part of the strip  Because its not  Don t think of this hotel and casino as luxury  or high end  because its not However  its not all bad  The hotel has very friendly service  The casino games were easier to win at oppose to others on the strip  and the hotel rooms were spacious and clean  Not to mention  the beds were phenominal   The location and price can t be beat either The pool was great  the entertainment was good  and the hooter girls are dressed just as approriately as most of the other casinos  The hotel is showing its age  and is in need of another renovation  In summary  If you are the traveller who doesn t mind staying at a motel   or the type who won t be spending any time at the hotel    Hooters is perfect for you If you are the traveller who has high expectations  wants to be impressed  and or pampered  don t be fooled by Hooters marketing  its not for you  Stay at one of the major players across the street  
P =>   Fantasic I was a little worried about staying due to the odd review and the price I payed to stay here  on the hooters website it averaged     for both of us a night      but from the moment i arrived it was just fantastic   We stayed here and later on at the Luxor and ok the room wasn t as fancy  we had a suite at the luxor   but it was clean and right next to the pool  Only one bad point no fridge and ok there was a chipped tile in the bathroom and the hall carpet has seen its best   but who the hell cares about a chipped tile   the luxor had them too    and I wasn t sleeping in the hall   The pool was great fun   but not       s    and i liked the fact there wasnt      kids annoying you all the time  to be honest i prefered the pool to the one at the Luxor   The food was brilliant and a sensible price  as were the drinks The hooters girls service was great and there are increadibly friendly  It just had a friendly  personal feel that the other casinos didnt have  Its right next to the strip and is      better value for money   We stayed at both as we wanted to experience more than one hotel   and it was broken up by a night at the canyon  but when we go back to vegas I d pick Hooters over the Luxor every time   the value was brilliant and I d rather spend my money on other things than a room I spend no time in at all really  Overall Fab     
P =>  Hooters   give them a chance   A quick review of our   nights at Hooters  We stayed   nights in late y in a total of   rooms     people  Everyone had a great time  We were upgraded from the bungalo room we d booked to a tower room at no charge   just for asking  The front desk folks were friendly and fast to check us in  The casino hotel itself is a remodeled older place  but clean enough  To make a fair comparison to other places to stay  you must factor in price  We paid about     a night and expedia gave us a     gas card for staying   nights  The rooms were spacious and clean  Beds and restroom were perfectly acceptable  The pool was large and had a fun atmosphere going on  We did join the players club and   of the   of us actually won     for the free slot play  People complaining about some free gambling crack me up  Do you think everybody wins     of the   of us that used the  nd offer of     in match play for table games won also  If you are a Bud Light drinker like me they provide the tall aluminum bottles when you are gambling   And when I arrived home  there was an email offering a free   night stay to come back  I d recommend avoiding the midnight      wings they were not good at all  You won t get the level of luxury at a lot of hotel   casinos in Vegas  but if you want to spend your money sightseeing and gambling instead of paying          a night for a hotel room   stay at Hooters 
P =>  A good deal A great hotel for the price  We paid just     per night and got a     gas card from Expedia com making the total cost for   nights just      When we arrived we were given a room upgrade without asking   which I figure happens often because there are only about a dozen of these rooms and once they fill they start upgrading  My advice is to book the cheapest room and roll the dice and test your luck to see if you get the upgrade  The room is better than you would expect for the price  but not necessarily the best  Those that don t spend much time in their room or have relatively low expectations will LOVE this steal of a hotel  Hotel snobs should look elsewhere  Also  skip the breakfast buffet which was sub par  You can get much better food elsewhere for the same cost  Play the    cent video poker blackjack at the bar at the back of the casino  You ll get constant complementary drinks while you play and the beer there is kept at a chill    degrees  Delicious  
P =>  Weekend in Vegas I was heading to Vegas to meet up with friends and see a couple concerts over the weekend  I had been in this hotel previously when it was called the San Remo  The Hooters is located across the street from the MGM Grand where my concert was that weekend  The hotel is a typical one  has the pool scene  band playing and of course gambling  I was in a room poolside that from first guess you d think would be too loud but there is a barrier between the rooms and pool so it wasn t that bad  The room was fine  nothing special and was clean enough  I chose it mainly for price as it was under a      a night and it wasn t a rundown out of the way location  
P =>  Great Time at Hooters I was a little reluctant to stay at Hooters but we could not pass up the good rates  It is in a good location and is close to the strip  It takes less than five minutes to walk The rooms are decent for the price and are clean  The hallways look like they could use some remodeling  We loved the casino and had a great time  The staff were friendly and service was great  There were only   or   that acted as though you were bothering them  The tables are cheap and during the day you will find       tables  We did not go swimming but we did walk out to the pool  It looks nice and has a tiki bar Besides sight seeing we stayed mostly at this casino to gamble  And we are definitely going to stay here again  If this helps at all we are a married couple  I am    and my husband is     My husband loved Hooters as well  Especially the Hooters Girls  lol 
P =>   Best suite in Vegas Period    We stayed at Hooters because they were only     night during the week  We were put in a standard room overlooking the dumpster and the strip   All night the A C was rattling and the people picking up trash were very disturbing  We complained in the morning and were upgraded for the rest of our stay to the most amazing suite I have ever seen   It was two rooms  two full massive bathrooms  a fridge  kitchen couch in the living room  two seperate balconies  excessively clean and massive flat screen tv  I can not say enough about how impressive the suite was  I have seen lots of suites in vegas and this is by FAR the nicest  The comedian Bobby Slayton is absolutely hilarious and a great deal since we got free tickets thrown in with our room rate  although if you are sensitive about race  sex  creed  etc  you will hate him  The pool area is very nice and comfortable  Although they charge for the weight room  it was very nice and after asking nicely we got them to let us use it without charge  it is amazing what these people will do for you if you just say please and smile  All people who worked here were very friendly and accomodating  I highly recomend this resort for anyone who is willing to walk take cab for food and entertainment  
P =>  A Good Choice Readers  the Hooters Hotel amp Casino is a good  inexpensive alternative to the overpriced Strip properties  My visit was the weekend of       e        I traveled alone  for a reunion and retirement ceremonies for my military unit The price was      per night for the two weekend nights  For the location  this was a very good price  Hooters is about     yards from the busiest intersection in Las Vegas  where the Strip intersects Tropicana Blvd  Walking was easy from one property to another  there are pedestrian walkways above the street  for all four possible street crossings  I did not use the     bill trick  because the room did not matter   Remember  when you do tip the desk clerk at check in  be ready to ask for what you want   quot Pool View quot    quot Quiet Room quot    quot Strip View quot  or  quot Upgrade quot  are the common requests  here My room was in the taller  Ocean Tower    th floor  The window faced the Strip Tropicana intersection  This made for a fabulous view  I left the drapes open all night  so that I could see the Strip at any time  The view was clear enough to read the signs and watch the Manhattan Express roller coaster at the New York  New York Hotel The room was fine  It was a major upgrade from similar rooms when the hotel was the San Remo  It had a tropical  Florida   motif  and solid wood accents were throughout the room  The AC was fine  the bed was king sized  and the bathroom was fine The small casino was always active  and there were always plenty of orange shorts around  The table games are tighter than you can get elsewhere  WARNING  think twice before accepting the  quot Free      in Slot Play quot   You may have to stand in a long line to play a specific machine  The people in line looked like they were suffering  and those at the machines seemed to be just  quot getting it over with quot  There were constant elevator problems  Only one lift was available for the entire Ocean Tower  When this is the case  the hotel should open the stairs doors  so the more fit patrons can move quickly  Don t lose your precious Vegas time waiting for a lift The parking garage is nice  and Valet was quick only used once   I was confused about breakfast options  it wasn t until I got home that I found out that ino s had a breakfast buffet  I m sure I missed it somewhere in the Services booklet  but it needs to be posted prominently  ino s is a steakhouse  a guest will not immediately assume that there is breakfast there  I always left in the mornings There is a naughty girl vibe about the Hooters  Surprisingly  a large percentage of the clientele is young females  who seem to enjoy the  quot I am allowed to dress like this  here quot  idea  This is not for me  To me  it is about table games Personally  I prefer the downtown hotels  They are all adjacent  and the canopy protects walkers from the heat  The  Q is larger and cleaner  at about     of the price  I invite readers to read my reviews of Golden Gate and ElCortez  which are two of my favorites  I wouldn t mind returning to the Hooters  but there are other choices Contact me at      with  quot Las Vegas quot  in the subject line  if you want to ask questions about Hooters or Las Vegas Gene Padgett Starkville  MS 
P =>  You get what you paty for This is a great place to go   if its you and the boys    and you are happy with staying in a howard johnson days inn type property  The hotel is NOTHING fancy and neither are the rooms  The place is not the cleanest   but it was disgusting either  If your the type of person who sees a drink stains on the carpet  in the corridors of the hotel and get grossed out   this isnt the place for you  Not the kind of place I would bring my girlfriend too   but for a guys bachelor party its was ok  The best thing about this property is the location  You cant beat it for the price  Theres a nice breakfest place next door thats good and cheap   coco s  and the MgM grand is across the street  Vegas has a way of getting lots of money out of your pocket   whether it be gambling  partying  or just doing the different tours and shows   So If i was going back with a few guys   I would come back here   with my girl   the Mgm grand is nice and I hear the price is reasonable As most people in vegas   we spent very little time in the room sleeping  So for the     hours a night your gonna spend in the room its fine  If you want something really nice    try the Ceasars palace   but dont complain about paying        per night Remember    you get what you pay for  
P =>   Tattoo City   My husband and I were the only ones in the property without tattoos for sure  The clients were a little low rent but there were plenty of great things about the place   Quick walk to MGM  Excalibur etc  Great rate  we paid around     a night and I have paid more  a lot more for less value The room was spacious and the bed VERY comfortable and the pillows soft and not the usual hotel rock hard  Our floor was very quiet  maybe because we were in the non smoking section The air conditioner was a little noisy but actually helped put me to sleep as it runs       The casino was small enough that I could find me husband without too much trouble  and I liked that   The cocktail waitresses were very pretty and came around all of the time not like a lot of places  Overall a great deal and a nice room  
P =>   Enjoyed staying at Hooters This was my third trip to Las Vegas and my first time staying a bit off the strip  previous stays were at Flamingo and Ballys   We booked a Sat Mon stay on Memorial Day weekend for around       For this price  we found Hooters was a very good value for the money  If you are looking for a   star hotel with fancy rooms  this is not your place  However  if you are looking a no frills hotel with a laid back  casual atmosphere  then this is your place  
P =>   loved the place    The Hooters Las vegas is great  I saw some of the reviews   amp  I don t know what people are looking for in a vegas hotel for this price  the venetian      The front desk crew was professional  checked me early  gave me a free upgread without even asking the room was big  clean  very comfortable  everything worked  when I needed helf with my internet connction  the man showed up after few minutes and did a great job the atmosphere in the hotel is young  relexed  even cozy comparing to the big hotels in vegas no miles to walk  and   different towers loved it I was planing to stay   night I stayed    
P =>   Couldn t ask for anything more  Finally arrived at Hooter s after an horrendous    hour journey from the UK with Delta  will not use them again   totally exhausted  I was travelling with my cousin for a friends wedding the following day  Before arriving I was slightly concerned reading some of the previous reviews but there was no need to be worried  We checked in about  am with no problems whatsoever  The elevator hall ways were clean and had a very clean smell about them  I was dreading getting a terrible room as this would have just put the icing on the cake for us after an horrific journey but the room was way above our expectations  A huge room with   queen beds two tables separate dressing table with well lit mirror  very large closet and tv  The bathroom was a very good size too  Everywhere appeared spotlessly clean  The best part was actually getting into the most comfiest bed I have slept in  We were on the second floor of the Ocean Tower which had a pool view  this was blocked partially as we were on a low floor but that didn t matter one bit as we were hardly in the room during the day anyway  We had no problems with hearing noise from adjoining rooms Once we had caught up on a couple of hours sleep we ventured downstairs for a look around  there was a small but cozy pool area with a pool bar  A  Bait  shop selling souvenirs  drinks and snacks etc  there was two bars in the casino and three restaurants  obviously one was a Hooters    we tried out the Dan ino s Restaurant for breakfast which was delicious  good selection for a good price  especially the buffet for just under      unfortunately I never got to go to Hooters as the queue was always so long All of the staff were EXTREMELY helpful and friendly  we wanted to spend a day shopping and enquired about buses and taxis to various places  after chatting with two of the bell hops  I didn t get there names unfortunately  we ended up hiring a car for the day which prob saved us a fortune in fares and a lot of time so meant we could do more shopping   We were picked up right outside the front entrance by the car hire company and taken to their depot where our  economy car  was waiting for us  I was expecting a very small car but it was a huge Chrysler Sebring so I guess we were upgraded  We also booked tickets to see  an evening at Le Cage  a show at the riviera  we were able to do this throught the hotel and again the guy  an oldish gentleman  was very helpful and advised us of timings and stuff to make sure we got the best seats The location of hooters is perfect  it s literally a   min walk from the strip  it s right opposite the MGM which also has a monorail stop so handy for that as well The only fault I could find was that the ice machine wasn t working on our floor so we had to use the one upstairs but I would hardly say that s a problem or inconvenience  People have complained on here about not getting towels or bedding changed  there are little cards in the room explaining about helping save the environment and only having the bed changed if you really needed it  if you did all you had to do was place the card on the bed and they would do this  as quite a  green  person myself I was quite happy with this  The pool area got very very busy with the younger crowd on a weekend with a live DJ playing very live music so not ideal if you are wanting a relaxing sunbathe This was my fifth visit to vegas and i ve stayed in different places each time  this is definitely one of the best values for money  Some friends were staying at the bellagio and we went to see there room and to be honest it wasn t all that it s cracked up to be  for what they paid I would have expected a lot more  and there was a really bad smell in the corridors  I would definitely stay at Hooters again  it s not a huge hotel and only has a small casino  but this makes it a lot more enjoyable and friendly  
P =>   Awesome Price for such a Good Location  I believe this is one of the best properties for the price and location in las vegas it is directly accross from The MGM Grand   Although it is not directly on the strip it might as well be you can be at the MGM grand in less than a   minute walk  From there you can catch the monorail all the way up and down the strip  Pete s Poker is also not a bad little place to play some cards there is usually only about   or   tables running but the dealers are great and the company is better  
P =>  no frills hotel great value very close to Strip Stayed at this hotel at the start of e  Weather was very hot  the airconditioning  if a little loud  kept the room cool  Hooters is within  mins walk of the Strip  just past Tropicana Swift taxi ride from airport  about      Checkin efficent  No problems  Stayed in one of the rooms in the  Bungelow  section  Arrived Saturday afternoon  and the pool party was in full swing  Plenty of    somethings around the pool with the music at full volume  that was the only day  to be fair  it was like that  the rest of the week was ok  the room was large and comfortable  sure  it wasn t the  wynn   but i wasn t paying top dollar  the only major problem    not the hotel s fault    was a very loud  cricket  that seem to share my room at night  i eventually found it on the final night and dealt with it  room was cleaned daily  with fresh towels etc  good range of tv channels  but you won t need them while in vegas  i would suggest using hotel as base  and spend time elsewhere  i would recommend this hotel  and may stay there again  enjoy  
P =>   Very good value a great find for     a night  We arrived at the hotel fairly late in the evening  at around     pm  Luckily we had no trouble checking in the staff were friendly and helpful  Our room was located in the bungalows by the pool  on the second floor  Going into the property I was slightly worried by the worn look of the corridors  the room was a pleasant suprise though  and brightly decorated  Our room contained a bed  two bedside tables  a bigger table  a TV  and bathroom with shampoo  conditioner  soap and body lotion  The bed wasn t too comfortable  but it was more than big enough  Since we were in Vegas we didn t spend too much time sleeping  so it wasn t a big deal  I was slightly worried about the hotel location  but I need not have worried  The hotel is so near the Strip it wasn t a big deal not to be staying there  It s actually nearer to the action than hotels at either end of the stip  such a Circus Circus  All in all this was great value and I would consider staying here again  However  due to the uncomfortable beds  I would probably check prices elsewhere before looking at Hooters again  
P =>  Worst Hotel In Las Vegas  Unbelievably poor hotel stay folks  I am a long time Vegas resident and I have been staying in Las Vegas casinos since the mid     s  Since it was Memorial Day and the prices were high  my aunt had three free nights at Hooter s Saturday through Tuesday and I accepted  Oh my God  Stick to the food  and girls in orange shorts  business Hooters     You know nothing about casino and hotel management  This place is so poorly laid out it looks like slot machines were dropped from the sky into a barn  The main floor is small  crowded  unorganized  ugly  dirty and there is no place to walk  Hooters is a place for people who have lost the will to live or have NEVER EVER been to Las Vegas before and think it s the happening place The hotel was crowded due to the holiday  Yes they have young girls in tight orange shorts selling chicken  but as we all know not every girl is a beauty queen   OK  I am not Denzel Washington or Brad Pitt either   Anyway  my aunt checks me in Saturday night and we get into the rickety elevator defaced by graffiti   HInt  If there is no security guard checking your room key card before you get on the elevator  you are in the wrong Vegas hotel   Once we got off the Bayview elevator  as distinguished from their Oceanview  section   we immediately noticed the filthy  horribly stained and frayed carpet as trays of food set out for the roaches to commit suicide on  Plus this hotel stinks too  I cannot understand how this hotel allows its carpet to stay so dirty on a daily basis  We walked into the room and it was barebones of course with more filthy carpet and yes there were cigarette burns on the carpet  I did not want to touch anything in this room and all I could think about was the room was FREE   I told myself to just try to make it through one night and then I would find another room  The rest of my family was staying at the Palazzo Venetian and I spent most of the first night with them  I stayed out drinking there until     am and drove back to this dump of dumps  I slept til  pm and got the ultimate wake up call  a guy from the room next door came through the connecting door  I jumped up and he ran out as he apologized  Had I been a woman instead of a   foot      pound guy  who knows how crazy and dangerous this situation could have been  I got packed up immediately and got the heck out of there  Please read the negative reviews and believe them  This hotel is AWFUL  If you can help it  avoid this crap hotel  This is NOT Las Vegas  
P =>   Pleasant surprise  quot Hooters has a hotel  quot  was the usual comment to my response to   quot Where are you staying in Las Vegas  quot  Yes  they do and it pleasantly fulfilled all my needs for my short stay in Vegas  I arrived late in the evening and was promptly checked in  I was told my non smoking king wasn t available  but I could have a non smoking dbl and change to a king the next night if I wished  It didn t really matter to me so I stayed in the dbl  The room was clean and nicely appointed in the knotty pine beach look  There were nice toiletries in the bathroom  not the generic hotel soap and shampoo  and two luggage racks   How many times have you been in a hotel where one person gets the luggage rack and the other one ends up putting their stuff on the floor   Pluses   Concierge type guy was helpful with info about transportation  On site restaurant open    hrs Players Club has all kinds of offers and promos  take advantage of it  It s only a block off The Strip and has bloody reasonable rates  Being at the end of The Strip  there weren t any construction noises as there are further up  Minuses   No airport shuttle p u stop  I walked next door to the Tropicana and picked it up there   Room service didn t come through  I ordered a hamburger at   am and waited    minutes for the    minute delivery  It never showed  Bad customer service  OK for me in the long run  Reeaally needed to sleep off the tequila and beer I drank celebrating the concert I d seen with my buds       Overall a nice stay  I d recommend Hooters to anyone who s looking for a hotel with reasonable rates and doesn t need fountains and a light show out front  It was clean  quiet and had everything I needed  
P =>   We had a Blast  Went to Vegas in feb  while we were there on the strip we sighned up for the Hooters Rewards Program  When we came home we recieved mail from Hooters inviting us to stay   free nights  so I booked the the trip for   The staff was super friendly  we arrived early and they had an available room ready for us  The room was very clean with a super cozy King sized bed  Hooters also gave my husband and I free tickets to Bobby Slayton  Not for the weak   We really enjoyed the show and would see him again  The BlackJack Tables were allot of fun and the Hooters girls were very friendly The only down side to Hooters in Dan inos  Eat else whare  
P =>   Ok for the Price My boyfriend and I stayed at Hooters and we were basically willing to accept anything for the awesome price  The price was good and we figured it was just a room that we slept in while we aere there  The problems seem to outweight the good and I am a pretty easy going person  The AC in Hooters was sooo loud and clanky  It kept both of us up all night  Secondly  no one is ever winning at the slots  Thirdly  the carpet is absolutely horrible in the rooms and the hallways  At times there was even the smell of vomit  YuckService at Dan inos and Hooters sucks  The food was great  but  each time we waited at least    minutes at our table before we even got acknowledged  The Owl Card  Wow    what a joke  For some reason they are never really able to tell you what you can get for comps as far as points go  Their was an earn    points and get    in cash reward  We did this and they cashed us out without telling us that we loose all our accumulated points to get an owl and other perks  They even have a        slot play that they advertise all over the place  The problem is that they have an area roped off and you are restricted to playing there with the         Their are about   machines and not a one ever paid out while we were there  We did see comidian Bobby Slaton which was awesome and our Owl cards paid for the show  Watch out for the drink prices though  We ordered   captain and diet and a second one as a double  The price              Needless to say  we spent a lot of time at the MGM which is right across the street and very fun  I would say this hotel really needs to work on customer satisfaction  I most likely will not be back  
P =>   hooters is awesome   me and my husband stayed here and loved it  yes its an older property in need of a bit of TLC but for the price its awesome  the property was clean  and the staff friendly  we loved the hooters theme and the restaurant was great  shame its gonna go  loved it   
P => The things to know this place is cool and when you go there make sure you get a owl card  it s free  here is a list of free goodies i got from hooters   six pack of beer   two for one dinner coupon          in free slot play      free show tickets   free stay at the hotel    nights dec      free stay   nights memorial day weekend     not bad don t you think  
P =>   Like a disgusting college dormatory Being right accross from the MGM you d expect at least average accomodations  When I checked in I was told I was in a  quot bungalow quot  room  This actually meant that I was stuck in the run down seperate wing along side the pool area  The first thing I noticed was security guards everywhere  Then when I entered the building I noticed the disgusting stained carpet all throughout the hallways  The walls are dingy and dirty  I got into my room and saw that my door didn t really fit the doorframe  The deadbolt had to be strenuously manipulated  I had a humble view of a loud parking lot and my  nd floor patio door was bolted shut  Its obvious that Hooter s is not concerned about the appearance or condition of these accomodations  If you re looking for clean comfort and a feeling of security stay away   
P =>  Not impressed This was a less than comfortable experience  The hotel is OK however is obviously a remodel of an older hotel  as can be seen from the old air condtioning units  The carpets in the rooms are dirty as are the hallways with cigarette burns and stains  This was the one thing that annnoyed me as the overalll experience would have beeen a   star otherwise  I would have expected a higher degree of cleanliness for what we paid The restaurants are sub standard  with the breakfast at Dan inos s cheap and less than you would expect  Although if you go for the fruit option that is ok  Service is slow Also the hooters restaurant is substandard with long delays and inaccurate orders being delivered I would not recommed this hotel other than if you really want   star service for a   star price  Location is good just off the strip but that is about it  Be warned  
P =>  Family Stay   nice heated pool and comfy beds I was upset to have won this property thru my bid on Priceline        fees  for one night prior to our morning flight out of LAS  worrying that it would not be appropriate for our family  However  at least on the Monday night we stayed  the property was quiet  The downsides     smoky registration area in the casino itself    have to walk through the casino with luggage to get to elevators   could hear other guests opening and closing their doors  making my children awake and fear that someone was entering our room   sinks in bathroom made getting ready a chore with four people  altho there is a vanity area with a light and wall mounted mirror that can be used for grooming    lumpy pillows   stained carpets  a bit of mildew in showerThe plusses    nicely decorated pool area with waterfall and large hot tub    soft sheets and soft mattresses 
P =>  So much fun   make a point to find Manny the Bartender  To all fellow Vegas lovers  After reading some of the reviews we were somewhat skeptical  but found Hooters to be a knock down drag out BLAST  This was our   th trip to LV and we ll definately stay here again  We both travel a ton  so if you re looking for THE Hotel or Bellagio Lite  this isn t for you  However  if you want a mix of the islands   LV   this is the place Our first room was too near the dumpster which was emptied at about  am   what a wake up call   haha   so we asked for a room change and received one without too much hassle  though it wasn t ready until later in the day  the desk staff when I did change rooms was fantastic and really funny  The entire staff was friendly  fun  and unlike other places actually seemed to be enjoying what they were doing and making a sincere effort to make the guests feel welcome    Sorry  Harrah s   you re  quot scripting quot  of employees falls short  we d rather get at  quot HEY  You re Back  quot  at the end of a fun day than some fake scripted  quot Hello Mrs  ker  how was your day  Mrs  ker  can I assist you  Mrs  ker quot  any day   We both have backgrounds in hospitality and I worked in Casino gaming for   years    Two musts  One   find Manny    he s one of the few male bartenders   and worth a visit in his own right  If you re tired of LV bartenders who don t know how to actually tend bar  i e  scan their bar  remember your drink  and make you feel like you re a regular at some local watering hole    he s your guy  While I m sure he could do the dog and pony show of tossing bottles and flaming drinks  he s more interested in making sure you feel welcome and swapping a good story or two  So go say hey to Manny  leave him a nice tip  and chill out for a bit between gambling rounds Second Must  Hang with the day time dice crew   some of these folks have been with the property for over a decade  They are real dealers who not only know the game  but have all the funny lingo down  and run a perfect pace at the table  You won t feel hurried or feel like a nap between rolls  Also unlike other houses that sweat the money   the crew and the box congratulated winners  with real enthusiasm and cheers and also gave newer players good betting information and were overly gracious when they were tipped or were put on the line with odds  don t cheap out folks  if you re going to put the crew on the line  play the odds for them  They regularly engaged players in fun conversation  talk of ch Madness  and inquired whether people were having fun  Huh  They seem to  quot get it quot   don t they    We had a blackjack dealer that  quot couldn t lose quot    but his personality and repeated yelling to the floor  quot get me out of here quot  was hilarious  You know the place is running well when the floor came over and started yelling  quot Bust  come on dealer  bust quot   Too funny  Overall the service was fantastic  the beverage service is probably the best in Vegas   it was very personal  speedy  and tips were received with real gratitude  Note  too that each bartender we encountered made a great bloody mary   which is a big deal for us  If you re a rated player somewhere else and tired of feeling like a number or that your play isn t appreciated  call Faye  one of the hosts  and consider giving Hooters your business  As a woman  I can honestly attest to the fact that the  quot Rack Pack quot  is brilliant marketing   and funny   and while they ladies are  I m sure  lovely to look at  they also have great attitudes and treat all players   regardless of gender or tipping level like kings and queens  And yes  they do have    tables and all the games  Their  quot light up quot  roulette tables are very cool  and all the dealers on that game we encoutered were teriffic  I think overall the best thing about Hooters was that people were having fun and there was great energy in the casino just about all the time  There were people in their    s sitting next to college kids and everyone was having fun  Even though it was  quot spring break quot  season we didn t feel as though it was a  quot frat quot  atmosphere  and the extremely personable and interactive Security Staff   especially by the pool   made a huge effort to interact with everyone and develop a relationship so that if one of the guests did go a little  quot over the line quot  he or she was humored and teased back into good behavior  So  in summary  give it a try  If you re looking for a fun place that doesn t take itself too seriously and understands that it s the overall experience as much as the win lose statement this may be what you ve been looking for  
P =>   Great for  Okies  and most others Just got back from Hooters yesterday and had a great time  As for the review a couple days ago  this Okie had the beautiful Kari  mentioned here often because she is great  compliment his smile right away  no need to stereotype people from Oklahoma    If you see her  tell her hi from the Oklahoma guy with  quot nice teeth quot  The Casino is small but BY FAR the most fun  I ve been to Vegas   times and stayed up and down the strip and this place is alive most of the day  The Hooters dealers were awesome  David and Lito at the craps table  and the girls were great too      of the ritzy casinos have dealers that seem to try to kill the mood and force you to unhappily lose your money  Not Hooters  we threw dice for   hours on Friday and Saturday  and it was a blast  Also nice is the fact that they will help you out if you aren t too experienced or get too drunk   Sports Book   Really fun and really easy to get a drink for free   just play some video poker here and there  It is small and closes early  so remember that if you have an early flight  You may not get to cash your ticket The rooms are OK  compare them to a Hampton Inn type place  I was in my room for about   hours a night  so that isn t why I went  They smelled fine  had a good pool view  Bay Tower  and were kept clean Pool area was alway happening and the bar  and scenery behind the bar  was great I probably would ve gone   Stars on this had the food been better and more available  Hooters restaurant is Always packed  I don t know if people don t eat at their local Hooters  but they all had to eat at this one  The only other choice was Dan ino s and it was decent for breakfast  but for a     dinner you ll be disappointed  unless you love unlimited baby back ribs  then you re in luck for         Once again  if you need Bellagio or Venetian glitz  stay there  If you want to have a good time with down to earth people  Hooters is great  PLUS  they will still actually comp you a meal or something for playing     hours in their casinos  I hear it will be changing ownership and themes soon  so pay attention to that  Hope this helps    Book it and Have Fun  
P =>   It is what it is Was in Las Vegas for ch Madness so knew I would not be spending a lot of time at the Hotel  Hooter s met my needs perfectly and then some    I was traveling alone with various friends coming in for the games  I had buddies staying at the Luxor  MGM  and NY NY so we were all close by  I have stayed at each of the other   plus the Rio and Bally s on past Vegas excursions I can honestly say that the stay at Hooter s was probably my most pleasant stay in Las Vegas  Since I was by myself  my needs were minimal but they were surpassed  I probably wouldn t have stayed here if traveling with my wife  but after this experience I would  The location is great     minute walk and you re at the Tropicana Las Vegas BLVD intersection  You are   minutes from the MGM monorail station  The price I paid was insane to be so close to all of this action As for the property itself  again I was presently surprised  The check in process was a snap and extremely friendly staff  I had a  th floor room in the Bay View tower that had a good view of MGM Monte Carlo   a little balcony that you could stand on and let in some fresh air   something that is rare in Vegas  Past complaints of old bathrooms are accurate   if you want a posh bathroom   look elsewhere and be willing to double your price  If you are using the bathroom to shower  dispose of waste and brush your teeth   this place will suffice  The room was comfortable and the bed was very nice  The place was clean and maid service was prompt and thorough As for the rest of the place  I didn t spend a lot of time in the casino  I like craps and they had only one table going and makes it hard to get hot  I spent most of my time in the MGM and Mandalay Bay gambling but that is what my plan was coming in  I thought the dealers were friendly when I did gamble and it was pretty lively  The pool area was pleasant and there were quite a few spring breakers partying in that area  but everybody seemed to be getting along and having a good time  I ate lunch at Hooters twice and dinner at ino s twice and had no issues at either place  The filet I had at ino s rivaled those at Austin s  The Palm and other places that would cost twice as much Bottom line   my experience was great  I d definitely recommend it to those of you that know what you re getting in to  It is not Ceasar s  Mandalay Bay or the Bellagio  However  it is as nice and cheaper than plenty of the other older properties on the Strip  My only regret is that it looks like it might not be a Hooters come next ch when we re back out for the basketball tournament  
P =>   I loved it  Hooters is a great place to stay while you re in Vegas  A buddy and I were there for spring break  and we saw fellow spring breakers staying there  but there we also met families  older couples  and business people who were staying there  We stayed in one of the tower rooms and it was very CLEAN and COMFORTABLE  The entire staff at Hooters  from the hosts at check in  the dealers and wait staff  to the cleaning ladies  were all very friendly to us  The price is great  and unlike other Vegas hotels  Hooters does not charge resort fees on top of your regular room rate The location is ideal  as its only one block off the strip and right across the street from MGM Grand  which also serves as a Monorail stop  We ate at Dan ino s and also the Hooters restaurant and both had good food at a reasonable price  The pool area was nice  nothing like Mandalay Bay  but we also didn t have to pay Mandalay Bay prices for our stay at Hooters I ve been to Vegas a few times before and what I noticed the most about Hooters was the fun I had in their casinos  The dealers  some are Hooters girls   are all friendly and talkative  They make your time at the table fun and entertaining  no matter whether you re winning or losing  I ve played at other casinos and the dealers are very impersonal  Plus  Hooters is not as big as the other casino hotels  so you don t need to walk a mile to your room  and while playing  cocktail servers make their way around much faster This was a very positive stay for me  I will definitely go there again  
P =>   Perfect for Okies  If you have no teeth and are from the Ozarks this is your home away from home This place reminded me of truck stops you drive by hoping you don t break down At the very least  Hooters should have good hot chicken wings right  WRONG  They were cold and bad tasting The girls were not friendly and seemed in a bad mood  Also  sorry to say  not very good looking for working at Hooters The room was dirty and poorly decorated  There was mildew on the shower curtain Thank goodness I only had to stay here one night  
P =>   Great for the price The hotel is in very close walking distance to one of the popular strip intersections  The room was nicely laid out and a very nice size  The bed and pillows were very comfortable  The decor was fun and beachy with lots of pine wood accents  The room was very clean  We were put in a smoking room because the non smoking were full and we aren t smokers  but the room didn t smell like smoke at all  The bathroom could use a little updating but wasn t bad  just old  The casino was kind of small but a fun atmosphere  All in all I would stay there again for the price  
P =>   It works I stayed at Hooters for a bachelor party from        th  We got a rate of     night average and booked knowing that we would be spending very little time in our room  With that in mind I ll try to include little tips and tricks we found while there Our room was fantastically hideous with the orange and greens  The beds were advertised as queen  I was told this never confirmed it  and they were at best full size  We used the beds for probably   hours the entire trip so again not a big deal to us but if you enjoy soft  big  comfortable beds this place is not for you  We had a view of the pools which would have been great if they were in use  The hot tubs were going strong      The casino itself is small in comparison to those nearby  However during our stay we always found it easy to find a table to jump on  and the minimums varied from       for BJ  Roulette  and Craps  The dealers were very friendly and attractive  We all agreed that the casino topped all of the ones we went to in terms of attractive  nice  flirtatious dealers  They definitely made the experience more enjoyable  If you go make sure to sit down if Kari or Kellie are dealing  they are extremely fun to play the game with We only ate at the hotel once  and we chose Dan ino s for breakfast  The buffet was only        and did the trick of getting a decent meal in us  The buffet includes eggs  bacon  sausage  hash browns  fruits  and cereal  No biscuits and gravy which was disappointing  We did attempt an extremely late night early morning visit back to DM but was told there was a wait  funny b c there was noone in the place  Overall the hotel met our needs  and we did gamble quite a bit in the casino  Most of us found the slots to be pretty loose and more than half came out ahead while in the casino  One last note I had been to Vegas a couple years ago and used the  quot Tickets   Tonite quot  service  Basically it just offered show tickets for half price the day of showing  What I found this time was that dinner and golf greens fees are now also available  If you plan to play golf definitely check this place out  We didn t bring our clubs and we were sorely disappointed as we could ve gotten a fantastic rate Also note that we did a Treasures package that included dinner  What it entailed was for    each  yes     we got a complimentary limo  no cover charge  and half priced dinner  We were told there was no catch  and there wasn t  The dinner was below average  go somewhere else for a good steak dinner Look for the Fat Tuesdays around the strip  There are   locations  one in Planet Hollywood  one in MGM  and they offer several different sizes and flavored frozen drinks  margaritas  etc  for reasonable prices  For example I chose the    oz  margarita and paid     for one  then refilled it for    the rest of the time  Compare that to one drink at      unless you re gambling of course  and that paid for itself easily Slots   played quite a few and found the wheel of fortunes in the round with the gigantic wheel in the center to be by far the loosest  We played in NYNY  PH  Monte Carlo  Flamingo  and Palms and every time hit for at least      It is well worth it  note find the machines that have the max  bet set at    credits not      Played Wizard of Oz and Top Gun and was extremely disappointed in the pay out  Lasted   minutes max on each Hooters Hotel Casino is what we thought it would be  and if you book knowing what you re going to get how can you be disappointed  Close to the strip    min  walk through MGM or to the tram   good casino environment  and cheap prices  Can t beat it for a guys trip or budget stay  If you want more than   stars shell out the money and stay at one of the many different options    
P =>   Just what I wanted This place was just what I wanted  I didnt want to spend the money that I would have to to stay on the strip itself  NY NY  Luxor  TI etc  and didnt need to have a room full or works of art  Wynn Bellagio etc   The price was great  booked direct with the hotel and the location was excellent  The bathroom wasnt the best Ive had   they were old  but by no means small or unclean   the shower could have been better but so what The two restaurants were good  just as expected  and the drinks prices were cheap as chips  Beds were very comfortable and the rooms were a good size   anyway  if your in Vegas  why you wanting to spend so much time in your room    The location was ideal   across the road from MGM grand  next to Tropicana   walk out the hotel door  walk two minutes and your on the strip   excellent Would definatly use again   oh and the hooters girls were a bonus as well    
P =>   Close to Mandalay Bay Luxor end of strip Got a great price on accommodation so for the budget this hotel has all you need  They overbook so could not get the non smoking bungalows  although booked on line for this   They moved me the next day  Internet access ended up costing about     of the room rate  The ribs at the restaurant are good  And the Mentalist show at Hooters will blow your mind away  Worth seeing  
P =>   You Get What You Pay For Buyer Beware  Hooters casino and Hotel isn t what it s cracked up to be  It s really nothing more than a glorified Motel     The old San Remo got just a small make over and now they call it Hooters  They really have a long way to go to match their competition  There was a real party atmosphere all day and all night here  If this is what you are looking for  then Hooters is the place  The carpeting in the hallways was patched in repairs that didn t match   we also had problems with the bathroom drains  The restaurants here weren t that great and were expensive  All in all  spend a few more bucks and stay elsewhere if you are looking for the real vegas experience  I know we will the next time we visit vegas  
P =>   Much better than expected I stayed for a week just after the Superbowl so the place was quiet for the seven days I stayed  Compared to the other strip hotels the casino was brightly lit but a little small and cramped  When it was really quiet few tables were in operation so I had to go elsewhere for some action  I was in a non smoking room with a King sized bed  It was clean  the bed wonderfully comfortable with a great view of the strip in the distance  There are only two restaurants  Hooters  yuck  and Dan ino s    hour diner  ok   The service in both was pretty good  The Dam restaurant shut a while ago and Porch Dogs is part of Hooters in the winter The strip itself was only   minutes walk  the MGM grand lobby directly across Tropicana Av  The hotel feels a little out of the way but the monorail and deuce bus allow for easy access to the whole strip For     a day during weekdays and     a day at the weekend I have to say it was excellent value for money  For the south end of the strip I saved nearly      by staying there  Not the full LV strip experience but for the price I m not complaining  
P =>   Great Value We had a great experience at the Hooters hotel  It s not luxurious  but the rooms are clean  nicely decorated  and a great value for the location  I thought the Hooters decor of light wood and orange was a refreshing change after staying in too many drab  dark casino hotels  The Hooters attitude comes across as fun  not sleazy  One tiny gripe though  the sheets seemed to be made of polyester or something and were not all that comfortable Check in was a breeze  the staff was friendly  the other guests were courteous  and I really liked staying in a smaller place where you don t have to walk a mile to get anywhere location is its best feature  right next to the Tropicana and MGM Grand  and within walking distance of the middle of the strip  Being right on Tropicana also makes for a very quick trip to the airport and easy driving if you have a car  I also liked that we could park right near the casino in a lot instead of having to navigate a parking garage The pool area is small but nicely done  definitely geared more toward sitting around than swimming I will say though that I was not impressed with the Hooters casino  It s very small  and what few tables they have start at     and are mostly novelty poker games and the horrible     Blackjack  Cocktail service is almost nonexistant  But  it s not really an issue since the much better casinos of the Tropicana and MGM Grand are right next door All in all a great place for the price  I d definitely go back  
P =>  pleasant surprise                 We travel on the cheapo and love walking  so taking a break from the cold and walking miles a day is a bonus not a hassle  I m a middle aged woman and have never been to a Hooters restaurant  I imagined the hotel to be full of drunk guys roaming the hallways  in the elevators  and at the pool  I thought it would be very uncomfortable like staying at a big frat house  But I m a gambler and decided to take a chance  We were there during super bowl and there was no need to worry  the other guests and staff were respectful and pleasant  I ve had worse experiences at Imperial palace with college guys screaming and throwing objects off balconies  Front desk  coffee shop  promotions  everyone was helpful and friendly  We had a problem with a lamp in the room  Staff arrived and fixed within    minutes  We were on the   th floor pool view  I m very sensitive to noise at night  The pool sounds and airport were not bothersome from that floor  I travel for work  we have vacationed many places and yearly for    years to Vegas  Hooters has the best beds by far of anyplace I ve stayed  If you are out of shape   this place is not for you   the beds are on a high platform and you have to hop in  there are bar stools rather than chairs  One thing I did hate was the large fake potted plants in every corner and in the room  It took up too much space it was in the way  Hooters is no frills  no waiting in line  great location  good nights sleep  We found our new place to stay on our yearly trip  
P =>  Not my favorite    We stayed at Hooters for Superbowl weekend  Thursday through Monday We had a Bungalow room  and the front desk wasn t especially helpful with directing us on how to get there  You actually have to go outside  around the pool  and through a side door to get to your room What was bad   Hallway and room carpet was disgusting and stained Pool view bungalows are loud  as they blast music from  am to midnight  One day housekeeping forgot to give us towels  The next day the towels we recieved were dotted with brown streaks   yuck  Tahiti Village timeshare desk within the casino means no shortage of people bothering you if you re a young couple  Players club line was always a mile long What was good      night for our first two nights Fun casino   minute walk to the front of the MGM Watching the Superbowl in Hooters with Sheila as our waitressI won t stay here again  but if you re looking for somewhere cheap to stay  and aren t looking for any frills  Hooters works  
P =>  The Good The Bad and The Ugly First impression was great  Then    Heat   AC   worse than an old Motel    I had to get up all night to turn the heat on and off Food   Dan ino should be ashamed of putting his name on this dump  Service   What service Price   GoodCasino   One of the best small casinos I ve spent    on  I hope OSI wakes up  They need the training staff from Bonefish Grill to shape up this place  Call me when you get your sh   together  Garry 
P =>   What a Surprise   We went to Las Vegas for a work related convention and needed an affordable room near the host hotel   Mandalay Bay  for the week  Hooters Hotel had rooms for     night which we reserved due to its proximity to the convention  I had reservations about the quality of our stay as we drove into town since this was a themed property and a re furbished older hotel    What a surprise  The hotel staff that greeted us on arrival were friendly and courteous and promptly directed us to the elevators to our room  which were at the opposite end of the property through their small and tidy casino  The room itself was HUGE and well appointed  The hotel was recently remodeled when acquired by Hooters and all the rooms have new furniture  including a large work desk that accommodated two of us using laptops  easy to use Internet access  a high bar table and stools for taking a snack break  easy chair for lounging and a large  comfortable bed  We were on the Ocean View side of the hotel and had a nice view of the Strip from our  th floor room  The bathroom was large and clean and had the usual features  toiletries  hair dryer  The room was well ventilated  quiet and was well cleaned our entire stay  The property also feature a  beach  area with pools and   restaurants  including a  Hooters What I expected to be a no frills budget stay turned out to be relaxing  comfortable AND budget friendly  I will stay here again and again while traveling for work to Las Vegas  
P =>   Great Atomsphere I ve been to Las Vegas dozens of times  including about    trips in the past year  I m a Diamond Total Rewards member and usually stay at Caesars  Paris or one of the other Harrahs establishments  but I ve also stayed at Circus  Circus  one night       NEVER again   Stratosphere  Sahara  Venetian  Monte Carlo  Golden Nugget  and a few of the non casino hotels A year or so ago I went to Hooters to play blackjack  Although I left with a lot more money than I brought  I left with a bad impression  The parking lot was old and creepy  the casino seemed to be dark and smokey  the tables were packed too close together  and with a couple of exceptions  the dealers seemed unfriendly I recently received an offer that I decided to use to add onto a trip I had planned at Paris for last week  I m glad that I did  I had a great experience First  the room was exceptional for a budget casino  My room was a suite  and althought it obviously wasn t as big or as nice as a suite at Caesars or Paris  it was nicely decorated  exceptionally clean  and the quality was much better than I expected  I wouldn t decorate my house the same way  but it had a casual and comforable warmth that was a uniqe change  I would easily choose that room over many of the rooms I ve gotten at other hotels  I also had a strip view from the   th floor  which was nicer than the view I ve had at most Las Vegas hotels But the most pleasant surprise was that the casino seemed to be warmer and friendlier than I experienced on my first trip  Either my first experience was exaggerated negatively  or they ve made improvements that result in less crowded space  brighter lights  and less stuffiness  Most importantly  the dealers were a lot of fun  After playing blackjack at the stuffy Bally s and Paris casinos  the Hooters atmosphere was a refreshing change The hotel check in was a breeze  The staff was efficient and there were no lines  I also never had a wait at the cashier s window Although Hooters is at the end of the strip  it s an easy walk to the monorail and a reasonable walk to the middle of the strip One of the nicest features is the proximity to the airport  I ve had cab rides from Ceasar s and Paris that run as high as     and take a half hour due to long waits in traffic  From Hooters the fare was        or     with a tip  and took aboaut   minutes We ate hamburgers at the Hooters restaurant and had ribs at Dan inos  Both experiences were great  both in terms of the quality of the food and the service There were a couple of negatives  As pointed out in other reviews  the hallways need to be upgraded  The carpet is dull and worn  and the walls need help  They caused me to worry as I walked to my room I also had to wait too long in the player s club line  The first wait was between    minutes and an hour  and the second was about a half hour Overall  my stay at Hooters was one of the best experiences that I ve had in Las Vegas  or in any other casino  for that matter  If you factor in the reasonable rates and the more casual  relaxed  fun atmosphere  you can t beat it  
P => ent for the price  Stayed at Hooters for   nights in ember  This review is based on the fact that I paid                for each night  If I had paid a little bit more per night I would probably have an awful review to write  as it isn t worth much more than what we paid The rooms were clean  You could tell that they did MINIMAL investing in the renovation  Covered things up rather than fixing them up  The HVAC was loud and rattling but it didn t bother us as we like a little white noise as we slept  The beds were definitely very comfortable and clean which was nice  We were given double beds instead of a king  but we didn t mind much  The hallways were definitely gross  the carpets were stained and they were dim and dank  The elevators were fine  We didn t eat at the hotel  but found the little gift shops to be ridiculously overpriced  go up the block to stock up on bottled water  gatorade  etc The location is GREAT  Whoever is saying its a       minute walk to the strip is ridiculously slow  We clocked it at   minutes The casino is fun  A completely different atmosphere than other Vegas casinos but we enjoyed it  I love that everything smells like sunscreen the beach and that they play fun music Again  if you can get a ridiculously cheap deal on this hotel  go for it  If you are looking at paying anything more than     a night  definitely not worth it in my opinion  
P =>  Nice for the price I booked Hooters Casino Hotel as a birthday present for my husband  It was a great deal       night  The location is fine   just slightly off the strip  The beds were very comfortable  but we booked a king and didn t get it until the last of our three nights  The hotel is still undergoing renovation  The rooms at this old San Remo Hotel look pretty good  but don t always have the right furniture  The first room we had didn t have any chairs  just the three barstools  The second room was better wth a desk chair and a nice bedside chair  There s also no coffeemaker meaning you have to go downstairs to the little bait shop to get a cup  That shop also has Krispy Kremes  The carpet needs replacing badly in the hallway  We got an odd set of towels     large    hand  and   wash clothes  There are few plugs  There is Internet  but we didn t try the connection because we didn t bring a laptop on vacation Food  Donuts and coffee juice are available at the bait shop at a reasonable price  We had breakfast at Dan ino s restaurant because the hotel gave us a   for   deal  It was pretty good  Good service  We ate at the Hooters restaurant and I wasn t impressed with the food  but the service was good Casino  Don t bother  The slots are really tight day and night  The promotion of      in free spins is an indication of how the casino isn t serious about keeping people playing  The money is used on    slots and gone in about a minute We probably won t stay here again  I think paying an extra few bucks to be on the strip in a more central location or downtown would be worthwhile  
P =>   have stayed   times Great hotel my wife and I always stay here  We travel to Vegas     times a year and search for the best rate and hooters always comes out on top  To be honest  this is my favorite hotel in vegas  The last time we were there  the hotel has declined a bit  nothing noticeable to the first time visitors  Beds are most comfortable in vegas based of apporx    beds i have stayed in  in vegas easy accesses to the strip through trop or mgm  the dam restaurent is the absolute best   am food in the world cant wait to go back 
P =>   Reasonable inexpensive accommodations I admit it  I stayed here only because of the price  I couldn t believe that I could get a reasonable room in Las Vegas for only     per night  but that s what I paid  What I got in return was a clean room with a comfortable bed  They have internet access in the room  but it s not free and it wasn t working most of the times that I tried to use it The location is next to Tropicana  about a      minute walk to the Strip  MGM Grand is directly across the street I visited many casinos during my stay in LV and the one at Hooters had more smoke and more noise than any other  There would occasionally be someone screaming out loud for no apparent reason  be it happens elsewhere  but here the sound travels throughout the casino I m not dissatisfied with the hotel becuase I got what I paid for  a clean and quiet room  However  I doubt that I will stay here again  
P =>   Not worth the savings    My girlfriend and I travel to Vegas     times a year and have stayed at many many hotels  both on and off the strip  I am definately not one to complain  the hotel for me is only a place to sleep   especially in Las Vegas  but our five nights here were a bit ridiculous  Despite my reservation they put us in a room with two beds  didn t make much sense  but having spent alot of time traveling  this was not my first experience with the matter  They were holding a package for me  which took about    minutes to find  but again  I understand these things happen  What bothered me was the staff  As a whole they were unfriendly and rude  and I m not talking about the dealers in the skimpy outfits  It was the front desk  the waitresses  the bartenders that really had an opportunity to make or break the stay for me and they failed miserably  My girlfriend was so taken aback by the general lack of courtesy and kindness that she asked to speak with a manager  only to be given a VIP host  Polite as he was  he merely directed her to fill out a comment card about the matter  The Dan ino restaurant was nice enough  though I had to interupt the waitress and the hostess from side conversations with their boyfriends to get them to seat us and take our order  The food took about    minutes to bring out  strange because we ordered    hot wings and celery sticks  and we waited so long for a check we ended up guessing on the bill and left cash on the table  The clientele was slummy and for the most part belligernatly drunk after about        For the women reading this review  my girfriend wouldn t walk the casino floor or bar without me  For the men traveling with women  if drunk guys hitting on your significant other over and over and over again bother you   find another hotel  And for you gamblers out there  yes the reviews are true  the casino floor is about the size of a basement  All in all  the service is not worth the savings  pony out a few more bucks and don t let the hotel and casino ruin the vacation   
P =>  Of ribs and chicks Stayed here on the Saturday after Thanksgiving for a night  and having been there the night before feasting on the all you can eat ribs at Dan ino s and almost lost some money trying to pay for the meal  I decided to stay at the property  I just came in at    am and asked the front desk guy if there s any rooms available  He said yes and gave me a good rate       for it without me having to show my AAA card or saying anything for it  Made the cash deposit  and he gave me the keys to one of the bay view rooms  The location wasnt that great  next to the stairs and view of Airport   but the beds were the best i ve stayed in a hotel in a loong time  and the decor is pretty hilarious  orange everywhere  a mini bar stool and table  and a mini tree  Service was great  the krispy kreme bought at the hotel store was awesome  and the girls there were great to talk to  especially the one at the store  Would return here if i want something no frills to stay in vegas  and definitely recommend it to everyone  Try Dan ino s restaurant too while you re there    good food for a decent price  
P =>  Had a blast a Hooters  My bestfriend and I just met up last weekend in Hooters for my   th birthday and we had an absolute blast  The room was nice and very clean  The casino was excellent and you could actually get a drink when you gambled  We arrived several hours early for check in and they still let us check into our room  The room service was excellent as well as our   o clock in the morning dinner in the resturant  Being girls we had read some of the reviews and were a little afraid we might get bombarded with midlife crisis perverts but this wasn t the case at all  I would and will stay here again  
P =>   A Hoot at Hooters Hooters is a nice hotel   rated as mid standard  there are good and bad points i will list below but overall the stay represented excellent value for money and would recommend this as a great hotel Hooters is just off the strip   about    minutes walk past the Tropicana  to get to the nice part of the strip with New York and Excalibur and MGM  It is over the road from the MGM and it has a monorail to get you around the whole strip The location isnt brilliant and you can feel a little isolated in the hotel The hotel has good facilities  it has an amazing restaurant  lovely pool and spa area  it has a good range of slots  but the main tables are closed more often than not The rooms are nice and spacious  big TV  large bathroom  was clean and comfortable The carpet does the hotel no favours there are drinks stains everywhere and the negative reviews on here mirror this  however this was the only issue I found that could be something to moan about Reception were friendly and informal  Room Service was nice and the staff were always helpful and approachable I would recommend this hotel for anybody   the girls are stunning and friendly so guys will love staying and eating here  It isnt too formal and isnt too enormous  I found there was a real range of guests from families  youngsters to older people The location isnt bad but another    minutes away and it would be an issue OVERALL a thumbs up to a very enjoyable stay 
P =>  great place I went out there for a my bachelor party with    of my buddies  We went out for   nights  it was     total for each person for   nights which was awesome  If your looking to gamble and drink  this is the place because the drink girls were so quick to bring back your beverage and the tables were not expensive  People have said that the casino is small which it is but not once did it get too crowded at a table  there were always seats at the blackjack tables  The hotel was right off of the strip  right across from mgm and tropicana  I would recommend this hotel and plan on going again  and the hooter girls were too bad to look at either 
P =>   Just OK Stayed at Hooters for   nights in one of the  quot bungalow quot  rooms outside the main building overlooking the swimming pool  Very good king bed and one chair but almost no other furniture  Loud music from poolside from   am to    pm or so  The rate      night  made it hard to resist for   nights in midweek  I might stay again in the off season  but not on weekends  when the price jumps to       per night  
P =>   FUN PLACE     We stayed five nights at Hooters returning last night i had to come on here and defend all the horrible reviews i have read that place is GREAT    well that is if u are not prententious or snobby u will have a great time  we had an  quot ocean view quot  room which was overlooking the pool  our room was very clean   spacious  cable tv  our beds were made and towels restocked the ONLY downfall to the whole hotel was the noisy a c unit and the dim lighting in the bathroom  but who really cares   the casino was alot of fun  although kind of dead at times  it was alot more personal and faster service than the other large casinos on the strip it was right across from MGM  in a safe convienent location  cab rides are    bucks to the airport  Palms hotel etc    dont take the monorail it is a waste of time  and take forever to get to the station at MGM  spend the extra money and take cabs  the staff was very nice and the pool was really enjoyable i layed out everyday  on the weekends the pool bar was open  the pool was pretty warm  with a warterfall and hot tub also we would watch the people laying out from our window overlooking the pool  lots of ppl seem to stay at the pool until late the check in and out was very fast  if i do go back to Las Vegas  which i will      i would stay there again    it is alot of fun  and i love the orange hooters lighting everywhere     we stayed at the Wynn one night which was beautiful  but i dont like staying in the mega hotels  too many ppl  takes to long to walk anywhere   Hooters is def recommended by me  
P =>   Dirty Rooms Hooters is dirty and yes there are bugs  I saw cockroaches and dead bug smears on the wall  This place should be shut down  The service is horrible  over   hour to get your bags delivered to your room  When I called the front desk I was told I couldn t expect speedy service  Rooms full of dust  they need a major cleaning  
P =>  no Party at all paid     USD plus tax for midweek stay Mon thru Wed Hotel is ok but cant compte with the newer ones is Las Vegas Stayed at the pool in the afternoon but it was quiet  no action at all   Hooters Waitresses behind the pool bar   dressed in pullovers since it was pretty cold in the shadow Lots of Hooters Girls in the Restaurant  but the ones in Santa Monica were friendlier Would stay again only at a lower rate Greetings from Switzerland 
P =>  Affordable and clean place to sleep while you see Vegas My husband and I stayed at the hotel for an extended weekend over  th of y  We booked our rooms       for   nights  on the hotel website  They included Bobby Slayton tickets our first night in town  The check in was quick and friendly  The hotel has a fun theme and the rooms carry the tropical concept into them  They were clean and basic  Food at The Dam was okay and seemed to be many of the same offers as in the Hooters restaurant  The onsite steakhouse was okay  I wouldn t recommend it for a great steak lover but alright for the money The pool area was very nice and a fun atmosphere  Try the  quot Hooter Juice quot  which was a frozen blended drink with a nice taste and quite a kick I would recommend Hooters based on our experience for a clean  cheap and conviently located hotel  If you want a reasonable place to stay while you enjoy Vegas  this could work for you  
P =>   Bed Bugs                      My brother and I stayed at Hooters Casino and Resort on t    th  I woke up at   a m  with bugs crawling on me and in my bed                       I went to the front desk to complain and all they would say is how do you want to pay for the room  They did nt offer us a ride to another hotel or anything they did tell me the Orleans had rooms but this was all the way out by the RIO not close to the convention center at Mandalay Bay We walked down the side street toward the strip and there were some people out who were following us and tried to get in an elevator with us by the Tropicana  I had to call a friend back home to help me find a room  What a HUGE HUGE problem for us  In Vegas and no hotel room at   a m  not a situation I would ever recommend I called the health department  CCH  on Hooters since I could nt get anyone on the phone  They came out and several rooms were shut down due to the infestation of bed bugs                            I have left several messages for the managers of the hotel and they must not of felt that this was that big of an issue because it took   weeks to get them on the phone  And the only reason I got anyone on the phone is I called the corporate office  Still no resolution   I don t know about you but I don t like to have to wear bug infested clothes for the whole week I am in Las Vegas working a trade show and attending a wedding  I would only reccomend this hotel if you want to take some bed bugs home and be told this is not their fault                     
P =>  Celebrating my daughters   st b day at Hooters We arrived the evening of her   st b day   Check in was quick and we made our way to the room to drop off luggage  We booked a standard two bed smoking room  Our room overlooked the pool area and at night it was pretty with the lights sparkling over the water Our room was very clean  the decor is average  the beds were very comfortable and more importantly it was very quiet  My only complaint was when we showered as the drains were plugged and it became half shower and half bath  Our room was serviced every day by   pm The Casino is quite small and that s a bonus as you could never get lost  We found the dealers to be very friendly and helpful  My daughter was forever getting carded and security helped out by giving her a bracelet to wear so everyone would know she was of legal age The food was average but the coffee at the Dam restaurant was very good All in all it was exactly what I expected and I would stay there again because of the affordability  
P =>   Fastest drinks in Vegas Baby  We ve stayed at the Luxor  and granted it s a whole different crowd  the service here was much faster and more personal  After visiting all the  quot Big quot  casinos for a little gambling we always came back to little ol  Hooters for the largest winnings and fastest drink service  By the way  I didn t find a better Cosmo anywhere in Vegas  The rooms are comfortably appointed and quiet  The view from our room on the  th floor tower was non existent  We booked directly because a family member is an employee of Hooter s in Tennessee and the casino gives employees a hefty discount  Even if we had paid full price it was a bargain  The Dam Restuarant is killer for all the food and service  But don t even bother with the wings at Hooter s restuarant  they suck big time  no flavor and ice cold  But do enjoy the Peanut Butter Pie  While the casino is much smaller than most  it s a  quot hoot quot  to visit  
P =>   Dirty and old but cheap and good location   you make the call  My husband and I decided to go on a last minute trip to Las Vegas for the first weekend in ust  I had a few hours to find a place to stay for that same night and the next one  Cost and location were both factors  so we ended up with the Hooters hotel because it was the cheapest we could find the closest to the strip  For those two factors  this hotel was great  We booked directly with the hotel and paid only     for the Friday and     for the Saturday  Also  the location wasn t much different from the time we stayed at the MGM Grand  The other nice thing was that after walking through all the huge monstrosity places  it was nice to come back to a place where it was easy to find everything and you could get to your room without a three mile hike  For most everything else  though  my reaction is   eh  Though this has nothing to do with the hotel itself  I have to say that if anyone ever tells you they go to Hooters for the wings  it is a lie  lie  lie  I know that s kind of a joke to begin with  but I found out it really is true  their wings are terrible  Greasy and flavorless  both at the Dam Restaurant and the actual Hooters   If you want wings  stick with Buffalo Wild Wings   I know it s convenient  but don t bother eating at the hotel   I have to say  though  we didn t try the Dan ino s steakhouse place  so I can t comment on that  Anyhow  back to the hotel  The outside and public areas seem to have been dressed up since it was the San Remo Hotel  and I think the rooms are a tad nicer  but the hallways and elevators are like something from the Bates Motel  I d read other reviews that mentioned how depressing the hallways were and thought   Who gives a crap about the hallways   Well  as it turns out  I do  They were that gross  The carpet is threadbare and stained badly  When I woke up early desperate for non alcoholic liquid  too much salt from all those margaritas  I guess    I walked down the hall to the soda machine with my two bucks  The machine s dollar reader was broken  So I took the elevator down to the next floor  That soda machine would only take exact change  Finally I went down another floor and got my drink  Then when I went to go back up  the elevator wouldn t work correctly  The door would start to shut and then would open again only to start to shut and then stop and open again  This started to make me nervous  so I hopped out and tried to find stairs  I couldn t find a way to get from one floor to another  So I went back to the elevators and prayed that this time  a different one would come  which it did   We were later in the same elevator and another couple said it was acting really screwy every time they used it  too  I know it s an old building  but elevators that don t work right make me nervous Something else that I wasn t impressed with was the fact that there were hairs in the shower  Not just one that I can understand  it happens  But numerous hairs that appear to be from different parts of the body  Yuck  Also  the in room safe was broken  we didn t bother to ask anyone to fix it  though  Something that is part good part bad is the fact that upon checkout  we were billed for a meal we didn t eat   I am SO GLAD I checked every item on the printout   It turns out that while we were eating breakfast at the Luxor  someone else was eating breakfast at one of the hotel restaurants and charging it to our room  The good part was that the guy at the front desk immediately credited us back for it and was very nice I know this review has a lot of complaints  I m not normally a very picky person when it comes to hotels  I swear   What bothered me here is that it seems like they just tried to slap a coat of paint on everything and present it as way nicer than it was  A lot of the problems I saw would be easily remedied with just some time and attention  maintain the pop machines and safes  make sure the rooms are cleaned well  wash the windows every once and awhile  etc  Overall  I understand that I got what I paid for  and that s o k  We had a good location and a bed to crash in for cheap  It s just that next time  I ll spring for something a little nicer  
P =>   Shouldn t have read the reviews here first    We booked the final two nights of our week long vacation at Hooters          as the price was very good compared to most of the strip properties  as there was a large convention in town  I always read the reviews on here prior to staying at any property and given the majority of favorable reviews I went in thinking quite positive about this property   with an air of aprehension  Well  I should have known better  My wife and I are fun  outgoing people and we had a terrible time at this property  First the pool area which is made out to be lavish is really a snooze fest  this may have been due to it being a weekday  but the worst part was they stop cocktail service almost as soon as the sun disappears around   pm  We like to go out for late afternoon swims  and as such if we wanted to enjoy a beverage we had to walk inside the Hooters restaurant to get a drink  where the service was incredibly slow  although the girls were very friendly  albeit not as attractive as we expected  The casino itself is small  with limited table game options  and lacking of the energy atmosphere of most of the strip properties  We found the two pit bosses and non Hooters girl dealers we came in contact with to be cold  thus we didn t spend much time at the tables here   the Hooters Dealers were much friendlier  and easier on the eyes  The rooms themselves  we upgraded to a suite  were ok  there was a    plasma in the living room  with a small bar area with a fridge  which kept drinks very cold   The beds were actually quite comfortable  That is where the good parts of the room ended  The windows looked as though they hadn t been cleaned since the San Remo days  they were like that scene from My Cousin Vinny  very  very dirty for those who can t recall   the carpets and couch were stained extensively  the soundproofing was non existent  However all of these items could have potentially been overlooked if not for the showers  The room had two showers  which may have been nice  however there is something seriously wrong with their water tank pressure system  In the course of a    minute shower  my wife and I would be routinely scalded and frozen in numerous intervals  we took   showers and this occured every time  to both of us  All in all  I guess given the price if we need a place to sleep  and they fixed the showers we may stay there again  The  quot off strip quot  location is no problem  you spend very little time getting out of the hotel as it is so small  and MGM and the monorail is right across the street  Also you don t have the outrageous taxi lines you do at other strip hotels  However we will most likely pony up the additional     and stay center strip next time as we did at the start of our trip at Planet Hollywood  
P =>   Can t go wrong at Hooters We stayed at Hooters for   nights and had a great time  The room was booked online at their website a months or so before arrival and we managed to get them for     a night Upon arrival we were not sure what to expect for that price but we were very pleasantly surprised  the room was big  had a great King Size bed  big TV  our own safe and a great and clean bathroom Sure  it s not flashy  but it must be the best deal in Las Vegas  it s only  min away from the Strip and casinos such as the MGM and New York New York  The room was cleaned daily and the pool looked really nice as well  never used it though  We will definately stay at Hooters again if we return to Las Vegas   
P =>  good place to stay on a budget I stayed here for   nights   a friday and Sat night  and while it s not an MGM Grand it is a great place to stay for under      night  I booked a week in advance and couldn t expect much on a budget  It s in a good location yet you don t have to pay for being right on the Strip  It s   blocks from the strip  I could have paid less for the stratosphere which is supposedly right on the strip but in my opinion the strat is in a bad location far away from the major casinos  There is a friendly atmosphere at hooters and I was definately hesitent after reading the reviews  The casino is smaller but that was ok with me  The elevators were normal with the exception of one time where we had to wait   minutes or so   big deal  We even ate at the hooters restaraunt  defying the negative reviews  and it was ok  It is hooters people  have you ever had a fancy meal at a hooters  It was decent food  no wait  friendly girls and good service  I would stay here again  
P =>  Loved it at Hooters My wife and I just spent y   nd thru the    at Hooters What can we say other then this place is incrediable If you are looking to relax and have a very down to earth stay this is the place for you  No snobs expecting something for free The rooms are very comfortable  Beds are so soft   The only thing I would say is the water pressure was not that great  I do not know if staying on the   th floor had something to do with this  It was not a big deal though So in closing if you like down to earth and you just want to relax this is the place for you  If you want upper class and people to kiss your butt around every corner go to the Belliago or Ceasers  
P =>  Great Hoot  Okay  Hooters isn t the Mirage  They live up to their motto of  quot Delightfully tacky  yet unrefined quot  but I would encourage you to take it for what it intends to be  The price was terrific for        on a weeknight I had a very nice room  everything was clean  and beautiful ladies everywhere I looked  This is a great place for guys and fun couples who don t want to have to remain casual and have a good time  The pool area was very nice and staffed by some incredibly beautiful and attentive ladies  Food was good at every price and prices for everything were reasonable by Vegas standards  It s an easy two block walk to the strip and I never felt concerned at night  It s impossible to beat for the price and I intend to return  Did I mention the beautiful ladies everywhere  
P =>   will stay only here from the moment we got to hooters  we loved it  we received excellent service from all the friendly staff   bradley you re the best  we arrived at         checkin time is       i asked for a quiet area i can t sleep    we werre given room       immediately  NO WAIT    the rooms are nice  clean  and the beds are so comfy  there was a safe  coffeemaker  table and chairs  huge towels and great water pressure there are   pools and   jacuzzis  plenty of chairs  the only downside is the building blocks the sun around      but by then you have had enough sun we ate ate the dam restaurant once  got   cents shrimp cocktail by signing up for a players card  we ate at hooters twice  enjoyed meals and service  the talapia was excellent the casino is small   didn t bother us   the girls brought drinks before we could even finish  figured the crown royal i drank made up for the money i lost in the machines which wasn t much   had fun playing our last day they were taping the tv show  quot the best damn sports show period quot   we did not have to get out of the pool  but the manager Kim asked us to give up our chairs for awhile   he gave us drinks and made sure we got our chairs when they were through  nipper juice is awesome we had a      flight so i asked for a room extension  would have gotten one till   but only took it till   because a friend was taking us to lunch  no chargethis was our  th trip to vegas  you can keep those monstrosities on the strip  it took us less time to get to the strip and our pool than if we would have been staying on the strip  we have stayed at tropicana  flamingo  harrahs  new frontier  monte carlo  aladdins  and ballys  this  by far  was the best  it is not a   star hotel   but we got   star service  i wonder if those   star places with the   star prices really give you what you pay for  hooters will see us again  
P =>   perfect Booked a bungalow room         and was upgraded to ocean view room  Room was clean and everything worked fine Casino was small  but I was always able to get on blackjack table  The dealers were very nice and better looking than your normal dealers  The dam restaurant was good for a late night breakfeast and the other restaurants were also nice  Just a short walk to the strip and the monorail is close by  MGM  NY NY and Excaliburs are all near by and offer a wide variety of entertainment and restaurants  We ate at Excalibur  Dicks last resort and roundtable buffets  both were excellent I am planning a return to Vegas in   months and will stay at Hooters again then  
P =>   Good Time at Hooters Went there for a men s weekend with some friends  True to form it is delightfully tacky  Hit      on the first slot machine I played so that helped set the tone  donated it back through the course of the weekend   The rooms were very clean and had no complaints with them  I would have to say that for a hotel just off the strip it is a great place to stay for those on a budget  The pool area was lively if you try to remember you are staying at HOOTERS and not the Four Season s  By that I mean the people are fun but shall we say adventuresome  So if that is what you like this is where you will find it  The casino was much smaller than I anticitpated with not enough tables for my taste  but there were plenty of slots  The bar toward the back of the property is a greatplace to kick off an evening and if you are looking to drink all day  make sure you look like a tourist and by the yard at the bar      for a gigantic Jack and Coke with refills for      One hell of a deal  The breakfast buffet was OK but not spectacular  They have omelettes made to order and the potatoes are great  Could not find one person working tere that was having a bad day and everyone seemed friendly and helpful  One nice thing about the location is right across the street is the MGM  We all got day passes for the tram and took it to the far north end of the stip and worked our way back on foot  Well worth the price compared to how long it would take for you to get there by cab  
P =>   Great atmosphere at Hooters  I stayed at the Hooters Casino Hotel in mid e and loved it  or in the casino and the room was typical of a Hooters restaurant with lots of orange vinyl and natural wood  A little jarring to look at compared to other luxurious hotels in Vegas  but it grows on you  If you are driving  the parking ramp is immediately adjacent to the hotel and access is very convenient  Driving in and out on Tropicana is a snap  Although technically off the strip  it is a   minute walk to Las Vegas Blvd from your hotel room  I have stayed at Bally s  Luxor  Harrahs  and other strip properties where it took longer just to get the elevator down My room was in the  quot Oceanview quot  tower  used to be the silver tower when it was San Remo  and it was large  comfortable  clean  and exactly what I requested  The hallways and elevators are a little beaten and dreary  but the room itself was great  I arrived   hours early for Sunday check in and they were able to give me the King no smoking room I requested  In contrast to older reviews I read here  all the staff I met seemed quite friendly and knowledgeable Pool area was very lively and had a live reggae type band playing on Sunday  I didn t see much cocktail service walking around  but service was fast at the pool bar  I thing large drafts were    and frozen drinks were           There were a lot of lounge chairs and benches surrounding the pools  and it seemed some were always open  The hooters restaurant has a porched area overlooking the pool where you can get food  Crowd was mostly couples in their late    s   early    s and not the drunken bachelor party group I was expecting  but it was a Sunday Casino is a little small  but they have all the table games and a good variety of slots  I found     JOB video poker and decent pay tables on Dueces Wild  BJ was mainly     minimum       I never saw lower  There were a lot of     tables and the placards stating that are small  so look carefully before you sit down  Cocktail service was speedy wherever I was sitting To summarize  This is a   star place with a really fun atmosphere and decent rooms  food  and gaming  It is a great place for the price  close enough to be considered on the Strip  and I plan on returning with my wife for our next vacation  
P =>   What a great deal  My girlfriend      and I      stayed   days   nights y     in a  quot Poolside Bungalow Room quot  for     nt and really loved it  We were in room     overlooking the center of the pool area  No complaints on cleanliness  Room decor resembles a Hooters restaurant right down to the orange barstool seats   there was a sitting chair as well   Bed was fine  a little soft   Room was large  It had a small balcony overlooking the pool area  The pool was busy  but never too crowded  get a spot under the waterfall for a  quot cool quot  spot in the shade   The food was so  so  The breakfasts were good in the Dam Restuaurant  didn t try Dan ino s   Always room at the craps table      min during the week  The Nipper Juice at the Pool Bar was very good  a slurpy with a kick   Such an incredible price for the location   behind the Tropicana across from the MGM  and monorail stop   I bet our walk to the Strip was faster than many of the rooms inside the MGM    nights for     bucks was a steal Plus  ya get Hooter s girls everywhere for no extra charge See the Vegas Forum for additional info on our Hooters experience and our trip  
P =>   Happy Birthday at Hooters  My friends and I had a great time at the Hooters Hotel  The atmosphere was laid back and lots of fun  The rooms are comfortable and staff was wonderful  Loved the pool party  It was definitely a Happy Birthday  
P =>  Great Place to Stay After reading the prior reviews  I also thought that I might have made a mistake in booking at Hooters  However  that was not the case at all  I have stayed at many casinos on the Strip and Hooters has delivered the best service yet  The Hooters girls were always helpful and friendly  as were the front desk and bell hops  The restaurants  especially Hooters and Dan ion s steakhouse were excellent  The rooms were nice  clean and comfortable  loved the beds   The casino floor was smaller than those on the strip  but in this way it was no overwhelming  and in some ways  more fun  The table games were very relaxed with the Hooter girl dealers offering advice and adding to the fun of the game  The pool was great and the drinks served while gambling were much larger than those served at the Strip casinos  An added bonus was that there were    Blackjack tables next door at the Tropicana  in case you did not particularly want to  quot lose your shirt quot  that day  All in all  a wonderful experience  I would absolutely stay there again  If i were to mention any negatives  I would say that the elevators were slower than I m used to and that the Sports Book was tiny  
P =>  Fun  I stayed at Hooters hotel a couple weeks ago and was very pleased  The rooms were very nice w  big soft beds  The casino size was just perfect and you didnt have to worry about getting lost like you did at the other big casinos  It had a very nice pool  but be there before  pm or the sun gets blocked by the hotel and it gets chilly  It also had a great location  just a block off the strip  one negative thing i would say is DONT eat at the hooters restaurant  The service is terrible and rude  We ate there twice and realized it was the biggest mistake we could have made  It was very spendy for the food you got  and the waitreses were anything but friendly  Overall i would def  stay here again  but avoid the Hooters restaurant  
P => Terrible Hotel Stayed between y   and    Called to confirmed non smoking room the day before and were not available when we got there  Stayed at room     where the carpet was dirty and got stains  The bathroom got peeling paint and cheap fixtures and rusted out valve behind the toliet with broken tiles  Only one elevator was working the whole time while   others were out of order  No AC in the hallway or elevator  Noisy AC in the wall  Lack of Management  
P =>  Hooterific Time After looking at some of the reviews on this page I was expecting a real dump  That was not the case  The hotel is not the Wynn or Bellagio  but it also doesn t come with the attitude either  It was clean  and the staff were very helpful  When we checked in there was a bit of a line  so the cocktail waitresses offered us free drinks  Way to pass the short time  The Hooters restaurant and the Dam Restaurant are both delicious  especially after a heavy night of partying   The concierge was very helpful  and gave us good advice on where to go on a Tuesday night  The rooms were very very comfortable and equally clean  The beds are better than in any hotel I ve stayed at in Vegas  The pool is a decent size and has a small waterfall  On our last day I asked for late check out and they had no problem  All this for only    bucks a night through the Hooterific Package  This hotel is not on the strip but if you just walk across to the MGM you can board the monorail anywhere on the main drag  I definitely recommend this place  
P =>   Great Value  My wife and I stayed at Hooter s Hotel and Casino from e          through e          in room      We took my father to Las Vegas as a Father s Day present and he stayed in room      Having never even dined at a Hooter s Restaurant and with my wife s apprehension about staying at a Hooter s establishment  we were both very pleasantly surprised and pleased with our accommodations As I needed to purchase two rooms  price was a major factor in selecting Hooter s  I found a great deal on Expedia for only     a night  This was for a   star hotel that had a good ranking on TripAdvisor  no     out of       The total price for two rooms for   nights plus fees and taxes was only          This was an extremely great value  To have stayed elsewhere on the strip at any decent hotel would have doubled the cost of the entire trip  I liked the location of the hotel as it was right across from a monorail stop at MGM Grand and down the street from a mini mart  The elevators were all working and I usually did not have to wait long for one We checked in at      pm and were able to secure rooms before the official check in time of      pm  We only had to wait about      minutes to be checked in  We were given smoking rooms  but as a nonsmoker I could not detect the slightest odor of cigarette smoke in my room  Our room was very clean  spacious  and did not show any signs of age  I liked the nice touch of putting large plants in the room  but felt the wooden d cor was a little tacky  The rooms had a nice view of the hotels on the southern part of the strip  Luxor  MGM Grand  Excalibur  and Tropicana   The television had a large selection of channels and was nicely positioned right in front of the bed  The bathroom was very clean and was of average size that came with all the usual amenities including a hair dryer and vanity mirror  The bed was very comfortable  but the air conditioner was a little noisy  I did not hear any noises from the adjoining rooms  The rooms were serviced every day  but some maids were a little too quick to open the door after knocking  The staff of the hotel was very polite and friendly  The drink service at the gaming tables and pool area was very good  I very much enjoyed the pool area  which had a lively atmosphere  There were two pools and two hot tubs  However  one of the hot tubs was cold all four days we stayed there  There were plenty of towels and security was always on guard  We ate at the Dam Restaurant for lunch  The food was good  but service poor  I heard some of the staff members state that the restaurant was reduced to a  skeleton staff  to save money  which has had a proportional impact on customer service  The prices were very affordable  I appreciated the fact that the casino table limits were as low as         I walked across the parking lot to play Blackjack at the Tropicana where table limits were as low as        Overall I very much enjoyed my stay and believe I got an excellent value for only     a night  I had stayed at the Hilton Hotel for my only other trip to Las Vegas and if given a choice between staying at one hotel or the other for the same price  I would choose Hooter s  c T  Hardekopf 
P =>  Spot on for the cash Check in was easy  room comfortable and clean  The staff were generally happy and had more personality than at a lot of the casinos we played  Cant knock the location  short walk to MGM an New York New York  Dont really know why most people moan on here    what do you expect for    bucks a night      As long as you dont mind the smell of greasy chicken wings all the time and dont eat there  food was crap   you cant go wrong 
P =>  Could Have Been Better We stayed here cheap because we were going to one of those timeshare things  so i can t complain about the price  I would have never paid what they were asking for that night       This hotel is worth no more than         a night  Only stay here if you have a really really good deal  Pros  Right on the strip across from the MGM  behind Tropicana  Comfortable beds and pillows Casino has a laid back feeling Rooms have new furniture SafeCons  Small casino  Small simple pool Parking lot elevators sounded like they were going to break Only one hotel elevator was working  the other was out of order  Elevators were hot with no air conditioning You can see where parts of the rooms were remodeled  with paint peeling behind wood molding and bathroom floor damaged  Several large carpet stains in the hallwayI believe this would have been a much nicer hotel if they just would have knocked down the old hotel and built a new one  It just seemed like the cheap way to make a hotel  
P =>  Never again    I looked over other reviews and my experience was very similar to another one posted here  We reserved a king size bed far in advance and when we arrived to the hotel we did not learn of the two twin beds until we walked into the room  Dealing with the front desk and management become a common theme on this trip because they made no effort to make the stay enjoyable  We actually received better customer service walking through other hotels on the strip and we were not even staying there  When I asked about the bed set up in our room I was also told they do not guarantee bed preference  only the room it self and that no hotel on the strip guaranteed it  So I called around to test this statement and my first two calls proved them wrong  If it were not for the convention in town and every other hotel booked we would have cancelled our reservations and moved to another hotel  Hooters hotel is also less then spectacular  the paint was peeling of the ceiling  the rooms were very small  and all of the little things you would come to expect from a hotel on the strip were no where to be found  Its as if they expect to thrive on name alone  If it came down to staying there again or canceling the trip I would cancel and look for another vacation spot  Pretty frustrating after coming home from serving my country in the middle east  expecting a relaxing vacation and having what should have been a wonderful time ruined by the horrible customer service of the hotel you are staying at  Never again will I return to this hotel and I tell everyone I know to avoid it  you should do the same  
P =>  Hooters   Just OK    Hooters has hit the strip  However several improvements need to happen soon Casino   Small but unique  I really liked the music going and the atmosphere  However game limits were high and most of the people staying there are on a budget  The budget players would walk to Tropicana to play     I m not sure why they have the poker room but mostly play on   tables outside the poker room    You come in from the parking garage right next to these tables  Very distracting     Always people trying to get through   etc    Room   Well     I thought the room was ok    We had a view of the pool and airport  However the window was so dirty that if you wanted any pictures you had to slide it open and stick you arm out the window  We called   times to get the window clean but management never called back    They just DO NOT CARE    Parking   Well that is quick and easy but the elevators   Honestly they sounded like they were literally coming apart  A must fix  Parking is abundant  A bit hard to get through the garage as they are tight corners   Same way up is the same way down   Watch out for the other guy      I was expecting a cleaner place since it was recently redone  But that is far from True  A quick paint job  new beds and coverings and that is it    They even still used the same ole door hinges from the San Remo that have years worth of paint splatter on them   Only good thing going is the hooter girls    Poker room is a joke   Management is very weak there too   I will say I thought the RIBS at ino s were good  All you can eat for        Nice waiter   Good food    
P =>  service below expectations Let me preface this by saying that this is not a reflection of the above average service at the Hooters restaurant that is located in the Hotel  We booked a non smoking room with a king sized bed  Upon check in  the clerks behind the desk told us that they were completely booked solid  and only had smoking room with   beds  I asked for our money back  and were told that this was not possible  Several minutes of arguing later  a non smoking room with a kingsized bed  quot suddenly quot  became available We thought that this might have been an isolated event  but according to several other guests we spoke with  they were greated with an equally difficult time    men who had booked a room with   beds were told that only a room with a kingsized bed was available until they argued a bit with the staff Coming back from the pool in our towels and bathingsuits  our room key did not work  and even with ID the housekeeping staff refused to let us into the room  and one of us had to walk through the whole lobby and casino area  dripping wet in a towel to fix our key Besides these complaints  the hotel was very clean  the beds were very comfy  and the casino  restaurants and pool fostered a fun and exciting atmosphere  Not too far off the strip  and I would consider staying here again if I could get a good deal  
P =>  Awesome Time date          From WisconsinI recently stayed at the Hooter s Hotel  amp  Casino in il of     I was very surprised at how clean the casino area was  Check in went very smooth and fast  We did have trouble finding the elevators  but a friendly staff member named Michael showed us the way  The room was nice and clean  only problem was the noise coming from the pool area  Had excellent food and service at Dan nio s   We also won some money at the Casino    The price was right I will be staying here again  
P =>   A hotel that doesn t take itself too seriously Stayed at Hooters LV for   nights during early ober    Firstly lets get a couple of ground rules set  If you wish to stay in a mega resort with an abundance of shops  attractions and restaurants  then don t waste your time and money by coming here  However if you wish to stay in a good quality mid range hotel where you can get typical Hooters style food  ie wings  burgers and beer  whilst kicking back by a beach style pool area  then Hooters is definately for you  Located on the site of the old San Remo  next to the Tropicana just off the South end of the strip and across the road from the MGM Grand s hotel entrance  Hooters was hosting families  elderly couples and a large array of single women  as well as the ubiquitous single men  when we stayed there  It possesses the  quot Dan ino Steakhouse quot  which targets those who want a higher end feed as well as a generous buffet and snacks at the bar  A convenience store souvenir shop is located at one end of the casino floor and another souvenir shop is located at the other end of the casino floor as well  Check in was quick and efficient and friendly The rooms are what you d expect from a mid range hotel Vegas hotel  Neat  tidy two double beds and a more than adequate bathroom  Our room overlooked the pool area which was a good location  We had no problems with noise either in the hallways or from outside  A very well appointed gymnasium is located off the pool and was cheap by Vegas standards at only    USD per day  Overall I was more than happy with my stay at Hooters  One word of warning though  If you can t stand the sight of wood panelling then run a mile  You ll understand what I mean when you stay there   
P =>  Great Stay A group of   people from work who happen to be all men stayed at the Hooters Las Vegas because it was a great deal  I admit being the one who booked the trip that I was a bit nervous booking rooms at Hooters Hotel  The stay turned out to be much above expectation  The rooms were all new and very clean  They were all well decorated and the beds were very comfortable  Now I don t know if my wife could get over all the Hooters girls in the casino and lobby however for a group of guys this place was fantastic  I would have no problem staying at this property again and would rate it as a  star for the great price we payed of only     a night and the quality of the premises  
P =>   Hooters was great  We had a great stay at Hooters  The room was neat  clean and the bed was very  very comfortable  We had a nice view of that end of the strip  Room service was prompt  courtious and the food was excellent  The hamburgers we had at Pete and Shorty s were awesome The staff seems very happy and the service is excellent  We will definately stay there again  
P =>   Fun place no problems at all  I was leery about booking Hooters and was close to booking Imperial Palace or The Tropicana  we were on a budget  instead but ended up being really glad we went with Hooters  especially after seeing Imperial Palace  eek    We had no problems whatsoever at Hooters  we booked a guaranteed bungalow room through the website but were upgraded to a tower room on arrival  I d been hoping that would happen  The room was fine  very clean  the bed comfortable  the bathroom was good  cute basic toiletries etc  No issues with noise  no issues with anything actually  We ate at The Dam the first night  had a good pizza and some drinks  we liked it and prices were really reasonable  Played the slots and a little on the tables  it was more of a place where we d play for a little while on our way out and back in than where we d hang out for hours  It had a fun and homely feel though and it was a nice place to come back to at the end of a long day and night out  We found the location to be really good for us  especially for hanging out at New York New York  MGM  Aladdin Dessert Passage shopping centre  the Bellagio etc  If you want to be near Wynns  TI s or The Venetian  Hooters is up the wrong end for you and you d be better off staying closer to the middle of the strip  Don t worry about being just off the strip if you stay here   some of the hotels are so huge  ie  MGM  your room could literally be as far back off the strip as Hooters is situated  It took about   or   minutes to walk onto the strip so it didn t worry us at all  Overall  if you re not on a Bellagio budget  Hooters is a decent choice  
P =>   Above expectations The hotel is older but you can tell that they have kept it up  The room was great  We booked the bungalow with two queens  The room was large and the decor was perfect  The room even had a bar table with orange top chairs just like in the Hooter s Restaurant  The bathroom even included a sewing kit and Q tips  How thoughtful  The beds were comfortable and the room was quiet  Oh  and did I mention that they are located less than a block from the strip  The casino was smoky  and the elevators are old and slow  Free internet in the rooms  but no business center  
P =>   Not bad for the price We stayed there for my husband s   th birthday   his choice  I was leery at first because I had seen photos from when they first opened  Obviously they have remodeled since then  I was impressed with the cleanliness and comfort of the room  We were there for   nights and enjoyed it  The bed was super comfortable and the bathroom was very clean  We had a discrepancy with our bill  but a phone call to the accounting department had that solved within an hour  The casino is small compared to the super casinos on the strip  but all the games are there  My only complaint would be the poor ventilation within the casino  The smoke was heavy and almost unbearable for a non smoker on the weekend  Overall  I was impressed with the quality and am happy we chose this hotel for the price instead of a more expensive hotel with rooms that are just as decent  
P =>   Hooters Rocks What can I say  Hooters is FANTASTIC  The casino is small and felt personal  The cocktail waitresses were polite and prompt  and easy on the eye  but the Hooter girl dealers were distracting Rooms  fantastic  Heaps of room and had everything you need  I do not know what previous reviewers were on about as I had no issues with noise from neighbours  The pool area was good and the fire pit burning of a night meant I could sit outside and socialise over a beer or   Restaurants  Hooters was always busy but had no trouble getting a spot at the Dam Restaurant  Try the Nachos        and between   of us we could not finish them  HUGE  Will stay at Hooters again  no problems there  
P =>   Loved Hooters I have just returned after staying a week at hooters hotel in las vegas  This was my first trip to the area and wasnt sure what to expect  After reading the reviews i was very nervous  but got a great deal so took a chance  And I am very glad i did  The room was nice size and comfortable  The bed was amazing  We only had very nice and quick service  Upon getting to my room our safe was not working  i called the front desk and they had it fixed within   mins  We had no trouble with having hot water  but we never got up before noon  The casino is smaller compared to the others on the strip  but you dont have to wait for your comp  drinks like you do at the bigger ones  I would stay here again  it has a nice relaxed feeling to it  Travel tip  See the shark reef  ride the monorail or take the public buss or bye some really comfortable shoes youll be doing alot of walking  
P =>   Good value Stayed two nights  very busy week in Las Vegas and prices for last minute stays were OUTRAGEOUS at nearly every other resort  so I figured for    bucks a night  how can you go wrong  Check in was efficient and I was in my room in no time  Overall the room was clean   there were a couple of issues  stepped on a pretzel   but nothing terribly serious  Bed was fabulous  Great quality mattress  Roomy bathroom with nicer than average toiletries and good water pressure  Towels were nicer than average for a hotel in this price range  Pretty cool heated pool area  very nice lounge chairsMy friends all teased me for staying at Hooters   the rest of my group were at MGM  but I would stay here again  for a budget hotel it was very nice  
P => Great time at Hooters Everything was excellent My husband and i went with his hockey team and some players wifes   Really the only problem was the distance from everything on the strip    it was a ways a way from everything and the pool closed WAY to early  we went with a hockey team and we all wanted to go swimming one night and it wasn t open which really sucked  Everyone was very friendly and food was good The beds were very comfortable and the water nice and hot for showers  it also has a firepit out by the pools which was really nice All in all it was a very good stay and i d stay again at hooters 
P =>  I have seen better I stayed at Hooters with a group of girls at the end of ruary  The casino and rooms look exactly like the restaurant  nothing spectacular  It was cheap which was great but you really get what you paid for  The rooms were really cheesy looking but I didn t stay there for the decor  Our toilet overflowed and they only wiped it down with towels  My biggest complaint is how much the entire Casino smelled like cigarette smoke  It was a relief to walk out of there and go to the other nice smelling casinos on the strip  There isn t any place worth going to in the casino and the food at The Dam wasn t very good  How do you mess up a milkshake  I think this Hotel is good for a group of guys  gamblers and cigarette smokers  If you don t want to spend a lot of money and you don t mind smelling like an ashtray then this is a good place to stay  
P => enjoyed my one nite here    booked here last minute because jetblue canceled our flight   got a room for   bucks  but when i got to the hotel  they put us in a tower room   awesome  everything was clean  didn t smell of smoke   was very happy with the room for what we paid   plus it s quick walk to see some hotties dealing cards downstairs   this place is full of guys though  so u wont see many female customers    great job hooters  for providing a laid back hotel for a great price  i would stay here again    check out time here is noon  compared to   am or   am at other hotels on the strip 
P =>   A work in progress My wife  amp  I stayed at this property for one night in early   We were in town to see a concert at the MGM  We choose this property because of the close proximity to the MGM and the price  It s an older property in need of updating  but you can see where they are trying  The rooms were nicely decorated  The beds were super comfy and the bathroom was good sized  However  our room was in need of a new door and new sliding patio door  ours were old and rickety   The wall are thin  so you do hear a lot of noise  Being that it is a smaller older property  the corridors are narrow  which probably contributes to the noise factor The front desk staff was indifferent upon arrival and checkout  they were neither welcoming nor rude   We had one meal at the cafe  The waiter was nice and the food was good  but a bit pricey  Overall  for a night s stay it was fine  but we wouldn t consider a longer stay  
P =>  Ah     the smell of wings in the morning It was our  st time in Vegas  and we had a blast  We stayed at Hooter s for the obvious reason  cheap  We were under the impression that it was a brand new hotel  We thought  well you can t go wrong with new  This hotel is not new  It is old and barley refurbished  There were alot of great things about Hooters        tables which are hard to find elsewhere  Comfy beds  Resonable drink prices  Lots of cocktails while gambling bacause casino is small  Close to MGM NYNY  Hotwings are good when you are drunk  Chicken Squak on the phoneWith the price come quite a few of those  quot you get what you pay for quot  negatives   The shower was hot  amp  cold the whole time I showered  This sucks when you are hungover and want a long warm shower  The carpets are stained and gross  The elevators are stinky  small  and tempermental  You can t get away from the smell of wings and cigarettes  It is quite a walk to most of the strip  amp  cabs get expensiveOverall  I enjoyed the experience  I will probably stay at one of the larger hotel casinos next time  
P =>   Really enjoyed ourselves We vist Las vegas every year on our way to family and also stop there on the way back  We have tried other hotels but so far Hooters has been the one we return to and have told others its so central for what ever you need to get around L V The strip is only a walk away also getting the metro link plus the bus stop is right outside what more can you ask  No i am not a     but a     and i really enjoy staying here most people have been helpful and the rooms were clean and plesant as well  
P =>   Had a Blast    Had a one night stay at Hooters this past week and had a ball  Stayed there once before during the transformation from the old Sam Remo  All I can say is wow    The rooms are very nice and the Beds are as comfortable as they come  The Dam resturaunt breakfast was outstanding and the portions are huge  Hooters resturaunt was a great meal as well  The renovation of the pool area came out great  Gambling was good and the cocktail waitresses brought em as quick as you could put them down  Wish I had been able to stay a few more nights but it is what it is  I ll definately be back at a later date Fast pace Fun    Massachusetts Mike 
P =>   st Time at Hooters was Four Stars     Our Trip was Fri ember      Sunday      This was a superise trip for my husband as I told him at the airport we were going to Vegas  Was nervous after reading some reviews and after visiting hooters to gamble twice before the place just did not impress me  My husband was delighted to find we were staying at Hooters as any husband would  We rented a car and parked in the Parking Garage reluctlantly  There are some cameras in the garage try to park your car in a view of the camera that is what we did and never had a problem  There is no Valet here and the only other option is to park in the lot in between here and tropicana  Okay Beware of the Parking Garage Elevators one of them creaks and makes the most horrid noises it sounds as thought the box you are in is just going to pop  However we never got stuck and instead had a few laughs about it  Check in was a Breeze  the girl was friendly enough and I told her we were celebrating a special occasion and asked if there were any upgrades  She went and talked to her manager and offered me a Presidential Suite for     per night Upgrade or a International Suite for Free  We took the freebee  What a great room  We were in the Bayview tower which I think is the most accessable tower  Room     it was literrally right next door to the elevator which was a hoot  but seriously we never heard the elevator once or noise in the hallways which are very cute with surfboards and other cute decor  We entered the room to a huge entry way with a full bathroom  then a Bar with sink and fridge  palm trees Orange and Brown or  A huge plazma flat screen tv  little table to have cocktails at  a full size couch L shaped  the Bedroom was seperate and was very tropical themed I thought very cute  there was another TV  Desk  closet  and another Full Bathroom  We paid     a night what a deal  We went downstairs and sat at the    martini bar and enjoyed the live band that played yor requests  they rocked and we had a great time  We ate at the Damn Restrant a couple of times and the service was excellent and the food was too at a great price  Cute Diner   Also ate at Pete and shortys  had some wings and slider burgers they were good too  The people at the club orange werevery friendly and helpful  Sportbook guy was nice too  Cocktail service is Non existant here I once ordered a drink and never saw her again  We hung out by the pool at night they had nice fires in pits that you could sit or stand around  Really enjoyed how easy the property was to get around  Yes it is small but we enjoyed that  Spent a lot money in the Bait Shoppe on goodies to bring home and was diappointed I didnt get a chance to try the hidden sushi bar in the back  We enjoyed our stay and safely walked from Hooters into the tropicana where we won some   fast  also walked the four corners  went to Coyote Ugly was kinda fun  checked out the ceterfuge bar at MGM  All in all it was a great time  We are heading back to Hooters in ch and I am hoping the second time will be as awesome as the first  If it is we are going back in  and y and we will stay here again  Check out all my pictures of the room and view  etc  Enjoy Cheers friends 
P =>  We ll go back to Hooters  My husband and I     ish  stayed at Hooters uary        This was our first trip to Las Vegas  we are planning to return and will stay at Hooters again We arrived just before noon and got right into a room  The young lady at the front desk was very efficient and friendly  We requested to switch rooms because the sliding door would not lock and within       minutes we were in another room  The room was clean and comfortable  very Hootersesque with orange lampshades and bar stools and table  The bed may be the most comfortable we ve ever slept on We enjoyed breakfast   mornings at the Dam Restaurant and highly recommend this restaurant  We ate   times at Pete  amp  Shorties  the sports betting bar   which had a basic bar menu with appetizers  sandwiches and salads  we particularly liked the mini burgers and side salad  We had dinner one evening at the Hooters restaurant  your basic Hooters  and one evening at the Back Portch which is on the back side of Hooters and has the same menu  We spent most of our evenings at the Lobby Bar The atmosphere in the casino and the entire hotel is very casual  fun and laid back  we LOVED it  The casino is much smaller than the others we saw on the strip The only negative was on the last evening at the Lobby Bar when we were told our drinks would not be comped unless we had a minimum of     in the machine and playing max bets  new rules all of a sudden    We left and went to Pete  amp  Shorties where we were told the same thing  again  we had been here   days and had not heard this  Other than these    all servers were very friendly and efficient If you enjoy your local Hooters restaurant and the atmosphere  you will like the Hooters Casino Hotel in Vegas  
P =>  Low down at the Ho down      My boyfriend and I  in our early    s  stayed at Hooter s Casino and Hotel on Sat           to celebrate his birthday  We frequent the Vegas strip and stayed at the Mandalay  Imperial Palace  Rio  Bally s Harrah s  Paris  Bellagio    to name a few but since we were only there for    one  night and this was the Superbowl weekend  the prices of any hotels on the strip were astrinomical  Out of all the cheaper hotels we could have stayed at  my reason for choosing Hooter s was that it s new and the location   I knew their grand opening was just about a year ago and that it was very near the South Strip  next to Tropicana and accross from MGM    Booked reservation through tripres com for about        and was quoted a  quot Bungalow quot  style room  We ended up on the  nd floor on the Bay View tower next to the elevator   I asked why I was given a regular tower room and front desk said I need to pay     to reserve your request   Check in arrived at  p m   was quick and easy and rooms were ready and clean and a little bigger than what was pictured on the website  Cosmetic wise  the room was comfortable new  and inviting  furniture  sheets  bedding comfy    towels etc  all new and plush  The building structure needs repair  shower needs temp  control streams of hot water would jet out while showering walls are a bit thin  you could hear the neigbors opening closet doors and murmuring but we were surprised we didn t hear the elevators   and the elevators very tempermental  so please know your fire escape  Staff wise  everyone was average  they don t go out of the way to please you but just there to do their job and to answer questions  They might need to staff more cocktail waitresses cause it was very rare to have a comp  drink while playing the slots  If you ladies are worried about the taboo  only the cocktail waitresses are dressed the same as the girls at your local hooter s not the dealer s  the front desk  the Dam restauant workers etc    there s no girls gone wild here     Other than the  a m  fire emergency drill and a short direct t v  cable outtage at  a m   all was great  I would go back to the Hooter s hotel if the only purpose was just to rest  your in a city where there is something to do           It s better than the IP  Harrah s  the downtown Vegas hotels or any other OLDER hotels on the strip  But if you are looking for the Las Vegas experience  pay more and stay at the bigger hotels with more amenities  Other tips from other ta s  get the club orange card for store discounts      off   the Dam restaurant is like a old school Diner and prices are reasonable   had the prime rib for       and the burger   big  w  seasoned fries for           Casino has     blackjack and    war  Walk next to the Tropicana for    blackjack and go to the MGM for Sports Booking  Location is great just bring comfortable shoes  Only when we stayed at Hooter s  we noticed a tram at the MGM  don t know where it goes but we ll find out the next time we stay there  Have fun  
P =>  ent Place Stayed here for a night in ember and was pleasantly surprised  The rooms have a pseudo tropical feel   much different and nicer than I expected The mattress was comfortable and had decent bedding  including full length body pillows  However  I should note that the beds are pretty high off the floor  People with mobility problems may have some difficulty getting in and out of bed  No problems with the bathroom   everything was clean and functioned properly The sports book is a Leroy s so it s tiny and doesn t have drink service  You can sit at the VP bar and watch the games on the plasma TVs but you either have to milk the VP for free drinks or just pay  On the plus side  their parlay payouts are the best you ll find in LV and you can cash tickets under        think this is the max   at any of the other locations The casino is pretty small but the employees were friendly and the drink service was very good Overall  they have done a good job refurbishing this property  Just don t expect the wow factor  
P =>   Good value but beware if you park there A college friend and I met in Vegas for a bachelor party and we decided we needed a relatively inexpensive option since we would only use the room to sleep  We shared a room at Hooter s with two double beds  This hotel allowed Saturday night check in  which is rare in Vegas  and the price        was cheap in comparison to some of the bigger hotels on the strip  It was only a short cab ride to where we needed to be on the strip anyways Check in was smooth and easy and there were no mix ups with my pre paid reservation  The room was clean and nice  Nothing spectacular  but adequate in every way for a shower and a bed to sleep on  The casino is small but busy and patrons all seemed to be enjoying themselves  There is a small sports bar  an old school diner  a regular Hooter s restaurant  and Dan marino s  finer dining  on site  We opted for the Hooter s restaurant for lunch and the service was quick and friendly  The waitresses all wear the standard t shirt and orange shorts  both regular and cocktail waitresses on the casino floor   The only real negatives were one minor and one major complaint  The minor complaint is that the average patron was a little bit on the lower class side  This is to be expected at one of the chaper hotels near the strip  If they were high rollers that could afoord      night at Bellagio  they wouldn t be at Hooter s  This was of no consequence to us  but for those of you who feel uneasy around lower socio economic people you might consider spending more money elsewhere  We were stared down by two imposing ex con looking guys near the diner  for no apparent reason  but we just laughed it off The major complaint is that my friend s truck that was parked overnight in the Hooter s parking garage was broken into and several items were taken  resulting in a      deductible   I would not recommend parking here  Other than that  it is a decent value for the     I can highly recommend Tao restaurant  at Venetian  for dinner and Pure nightclub  in Caesar s  for clubbing  if you have the     Our group of friends were high rollers from the East Coast and we were able to enjoy top notch VIP service at both of these locales  
P =>   Excellent hotel I stayed here for   nights in     th and   th   I arrived at       and was given a twin Ocean View room  The room was very nice  it actually seemed quite new  I was staying on the   th floor and I had a view of McCarran Airport  which was quite cool  The floor I was on was very quiet and I didn t hear my neighbours at all during my stay  I recieved a     voucher for Dan inos on arrival and I ate here one of the nights  The food was very good and the service was very good The overall atmosphere of the hotel is very casual  which suits me fine as I don t really like the formality of most of the other hotels I would defintely stay here again  just make sure that you avoid the bungalow rooms 
P =>   sweet suite After reading the bad reviews about cabanna rooms  I upgraded to a suite  Good move  because we had the  quot presidential suite quot  for the entire stay  for the price of the  quot regular suite quot    Hooters overbooked the reg  suites   The suite was large    full bath    half baths  pool table  bar with mini fridge and coffee maker  Living room with    quot  HD plasma tv and sectional sofa  which can be converted to a bed   Between the pool table and living area is a dining table for six  The master bedroom had another TV  not HD or flat screen   and a jacuzzi tub  with an ajoining marble bath with a shower and double bowl sink  Hooters overall is a LITTLE casino  Not many choices in table games  only   craps tables  only   of which was running during our stay  Slots are from penny up to a dollar or more  Drink service is hit or miss  mostly miss  Table players get better service than slot players  unless Alana is working the slot area  A BIG TY to Alana for awesome service while playing penny slots  The pool area is small in comparison to other nearby hotels  but is heated  and has   separate hot tubs  I did see people in both the pool and hot tub  even though the outside temp  was below freezing at night and only in the    s to    s during the day  We only ate at the Dam and had room service  both are equal to a Denny s or Cracker Barrel  I would stay here again  Clean rooms  easy walk to other casinos  great price  
P =>   Don t give a hoot for Hooter s I arrived on Saturday morning and was allowed to check in right away  The room seemed okay at first  but my opinion changed when it was time to go to bed  This property caters to a    something crowd  and with the low room rates  that s what it attracts  At      am  both nights of my stay  I was awakened by loud  partying neighbors  The walls are thin and noise from everywhere including the street comes right in  The heating unit was loud  but fortunately it drowned out some of the noise from the room next door  The casino is small and cramped  The blackjack tables are all single deck     games  or tables with side bets  Not a place for serious players  The sports book is tiny and along the back wall of a restaurant  The Hooter s girls were attractive  but most cocktail waitresses in Vegas casino s are attractive  I dined in ino s  The Dam  and ordered room service  The food quality and service was quite well for each  I also needed a fresh towel brought to my room  and housekeeping brought it in a matter of minutes  All of the staff I dealt with were very polite and customer oriented  Personally  I won t stay at Hooter s again  The concept is good and I feel if they had built a hotel casino from the ground up  rather than renovating a property that should have seen the wrecking ball years ago   it would have made for a better experience  
P => Better than expected It was going to be New Year s weekend and I had a daughter turning    on ember   th  I needed something within walking distance of the strip at a reasonable price because I needed three rooms  It was actually a friend who spotted this bargain on line after she heard about our plans and decided to join us  Our price was         night and even at that price I don t think they were full by New Year s eve  Check in was a breeze and despite one room not being immediately ready  it was    minutes later  They put our    yr old  and her boyfriend  next to us and my other daughter directly across the hall  Very convenient for our meeting during our three nights there  Rooms were comfortable  linens upgraded  bathrooms only average to less than average  There is no desk  Walls were thin but we never had any real problems with that  We dined in the Dam Restaurant a number of times  for lunch  breakfast and a late night snack  Service there was great  a rarity in Las Vegas  I ate in Hooters on two different occassions  in each instance service was excellent  This despite the second time it being five of us and being during the lunch hour on Sunday  in the middle of NFL football  Lines were    people long but we were in within ten minutes The staff was well trained consistent with all of their locations I was told   But I save my biggest compliments for  quot    tini quot   the lounge where my daughter had her first official drink  The waitress  Brittany  took note of the occassion  asked her what she wanted for her first drink and delivered that drink on the house at the witching hour of midnight  In a crowded bar with a rock n  roll band playing in the background she didn t have to pay that much attention  She did  the band acknowledged the event    it was all good  In summary  we could have stayed next door at the Tropicana for twice the price  but didn t  We could have searched for good food with good service and more price at the MGM across the street  but wouldnt  We could have been considered just another cow following the herd but Hooters couldn t  They cut us from the pack on a couple of occasions and made us feel special  I will be back in Las Vegas in three weeks for a convention and I will be staying at Caesars  It will be nice and I will like it  But I will miss the homey feel of the     room Hooters as compared to one of these mega hotels  Hooters was the perfect location for our Birthday New Year s trip 
P =>   Clean and a great value The first thing to keep in mind is that the tower rooms are new  while  I think  the bungalow rooms are not  I think this explains the disparities in the reviews  We got there REALLY early        am   My husband went to ask if they could call us on our cell when our room was ready  and when I got to the desk  we were checked in already with no extra charge  I ve never had that happen anywhere else  It probably isn t common here  either  but it made our day  We got in a tower room and it was the cleanest hotel room I ve been in in a while  We had a non smoking room that had really never been smoked in  unlike most non smoking rooms and it was bigger than it looked online  It looked over the pool  not the Strip  but it was only    bucks a night over Christmas  The restaurant had a nice little breakfast buffet and ridiculously huge plates of nachos along with friendly service  The casino is nice  with fairly loose slots and better than average cocktail servcie from Hooters girls  Frankly  the Hooters girl uniform is one of the most modest cocktail waitress uniforms on the strip  so don t let the Hooters thing throw you if the restaurant isn t your thing  
P =>   Great value enjoyable stay We stayed at Hooters     th      nd with another couple  My husband and I booked a  quot free quot  Second Honeymoon package with Condolidated resorts  We had to listen to a   hr  timeshare presentation on a new property called  quot Tahiti Village quot  and our stay was basically free  Hooters is the hotel they put us up at  We were pleasantly surprised  Our room was clean  and spacious  Definitely not luxurious by any means  but certainly comfortable and we had a great view of the strip  We requested a non smoking King and got it  although the entire hotel  and all of Las Vegas for that matter  smelled like an ashtray  I guess there s only so much you can do about it when everyone on the casino floor is smoking  The Dam Restaurant had an awesome breakfast buffet with the best bacon we ve ever had   you have to try it  They also made a great milkshake  The Hooters restaurant had the typically great wings  but we didn t eat at any of the other restaurants We really didn t do a lot of gambling  but found the casino at the hotel to be a welcomed respite from all of the other over the top  in your face casinos that we were in The fitness center looked really well equipped  and the pool area was very nice  although with the weather rarely reaching above    degrees while we were there  it was closed  They did have fire pits out there if you felt like sitting out campfire style All in all  if we ever do go back to Vegas  we would definitely stay at Hooters again  
P =>   super   full of drunken rednecks we lucked into the last parking spot in front of the building and walked up to the front desk  After several clerks got done chatting amongst themselves one went out of there way to help us and we were checked in then  we got to drag our luggage all the way through the casino to the elevators in back We got into our room and it was about average for hotels in the area  about what one would expect from a holiday inn except the colors were a bit more orange  and there were bar stools instead of chairs  Taking a quick nap being venturing forth into vegas we were woke up my the people next door shooting at each other coming back that night there were numerous piles of garbage from room service left in the hallway which were still there the next morning  Coming back late the next evening  our room wasn t cleaned  I don t think our room was cleaned once over a   day stay And don t be fooled about it being a  quot new quot  hotel  it was an old hotel with the casino remodeled and the rooms look like they got new furniture and maybe carpet  
P =>   Comfortable at Hooters My wife and I stayed at Hooters for   nights in ember and loved it  The rooms were clean and comfortable  the staff were very friendly  there is a nice pool and hot tub that were open and they have plenty of places to eat  The breakfast buffet at Dam s restaurant was good  There were even fresh strawberries  raspberries  blueberries and blackberries  which is unusual  Hooters was only a short walk to MGM Grand and Tropicana  Excaliber  etc  The casino is small enough that I could always find my wife and the payback at the slots were just as good as anywhere else The only negative comment would be they were only offering        blackjack tables during our stay while other casino s on the strip had       tables  Also  we were facing the airport which was loud sometimes but at least the windows open and the fan would block out the planes taking off We would definitely stay at Hooters again  
P =>   Great hotel great experience I am   yo who travelled with my best friend  Room cost     after tax  checkin was early and very easy at       am and room was very clean with no smell  Got  th room overlooking the beautiful pool  I saw all of   people total at the pool  but it was there and looked great and warm  Booked though hotels com and recieved a few credits including     at inos  Ate there and it was decent  nothing to write home about  except the    coronas  Bill was still cheap after the credit  Check out the       prime rib and get fries with it  not very classy but tastes great  although my Mid rare  was mid well  oh well  Strip is a three minute walk  From the airport you can take a shuttle for    each  a cab for reportedly       or the public bus for      all day pass  or       each way  I opted for the public bus which you can pickup on level zero  Take     or     to the     conector  very easy and quick  just about    minutes  Check out low limits at Barbary Coast  Slots a fun outside Circus Circus  nearby Tropicana  
P =>   Better than expected Stayed at Hooters Hotel on Sunday night      after staying overnight at Arizona Charlies atur  see other review   Paid     with credits towards dining at inos I was pleasantly surprised with the location  Walking distance to the  quot strip quot  and hotels on the south side  across MGM  next to Tropicana  near New York  New York  Excalibur  etc   The service was average  but the rooms were definitely better than expected  I stayed in the Ocean View section and the rooms seemed to be upgraded and did not show signs of wear tear  The casino on the other hand  was small  about    craps  blackjack  pai gow tables  and the Poker Room  dubbed Pete s Poker Room  was very cramped with only   or   tables  I missed the Sunday poker tournament  but I think it would have been fun  for only     Didn t get a chance to use the     dining coupon  because Dan ino s restaurant is only open for dinner Overall  I like the hotel  I ve stayed at a worse r  ones  so this one wasn t too bad  I would definitely recommend this hotel for the budget conscious travelers who want to stay closer to the strip  
P =>   Will DEFINITELY return    Both my and my sister s families  kids included  stayed at Hooters over Thanksgiving week  We all loved it    It s super close to the airport and right off the Strip behind Tropicana  We were able to take the MGM tram which was directly across from the Hotel or cab it to the far end of the Strip using back roads and avoided the traffic for a few bucks The Casino is small enough to find the other members of your party without searching for hours but big enough to have some breathing room  The entire staff was very laid back and friendly and the dealers were great    Murphy and Rob kept my sister and I laughing for hours  Lastly  the cocktail waitress  who are all Hooters girls  were quick to come around with drinks and SUPER sweet  especially Toi The rooms were very clean  comfortable and big  we even had an awesome view of the Strip  The pool was still open and was heated so whole family was able to spend a day outsided swimming and playing    even had wings delivered poolside by a beautiful bikini clad Hooters girl  which our husbands enjoyed   As for entertainment  the house band at    was AWESOME  played everything from Train to Pat Benetar   Plus Wednesday nigths ladies drank free for       The Hooters Restaurant had all the games on so the guys got their football fix  And the Dam Restaurant served great food  the Prime Rib for    was the deal   All in all it was a great stay and we will definitely stay there our next trip to Vegas  
P =>  great I have recently returned from a stay here and I must say what a fantastic experience is was  The check in was smooth and quick although I was a little worried when the young lady at the desk started by saying  quot sorry about this but we are fully booked  wouldyou mind if I put you in a suite for the first night quot  phew what a relief  the suite was really nice and plenty of room  with a gigantic plasma screen tv in the living area  The next day when we were moved to a standard room I was again pleased with the room loads of space and the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in The staff here were all very pleasant and everyone had a smile on there face  All in all this is one of the best kept secrets in Vegas  and I will return on my next visit   
P =>   Enjoyed my stay I enjoyed my stay at the Hooters Hotel Casino  As soon as I entered I was smiling and laughing  The decor is just like being at your local Hooters  Only Hooters would have a tin ceiling with a chandelier in a casino My room was in the   story bungalow section  I liked being over there vs being in the main building  Had an excellent view of the pool area  and that is a big plus at Hooters  Bed was so comfortable  and everything was great with the facilities I especially enjoyed  quot The DAM Restaurant quot  for meals  Enjoyed seeing the Alan Kulwicki   Hooters NASCAR championship car in its permanent display  
P =>   Great Getaway Weekend We just got back from The Hooters Hotel was perfect for our group  We are all between the ages of       and the atmosphere was so relaxing and just fun  We got there at   in the morning on Thursday Morning and Left Sunday at Noon  From the moment we stepped into the hotel we all fell in love with it  Well the guys mostly fell in Love with the Hooter s girls  The rooms were VERY nice and oh gosh the beds are perfect   My boyfriend wants to buy that kind of bed now  The price was great  we booked at the perfect time  We got   rooms for   nights for       all together  The swimming pool was perfect  and it had a little like camp fire pits around the pool which was great at night  The pool was heated also  I heard a lot of bad reviews about this hotel but I am glad we went there  Everybody loved it there  Perfect place for those who want to have fun and be close to the action  
P =>   Fantastic Value for Money We only paid     a night to stay at Hooters and  because it was so cheap  only booked to stay for half our holiday in case it was a dive   we wished we d stayed the whole time  The rooms were big  clean and comfortable and the hotel is a five minute walk from MGM Grand and New York  New York  The staff were pleasant too  We ate at the Dam restaurant twice  once for breakfast and once for dinner         for a prime rib dinner  bargain  We heard some americans complaining about the standard of the hotel but  as a brit  I thought it was fantastic value for money and would definitely stay there again   half the price of a travel inn but double the room size and nicer to boot  
P =>   Hurray for Hooters   Just got back from a   day trip to Vegas stayed at Hooters on Saturday and Sunday nights  rates of     and       We loved the hotel  Great location directly across from MGM and next to Tropicana  We stayed on the  th floor at the end of the hallway so there was no noise at all  Our room was spotless and looked brand new  new carpet  new furniture  great fluffy towels in bathroom   For the price and location  Hooters was great  We did gamble here before going to the airport  We usually play at    blackjack tables but they only had     tables  go next door to the Trop for      The dealers were very friendly and we actually won some money before going home     Took a cab to the airport and the total only came to       so that was great also  I can t understand the bad reviews   although I would definitely not stay in the bungalow rooms  around the pool  separate buildings   Heard some complaints about those  Would definitely stay here again and would recommend  We didn t eat here but heard from some people that DAM restaurant was good  
P =>   Fantastic hotel You cant go wrong with this hotel perfect location opposite the mgm grand very clean very welcoming first class accomodation at a bargain price could not have wished for a better stay would go back tommorow if I couldn you wont be dissapointede thats for sure  
P =>   Dont Stay Here This hotel is horrible  I m a    year male who went with three other friends to Las Vegas for spring break last spring  My friends insisted on this hotel because it was Hooters  I resisted after reading reviews on this site  and knowing that you don t go to  quot Hooters quot  expecting to meet women  Apparently my friends don t realize this  probably why they remain single   Well  we arrived early and the desk clerk was nice enough to give us our room key and let us check and see if the room was ready or not  We go up and the room is filthy which  I expected because it hadn t been cleaned yet and  its Las Vegas  We booked a  quot suite quot   Tthis nothing more than an apartment room and an adjoining single room with a bathroom  its a joke  We go back down let the front desk know the room isn t ready and go back up   hours later  The room is  quot cleaned quot   but still smells of stale cigarette smoke and vomit  Not only this but we drop our bags and begin to walk around and the floor is soaking wet in the whole living room  We call mantinence and they do nothing so we complain and receive a new room not a  quot suite quot   along with the discounted price  This room is dirtier than the first one but at least the carpet s not wet  We also found roaches  the kind you step on  AND the kind you smoke  and on that note you have to deal with people offering you drugs on the elevator I really can t put into words how cheap and nasty this place is  I mean four guys in their twenties hated this place  thats how bad it is  Its important when in Vegas to decide where you will spend most of your time  If on the strip  spend the money and stay at a decent place like Mandalay Bay  New York  Bellagio  My favorite was the Venetian  If you are looking for a good time and cheap thrills  and some cool bars  stay downtown in Old Vegas  Hotels are more important in Vegas than anywhere else  because everything is centered around them on the strip  Heed my advice stay away from this hotel  
P =>  Laid back atmosphere After staying in Excalibur down the way from this hotal for the first   days of our trip we headed to Hooters to check in  Much smaller hotal then the others that are connected like Luxor and Excalibur  Waited a few minutes to check in and the guy at the desk seemed confused at what he was doing but no biggy we were given our room keys and away we go  The hotal is a little crowded being smaller then other hotals in the area  Its at the end of the strip near the motal    Everything is wood and orange like a Hooters restaurant The room was clean and bright whic is more then I can say for the Excalibur  Same amount of room with   double beds and room to lay out a air mattress we brought due to we are   guys  Good options to stay in your such as Directv sports that can be ordered  Being from Canada and wanting to catch the hockey game we tried to order through the remote but wasn t working  Called down to the desk and was hung up on by accident and then tried agian and spoke with Robert who said try again in a few minutes and he hung up Waited a few minutes and it worked and we enjoyed the live hockey from Montreal  Had some ice cold brews we bought at a gas station which was much cheaper then anything in the hotals  Ate and drank once at the on site hooters restaurant which I think is one of the worst restaurants out there in food quality which I still feel the same  Ate mosly at the   hr dinar called the Dam which had       prime rib which was the best deal in Vegas we found  Ate at Dan marinos and was the best meal we had all week but also costed the most at a cool     before tip for a steak  They do have other lower cost foods so don t get scared away Most people said there wern t that much hooter girls around but I saw plenty from working in the resaurant or dealing at a table in the casino there was no shortage of the eye candy  Not a whole lot going on in the hotal as in shows so we walked to the other hotals  Saw Howie Mandel at MGM and Fantasy a topless revue at Luxor which are only        mins away  
P =>   I Hate Hooters     Parking Elevators are on their last legs and smells bad  Was treated rudely by the front desk girl as soon as we checked in  The room smelled musty and the bathroom is a dump  Took forever for the water to get hot and drainage pipes smelled like sewage coming out of them  No fridge in the room  Very Thin Walls and you could hear your neighbors and housekeeping talking and gossiping  For the Price We paid We could have got better Hotel on the strip  Im pissed that I cancelled a room at the Stratosphere for this dump  I would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone  More like a Roach Motel than a Hotel  
P =>   Very nice hotel very pretty girls We stayed at the Hooters hotel for two nights and my husband and I agree that it was a good choice to stay there  The hotel is located close tot the strip  The staff was very friendly and the room was clean and cosy  We ate at the Hooters restaurant twice and the food is really good  try the chicken wings  The girls are sweet and pretty  The pool is clean and they provide towels  Overall we enjoyed our stay very much

P =>  Nice surprise  I didn t know what to expect from Hotel   and was pleasantly surprise by this hotel  It delivered on the promises made in the marketing email I received  
P =>   Nice but way overpriced I have stayed in some nice penthouses on the strip including my favorite the skylofts at MGM  I stayed in a   bedroom penthouse at hotel    and even though it was nice it was average  The cost was       per night  The skylofts run from              per night for a   floor   bedroom penthouse  The only thing that was better in this room over the other penthouses were the bathrooms  They could of used a better TV in the bathrooms but that aside they were nice  Hotel    prides themselves on saying they are a sister to the Skylofts  Well in this comparrison the Skyloft is a bikini model and Hotel    is the pretty girl next door that just has that   weird thing about her that you just can t really put your finger on LOL  I would visit again if the room was more like           per  No extras like free beverages or snacks in your room  They do offer some free treats all day down the hall  I didn t find anything in there I was crazy about but they do go the extra mile in there for you  Very nice people  They cater to you but don t crowd you like the skylofts  One thing I disliked and find trashy is the bathroom is all glass even the entrance door to the bathroom  I don t and I repeat don t want to see someone going to the bathroom  The bathroom should have a wooden door  It s like this in a regular suite also I was told  No women is that pretty to be seen using a bathroom       now add    years of marriage to that and it gets sadder LOL  Didn t use the pool  They have a floating river and wave pool but its very small  Mandalay bay has the same type of pool area but the wave and river pools are much much larger then Monte carlo  hotel      The casino was fun but very low maximum bets      on   card poker and Let it ride  The tables had low minimun bets though    and      The slots were very loose  One other thing  The web site makes the penthouses seem better then they really are  They are nice but at a reasonable rate  Have fun  
P =>   Low key hotel with great location on the Vegas Strip I have stayed in Vegas many time but never at the Monte Carlo  It was a great value during the over priced Labor Day weekend  It was a low key hotel  You can t beat the location  
P =>  Great rooms and service I stayed at Hotel    in the      sqft Loft suite and it was fantastic  My stay was comped but these rooms normally go for      a night  All   nights of my stay were quiet and comfortable  If you book a room at Hotel     they will send a limo to pick you up from the airport and take you to the main Monte Carlo entrance  There a suite assistant will greet you and escort you to the   nd floor to check in  There is almost never any line up at the hotel    front desk  The assistants will take you for a tour of your room and teach you how to use the LCD control box to turn on the TV s  lights and drapes  Even the shower is electronic  I was impressed  The bed was extra comfy The Monte Carlo itself is a very quiet casino compared to the others on the strip  In the evenings  other hotels would be full of people gambling  walking around  drinking  etc  The Monte Carlo just didn t compare  especially in the category of having beautiful people around  Sigh  The gambling for this trip was fantastic for me and I was able to leave Las Vegas as a winner  Drink service at the tables were average and the dealers on the most part were friendly and wanted you to win  I ate at the    hour Cafe and the Pub once and the food was above average  Didn t try the buffet but I ve had it before in prior trips and it was ok  I saw Terry Fator and Love this trip and I liked Terry Fator the best  Love was kind of boring for me but I m not old enough to appreciate the Beatles Overall my stay at Hotel    was great  My room  food and beverage was all comped  I highly recommend Hotel    as a great floor to stay on but the casino itself could be a little more alive  
P =>  Hotel      A New Hotel and a good experience I have to be in Las Vegas for business and having stayed in most of the hotels I am keen to try the new ones  I heard about Hotel    on the top of the Monte Carlo a few weeks ago and it got me excitied In the last week I was able to experience it  the process is very cool  Once you book they called me to arrange the free limo trip from the airport   I love this as I hate the taxi line   When I arrived my suite assistant took me to the hotel on the    floor  They have a lounge where I was offered a drink and snacks etc Then Amber   the suite assistant  took me to my Studio     the room is decorated in a cool white colour scheme and it had a massive long blue sofa  They gave me a fruit arrival ammenity and free Voss water That night I got a turn down and a small chocolate plate was left for me in my room  Breakfast was great in the lounge and I could see them building City Centre I had a great stay in the hotel  the team are working hard to make this special and it was  I will return if only for the Limo ride 
P => 
P =>   It was a nice stay Our stay was nice  the roomwas spacious and clean  The staff was very friendly and helpfull  Everyone at this hotel was courteous  helpful and worked to make our stay fantastic  My room included fridge  microwave and coffee maker and the most important thing  i Had free wifi with strong signal  They have a good restaurant on site were you can order cuban food  Parking was free  i did expect less for the money i paid but the room was very nice  A grocery store is within walking distance and opened   hs  I did enjoy the three nights i stayed there  Will definitely stay again  
P =>   It was a good place After reading some reviews we stil decided to stay at this Howard Johnson  I didn t expect much   BUT I was surprised when I got to the hotel     I had originally booked this hotel for   day  I ended up staying for a week  Staff was very friendly and helpful specially the manager Omid  For the price this hotel was outstanding  they have a huge lobby and a very nice Cuban restaurant  My room was clean and was very spacious with a balcony and free internet  was very spacious with a balcony and free internet  internet  Location was ok  the hotel is conveniently located between Las Vegas Strip and Downtown  just   to    minutes away from the main casinos and parking is free everywhere  For what we paid we felt like it was a great deal  I would definitely consider staying here again  We were very pleased with our stay  
P =>   Pleasant Surprise After reading some reviews we still decided to stay at this Howard Johnson  I didn t expect much   BUT I was surprised when I got to the hotel    I had originally booked this hotel for   day  I ended up staying for a week  Staff was very friendly and helpful specially the manager Omid For the price this hotel was outstanding  they have a huge lobby and a very nice Cuban restaurant  My room was clean and was very spacious with a balcony and free internet Location was ok  the hotel is conveniently located between Las Vegas Strip and Downtown  just   to    minutes away from the main casinos and parking is free everywhere  For what we paid we felt like it was a great deal  I would definitely consider staying here again  We were very pleased with our stay  
P =>   Okay for a one shot deal wouldn t stay there again  The services were okay  did not like the room at all The location was too far from the strip Needs a lot of work  Was rather old and seedy   
P =>   Dirty This was the worst place I have ever stayed in Las Vegas  Parking is outback and you must walk around the building to enter  In the most dangerous place in town employees warn not to walk alone  Rooms are clean but the cock roaches will keep you busy trying to avoid them  Facilities close at   pm and doesn t open untill  am  Place is surrounded by strip clubs so it s not a good place for a family visit  Only good thing about the place was the Las Vegas police occupied the sidewalk in front of the building after dark  
P =>  Is this where cops is filmed    The room was old and needs updating  Some of the wall outlets did not work and some of the lamp cords were cut  
P =>   Fine if you are on a tight budget I stayed here for two nights in ch  The hotel is on the strip  about half way between the big casinos and downtown  Yes  the room was worn and the furnishings tired  but you get what you pay for and this place was a bargain  The sheets and towels were clean  the kingsize bed comfortable enough  and at     a night  through Venere com  I had no complaints  Las Vegas was heavily booked while I was there  The big casino hotels were charging over      a night  and closer to my arrival date the HoJo rate climbed to over       which I would not have been happy to pay  The hotel has a pool which looked fine  though I didn t use it  There is a large parking lot behind the hotel  and I got high speed internet for free  I wouldn t recommend this as a place for hanging out  but if you just want a bed  it s a reasonable choice  
P => Great deal good restaurant decent pool For only     per nite  we were able to sleep our family of    have a nice dip in a pool   amp  a great breakfast  It s on the strip  yes  but you need a car  It s an easy drive to the downtown casino area or the fancy casinos on the main part of the strip  But  none of the casinos charge for parking  so it s no problem to have to drive there I loved the cuban toast and cafe con leche for breakfast at the Florida cafe One downside  the ice machines could not keep up with the demand  
P =>   Short in cash    stay here  Just want to let everyone know that this hotel motel is at the far end of the strip  like   blocks the other side of the Stratosphere and Sahara  So its a hike to the strip  Close to Fremont though  We ended up getting   nights with tax for         Great Price  We checked in and were directed to our room  which was not in the main building where the lobby is located  There are   buildings    where the lobby is and then another building which doesn t attach the the hotel lobby  more of a MOTEL than a hotel  i d say  anyway  so they stuck us in the  quot motel quot  part  The room was     degrees  there was an a c unit  but it was more of a  quot in the wall ai conditioner quot  and boy was it LOUD  So the room is small  ran down and looks NOTHING like the pictures that we saw on the internet  I made up my mind I wasn t staying there  I went to the lobby and asked for the manager  I explained my complaints to him and he said   quot no worries  I will upgrade you quot   I feel that they advertised one room on the web in hopes of booking their rooms and then when you get there they stick you in the most run down rooms that they have  Only when I complained was I offered a better room  a room like the one that I saw on the web  So after we got our stuff moved to the new room  things were good  A little skimpy on the towels and the shower pressure wasn t the greatest  but what do you expect for    bucks a night  right  
P =>  Good option A good option if you don t find accomodation in the principal hotels  Near the strip  no noise  clean and gently people working on it  A nice place to stay for what you pay  We stay there the last weekend of april       My husband and I were very scare for what we read in the reviews  but everything was ok  
P =>   Adequate So my confirmed reservation at at Bally s didn t exist on their computer system when I tried to check in at the airport  So  I needed a hotel room on a Saturday night on what seemed to be the busiest Sat ever in Vegas  For example  riott had no rooms within    miles  Everywhere I called was sold out Finally I was grateful to get the room here Shuttle driver from the airport gently ribbed me regarding location   the  less desirable  end of the strip apparently although  quot I should be OK if I stick to the strip quot   Its far end of the strip   its really downtown   not a great location  little going on other than weddings  Certainly not  strip central   However  as my main concern was sleeping after a trans alantic flight it wasn t an issue First impressions  Not bad internally  Nice room overlooking pool  Bit basic but what do you expect  Free wifi worked well  The Cuban style cafe on site is relatively lively and is entirely adequate for a sandwich and beer The downside  Thin walls  hear people moving above and in corridor  Room could have been cleaner   the edges and under the bed weren t great Light switching system poor  Light by the bed is controlled by the master switch by the door   which also controls the entrance area light  No master light switch by the bed  Yes  the light by the bed can be turned off independently but this doesn t turn the entrance area light off  Turning the entrance area light off  using master switch by door  results in bedside light being turned off  Net effect is that you MUST turn light off by the door and thus make your way to the bed in darkness   madness So in summary  entirely adequate  I paid       for the night which was outrageous  its really a         per night place IMHO  but when every hotel room in the city is full  and as I checked in they were quoting      per night for their last   rooms which they sold judging by the  sold out  posters on the doors this morning  it was a bed for the night and could have been worse   a lot worse  
P =>  Great for the price  This is a great hotel for all the right reasons  It is clean  the staff goes out of its way to be helpful  it is reasonable  It s the kind of hotel Europeans love    they know what s important  It is AAA rated   diamonds  The one drawback is its location  You are a few blocks north of the Stratotower  so really not close to the action on the Strip or downtown   It is right next to the Little White Chapel where Britany Spears and a ton of celebrities got married   You ll have to taxi around  drive  or take the new Deuce bus service that goes up and down the Strip and lets out a few feet from the door  About a half year old  the Deuce  so called because it is a double decker  costs    a trip  or    unlimited trips over    hours  It s supposed to run every    minutes  and depending on the time of day  it is close  Busy times  the buses tend to bunch up  If you have a pet  this is the only place to go on the Strip except for the Four Seasons at  x the price  The Cuban restaurant on site is excellent  but not owned by the hotel  so you can t charge meals to your room  but take credit cards  There is an additional American menu for breakfast and kids  meals  The wedding chapel off the lobby is busy and a never ending entertainment as you watch couples with families and friends bustle around on the big day  
P =>  Don t look under your bed  We were already concerned when we read the reviews for this hotel after our friend had made reservations  The carpet in the room was obviously very dirty and felt crusty under the feet  My friend immediately noticed some type of stain on the wall  We were better off suspecting it was spit of some kind  I attempted to turn the television on and it did not work  I looked behind the dresser and found the TV wasn t plugged in  I also found several empty beer bottles and other trash behind the dresser  I decided to do some more investigating and found several more bottles under the bed including broken glass  The sheets were old and the entire room felt dirty  My friend described it as being   the only time he took a shower and still felt dirty  The next morning we were out waiting in the hotel parking lot to start the days events  I looked down and what do I find  A small dime bag containing methamphetamine  I complained of the condition of the room several times to the staff and got promises it would be taken care of  The bottles were never even picked up I would not recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a safe  clean  drug free place to stay  My group was mostly made up of police officers and we were even concerned for our own safety in this area  Be careful  
P =>  Overpriced and disappointing Highly overpriced for the quality of the room  We wanted to avoid the hassle of going all the way into town as we just needed a quick nights rest between two cities  However  the hassle would have been worth the lost sleep we suffered  You can stay at a bigger hotel such as the Stratoshere for a third of the price and at least have a decent room  Our room was very run down  the lights didn t work  no remote control and were visited by a local cockroach  Not to much that being a motel as opposed to a hotel  it is extremely noisy  The only nice thing was the shuttle service to and from the airport and the staff were pleasant enough  
P => Horrendous This hotel is beyond shabby  it is scary  The delicate pattern of moth holes and cigarette burns in the curtains let just enough light in from the parking lot for me to watch  with great enthusiasm for  AM  roaches playing what looked like polo on the ceiling  As if more than the overwhelming scent of chemicals was needed to confirm the installation of new carpet  trimmings  dirt  and plaster was left as evidence in the entry way  I found it difficult to shower  shave  and brush my teeth while attempting to hover in order to not touch anything in the bathroom  This hotel could be well worth the money if your idea of a great place to spend a night includes wondering if the people in the room next door could actually see you through the thin walls  you don t mind sleeping  in my case watching roaches  in roughly the same position as the meat in a taco  or you can actually hover  I  sadly cannot   There is no price at which I would stay there again

P =>   Different in a good way  I ve stayed at Hyatts before  but never at the business traveler oriented Hyatt Place  This one is kitty corner to the Hard Rock Casino amid a maze of streets that end abruptly and or are one way  which I don t think they were a few years ago   Keep in mind that the Hard Rock is close by because this property has no casino    it s here for business  baby If you re just looking for a nice place to stay  and don t necessarily need that  quot Vegas Experience quot  in your hotel  you should consider this place  It has no room service  but the rooms are spacious  clean and quiet  Parking is easy access  and when I was in my sixth floor room I could see my car safely in the lot below  It s relatively close to the airport  but I only heard occasional muffled engine noise from small jets  nothing bothersome Nice HD TV with a lot of channels  movies are         if that s your in room thing   working fridge was nice and free wi fi was very good  It took me awhile to figure out the giant mirror was actually the sliding closet door  There is a small cafe  from which I grabbed some fruit from the coninental breakfast selection  Sharing the parking lot with the hotel is a popular Bavarian restaurant  and across the street there s a CVS  a bar  amp  grill  a Johnny Rockets  burgers   sushi and Korean BBQ  On the other corner there s UNLV  in case you feel like enrolling Points off for the dirty drinking glasses Overall  I think this is a great value and a nice change of pace  If you need the hustle and bustle of the Strip  it s only a few blocks away  
P =>   Outside the Strip calm and convenient close to airport The Hyatt Place Las Vegas is close to the airport  Welcome starts with a free Shuttle Bus available upon upon arrival at the airport  though  make sure you book with the concierge in advance   The Shuttle service is also available on your return from the Hotel back to the airport Very good service from the personel  They will be able to suggest the best attractions and places to visit during your stay The rooms are specious  clean with free Wi Fi Internet access  that is a major plus Close to the airport  outside the Strip  quiet and calm location       minutes taxi ride to the heart of Las Vegas where you will be able to enjoy yourself  shows  concerts  bars  clubs  restaurants  casinos of course       If you fancy woalking and if it is not too hot or windy you can set off on foot arrive within       minutes in town be not the best choice for food  as I do not remember they offered a full restaurant service Would definietly recommend it  
P =>  Great stay This is a great place to stay if you have a car and want to be off the strip  We stayed   nights and I never heard a plain  we were on floor   facing the parking   Service was great  they had a very yummy free breakfast  also free wii fii and parking  and the same type of room and amenities of every Hyatt place     flat TV     hour room service with menu and ordering option on TV  nice bathroom with tub  coffee machine  fridge  big bed  sofa  working desk  nice bedding    I love the idea of the Hyatt place  it is a basic hotel with everything you need to feel comfortable during your stay  I just love the big flat TV Wherever I go and there is a Hyatt place  I stay there  The price is great for what you get  in our opinion 
P =>   Great airport UNLV hotel but in a somewhat sketchy area This is my second stay at a Hyatt Place property and I really like what they ve done with these  quot older quot  hotels  The decor is so modern and classy  I like the furniture  color choices  and overall  quot hipness quot  of these properties  Room was very clean and has everything you could want  refrigerator  huge plasma TV  free internet  separate bar area  couch  comfortable bed  and nice sink area  The bathroom area itself is a bit tight but not too bad  If you are a  quot large quot  person I could imagine you might struggle but it s fine for most  There is a free breakfast which is perfectly fine but it s not a hot breakfast that you d get at a place like Staybridge Suites  ent selection of breads  cereal  yogurt  and fruit  Check in was quick  easy  and friendly  All staff I encountered were very nice  The only thing I don t like about this hotel is the location  It s in a somewhat shady area across from UNLV and there are signs all over the parking lot warning you that they are not responsible for items left in cars  I rented a car  they do have a free airport shuttle though  and was scared the whole time I d find it broken into when I got out  Those signs don t set a good tone but I understand why they are there  Luckily I didn t have any problems and had a great stay  Would stay here again if I wasn t visiting the strip  
P =>   Great Airport hotel  I had an overnight layover and chose to stay in this Hyatt brand hotel  We frequent Hyatt hotels and this is a very smart  modern and clean hotel  It is a recent acquistion for Hyatt and newly remodeled  alhough I would have sworn it was a brand new hotel The room had a very comfortable king bed and a separate living room with a couch and table with a desk and kitchen area  sink  micro  frig   The staff were very friendly and helpful  There is a free airport shuttle and a free breakfast  although my flight left too early for me to take advantage of it  The breakfast area is large enough  well organized and clean  The hotel is close to the Hard Rock Cafe although traffic is rather busy in this area and the typical seedy Vegas billboards advertisements surround the area  I felt relatively safe walking across the street to the restaurant  I will definately stay here again should the need arise  
P =>  Pleasurable stay As a travel agent  got a great rate and didn t want to say on  quot the strip quot   so this Hyatt was the answer  Unfortunately  it took us     hour to find the place after coming into LV north on I     It is literally right across from UNLV  and with all the one way streets  and Paradise Rd stopping  then starting up again   confusing  it is also just minutes from the LV airport  and hotel has a shuttle Room had separate  quot living room quot   but vanity area was open wide into bedroom area Refrigerator and USA Today delivered on weekdays  No restaurant  BUT best feature for me    the POOL  Gorgeous landscaping  not too deep Very comfy beds and pillows  Also  no fee for parking  
P =>   If you value sleep stay elsewhere     The hotel is right under the flight plan of planes taking off from Las Vegas Airport and is very loud     The hotel staff at check in gave me my room card and did not explain the amenities of the hotel   I ve stayed at Hyatt Place before  so it wasn t a big deal for me  But it is unprofessional     Checkout took    minutes in line  And I was the  st person in line  Totally unacceptable for there to be one person at checkout desk at  AM  Granted  the woman being helped when I got the to desk had problems  but it could have been handled a lot better   like to call a co worker to help  asking the woman to wait while simple check outs can occur        The room had an iron  but no ironing board  Needless to say  I will not return  
P =>   Surprised Me  They Renovated The Amerisuites  I use to stay at the Hard Rock Hotel all the time  But sometimes when I couldn t get a room I would stay across the street at the Amerisuites  Mediocre at best and overpriced  BUT NOW  I booked through the Hyatt web site and they surprised me by booking me at the SAME PROPERTY UNDER A NEW NAME  It was WAY WAY WAY BETTER  Everything  Rooms  lobby  Wood paneled and huge flat screen TV  Great Hyatt beds  I read some other reviews about airplane noise  Totally wasn t an issue  Yes they are near McCarron but it s muffled  And I was on the  th floor  I know my comments sound so good I must be a shill  I m not  But I am very picky and was expecting another mediocre experience in Vegas hotel staying  I thought this place was perfect  Great service  There was a slow drain in my sink and the TV didn t get HD so they came up immediately and fixed it  There s free internet  Coffee in the room which I like  Huge fluffy pillows which I like  Kind of a suite layout  Living area and bedroom area Wish I could rag on something here  But can t  I d look here first before going to any of those crappy casino spa joints  
P =>  Clean Comfortable Handy Little Place I stayed here last weekend for one night on a Saturday and was familiar with the location as I frequent the Hard Rock Hotel and have also passed by the Hyatt Place on my way to the Vegas airport  Like almost all things in L V   this is a much larger Hyatt Place than normal and it was pretty full from sports groups booked there  I think the S D  State women s basketball team was one of the groups there   Seeing that  I was a bit nervous about room noise and the long lines for the complimentary breakfast but after requesting a quiet room  was surprised that it was a nice quiet corner room on the second floor  No noises from the other rooms around or above and the room was clean  well kept and comfortable  if you don t like firm beds then beware   As stated in some of the other posts  the only noise was from the airplanes overhead    having previously lived under a flight path  I think I was somewhat insulated from the noise but it is an issue to consider until they change the flight path The wait for the breakfast line was not too bad and while they had run out of a couple of things when I first got there  I was surprised at how quickly it was replenished  compared to some of the other Hyatt Places I ve stayed at   Did not take advantage of the pool  which was outdoors and looked nice  or the exercise room  which was on the second floor   They have   internet stations by the breakfast area in addition to the free wi fi throughout the hotel  Did not take advantage of the free airport shuttle as I had driven over  but this is a great feature for L V   nor the complimentary shuttle to Planet Hollywood as I was told you had to call for pickup  However  location across from the Hard Rock Hotel Cafe is great and if you re a walker  a great selection of restaurants on their  quot Restaurant Row quot  on Flamingo Rd  is about    min walk away Overall  I was impressed with this hotel as I m a frequent visitor to Vegas and I don t always stay or play on the Strip  If you re looking for Strip casinos or action or this is your first visit to L V  you might want to pay extra for a strip casino  Otherwise  this is a great place to stay  
P =>   Great Stay Booked a room through Hotwire for around     USD night  Hotel looks great  Rooms are big  with massive LCD TV   coffee maker and key operated safe  Bathroom a little small  Modern interior decoration  Very clean  Free wi fi with good signal    computers and a printer are also available for use in the lobby Included breakfast was good  Bagels  bread  english muffins  cereal  fruit  yoghurt and Starbucks coffee and teas  Location was ok  They provided a free shuttle to the strip  Planet Hollywood   which leaves at half past every hour  In order to return to the hotel  you need to call and book the shuttle  Definitely more fun to stay on the strip if you plan to have big days out  Also  there is a free airport shuttle  Plenty of restaurants around  as well as a laundromat and CVS pharmacy We weren t bothered at all by the noise of the aeroplanes as flights finish at midnight  Very friendly staff  
P =>  Hyatt Place in Vegas This Hyatt Place is nicely set up    location is actually pretty good  It s directly across corners from the Hard Rock Resort  We did the walk from the Hyatt Place to the strip  and it really wasn t all that bad  It s not all that close  but I work in downtown Chicago and have to walk from my train to my job daily  so it s just another walk  It was close enough that we decided to walk back as well  Our only big gripe with this Hyatt Place is that it seems located directly below the McCarran flight path  It can be somewhat noisy at times  This is sort of a beware type thing  and not something I d take out on the hotel management  The rooms were spacious and as other Hyatt Places we ve stayed at  has a wonderful TV with plenty of HD content available  
P =>  Warning   Its in the Flight path We are staying at the Hyatt as we speak  We came to Vegas for the New Year and chose the hotel after reading the reviews  but mainly because it was opposite the Hard Rock Hotel where we were spending New Years Eve For the money you can t really complain  The staff are fantastic  When we checked in we were told to use the free shuttle bus that they provide to travel to and from the strip   it operates from     am and finishes with the last pick up at      pm   They advised about walking anywhere because of the  quot area quot  so be warned  Our room  like the other reviews suggest  was the size of a suite  Reasonably clean but quite an unpleasant smell lingering in the corridors  We were absolutely gobsmacked to find that we were under the flight path   perhaps flight path are the wrong words  Flight path suggests the planes have actually taken off before they bounce over the roof of the hotel  We are on the top    th   floor  The planes are constant   the sound of one  not disappearing before the next  The room vibrates as they go over and car alarms in the parking lot below sing in unison as the jets set them off  We asked if we could be moved to a lower floor thinking that maybe a few storeys above us would kill the noise  but the room we were shown stunk of cigarettes   although this is a non smoking hotel   and there was no getting away from the planes  The local pharmacy sells ear plugs  What we couldn t understand is why no one else had mentioned this in their reviews  Well the answer is that for the next   months they are relaying a section of runway at the airport and during this time planes are taking off and landing on a different approach  So be warned         The comp breakfast is not bad  so if it wasn t for the planes the hotel would be fine for a base  
P =>   Great Rooms This is a very clean   comfortable hotel about   mile off the strip  It is near the airport and across the street from the Hard Rock Cafe  The rooms are great  like junior suites  with a great buffet breakfast  The pool id quite good  Overall I would recommend a stay there away from the craziness of the strip  
P =>   A normal business leisure hotel in Las Vegas  I had a pleasant stay at Hyatt Place  I found it pleasant because of several things it didn t have  no resort fee  no electricity fee  no internet usage fee and no outrageous mini bar fees  These fees are pretty standard at most  if not all the Vegas casino resorts  After a few days  they can really add up  The estimate given to me from their site was exactly the rate I paid to the penny  Also  Hyatt Place opened in ember      so it isn t beat up like most of the other places I ve stayed in Vegas  I doubt you can find a more comfortable bed in town Despite not having a restaurant  the amenities at Hyatt Place surpass most of the resorts too  The standard rooms are very large  The    quot  HDTV actually gets a ton of HDTV stations and pay per view movies  I m amazed how many other hotels invest in HDTVs and then don t subscribe to get the HD stations  Of course  in Vegas  most resorts have poor TVs so you spend more time in the casino  The free wireless Internet was fast and flawless  You can connect your ipod to the TV speakers  Just remember to bring a cord While some people here didn t like the location  I did  The strip mall across the street with the CVS has at least a half dozen good restaurants including a great New York Pizza place  The primary reason I stayed here was it was across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel where I ususally stay  It was sold out during this trip and Hyatt Place was a much less expensive option anyways  You can use the pool at HRH as long as you tell the security guy that you intend on playing at the gambling tables by the pool  This included the Sunday Rehab which is normally an expensive ticket  What incredible eye candy  The Hard Rock Hotel  skip the Hard Rock Cafe  is my absolute favorite place in Las Vegas and where I end my nights when I m there  Having a nice place to walk to instead of waiting in the huge cab line was great  
P =>   A Vegas gem  I LOVED this hotel  Exceptionally friendly and attentive staff  lovely rooms  great shuttle service to town and the airport as well as a generous morning breakfast and evening nibblies  Our rooms were spacious  beautifully appointed and equipped with Wifi  a wet bar and a gorgeous flatscreen  No casino noise and a perfect oasis of calm  I look forward to retruning next year  Great work Hyatt   
P =>   Great place at a great price It is a little bit off the strip  but that means you don t have to deal with the traffic and crowds  It was quiet  even though it is close to the airport   and there are plenty of places within walking distances to eat  They provide a free shuttle to the strip Our room was very nice  a living area and bedroom area  with a huge tv with inputs for the ipod  There was a LARGE comfy couch and free internet access  The bathroom sink had LOTS of counter space and overall it was a very nice place to stay at a great rate  
P =>   Best place to stay if you hate all the traffic We stayed here  th of y weekend  Have been to Vegas before and hate all the time it takes to get in and out of hotel  Hotel staff was very nice  has Starbucks at front desk and a    hour restaurant  We had a strip view and it was wonderful their was no charge you just have to request it beforehand  Always love Hyatt Place s rooms they have free wi fi and flat screen tv s    Free parking and just a block away from the strip and across the street from the Hard Rock  It was good because we have kids and hate to walk through casino area and smoke with them  
P =>   Good Quiet Vegas Location This Hyatt Place is close to Vegas airport  and about four long blocks away from the Strip  My room had a terrific view of the Strip  which was breathtaking both during the day and especially at night  The hotel s sound insulation is superb  Jets were passing right outside my window literally    seconds before touching down at the airport    and I could barely hear any noise  The large German restaurant next door was also noisy with a particularly bad oompah band  but none of the noise made it into the hotel My spacious room had a large flat screen TV  a large sofa  and a Queen size bed  The room was clean  but the carpet could have been a bit fresher  The bathroom fixtures looked new and functioned well  The wireless internet is free  and generally operated reliably but did slow down during afternoon peak periods The morning breakfast is included in the price and was well stocked  and included a healthy fruit bowl  The hotel is close to a    hour store that carries essential supplies  and the Hard Rock cafe is nearby  as are several small food places My main complaint at this hotel was the housekeeping  which was sloppy  On one day  I clearly left a used towel in the bath tub to be replaced  and it was still there after the room was cleaned  Disappointing Otherwise  if you want a quiet place away from the Strip  this is a very good choice  
P =>   Nice rooms but heed the location This HP shares the typical stylish decor with other HP locations  so expect nice  spacious rooms with an excellent    quot  flat panel TV displaying true HD content  The staff was friendly and competent The location is conveniently close to the airport  but you do get the occasional jet noise  depending on the wind direction   Also  it s sort of on an island between the two one way sections of Paradise  a major thoroughfare to from the airport   So on each side you have a high volume of one way traffic  and on a third side the HP shares a parking lot with a very large  popular beer hall  The immediate environment feels noisy and chaotic  and at night  perhaps a bit unsafe  The doors  even the main entry  require keys after dark  so I had to buzz to be let in when I checked in at  pm  Inside it does feel safer and quieter The general area is not known to be the safest  but it s convenient to the Hard Rock about     a block away  UNLV  Thomas amp Mack Center  and of course  the airport  The Strip is about a   minute drive  
P =>  best place to stay off the strip for bussiness travel We were very satisfied with the service at this location  the staff is extremely accommodating always with a smile  especially Ms Ayako and Gaby 
P =>  nice place off strip  myself and my girlfriend stayed here for one night after our flight was canceled delta airlines put us up free of charge so i am not sure what the prices are like the hotel is located approx a mile from the strip the hotel runs a free shuttle bus to and from planet hollywood on the strip the lobby are is nicely decorated staff are friendly our room was very large in size  it had a living room kind of area within the room there was also a very large flat screen very impressive the hotel is across the road from hard rock hotel and casino there also is a small shopping area across the road with alot of food options we ate in johnny rockets for lunch right beside there is also a german pub restaurant we did not eat in the hotel  we left very early in the morning so did not have breakfast there also seemed to be a nice swimming pool but we did not use overall i would recommend this hotel the location might seem an inconvenience but with the free shuttle bus things are made easy  
P =>  Good deal   Off Strip Good deal  close to the airport  their shuttle will take you anywhere you wish  Planes flying over every now and then  but it did not keep us awake  We are not into the hustle and bustle of Vegas  we were here for a convention  it was perfect for us  Continental breakfast  with option to buy other selections  Check out the      Mr  Luckys at the Hard Rock  get the Gamblers Special       for steak and three shrimp  good deal  Friendly folks  newly renovated rooms  Huge TV in the room that we watched the Superbowl on  We would stay here again if we were in town  The Hard Rock is right across the street if you want to gamble  but stay and sleep in a quieter environment  
P =>  Helped us in a Pinch Satyed here when our flight was canceled  It s less than a mile from the airport  so we picked it for closeness and the free shuttle service from the airport  and the cost  very reasonable   The shuttle arrived quickly and our driver was very nice and informative  Check in was quick  they have a kiosk and you don t even have to speak to anyone  There is a desk too  if you want a live person  The rooms were comfy  a little strange in the layout  Living room area with desk  pull out bed  mini bar area with free wi fi  Bedroom area next with flat screen TV in between that can be rotated to either side  Bed was suer comfy  bathroom was very small  The only down side is you can hear the planes literally flying over your head  Luckily they stopped around midnight  I wouldn t stay long term  but if you need a comfy cheap place to stay close to the airport I would recommend staying here  
P =>  Beware the jet noise When the wind shifts the hotel is directly under the departing flight pattern for way to close McCarran Airport  At midnight we decided to give it a count    flights taking off directly over our hotel in just    minutes  The rooms depicted on the hotel s website are a generic representation of an average room in the Hyatt Place chain  not an actual room at the Las Vegas hotel  The rooms in Las Vegas  rather than having a screen separate the two portions of the room had a   X    floor to ceiling divider that housed the in room air conditioner  loud  which also made the area around king bed much smaller This place does not deserve the Hyatt name and is no where up to the standards of riott s Residence Inn  Fairfield or Courtyard chains  Okay  the large LCD television rocks  but it did not makeup for the rest of the issues

P => Reviews here are pretty much right on The best reason to stay at the Imperial Palace is location   it is pretty much in the heart of the strip and the middle of everything  That and the price were my main reasons for staying  I would have preferred to stay somewhere nicer  but for the money  this hotel was a good deal  Not a whole lot to do   nightlife is pretty much non existent at the IP  but other hotels are close by so there is always something to do  Rooms were decent   nothing spectacular by any means  but the shower was hot and the water pressure was really good  Noise level was okay unless someone was being loud in the hallway  it s Vegas so that s going to happen   Our room was by the pop machine and I did get a little perturbed at someone filling it at   am  The saying    quot you get what you paid for quot  and that s what you ll get at IP  
P => loved the place   for the money it s great right in the middle of all the BIG casino s   it s worth it  Been in different kinds of rooms everytime we go   i can t decide which one i like the best  there s one w  a huge tub   this year we stayed at one w  a  quot living room quot   couch and tv  bedroom didnt  have a door tho  so can t have guests   lol 
P => Good value at the heart of the strip I had read mixed reviews and even was advised by a friend not to stay at the Imperial Palace  however I got a great flight hotel deal so I thought I would give it a go  We arrived on a Thursday  checked in took about   minutes  the walk to our room was about the same  On inspection of the room  I even checked for bed bugs  the only thing that was lacking was there was little bits of hairs on the bathroom floor  The next day the cleaning lady did clean the bathroom  The hotel is outdated  the restaurants are not worth eating at as you are minutes from much better restaurants such as garitaville  etc  The pool is decent but gets packed as it is small  When the weekend hit  the hotel was full and elevator lines did get alittle long  never longer than a     min wait and if you knew your way around the hotel you could find an alternate route to your room but it was tricky  we finally mastered a shortcut on day    The location is ideal  there is also a bus stop right outside the hotel  If you are not planning on spending in the hotel and instead outside enjoying the strip then this hotel will suit your needs  If you are looking for a hotel that you want to stay and play without having to leave  then upgrade to a different hotel  
P => Bed Bugs At Imperial Las Vegas Beware I stayed for   nights  the second night I was itching and about the third or fourth day I showed the cleaning lady and was told lady that I must have developed allergies as I showed her my back and legs  I was in agony for the week and asked for new sheets  blanket  bedspread  each day would ask for something new  Her and I looked for some sign and saw nothing  I came home saw my MD the very next day and he said it was bed bug bites  I called the hotel and they are looking into it  I wanted them to stop renting the room out and refund money  They have not responded as yet  They were shocked I did not let a manager know at the hotel    How many people are sabby to bed bugs and the cleaning lady said no  it is allergies that I must have just developed them  Besides I did not want any man to see me  I was so embarrased that I even complained to the cleaning lady and showed her all my bites and clawing I did to my self to try to get relief  Not to shy to post them as to help someone else  How do you tell your friends OH I GOT BED BUGS  
P => Cheap rate good location nothing more  Booked IP for a quick one night stay at a very low rate  Wasn t expecting much  but still disappointed  Probably the most uncomfortable bed I ve every experienced  The room  hallways  and casino were worn and dirty  Front desk staff and casino personnel all seemed fairly competent  But I would ve been miserable here for an extended stay  Tip  If you stay here  request a room far away from the Rockhouse Bar  otherwise you ll be hearing thumping bass until early morning  
P => Hey it s Vegas              gotta love it  Hey we just got back from Vegas and had a wonderful time  Six of us went and stayed at the Imperial Palace    of us had a regular room but friends who are repete customers had a comped penthouse  The staff are great  rooms are comfy and clean and they restaurants were good  You can t beat the location and the price  We were in town Sunday when the CFL was playing the West  amp  East finals for Grey Cup  GO RIDERS  The Wynn said they would play the game for us in the sports bar       NOT       The Mandalay Bay had a conference of      Canadians staying there and would not play the game either  We asked the RockHouse at the IP and they said you bet  They had   tvs going    for   drinks specials for us and treated us like royalty Thry are aslso going to play the Grey Cup this Sunday for anyone donwn there  Go see them they are a great bunch  Annie was out waitress and she even wore a Rider Jersey Go see Terry Fador at the Mirage  he is a great showman and lots of fun I would go back to the IP  I liked the sixe of the place  we are treated well and enjoyed being right in the middle of everything  
P =>   Nothing fancy but good price and location Clean  but very average rooms  Good water pressure in the shower  Best of all  it s very cheap  and is right in the middle of the Strip  near the Flamingo and across from Caesar s Palace  A good place to stay if you just want somewhere to sleep  There s also a Monorail stop One word of caution  get a room away from the Strip side of the building  There s live music outside until the wee hours  and it s as though the band is right there with you in the room  We checked in at  am  covered our ears  and immediately went back to the front desk  It was no problem getting a new room  
P =>  Worked out great  We were at the IP as part of a group and had     room nights  So we got a picture of the good  bad and evil of the IP  First you have to remember that everything in Vegas is priced upon LOCATION  Being at the center of the strip cost more than being well off strip  The buffet at the IP is     for the whole day  but yet go   miles to a Boulder Highway Casino and eat all day for less than    bucks  And neither are any more than some red meat and a lot of chicken products with a salad  So when it comes to food  get out and explore to find bargains and variety  This is an OLD hotel  Period  You can feed an old dog steak and it is still an old dog  Rooms will have the smells of the last    yrs  Carpets will be worn  Water flow will be strange  Elevators will stop working  These are just facts  so except them because of the location and price  I am sure some people were happier than others  But the only whine I heard from our group about the rooms was rough toilet paper   Duh  bring your own to ANY hotel  And bird poop on the balcony  Yes bird pop outside  what a surprise  I was impressed to even have a balcony for each room  I was not impressed by the size of the rooms  as I was at Harrah s or even Bally s  Tuscany wins that battle hands down on room size  but again location and cost are a factor  I twice called security about elevators being out of service and one was fixed quickly  one never did work in my    day visit  But I did locate all the hidden elevators and never had much of a wait  There will be noise inside and outside the hotel  This is Vegas  a town that never sleeps and gives away free drinks  Just deal with it as a fact  The desk clerks did a fine job as well as the group room sales office  Robert Coppola  You can always expect a few bumps when you deal with so many rooms and so many people  The maid service was great and responded quickly when asked for extra services  All the employees where nice and made us feel that our business was welcomed  Shaun Tracy the Midwest Regional Sales Manager for Las Vegas Meetings by Harrah s exceeded his duties and went beyond the call of duty to see that we had a great time and all at a decent price   Over all with price and location our group will be back soon  
P =>   you get what you pay for clearly  Las Vegas epitomizes  quot you get what you pay for quot   You pay a little for a cheap room  you get a cheap room  No bargains found in this town during our stay  Having said that  we wanted a decent room on the strip so we could walk around  day or night  After reading reviews of other hotel rooms in the     range  I have to say that the Imperial Palace wasn t too bad  Although the wallpaper was peeling and the furniture obviously had not been wiped down for years  it wasn t too filthy  The room was large enough for the two of us  The bed was a bit saggy but not uncomfortably so I think the property is a bit rundown   some of the elevators weren t working and it surprised me that we had to call the maintenance staff because they were unaware of the problem   You always get the impression that someone is watching all of the casino operations      but this didn t seem to be true  The best part of our stay was the   for   coupon to Matsuri for hotel guests  It was a good show for          then  on our way out  we found another coupon in the vegas to go book  so I guess it wasn t an exclusive saving   if you can get a room here for under      I think I would have to recommend it  Circus Circus is a bit far away         so the location of the Imperial Palace is what recommends it the most  If you pay more than that for a dumpy room  I d have to say you got ripped off  
P =>  Very tired Hotel I stayed at this hotel as part of a tour of the West Coast area USA  The exterior of the hotel is very off putting and quite seedy  having a large disco bar in front of the hotel  The rooms are very tired and although they were clean  the whole experience of staying there was not pleasant  The noise outside could be heard in a lot of the rooms allocated to our group  I did not eat in the hotel but used tthe buffet in the Caesars Palace Hotel which is across the road and  although not the cheapest  is very good   The only redeeming feature for this hotel is its location  which is right in the centre of the Las Vegas Strip  
P =>   Great value This was my second stay at the IP  If you re a person who needs frills in a hotel  this isn t the place for you  If you want a good basic room in a great location  then this is an excellent choice  You can t beat the price for a location like that The room was clean and comfortable  The shower was slow to drain but so s my one at home so that didn t bother me  I didn t have that problem during my previous stay so it might just be that particular room The main minus are the legendarily slow elevators  They re as bad as you may have heard  Otherwise  I really enjoyed my stay  The staff are friendly  The room was clean  Plenty of towels and good hot water  The bed was comfortable  The TV is the old bulky style but it worked well and has a pretty good selection of channels There s a good variety of slot machines and the dealertainers are fun to watch  The internet connection was great  cheaper than at the other hotel I stayed at and much more reliable  Another plus is that the IP is very generous with comps and rate reductions even for those of us who are low rollers  This is not a fancy hotel  If you want frills and such  this is not the hotel for you  If  on the other hand  you just want a basic room with friendly staff and clean  comfortable accomodations  then consider staying at the IP  It has a great location in easy walking distance of several other casinos and attractions and the bus line  
P =>   THIS PLACE IS GREAT    DONT WORRY    What Can I say but wow    I just got back from las vegas I have stayed at many places there  I found a great deal for this hotel  This hotel is Great    my room was very clean   Staff was great   Really dont worry about bad reviews these people are nutz    Check in was fast   We ate in the buffet it was       and you can eat all day go back and forth as much as you want all day    Food and service was great    At night had great seafood etc  the prime rib was great     You really cant beat this deal   Oh ya one vip thing to remember when you check in dont get a room by the night club the clerk at front desk told us that part of hotel was very loud  They gave us a pool view room on the   th floorgreat view   And do not get the capri rooms they are in very back of hotel those are the dumpy ones    Anyway I had a great stay I will be back I already booked for feb           
P =>    th time there but probably the last  Everything was the same there but maybe I am getting older and ready to pay more for a nicer place  I had a friend stay at the Mirage for not much more and that hotel is so much nicer and almost as good location  so after staying there   times over the last   years here are the negatives and positives negatives Pool  not really a Vegas pool more like an Apartment complex poolThe great value of the hotel brings rif raf that stays there  so much less eye candy than other hotels  but still great people watching  don t get me wrong still a safe placeElevators are minimal small and way too slowBuffett is awfulShows are awfulCasino is small  ceilings are low and its way too smokyTables are old and dirty and the other games are datedBurger palace and the pizza place are horriblePositives Service has always been goodValue is greatLocation cannot be beat you can get to a lot of hotels in   minutes   where if you stayed at the Wynn you could only get to their parking garage in   minutesDealertainers are funny and entertaining   i still miss Louis Armstrong   he was greatBetties little snack shack looks old but good little bagel and pastriesClose to Harrah s so you can steal their free WIFI so I think this is a pretty good desciption of the place that is fai  Like I said I came back   times   I stayed at the Excalibur once but preferred the location of the IP  I wouldn t object to going back based on the value but I just think I am ready to pay a little more for a little nicer place  I would like to enjoy my next hotel a little more than just a place to sleep so I can get up and go to another property  The IP will always be a part of me though 
P =>   not the best place on the strip but great location and good value for money Hi EveryoneI was dreading staying in this hotel after reading everyones review but this was third time in Vegas so I wasn t really bothered where I stayed after all its just a bed and roof over my head is all I was after  Im glad I stayed their    Its perfect location and CHEAP    Don t let others opinion worry you  Its not the best place but my room  and   other rooms where my friends was staying  were all clean and spacious  no roaches as others states  but for the price i paid   days for     dollars what do you expect     Venetian         You get what you pay for    Lift was slow but it never bothered me I never waited longer than   mins the only thing I would have like and this is personal choice is having a safe in the room   Honestly  Its not that bad and for what you pay its perfect     ITS CLEAN    Its like paying for easyjet flight and expecting BA service get real         Buffet was ok but Embers restaurant was fantastic      course meal for     dollars Hope this helps 
P =>   vegas baby we had an awsome time at the imperial palace  there was a dealer ther card dealer that is that never forgot a name and he aslo was from north dakota made our trip great 
P =>   good location but getting a bit run down This is the second time we have stayed in this hotel it is clean  and is in very good location in the centre of the strip  It is also a stop for the monorail which is handy   The hotel itself although clean is getting run down bathrooms could do with upgrading The whole place could do with a coat of paint  I also felt the buffet didn t have such a wide choice this year  There aren t enough lifts to cope at peak times  you can wait up to       mins sometimes  As my has walking difficulties we were forced to wait rather than use stairs   They are also now charging to use gym    dollars for    mins which is a rip off  They have outside cocktail bar which my wife and i were refused access as we didn t have id consdering i am fifty and paying guest i find that situation terrible so for these rasons i will not be back 
P =>   Good location Basically as you all know you get what you pay for The Imperial palace is cheap and cheerful but its location is amazing as it is central on the strip  This was my first trip to Vegas and although a bit unsure at first quickly got into the spirit of the place You are here to drink  gamble and enjoy yourself  The Rock Bar just at the front of the Imperial palace always has a great has a great atmosphere and is a bit more laid back than some of the other bigger clubs The best bit about this hotel is that you are not too far away from anything  The price is worth the location but if you are looking for something bang up to date you may want to try out some of the slightly more expensive hotels like TI or the Mirage  
P =>   Good Location and very reasonable We stayed at the IP from   th thru the   th  The hotel is nothing fancy  but for the location and cheap price  it cant be beat  If you are like us and just want a clean place to sleep  then the IP is for you  If you want more of a upscale hotel  then I would look else where  
P =>   my daughter s wedding the place is a joke they trea ted my daughter and her new husband with the most disrepect  From a maid going into their room when a do not enter sign is on the door  topeople going in and breaking their belongs  And being escorted out like criminal  Don tget me started on some one stealing money from one of guest  valet leaving the door toanother guest car ajar running down the battery and then threaitng them with having their car towed to bath tubs broke and other guest putting do not enter and staff going in any way if they can t read english send them back across the border  
P =>   Great Place I dont know what people want for the price I stayed here for    days and It is only a place to sleep when your in Vegas My husband and I were treated very good and for the price you cant go wrong especially the location  The food was good for the cost and Our room was clean

P =>   Great choce  but you kind of got to know how to work it     This was our   nd Las Vegas trip and our  th stay at the IP  We have stayed at many hotels there  and we keep coming back here  The location cannot be topped  head out the front door   and you are within walking distance to most of the great things this city offers We were comped a king suite   but we have stayed in a deluxe room  and they are ok as well  My recommendation is that you can pay for a king suite for about the same price as a standard room at Mirage  or TI   and have a much larger room with more amenities  Our room had a sitting room  king bed  oversized tub  wet bar with a refrigerator  and yes     a coffee maker  The biggest gripe you will read about staying there is that the IP is the home of the planets slowest elevators  This honor is well earned  but the knowlegable guest learns that there is a second bank of lifts around the back and to the loft of the main bank  Few people seem to know about these   and the wait is not as bad  Also the front elevators seem to not have as much traffic and you can walk back to your foom on you home floor after using them  This is particularly handy if you are toting luggage The restaurants there are not the best in town  The Embers steakhouse is ok  and the coffee shop is good for a breakfast  or a light lunch  Room service is great for breakfast    used it every day  although a little slow  The Burger Palace and the buffet are to be avoided at all costs  The staff there is great  and the casino hosts are among the best in the business  The front desk and the valet staff are friendly and helpful  I would not recommend this hotel for the first time Las Vegas visitor  but for the guest who knows his way around  it has got to be the best value on the strip  
P =>   Like sleeping in a parking garage Recently stayed from ober      th There are two very different sides to this hotel  the main part of the building which must be relatively ok and rooms in a separate building  The Capri Building  about a    minute walk away through the carpark which are like sleeping in the carpark  We heard televisions through the walls  EVERYBODY S conversations as though walls didn t exist  fights in the car park  car alarms here and there and twice had people trying to get into our room in the          am Had to call security twice to break up an argument of drunk college guys outside our room at      in the morning  they never turned up  Housekeeping also  forgot our room  twice in four days and no  the  do not disturb  wasn t on the door As regular business traveller I have stayed at literally thousands of hotels at all levels of luxury to economy  I understand people don t go to Vegas to sleep but we stayed for   days and reasonable expected to sleep at some stage We turned on the heater  during a particular cold front that came through  to have the whole room fill with an electric fire and burnt dust smell It s centrally located and they have celebraity look a likes dealing cards  That s the best I ve got  
P =>   This place is a DUMP We thought we had a great deal   airfare  amp    nights hotel for       Unfortunately  you get what you pay for  This place is an absolute DUMP  We had paid for   nights and left after    The only thing missing was cockroaches  Water backed up in the sink  amp  tub  hairdryer didn t work  nice to find out when you re standing there with a dripping head of hair   grimy room decor straight out of the    s  beds HARD AS ROCK  towels as soft as a wire loofah  air conditioning sounded like a     landing      and on and on and on  And the FOOD in the restaurants  Overpriced and disgusting  Yup  this place is a DUMP  We moved after   nights to the Tuscany Suites  amp  Casino about a half mile off the strip   FABULOUS  A suite that was   times the size of the dump at the Imperial Palace  brand new  beautiful  quiet grounds and staff that just could not do enough for us  Saturday night cost us     and Sunday night cost us         
P => GREAT Location and GREAT HOTEL We stayed at Imperial Palace from ober          ember          This was our first trip to Las Vegas and we couldn t have asked for a better location on the strip  It was close to everything  Turn right out of hotel and walk to the Venetian  Wynn  and Encore  Turn left and go to Flamingo  Planet Hollywood  and MGM Grand  Caesar s Palace is directly across the street and Bellagio is diagnal  The hotel staff was very friendly and always helpful  Yes the rooms are outdated  but who goes to Las Vegas to stay in their hotel room     I requested a room in the back of the hotel away from the strip so it would be quiet for bedtime and I asked for a balcony when we checked in  We were on the   th floor facing the Flamingo and it was great  You could get    pitchers of beer from the casino bar and the Dealertainers were OK  We didn t gamble very much at Imperial because we were always walking around the other hotels so we could see them  Bill s is next door with cheap food and drinks  as well as Casino Royale  Bill s has a discount ticket center which is where we bought tickets to Love by Cirque du Soleil  we paid     each for the tickets and had  th row  normal price I think is      each  so if you are looking to see a show definitely stop by there  We ate at garitaville which is super close to Imperial  but I wouldn t recommend it  The food is overpriced and wasn t that great  We had lunch at Noodles in the Bellagio  awesome  and dinner one night at BLT Burger in The Mirage  the best burger I have EVER had   The monorail stops at Imperial Harrah s so that was convenient for getting around  We NEVER had a problem with the elevators  Most of the time we walked right up to it  hit up or down  and it opened right up  Seriously  this is a great hotel for the price and in a fabulous location  When we do go back to Vegas  we ll be staying here again definitely  Hope you have a wonderful trip  
P =>  Cheap hotel  cheap clientele  Don t expect much  We stayed at the IP         nd        Now I read the reviews and kind of knew what to expect  I was expecting a crappy Motel   and that is more or less what we got  At least the room was more or less clean  We arrived at   am so I just checked the bed for clean sheets and bedbugs and crashed   There were no bugs by the way   In the morning I saw some of the issues with the room  The patio door was very hard to open and close  Stained curtains  Tiny tube TV  No safe  The bathroom was worn and pretty clean though the wallpaper was coming off and there was mold on the top edge of the tub and shower surround  Who knew mold could grow there   There was no lid on the toilet seat either  odd  The room is quite small and the bathroom is also very small  Everything about this place is cheap though  Even the ice buckets are not regular ice buckets  but a cheap plastic bucket printed with the logo  There is not even a pen in the room  you get a tiny golf pencil to write with  Even the toilet paper is the absolute cheapest stuff available  The Bellagio and every other hotel had better TP in their public restrooms  So if you want a cheap place in a good location mid strip the IP is going to be fine for you  I would not stay here again unless I absolutely had to  We had some noise issues with our neighbors on Fri and Sat nights  I was expecting it though when on Fri and Sat I saw lots of college students and    somethings checking in  Their main luggage seemed to consist of cases of beer and beer bongs  So I knew we d better stay up late cause it would be loud  And it was  We did not eat at the IP at all and I don t think any of the places are good  You can find better food at other nearby casinos that is better and similarly priced  I m not sure when this place will be torn down or remodeled but it won t be soon enough  Even the Flamingo next door is a lot nicer for only a few bucks more per night  
P => Very Loud The rooms are very ok at best  You can hear everyone walking in the hallway at all hours of the day and night  and you would think there are no walls in your room as loud as the music sounded  
P =>  A Good trip with a Reasonable and Good Hotel My husband and I  and his brother and sister in law drove down to Vegas at the end of tember for a   day getaway  It was her first trip to Vegas  his second and our   th  We hadn t stayed at the Imperial for close to    years and were concerned after reading some of the reviews  But I couldn t pass up a     a night deluxe room in the middle of the strip  And I am glad I didn t  Great location  excellent service  a drippy faucet fixed after just a quick mention to housekeeping  and a clean  large room at a wonderful price  Sure the Imperial doesn t have the grandeur of some of the other hotels  but we weren t looking for a place where we were afraid to leave a fingerprint  We wanted a good pool  a central location  clean rooms and a decent price  We ll be back  
P =>   This is a great hotel for the value and location  We stayed for   nights            and     Staff was very friendly at check in and the wait in line was not bad for a Friday night  Our room was very comfortable  everything was clean  the bed was comfortable  and the air conditioner worked great  The cleaning staff was very friendly and would always smile and talk to us in the halls  The casino was nice and it was an easy walk to other casinos on the strip   Location was perfect  When we plan our next trip we will definately consider staying at the Imperial Palace  
P =>   Think twice I would like to start off with the positives The staff was great  Dear lord  the buffet was fabulous  I would have to say that having   plates of crab legs alone suggests how much I enjoyed the buffet         is the correct price and not        as displayed all throughout the hotel   Being located in the strip was definitely a perk  We were only steps away from the club scene that way the walk back wasn t so bad   Yikes and now for the bad and the ugly   Immediately after arriving in a room it only took a few minutes to notice the bites on my feet and legs  Both my friend and I sat on the bed and felt a sudden rush if itching  We went into the light and saw tons of bug bites    We asked to have our sheets changed which they immediately were only to have the same thing happen with the new sheets  Ridiculous I tell you  Six torturous days until our return home  Whatever it was that was biting us came home with us  After further investigation our home has now been dianosed with a bed bug infestation  Look it up  They are blood feeding bugs that are easily harbored by clothes  suitcases  etc  I can only speculate where the infestation came from     I wouldn t suggest staying at this hotel  Definitely a place to eat at    
P =>   Best place in Vegas to stay bar none     I cannot believe some people s reviews of my favourite hotel casino in Vegas  OK the place is only a   star but it s a GREAT   star   The atmosphere in this casino is THEE best of ANY casino in Vegas  I have taken numerous friends to this place and they all love it  The Dealertainers  the poker room  the buffet  the music they play all the time  the bars  the cocktails   this place is absolutely brilliant  I will be there again in   weeks time for my  th visit in   years  I cannot recommend this place highly enough if you want to have a good time and not complain about the  quot chipped paintwork in your room quot    Jeez  how long do you spend in your room    minutes unless your some decrepit old fud  This place is THEE best casino in Vegas for havin  the crack    That s fun to you yanks   
P =>   Perfect for the price  If you are looking for somewhere that is cheap  not too basic but not shabby  this is the place  Rooms were fairly large  the only downside is the lifts take forever  but there are lifts at the back of the hotel that nobody uses if you dont mind a little walk  but for value for money  its probably the best place to stay  maybe not ideal for familys or couples  but for a group of lads out to have a good time and save money on sleeping  this is the place to go  
P =>   Showing its age A great location on the  quot Strip quot   Facility is aging but adequate and reasonably priced  Like all of Vegas  however  food prices are getting higher with poor service and miserable gaming odds  The cafe serves a great pastery the  quot Bearclaw quot   Don t miss it Seems like Vegas has become too big and too crowded with very little value for your money  Where is the next  quot Old Vegas quot   
P =>   Cheap but ent The Imperial Palace is definitely no place to write home about  but the rooms are incredibly inexpensive and you cannot beat the location  The staff was friendly and honest  We wouldn t recommend the buffet  however  If you re a  no frills  type and like to save some dough  this place is for you  
P =>   Great location and price but a little rundown Stayed here because the price was fantastic  Bed was very comfortable and clean  but the toilet was a little rundown and there were dubious stains in the bathtub  No problems with the lift  but yes  like the other reviewers we got lost looking for our room for the first   days  We got a room facing the pool  so no problems with noise from The Strip Location is absolutely fantastic  various types of food outlets  shopping and even a car rental stall all within      mins of walking  Monorail station right at the backdoor too  There was NO in room safe  so we had to lug our laptop with us to the Grand Canyon  Front Desk staff were all very helpful  
P =>   Jewel in the rough  True the rooms aren t that big but it has heart and soul  Had a wonderful time  Will be returning in        Great rates  great location  no problems  Most people when they come to Vegas  really  honestly  just how much time do you spend in your room  I have stayed at other casinos with higher star ratings and had worse rooms for more money  
P =>   Read for a true review   Stay away A request for a room close to the elevators for a handicapped guest who has difficulty walking leads to a room assignment of the LAST room at the end of the hallway  the furthest away from the bank of elevators  Wallpaper peeling off the wall Dirty carpets Worn furniture and bedding A bathroom sink so worn the enamel is almost none existent A bathroom tub that takes almost an hour to drain after a shower A bathroom tub that drains to well from the floor above into a guest room across the hallway at      A M    check your records on         creating a disturbance to all guest as shop vacs and workers endeavored to clean up the mess   The later explanation given by one of your supervisors  according to his name tag  was that the  Oriental  people use the bathtubs to do laundry and that they left the water running  Hence the name Imperial Palace I guess  Noise   Noise   Noise   Noise  Only   elevators that run about as fast as dirt   leading to guests waiting    to    abreast and    to    deep and pushing and shoving when a car finally arrives at the casino level  People wedging open fire doors to stairways with room towels rather than waiting for these elevatorsA blinking message light on the phone in the room leads to a message stating that there are no messages in your  Meridian  voicemail   There were however    long stem roses for an   th birthday celebration that were never delivered that this message was supposed to refer to  Only when the sender called and asked about his gift  were we made aware that your staff had tossed a package clearly marked FTD live flowers into the  back room  and they would send someone to look for it A parking garage that requires a GPS system to reach   up   down  elevators and escalators and a   minute hike   ridiculous  Being propositioned by hookers in your shopping areaWatching your security guards escort one of these  ladies  off the premises as another one  tossed out not    minutes before walks right past them and back into the hotel     Check your security log at   A M on       
P =>   If you need cheap it s a good clean one  older style hotel  clean rooms and casino is alright  nightlife is limited and it a little ways off the stip so you need to do some walking to get to anywhere good  you get what you pay for and at least this one is clean  
P =>   Great stay for the     The hotel was very nice  taking the cost into consideration  We were looking for a nice  clean place to rest at night  We got that and much more  The room  while small  served our needs very nicely  We heard no noise from the strip or the casino below and the A C functioned just fine  RE  Hotel Casino Staff  My wife dropped a small coin purse of some sentimental value with her TR card and a small amount of cash in it in the casino  While we had pretty much written off the hope of finding it again  especially w     in it  we were about to head out to the shuttle pick up area when we heard a page for my wife to return to the security booth  A staff member had located the purse and turned it in to security  Still had the card and the cash in it    A perfect end to a fantastic trip    
P =>   Rooms that are an incredible value that are located at the center of the Strip  My husband and I stayed at the Imperial Palace  IP  ober         It was our second stay at the IP within   months and we are very pleased with it and will certainly stay there again  Our room this time had been remodeled and was always very clean with a comfortable bed  The IP is located in the center of the strip which is close to the Venetian  Mirage  Caesars  the Flamingo  Harrahs  etc  The food choices at the IP are not great but just go out the door and you are just steps away from many wonderful restaurants and great shopping  We use the money that we save by staying at the IP to see the shows and eat at the better restaurants in Vegas  This is Vegas     we are always out on the town and are only in our hotel room to sleep  Believe me  it is an incredible value  
P =>   Underated Harrahs property Good central location to stay while you are in Vegas  The rooms are not that big but they were upkept quite well  I would stay here again if anything for the nice location near Caesars and the Mirage  
P =>   Needs to be updated  Imperial Palace is in a great location  but the rooms are totally out dated  the pool is nice too  but in ober the sun dont shine on the pool for very long  I dont think I would stay there again  
P =>   Fantastic    Don t let other reviews sway you  Booked this trip  trying to save a little money and still be in the middle of things on the strip  This hotel is quite a jewel      excellant location  great price  and very clean    Our room was on the   th floor of the tower and it was just perfect  We never had a problem with the tub backing up  or the toilet not working as stated in some of the other reviews  The staff was very helpful and friendly I would definitely stay here again  Check in was also easy no lines at all  So dont let the bad reviews keep you away it is a good clean place to stay without spending a fortune    
P =>   Great Place Had read reviews and were not sure about staying at the IP  We loved the place  Its located in the middle of the strip and close to everything  Will stay again  
P =>   Great value on the strip The hotel is conveniently on the center of Las Vegas strip with monorail service and a shuttle bus service from the airport for only          This is a great hotel if you are on a budget with clean rooms and prompt service  I stayed on the   th floor         with double queen size beds  There was no view from this side  just to let you know  The non smoking room was great  They also have smoking rooms There is also a pool and jacuzzi open  am  pm and the jacuzzi i think is    hours  but the pool area is open for sun bathing all day  The weather there was an average of    degrees celsius  You go through the casino lobby to get through to your room  it s always smoky and loud  I checked out the show  Cirque du Soleil  La Reve at Wynn Hotel  Third row seat for      Great show  not to be missed  Check out the Caesar s Palace Hotel mall right across Imperial Palace  You must go through different hotels  even just to check it out  You can use the monorail to take you around quickly and it costs     for the whole day  The Grand Canyon is worth the trip to Vegas alone  Although  I went to a much smaller version of that in Red Rock  I think it s about    to get in  Really great if you have kids because the hike is not strenuous  I stayed at the hotel with my bro  and my cousin  We re in our mid    s  Las Vegas is great with the right people to go with  of course  But there s something in it for everyone alike  Have fun  
P =>   Better then we expected After reading other reviews we were a little uneasy about our decision to stay here  but for the price we decided to stay with it and we are so glad that we did  When we arrived and checked in we were offered an upgrade to a suite with a huge tub  We took it and could not have been happier  The staff was helpful and friendly  I have seen many complaints about the elevator but we had no trouble at all during our stay  The rooms were a little outdated however they were clean and the bed was comfortable  We were on the side of the building so the music from the stage was not a problem at all  The location is perfect and with the monorail station in the hotel you can get almost anywhere on the strip fast  The shopping in the hotel is some what limited but there are so many choices nearby  The casino was smaller and much less intimidating then some of the others we visited  We did visit the buffet once and were not very impressed but again with so many other choices it was not a huge drawback  We will be staying at the Imperial Palace the next time that we visit and we can t wait  We also had friends join us who were able to book a room at the last second and were also extremely pleased  If you are looking for a great deal and a very decent place to stay this is a good bet  if you are looking for one of the big resorts keep looking and be willing to pay for it  
P =>   Not the classiest of hotels but very central and great entertainment Stayed   th t to  th oct Although this is not the classiest of hotels in vegas  it is right in the middle of the strip so less walking for you to do dependent which side of the strip you want to go And the hotel does have a nice atmosphere with its Dealertainers   ie the croupiers will get up and sing   some mime  badly  but others are really quite good  Can be a bit loud at times especially in the morning when wake up after a few drinks Have to say the rooms although basic were kept very clean and no matter what time of day I left my room when I cam back it would have been cleaned and new towels etc been replaced  Try not to get a room outside the car park though as every now and again the car alarms would go off  not sure why that may be   Drinks in this hotel also seem to be a lot cheaper  For example   Vodka and Tonics would cost you     in the Imperial Palace but other hotels in excess of     Overall a good trip  If you want to go to Vegas on a budget then this is the place for you  but if you like a bit more of the creature comforts in life then perhaps try Ceasers palace of Mandalay Bay The Hotel   very very nice     Croupiers are very friendly and you can have a laugh and a joke with them while you 
P =>   OK for the price and location The Imperial is centrally located in the middle of the strip s action The price is reasonable It is dated and a little  quot frumpy and frayed quot  Definitely has a  quot funk quot  factor The layout is very confusing  you can t get there from here  and the staff doesn t really help  It seems that the staffers always leave out one crucial piece of information that just leads to more confusion  My room was a  quot deluxe  quot  that supposedly had a king bed  balcony and a hot tub The king was more like a queen  the balcony was a  quot juliet quot   you could stand  but no room for a chair and the hot tub was simply a big tub w  no jets The room was clean quiet  roomy lots of towels  and everything worked The pool was nice  but they blared music at top volume all the time If you can work out a good  price deal at one of the nicer hotels on the strip  than do so  but if you can t  the Imperial is a reasonably priced alternative  
P =>   Good for the money Outstanding Location   centrally located  If you re looking to do Vegas on the cheap  then this is a great spot  If you want the glitz and and outstanding service of some nicer hotels then don t come here  Great Value  the rooms are nothing special  the elevators aren t great  it s not very big  but the price is right  The rooms probably haven t updated in a long  long time  If room looks are important to you don t come here  We had a wall heater AC  If you re just dropping off your bags and you re gone then why not  
P =>   love that i can find the elevator  i like the intimacy of this hotel  it is easy to get to your room and back out onto the greatest part of the strip  great location  and we always seem to win at this little hotel  prefer it to larger and fancier places across the street  
P =>  Love it How can you go wrong  Center of the strip      rooms  clean room and bath  clean hallways etc   good maid service  clean towels  large room with balcony  fun casino with    tables  entertainment day and night  dealer tainers  pool with barbecue and drinks  My  rd time here  wont be my last  Their coupon book at check in is one of the best  coupons for all the harrah properties  
P =>  Fun exciting time Location is great for a fun  exciting time  Helpful staff and great time for us  Would go again  
P => Perfectly pleasant hotel and casino located in a great location The Imperial Palace has not been able to keep up with the grand hotels on the strip in regards to opulance  However  we found the hotel to be very clean  the rooms spacious  and the staff extremely friendly and accomodating  In addition  the location is perfect  surrounded by the likes of the Mirage  Caesars  Bellagio  Bally s   Paris   and Planet Hollywood all within an easy walk  The price for the location was a deal  
P =>  Great value in a great location While the Imperial Palace is far from the fanciest hotel on the Strip  it cannot be beat for price or location  If all you need is a clean hotel room  How much time are you really spending in your room on a trip to Vegas anyway    the Imperial Palace is a great option  It s located near the center of the Strip right across from Caesar s Palace  The Forum Shops are a five minute walk away  Also  the hotel has several restaurants  including a buffet and a    hour diner  as well as celebrity impersonator  quot Dealer tainers quot  that make a walk through the casino enjoyable I have stayed at the Imperial Palace twice now  and I would do so again  Between the location and the price  it makes for a great home base during a trip to Las Vegas  
P => Worth the money We stayed at Imperial Palace and got married in their chapel and we were pleased with everything  The rooms were clean and the hotel was centrally located  
P =>  Cheap  We stayed at the Imperial Palace because it was  by far  the least expensive hotel on the strip that we could find  It was a relatively no frills hotel but it was right in the heart of all the action on the Vegas strip  The rooms were clean and nice  though a little on the plain side  In general the hotel is a bit outdated and the crowd is on the older side  We went to the buffet but were not at all impressed  However  the location just could not be beat  So while I wouldn t hang out there  or eat there  I would absolutely stay there again  
P =>  Nice Inexpensive Place To Stay This hotel is in a perfect location right in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip  It s older than most of the Strip hotels and lacks the glitz of most of the other hotels  However  the rooms are very inexpensive  I ve stayed there a couple of times and the room was clean and reasonably comfortable  For the budget minded traveler this is definitely a great deal  
P =>  Perfect location The IP is located right in the middle of the Las Vegas strip    the location could not be better  The check in line was a bit long  but worth the wait for the price  The room was about average  nothing fancy and the room service was great  The pool area was nice and there was a waitress walking around taking drink orders  This was the perfect location for us to walk to the shows and other bars  Bill s Bar and Saloon is right down the road and has      margaritas     Coors light cans and    minimum black jack tables  We will definitely stay here again  
P =>  Great Location and Price just got back from Vegas for my   st birthday and stayed at the Imperial Palace  I read the reviews before I left and was a little worried  Well I must say that I would recommend this hotel to others and will stay here again  We stayed in a king deluxe room that over looked the strip  I was told at check in that there might be noise because it overlooked the strip  The noise did not bother me at all  The room was nice and clean  A few things I missed were a microwave and in room coffee and refrigerator but for the most part the room was a great bargin for the two nights I was there  Remember folks you get what you pay for          
P =>  Not bad not great If you want somewhere in the middle of the strip for a reasonable price  this is probably the place  It s not fancy  far from it actually  The people at the front desk were very kind and helpful  The room was dated  and not the cleanest  The water backed up in the tub when I took a shower  It took about    minutes for it to drain  I was in Vegas for a wedding  it was a really quick trip  over and back in less tan    hours  So this hotel served it s purpose  I was only in the room a total of   hours  If I were going to stay longer  this isn t the hotel I would probably choose  
P =>  It seemed like a good idea at the time  I was travelling alone to a wedding in Las Vegas  decided on the Imperial Palace as it was central and reasonably priced  but thankfully didn t book a really really cheap room in the annex  On arrival  after a    hour journey and expecting a haven I encountered bedlam  The noise at reception is unbelievable   slot machines and drunks competing as to who can be loudest  After being herded  a la Disney  I had to communicate in sign language with a bored receptionist  was sent to the wrong lift and had to return to the ground floor still with bags as no porters were in evidence and start again  The room was clean  ish  but dingy although it did have everything I needed  If you like being a patient sardine this is the hotel for you  the lifts are slow  small and infrequent  If I had not been so worn out I would have looked elsewhere  The wifi is expensive and unreliable  room service slow and not cheap  the shops are tatty and not cheap and Bettys Diner i e the place where you will eventually be able to buy a sad overpriced sandwich is erm  interesting  If you want a bed to crash out on  fine  If you want peace and to feel vaguely safe  avoid  It was still worth it though to be at my nieces wedding at the Bellagio  Now  there is a hotel and a half          I described the hotel in an e mail tomy husband as  chav central attends a trailer trash convention   Nuff said  
P => customer service is supreme at the IP Our group of    stayed at the Imperial Palace from         thru          We had no trouble with check in  the elevator s  or cleanliness of the room s  Everyone was sofriendly and willing to go the extra mile to make our stay a pleasure  Will return for another stay in the spring  
P =>  Average and Tough to Contrast The most important thing you need to keep in mind  there s a reason the Imperial Palace is usually the best most affordable deal in Las Vegas  It s one of the older hotels on the strip and not really all that old when you think about it  it s just that hotels on the strip have an average lifespan of between    and    years First of all  no one goes to Las Vegas to spend a significant amount of time in their room unless they re passed out or drunk  If you are you re going for the wrong reasons  Is it nice to have a luxurious hotel room waiting for you to get out of the scorching hot desert atmosphere  Of course  but all you really need is a reliable base of opperations and you re set  The Imperial is perfect for this  Now its pointless to compare the Imperial to all the glamorous hotels surrounding it  It s obviously not going to stack up  but you get what you pay for  In this case its a sensible room with reliable air conditioning and the perfect location   dead center of the strip  The lobby is dingy  the decor out dated and the rooms are par at best but enjoy it  That is unless you feel like paying double the price for a room you ll hardly spend any time in  
P =>  Great Stay  Like most reviews I have read about the Imperial Palace  I do agree that some updating is needed   carpet in particular  Our room was quite nice overlooking the pool  The carpet was a bit stained  but overall  the room was neat and clean and we found everything in working order  The hotel staff was very accommodating and room service  which we had twice  was very prompt and the food was quite good  We ate at several of the restaurants in the hotel and all were equally as good  We had also read about problems with the elevators  but we found no problem with them at all  The location  to say the least  is fabulous  I have stayed at this hotel several times in the past and have always had a positive experience  This time was no exception  A great value   great service   great location   we couldn t have asked for more  
P =>  The most average hotel on the strip I would describe the IP as the most average of hotels   its not the Bellagio and at the other extreme its not Circus Circus Room had dated decor but the linen towels were changed regularly  the carper wasn t always vacuumed when the room was cleaned  The hotel corridors were very noisy at night  but then again this is Vegas and people come and go      The casino offered lower   minimum stakes than some casinos  the restaurants were pretty average  Nothing bad to say about it  likewise nothing that good either except its very central     dollar trick didn t work  
P =>   Im a fan of Imperial Palace Considering the location and price of Imperial Palace  Im not bothered with the mould in the bathroom or the stains on the floor  the staff were friendly and helped us out on finding cheap attractions in and around las vegas  Shot Imperial Palace  
P =>   Worst experience in my many stays in Las Vegas We have stayed in at least Ten      Casinos in Las Vegas  at least twice at the Imperial Palace since       and this was our worst experience  Made complimentary room reservations months in advance requesting two Queen size beds  At check in I again requested Queen size beds  Was informed at check in of a     processing fee on the FREE rooms  Assigned a room and found two double beds in room  Complained by phone  and was told Queen beds would be an additional     per night  Went down and complained in person about no notification in advance of any additional charges or room bed size costs   amp  after desk clerk talked to a supervisor was give a room with queen beds at no additional charge for this visit  My wife and daughter were trapped in an elevator because the doors would not open  Other elevators broke down at least twice during our three day stay  and the elevators were very slow  On every trip in the elevators the conversations included comments about the elevators  and at least three     times I heard persons say that they would never stay at the Imperial Palace again  and my wife said she did not ever want to stay there again either  We have stayed at other Harrahs Casinos   amp  other hotels on the strip  amp  Fremont st   amp  were always informed in advance of any additional charges for requested services or items  And we have never had to pay a Processing Fee for Complimentary rooms or an additional charge for queen beds  My brother checked in at the Imperial Palace the same day I did for his Complimentary room  amp  was not charged a processing fee  
P =>   Good deal   if you re on the move Location was great  right in the middle of the strip  I was in for my brother s wedding which was across the street at Caesar s  The room wasn t the best but didn t spend too much time there and didn t spend too much money on the room  There are little decks in the rooms lookings out to the pool which was nice  The pool was ok but you start losing the sun around    People were friendly  
P =>   Vegas on the cheap I was prepared for the worst when I booked the rooms for my latest Vegas trip at the Imperial  The Imperial didn t disappoint  Let s just say that if you are looking for a really cheap place to stay and don t mind grime  rust  stink and a bad view   the Imperial is for you  You can tell that they haven t done much with this place in the last few decades  The lobby is decent but decency ends there  The rooms were cramped  dank and really showed their age  I would place the Imperial a few pegs down from a Motel    All that being said  I would still recommend this hotel  It s a great option if you want to go to Vegas  be located in a great spot and save some money on lodging for the tables and booze  There is a decent dance club between the hotel entrance and street that is small but fun  Overall a good place to stay on the cheap  
P =>   Quit yer gripin   You get what you pay for  always have always will  IP was a great location and nothing close to the bad reviews seen here  It is what it is  a convenient location and what I liken to mildly lower grade LaQuinta  The elevators were no problem  And we were told it was one of their busiest days  It took a grand total of    minutes to check in  Since they were completely booked  we received breakfast for free  Our room was nice except we were directly over the bar  It was loud  but not that loud  We had played so much during the day that we fell right asleep and never noticed the crappy DJ  The rooms were adequate  clean  and the beds were very comfortable  Pillows were the only draw back  I called for extras and   hours later called again  We had not received enough for each bed  They immediately brought   pillows and   bath towels and apologized profusely  Hey  good enough for me If you want a little more  quot swank quot  to your hotel  spend the extra     a night and go to Monte Carlo  It s nicer  the rooms are bigger  but it s still the same room ran by the same group of people and that includes Bellagio and MGM One thing to the IP General Manager   your Entertainment Dealers look nothing like who their impersonating and putting them on a stage in the middle of the poker room with a sound track to lip synch is old and tired  There was one girl who was supposed to be Celine Dion  but she was black and had short hair  Really  spend the extra    per hour and get better side show folks One caveat   the luau dinner  It was WONDERFUL  We had the best time and met the dancers after the show  Talked with the girls in the ladies  room and they were so sweet  The food was adequate  but the crab legs  mussels  and crawfish were abundant  The Mai Tai s were cute and sweet  The creme  brulee  sucked  but it came in a cupcake wrapper so what should I have expected  The show was fun  though Stay here if you re ok with middle class travel  If you like higher middle class  don t  I ve stayed at many places and this is second time at IP  I ll stay again     They didn t have a spa opening  so they sent us to Harrah s for the same price  Harrah s spa is MUCH nicer  
P =>   Perfect Location  Imperial Palace may not be the fanciest of hotels on the Las Vegas strip  but it scores top marks for value  We stayed here for   nights  in a room located on the   th floor  Yes  it s very basic  but what do you expect for     a night   We were very pleased with the standard of our room   clean  spacious and comfortable  The TV and ironing facilities were a bonus too  The hotel itself had little to complain about  The pool area was clean and there were plenty of sun loungers and towels available for the guests  The staff were very friendly and helpful  The lifts were a pain  they take forever   take the stairs if you re only a few floors up     but I m sure many of the big hotels have this problem  Other than that  I really can t think of anything bad to say about it  I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting good value for money  It s the perfect place for budget travelers  or for those who just want to save their money to spend on the good things in Vegas  like cocktails and fancy meals  
P =>   Probably the cheapest on the strip but i d still go elsewhere First off  the rooms were fine  Pretty standard  but it was clean and nice enough  When we checked in  we were told they didn t have a double bed room for us  so we stayed in a king size for one day  The view was great  and one night sharing a bed with a friend wasn t a big deal  We then moved to a lower floor  where the rooms faced the  quot ugly quot  side  If i had thought of it  i would have asked about keeping the good view  and a smoking room  Anyway  it took me a few days to figure out the layout of the hotel  Depending on your room number  if you get on the wrong elevator you ll be walking for a long time  Certain elevators only go to rooms and others only go to the salon and stuff  The restaurants are beside the front desk  up an escalator  The wait times for the elevator are crazy long  I ve read alot of reviews about staying in the tower as opposed to the older rooms  and that s absolutely true  They are new and much nicer  The pool was nothing special  i would have liked it to have been more  I did like how the hotel was in the middle of the strip however Onto the salon  I would recomend you not wasting your time or money with this place  I called to make an appointment a few weeks before my stay  and was told i could have a triple barrel curling iron style  When i got to the appointment however  i was told that they do not have the iron for that and  quot we re the only two here  so no one would have told you that quot  I don t think calling your customer a liar is a good way to start off  But since i already booked the appointment  i would have had to pay even if i cancelled  It was also quite expensive  She didn t wash my hair  and it was    dollars to dry style it  Needless to say  the style didn t stay and i could have done a much better job by myself  Walking through the other hotels  i saw their casinos seemed more spacious  and most seemed more updated  I didn t think the breakfast place was very good  as all they had were basics  The flamingo just down the street had many more options  or there s a denny s and mcdonalds also down the road  The whole trip was very cheap  and for the money it was a good deal  Next time i go  i will be staying elsewhere  just because it seems for a little more money i get alot more bang  Some things i noticed about vegas itself were the deuce  It was    bucks for a   days pass  and i found it to be very worthwhile  This bus will take you up and down the strip  freemont street and to this wicked outlet mall with a transfer  You get on the     after to go to the mall  I would definitely reccomend the outlet mall  i found some really awesome deals  Freemont street is the best place for souvenirs  They have shot glasses  ashtrays  cups  pretty much anything you want for a dollar  There are people on the street that sell club passes  and they usually want a    dollar tip  I didn t end up using mine  but i found a great place i loved with no cover  They are part of harrah s  when you walk down a windy road with little kiosks and it s a circle bar  They do need your passport if your not from the states though  I got a showtime shuttle pass from the airport  although i found this specific company to be sub par  I would wait until i got off the plane and buy a ticket from one of the other companies  Overall  i had a fabulous time in vegas  You really can t go wrong with drinking  shopping and seeing the sights  
P =>   Brilliant location  We stayed at the Imperial Palace for a week and although we were a little disappointed when we arrived  after looking up all the big hotels before we went   for the price we paid it was well worth it  The hotel is in need of a refit but its clean and tidy and the staff were very good  The room was large and of course it had air con  It could have done with a fridge to keep our bottled water chilled but we managed OK with the ice bucket provided  The bathroom was small and you had to shut the door and stride over the toilet to get into the shower but once in the shower was hot and very powerful  They also provided shampoo  conditioner and soap  The pool was nice  a real sun trap in the morning and early afternoon but as the sun moved around it did end up in the shade  The casino was always packed and full of the usual games you would expect The location was perfect  right across the road from Caesars Palace  amp  Bellagio and about a   min walk from Venetian so we didn t actually spend much time at the hotel We tried the Burger Palace one afternoon and it was OK  We also tried to get a Pizza  Pizza Palace   but it was closed  The Chinese Korean Japanese place was open    hours but we didn t try it  The monorail was right outside too  so we used that to get to the Stratosphere at the other end of the strip There was also a car museum but we didn t get a chance to visit it All in all  the hotel interior could be better but its so cheap and if you using it like we did  simply for a bed for the night then its great value  
P =>   Imperial Palace is always my choice I stayed at Imperial Palace for   nights in ch and   nights again in tember  The location is the greatest  my room was extremely clean  I was treated great by the staff and I will stay here again on my next trip which will be soon OK so the sink and shower drained slowly  I can live with that  The water didn t stand after you turned it off  it simply drained slowly  The commode flushed normally  I don t like the buffet there and think it is overpriced even with the    off coupon  but most all Vegas buffets are pretty terrible I got an unbelievable deal there by using my Harrah s Total Reward card number and booking it at the Harrah s web site I can t get over the negative things that are said about Imperial Palace in the reviews  I think that a lot of people just look for the smallest thing to complain about and others are pure and simple snobs  It doesn t really matter  I can truthfully say that after several stays there I don t have any complaints  maybe because I didn t go to Vegas to stay in a hotel room Another thing I enjoy is that right next door at Oshea s there s a Burger King  which is great for breakfast and very good cheap coffee  and a Subway I give Imperial Palace two thumbs up  
P =>   VALUE AND LOCATION ARE GREAT this spot has the best location right in the middle of the strip  room was clean and good size and casino was pumping all week  sure its not the bellagio but for what i paid i would stay there anytime  staff were helpful and friendly  definately a good spot for any  seeking the heart of the action  
P =>   The Imperial Whatever I stayed at the imperial Palace for business and the hotel was more like a motel  It was Imperial alright but NO palace  The rooms were bare and dirty  The carpets were stained  Paints peeling and stinky rooms  The hotel is like a maze and it took forever to get to places  I ate at the Ginseng restaurant at the food was horrible  My room was pre paid for   nights    I stayed the night my flight came in and transferred to another hotel  I don t mind loosing the       dollars    it was worth every penny checking out of the hotel  
P =>  Location Location Location The Imperial Palace may be one of the more run down hotels on the Strip but its prices do reflex this and it absolutely cannot be beaten on location  The rooms were fine for what we needed  a place to sleep and to get changed etc   and were clean  I was really surprised at the shower pressure  it was amazing for being in a big hotel in the middle of the desert  The staff were great and helped quickly and efficiently with any queries we had  Never had to wait long for the elevators  the casino and pool were both fine but with the rest of the strip being so accessible I would recommend this for people using their hotel simply as somewhere to sleep  
P =>  Nice hotel for a great price When i started reading reviews on this hotel it had me a little worried that it wouldnt be nice  I stayed there for   nights and loved the hotel  We had a pretty fast checkin and the lady gave us directions to the room  When we checked out the room we were throughly impressed it was a pretty nice room especially for the price it was a deluxe room on the  th floor  We had no problems at all the room was clean the shower drained fast the maid always did a nice job  The elevators were pretty slow on the weekend but the rest of the time wasnt too bad  We were on a non smoking floor and it didnt smell at all of smoke and it was quiet too  I also love the location of the hotel too right in the middle of everything  We also ate at the burger bar restraunt that the hotel has it has nice food and great pizza ate there a few times because of the convenience and good food  I would love to stay here again if i ever came back  
P =>  You get what you pay for great location  but as most people should understand  you get what you pay for  I stayed here during my second visit to Vegas  the first time was with a friend living here   The rooms are decent  but being an older hotel  you can still smell the smoke that has saturated most of the room C mon  you re in Vegas    you shouldn t be spending time in your room anyways I probably wouldn t stay here again  but I would recommend it to people who are very cost conscious and still want to be where the action is  it is smack dab in the middle of the strip   
P =>  I would stay again but would try other Harrah s properties first I was able to get this room complimentary as I am a Total Rewards member  I was leery at first as I read many of the comments here  but I decided to take a chance The Imperial Palace is good for someone who is on a budget or is looking for no frills  The hotel is older and you can tell no improvements have been made recently I arrived at the hotel around    am  The check in process was a little time consuming  as the line was long and there were only four Guest Services Representatives  When I had the opportunity to check in  the representative confirmed my complimentary room as well as gave me discounts for sister properties  Harrah s  Bally s  Cesaers Palace  Flamingo  Rio Suites  and Paris  As everyone else has mentioned  elevators are SLOW  After a day  I became accustomed to calling my direction at both sets of elevators and then going with the one that came first The Deluxe Room was big  but could have used more furniture  maybe a sofa bed instead of table and chairs   My room had an indirect view of Cesaers Palace  but a direct view of the parking lot  If possible  ask for a room with a poool view  good for people watching  The bathroom was clean  although the drain did not flow as fast as I would  In addition  the shower would start even before you pulled the gauge to start it Housekeeping left enough towels not to have to replenish as it was just me  I do have one complaint  I came back to my room one day to see my bed unmade  The first time was okay because I had left my laptop on the bed  Housekeeping cannot touch your personal property  therefore the bed was unmade  I removed my laptop  called Housekeeping  and informed the telephone representative that I would like to have my bed made  They never came that night While at the hotel  I ate at Burger Palace  Ginseng    and the Emperor s Buffet  Burger Palace offers a     pound cheeseburger combo  burger  fries  and drink  for    XX  While I know I should have not eaten eight ounces of beef  it did fill me up  especially since I had not eaten since   am EST  Ginseng   is the    hours restaurant serving Chinese  Japanese  and Korean food  The sushi was AMAZING  Spicy Tuna rolls   and I asked for a second order  I ate at the Emperor s Buffet for breakfast the day of my departure  The cost was about     and you can tell that the buffet catered to the late night partiers and the early risers  Some of the selections included eggs  pancakes  fried chicken  rice  and cake The casino is small in my opinion  although the hotel has dealers who are impersonators  Sometimes these impersonators would perform on a mini stage  I went during Michael Jackson s birthday  so there was an impersonator for him  as well as a J  Lo  Jennifer Lopez  impersonator Pool area is SMALL  The last time I came to Las Vegas I stayed at the Riviers Hotel and their pool is twice as big  to give some perspective   Get there early if you plan to go  It was nice to sit out there and get some sun I did like the fact that the Monorail that runs from the Sahara to the MGM Grand had a stop near Imperial Palace  The Monorail run    hours a day Location of Imperial Palace cannot be beat  It is across the street from Cesaers  so you are in the middle of the strip  I did express checkout since I did not have any charges to the room  so that was easy Overall  an okay stay  if I come back to Las Vegas  I will check other Harra s properties  but I will not turn my nose at the Imperial Palace  
P =>  Disappointed Great location  smack in the center of the strip  but let down by tired rooms and poor facilities  Tried the   hr Burger Bar  at  pm  which was dirty and unkempt  The food was poor and the coffee must have come from the sink We tried the Dinner Buffet once  That was enough Although the rooms were clean and tidy with maid service daily  the fixtures were showing signs of age  A lot of the silvering on the Bathroom mirror was missing  the balcony door refused to shut and the  quot Air Con quot  was the noisiest in LV They have a gimmick whereby certain dealers in the Casino are look alikes and will at random jump up onto a small podium and sing  Without doubt  quot Billy Idol quot  got the place rocking  but several of the others should stick to dealing Stayed at Circus Circus   years ago  and if we went again we d be happy to go back there  we holiday on a tight budget  At the end of the day  we only used the Hotel for somewhere to sleep  we ate  gambled and partied elsewhere in LV and had a great time  
P =>  Can t Beat the Location or the Service The hotel is an older one that could certainly use renovating but if you were like us  the room is basically a place to lay your head for a few hours  shower and get up and go all over again  We knew what to expect from recommendations from friends but were at first somewhat taken aback  Upon arrival  the room looked clean and sufficient to meet our needs  We did have a problem the first night with a backed up shower and slow flushing toilet  Front desk immediately sent someone over to take care of the problem and we were then good to go  As I am not a fan of air conditioning  we decided to open the balcony door but later learned that water bugs love humidity and found one in our room  Another call to the front desk and we were immediately moved  They were fantastic in their customer service and left us quite happy The location alone is by far the best along the strip  Convenient to everything without having to cross bridges or large intersections  Well worth the value and an enjoyable stay was had  
P =>  Great location great service great time  The location of this hotel is spot on  It s right in the middle of the strip  next to the flamingo  mirage and several other big casinos  The hotel and casino are fairly cheep and cheerful but that was fine with us  We found the staff very friendly  especially those at the bar  The  lookalike  dealers in the casino were hilarious and kept us entertained  The food at the hotel isn t great but with so many places to eat nearby  you don t need to stay there anyway  I would definitely recommend this place  We had a fantastic time  especially at the bar   and would certainly stay there again  
P =>  Good hotel great location My friend and I stayed at Imperial Palace ust        We had stayed there previously so we knew what to expect  Our check in process was no problem and Ben  at check in  was friendly and very accommodating  We asked for adjoining rooms and there was no problem  Our rooms were clean and our floor was quiet  We ate breakfast at the Emperor s Buffet   times with no complaints and the Tea Palace for one breakfast and everything was good  The  quot dealertainers quot  in the casino were fun and put on good shows  Our only  quot complaint quot  would be that the elevators were a little slow and one was not working our entire stay  If you re looking for a clean hotel with a fun casino and great location to other places  stay at the Imperial Palace  We would definitely stay there again  
P =>   This will do if you are on a Budget This is a vast hotel on the strip so cant be beaten for location  The rooms are large and clean but not fancy  We didn t gamble  teenagers  but everyone seemed happy enough on the floors  The pool is large but packed so avoid at all costs  The Emperors Buffet is simple and filling  Valet parking is cheap and efficient  A decent place at a reasonable rate  
P =>   Great Location Great People Below Average Facility For a hotel in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip  this is dissappointing Service was great  casino dealers good  except the one crap table  where one of the money guys kept hitting the die with his hand    Food choices were not good  Room was clean but basic  small TV  toilet ran a lot  shower didn t drain well   Location is the strength  it s right in the middle of the Strip  You can walk to a lot of great places like the Bellagio  Ceasar s  Harrahs     Dealertainers in casino were fun  Others  not so much  Overall you have to decide if the location and the really cheap rates are worth a crummy room    
P =>   Whats everyone complaining about  I cannot stand people who do not do research before hand then write bad reviews because it is not what they expected  This was my first time in Vegas  as long as I had a room to sleep and to put my belongings then I was happy  The hotel is awesome location  central strip and very cheap among other hotels on the strip  So why is it that people think they are staying in a   star hotel for that cheap of a price  I was very happy with the service  very happy with the location  and very satisfied for a bed and a bathroom for the price I paid  You do not come to Vegas to stay in your room and complain about the tv  get out and enjoy the city  
P =>   No frills   great location Firstly a great location   right opposite Caesars Palace on the strip  Much better placed than some of the other alternatives such as Circus Circus  Room was clean  but could have been much better  Shower tap not working properly and some cracks chips in the bathroom  Compared to one of my friends experience we had a good room  Some of the others in my group had rooms that overlooked a carpark or looked straight into a wall  whereas I got a room which overlooked the pool  Air conditioning is very noisy The biggest gripe i have about this place is the lifts  It often took up to ten fifteen minutes of waiting for the lifts and it became a joke with all the other guests staying there  So if you have any place to be to go make sure you allow for this  In summary  If you want somewhere central  thats cheap and are willing to forgo the extras then this is an okay place to stay  We spent so much time out and about that we hardly spent much time here so it worked for us  If you want some luxury and relaxation time  i would personally stay somewhere else  
P =>   Awesome Excellent customer service from front end staff  bar service quick  polite and friendly  Valet service quick and informative  Awesome room  simple and clean  Great view of the strip  Location is prime and the hotel has a simple feel to it  The size makes things easy and you can t get lost  Vegas can turn into a headache and this hotel puts your mind at ease  It was a grat place to stay and I am staying there again this year  
P =>   Great Location Great Casino Great Value  I stayed at the Imperial Palace in        and loved it  so of course when I went back this past week for the first time in   years  I decided to stay again at the Imperial Palace  After reading some less than stellar reviews  I got a bit worried  though  I m glad I went with my instinct and not with the lame reviews of the IP  This place is great  It s located in the center of the strip  the staff was great  the rooms were clean  AND CHEAP    and the casino was a blast  The Dealertainers were so much fun   play blackjack with Tony Orlando  you won t regret it  he dealt until my shuttle showed up  and if it weren t for his tips  I wouldn t walked out of there with more money than I started with   The rooms were clean  Of course they re dated  but what do I care about that  I just wanted a clean room  clean bed sheets  and clean shower  All of which were available to me  Do not believe the garbage people are saying about the Imperial Palace  Sure  there was a slight wait for elevators during peak hours  but I waited no more than   minutes for the elevator at any time  All seemed to be working to me  so I m not sure why people are still there are many out of order  My opinion  if you re young  and all you want is a clean cheap room  the Imperial Palace is the place for you  I will stay here again when I go back to Vegas   hopefully it ll be much sooner rather than later  
P =>   Hotel badly in need of renovation  I don t quite know how to describe this place  It s the trailer park of the Las Vegas Strip First of all  the positive of this place is LOCATION  You couldn t pick a better location period  But I have stayed here twice and each time has had its different miseries The entire hotel and casino in general is extremely dated and dirty  It was probably a nice place back in the    s or    s    and it honestly looks and feels as if it has had absolutely maintenance since then  You have to wait in LINES  long lines   literally  to access the main elevators  I waited once for twenty or thirty minutes  Entire place is congested period  Just checking in can instantly put you in a bad mood Bar and restaurant staff are not friendly at all  Security  card dealers and other staff members equally unhelpful and most act as if they hate their jobs  Each of IP s restaurants that I have tried have not simply been BAD  but VERY NASTY period  I sincerely hope that some day soon a better chain will purchase this place and do a floor to ceiling renovation  It sucks that the best location on the LV Strip is occupied by such a Hellhole  People say   quot it s good for a tight budget quot  or  quot it s a good     quot  hotel  I completely disagree  I have stayed cheaper at both Riviera and Treasure Island  As far as being a good  quot Sin City quot  adult establishment  it s just a judgment call  You can get anything you want anywhere on the Strip as long as you feel like walking or making a phone call I m not giving them a third chance  
P =>   Fun budget Hotel Fun and friendly  if your looking for class go elsewhere This Hotel is great if on a budget even though its allot older than others on the Strip  Central location is perfect for getting around  staff are fun and friendly  food was good  Not as stuffy as some of the bigger hotels with a relaxed atmosphere  Rooms adequate and clean but did feel a little old  Beware if your room is situated out the front of the building as we asked to be moved due to the loud music coming from a tent below which would go on all day until late at night  Once moved to the back of the hotel was lovely and quiet  also lifts can be annoying as they seem to stop on every floor  But for the price and location you couldn t ask for a cheaper hotel Also some of the surrounding Hotels are equally budget  but within a short distance of Caesars and other larger hotels  Check out Oshays    beer and the leprechaun  
P =>   Great for young people trying to save some     My boyfriend and I stayed at the Imperial Palace         The location could not better be  It is literally in the middle of the strip  An easy walk to every big casino  We arrived at the hotel at      pm and only waited      minutes to check in  It was very quick  The room was simple  but clean  I only waited twice for the elevator  but I found it quicker to walk down the stairs and only ride up the elevator to avoid the wait  We ate at two restaurants late night at the hotel  Both were ok for late night food  The casino floor was always full of a good crowd  but I never had trouble finding a seat to place a bet  I would definitely stay here again  It was very inexpensive and did not dissappoint me  
P =>   Not that bad I was VERY skeptical when we reserved this hotel in Vegas  I was sooo worried about the rooms and the things everyone was saying about it  It is true that you get what you pay for and if you want newer hotel then this is not it  It is not Caesars Palace or the Bellagio but it wasnt that bad  If somehow you end up in the back of the hotel  good luck finding the front  it is a good distance and depending on what time you come in there will be NO ONE to guide you  All in all  it wasn t that bad  We did not eat at any of the restuarants inside the hotel  simple because we were on the go the entire time  The casino was PACKED every night  It was unbearable  Im not sure if it was because of the low table limits or if it was because of the  quot dealtainers quot   they were great  They definitely keep you smiling and laughing  The check in process was a bit long but the second the line got long  there were   desk clerks that came from the back to make the check in speed up  We checked in on a Friday night around   pm and waited about    minutes  The elevators were NO problem  considering how crowded the hotel was and never once did I feel unsafe in them even when it was crowded  They came quickly when we called for them  The room was great  We had room         queens  and it was very clean and tidy  The housekeepers came and did an excellent job each day  I have only one complaint when it comes to the room  the television  It was like a    inch tube television with    channels  it          Then again  who goes to Vegas to watch television Overall this hotel wasn t that bad at all  I would definitely recommend it and I definitely would stay there again  If I ever go back there and I need an inexpensive  decent place to stay  this is it  
P =>   Don t eat there     If you are looking for the best value on the strip  than the Imperial Palace is great  It was very inexpensive for the great central location  The room had peeling wallpaper  and a constant running faucet  You definately get what you pay for the room  The elevators are definately not well planned  We averaged       minutes to get from the   th floor to the lobby  The stay was very cheap  so I suppose drawbacks are to be expected  DO NOT EAT AT THE TEAROOM             I went for a bachlorette party  and myself and the bachlorette spent most of our weekend in the drab room with what we think may be a parasite infection from the food at breakfast at the Tearoom  Aside from leaving breakfast with a racing heartbeat and shaking we spent most of the weekend sick to our stomaches in the hotel  It s   days later  and I am seeing a doctor in the morning  DO NOT EAT THERE  The hotel in general is a great value if you are on a budget  The location was perfect  so if that is what you are looking for  try a few extra bucks and make your vacation worth it at Caesars Palace across the street  And    if you do stay there      DO NOT EAT THE FOOD             and please request and extra roll of toliet paper  
P =>   Very clean great value brilliant location I stayed in the Imperial Palace for   nights a couple of weeks ago  ust      Apart from the fact that the elevators did take ages  everything else was perfect   There were   of us and each of the   rooms were extremely clean  quiet and very comfortable to stay in  Also  the hotel is in the perfect location  right in the middle of the strip  And as for the price  it was great value  What more could you ask for   I would definitely recommend this hotel  
P =>   should ve stayed at hooters room was dirty  Parking was a pain  No coffee pot in room  what s up with that  Had to have a pot sent to room       Elavators very slow  Hotel staff was great  Watch out for people selling timeshares  Met couple who s whole day was ruined dealing with timeshare company for just a free diner  Visited friend staying at Hooters  His room was clean and at a great location  
P =>   Hotel worked great for us I was hesitant to stay here after reading the reviews  but couldn t pass up the cheap rates combined with the mid strip location  This was my  th trip to Vegas so I knew location was everything  and also that I wasn t going to spend much time in my room  Our room wasn t impressive in any way  it was pretty standard but clean enough  Two beds and a  very small  balcony that overlooked the pool  We had no problems with our bathtub shower  We had an iron  as well  which worked fine  I can imagine  though  in this older  cheaper hotel the rooms vary quite a bit in cleanliness  smell  etc The best thing about the hotels is the location  right in the middle of the strip    across from Caesar s  near the Mirage  short walk to Venetian and all the others  O Shea s next door is lots of fun if you want to play beer pong or flip cup The drawbacks to the hotel  I will echo others here  are the elevators  They were extremely slow  We snuck up the stairs on more than one occasion  but the other reviewer s are right  the stairs are usually locked  The parking lot is weird but I flew in so this wasn t a problem  I would highly recommend the airport shuttle if you are arriving alone  it is cheaper than a taxi and stops at most major hotels  though it takes longer  Another thing I like is since the hotel isn t as huge as some of the others  it is easy to quickly pop back up to your room if you re walking up and down the Strip  assuming the elevators cooperate   Plus  you have impersonators at the tables and although they aren t the best  it is entertaining to see who s there  The hotel doesn t have as many amenities as the larger ones  the casino is quite basic  not a lot of dining options  the rock bar  quot club quot  in the front wasn t great  etc    but all the larger ones are close by And finally  for your night owls  our favorite thing about the Imperial Palace was the    late night breakfast special   We had this almost every night we were there       for a full breakfast  pancakes  eggs  bacon  hash browns     and it is served late at night  I can t remember the exact hours  probably     a m  or something  Great for drunk people coming back to their hotel hungry   I hope they still have it when I go back this fall  Oh  and the hotel allowed me to check my bags after checkout in a storage room  as I had a late afternoon flight  This is nice for those in my same situation  And it was free In short  if you are looking for no frills  cheap and convenient    and don t plan on spending too much time in your room or your own hotel  the Imperial Palace is a good deal  
P =>   OK but not really my kinda place I checked into the IP on friday august  th to attend a poker tourney at RIO  Check in was quick and was in my room by    am  Check in staff were polite and courteous  The room was in need of a refurb but it was clean and spacious  I noticed some things like cracks in the counter and rust stains around the drain but I am not put off by that as some people are  The room is cheap and for center of the strip no one should complain  If you require better accomadations pay better money  I found I was a little out of my element cause I am older and a bit of an early bird and I got up at   am one morning to go down to the casino and it was like a college party downstairs with more drunk    somethings and numerous fights in the casino     Oh I remember those days problem is if I did that now I d be hung over for a week   LOL and I hope I was never as embarrassing as those kids were LOL  If you only knew      I really enjoyed the casino staff   they helped make my time on the tables fun even if I was losing  The drink service was super   never once did I have to ask for a server  The one big complaint I do have is being an early bird myself I couldn t find a restaurant open in the hotel other than an all night burger joint which wasn t what I was looking for at     in the morning  The hotel is definately better suited for       year olds looking for a fun loose and cheap place to party on the strip  I don t begrudge them     maybe I am just a little jealous    LOL  Would I stay here again   probably not   but I do recommend it   for like I said   that         year old college crowd or group looking to party cheap on the strip  Rock on dude        
P =>   Their slogan says it perfectly  I am a Total Rewards member and was able to book a mid week stay at Imperial Palace through the TR site for an unbelievably low price  I knew what to expect going in   nothing fancy  and that was true  But my experience overall was very good considering the price I paid  No major problems and only a couple minor annoyances I stayed in a king bed room with a balcony and pool view  Again  nothing fancy  but everything that you need is there  The bed is fairly comfortable  there is a small    inch TV  the lighting is decent  There is a hair dryer and iron and ironing board provided in the room  Best of all  the room was quiet  Besides the room  the casino is decent but not one of my favorites on the Strip  What I ve seen other people write about the elevators is very true   an extremely long wait if you try to take the ones next to the casino  I suggest walking further down the hall toward the parking lot  I found the wait to be much shorter there  The parking garage is also a little sketchy  with dim lighting and some foul smells  Last minor complaint   the pool is only open from         I thought these were extremely limited hours  For what I paid  I would have been happy with less than what the hotel offered  I got a clean room for cheap  and the location can t be beaten  Right across from Caesar s Palace in the center of the Strip  The hotel s slogan says it perfectly    quot Good fun  Great Value  Perfect Location  quot  They know how to market themselves  It s nothing fancy  but it s a fine place to stay without spending much or having to worry about driving home  or paying a lot for a taxi ride  after a night on the Strip  
P =>   Perfect for anyone on a budget We were not expecting great things from the Imperial Palace as we paid very little for   nights here  however what a surprise to have such an awesome room  which had a balcony  two double beds  cable tv  a great bath shower  huge sink area with massive mirror  and much more  Apart from the decor being a little dated it was very clean and had everything we needed  When you walk outside you are literally opposite Caesars Palace  and so close to everything else  I am still shocked at how cheap it really was  We had a fantastic time staying here  the swimming pool is quite simple but fine for what a pool can be  They had to handle a bit of drama when I was at the pool one of the days when a guy threw some stuff from his balcony at the top as he was locked out  which actually could have caused major harm to anyone below  the security staff and pool staff dealt with this very well and quickly  The only thing they could actually improve on is the speed of the lifts  there are generally queues to go up in them Make sure you check out the impersonators in the casino  they are hilariously awful    
P =>   Not the best place to stay Centrally located on the Las Vegas Strip between Harrahs and the Flamingo  This hotel s entrance is set back from the strip and not well marked  I pulled into the parking garage which was also a bit of a maze  After completing this little habitrail experience I then had to make my way back to the hotel and casino area to find the front desk for check in  There was a massive line at check in and it seemed the entire south central LA scene was there  After     minutes I was finally able to check in  The hotel staff was friendly and accommodated my room upgrade request without any hassle whatsoever  I stayed in the King Suite  Back through the hotel again to the elevators  The elevators here are dire need of upgrading  They are old and slow and there are regularly lines of up to     mins just to wait on an elevator which would show up full  The stairs are useless  As they only let you in at any floor but you can only get out on the first floor  The room was nice and moderately appointed  The TV was a    quot  tube TV and the remote had no batteries in it which made it useless as well  The rooms spa tub was massive and could easily accommodate   of your closest friends  The sofa in the living room also pulls out into a queen sleeper  As mentioned in other reviews the water drains extremely slowly in the shower tub so even though you are in a   X   tub you re gonna end up with water around your ankles  The room service menu was missing from the rooms notebook so I had no chance to test it out  The maids here pretty much sucked  They did not clean the room even though I put the sign out  They did come in and exchange the towels but did not do ANYTHING else including make the bed  Internet service is an extra        per day that is completely unacceptable in this day and age  The pool area was nice as far as being a large rectangle surrounded by concrete  The concrete coating however was very HOT and slippery  bring sandals  The bar area at the pool had lots of drink specials and the waitresses were very nice  The club at the Imperial is called Rock Band but it certainly did not play ANY rock music  The ladies I talked with here said that the guys in the club were overly aggressive and they did not have a good time  Overall not the best and not the worst  The best part about it was the central location  
P =>  Imperial Palace We first arrived at the Imperial Palace around      pm  We had to wait about    minutes in line before being properly checked in  I thought that this was fine being that it was a Saturday and everyone was trying to get their room  We got to our non smoking room and it reeked of smoke  I dismissed the smell because the young lady at the desk said that we could do an upgrade tomorrow for free  After getting settled  my husband checked the  th    th and   th floor for ice and all the machines were out of order  I didn t want to get irritated  so I called down stairs to ask where I could get some ice  After getting the run around  the manager finally pulled some strings and had room service bring up   buckets of ice  for free  Otherwise  they were going to charge me   bucks  As far as the room  it was old but despite the smell  it looked clean  The Imperial Palace is just an old hotel all together The next day  we got our upgrade as promised and found the room was old but very nice  We had a mirror over our bed as well as a mirror over the huge Jacuzzi looking garden tube  It had a couple other nice things about the room as well  One thing that I liked about the hotel was the entertainment  They had several celebrity impersonators working as dealers at the casino and they would also do performances  My favorite was the Michael Jackson one whom really put on an excellent show  In the back of the casino area  they had a couple fast food restaurants  like Burger King or Subway  if you wanted to eat on a lower budget  Also  they had room for Beer Pong and other games  It kind of gave you a variety inside the hotel  As far as the restaurants  we didn t really get to eat inside because most of the time it was unappealing  closed or about to close  I think that the Imperial Palace is a good place to stay if you are not hung up on luxury accommodations  If you would like a nice clean place to stay and somewhere that people are having fun  try them  It s in the middle of the strip and not far from a good time  
P =>  Good price and    on the Strip  Good prices during the weekend considering you will be on the Strip in front of the Ceasar Palace  Friday Saturday prices become very high in all famous hotel nearby  It is not a recent renovated hotel  but it is clean and staff is very helpful to satisfy your needs  I ve been in Capri buildings   night  little motel inside the Imperial palace  and the room was very spacious and clean  but outside the door you have the garage and you have to walk through it to arrive inside the main hotel  btw this was not a big issue for me   nd night I ve been in a suite of the Imperial palace  very spacious  with a big round dirty bath inside the room    So if you just want a clean hotel on the Strip with an affordable price this is for you  
P =>  Good    women from Iowa traveled to the hottest place in the US for   days   nites thru Allegiant Airlines  None of us knew what to expect  all that mattered was memories were to be had and a great time doing so  We arrived very late in the evening  with no shuttle or check in problems  Our   th floor room was located near the elevator and was clean and cool  and surprisingly  very quiet  The bed was comfortable and we always had clean towels  The Impersonators on the casino floor were a hoot and access to the rooms is easily loacted from the Casino front entrance  Yes  we had issues with ice  the entire place is outdated  and the elavators worked     the time  but if your plans are to actually enjoy LV  then none of this should matter  There is no better location than HERE  unless you are at the hotels across from or beside the Imperial  Shops  eateries  casinos  all easily accessible  I would highly suggest to first get a        day pass on the Deuce double decker bus and you can get on and off the strip and downtown  it runs   hrs  OR walk  I would probably stay here again knowing that I would be just as busy as I was this trip  The beds were very comfortable  the room was cool  the price was right  and that s all I required on this trip  We had a lot of fun even in the      temps  A trip is what you make it     
P =>  Loved it    i stayed in room tr     from july   th to june   rd  my room looked like the online pics and had all necessities the most i waited for the elevator was   minutes great location staff and price waited in check out line less than    minutes which is great if you have    people in front of you  
P =>  Pleasantly surprised After much reluctance in booking a stay at the IP  I had heard a LOT of bad reviews about this place   my boyfriend and I were set to experience what the IP had to offer  We had booked a Luv Tub room for   nights at     night for the end of y  and after waiting    minutes to check in and tipping the front desk clerk     bucks  we were given a KING SUITE  Sweet   The line to check in was  granted  long  but the check in process took no more than    minutes  So that was pretty good  After a walk that seemed to take forever  we finally reached the elevators  Just as I expected  only   were working  I found it rather entertaining to see a group of people waiting for      minutes for the elevator to come  only to have    people making a mad rush into the elevator before the doors close We finally got to our room  and I was pretty impressed with the condition of the room  Sure  it may not be furnished beautifully like the rooms at Wynn or the Bellagio  but it was adequate  The Luv Tub was ginormous  My     quot  boyfriend could almost lie down without bending his knees on the bottom of the tub  There was also a separate living room with a sofa bed  which I found pretty nifty  We even had our own balcony  too  Not much of a view  though  unless you like some old half naked man watching you from across  We were way up on the   th floor so the noise level was very minimal  No complaints there  The casino was all right  I greatly disliked the amount of cigarette smoke in it  but then again  cigarette smoke is found in every Vegas casino  ha   it just felt like there was   x more smoke at the IP  Anyway  there were a lot of low limit tables and games about which we found to be ideal since we re poor college students trying to find a game that won t make us any poorer The Dealertainers were super friendly and some of them were very talented  even though a few looked NOTHING like who they were supposed to impersonate  Props to them for being awesome singers  though  I was quite entertained  Didn t try their buffet  It looked pretty empty  so I kinda took the hint that it was something I didn t want to invest my stomach in Overall  it s a pretty decent hotel  It s old and in desperate need of a face lift  but hey  you do get what you pay for  The location of the hotel is so so convenient  Caesar s Palace  Bellagio  and other   star resorts are a   minute walk away  Now  how awesome is that  If you don t mind a little normal wear and tear  ridiculously slow elevators  and that old  corny Vegas charm  then the IP is the place for you  Plus  the IP is super cheap considering most visitors spend an average   hours in the room each day  It was definitely a good value  
P =>  You could do better  It was cheap         for   days  but you get what you paid for  It is Las Vegas of course and you will be paying for everything  I was surprise to have to pay for shuttle pick up  fitness facilities  and internet access  You have no plans of staying in the hotel while you there anyway so if your looking for something very inexpensive and don t need all the simple things to make your life easier  This is the hotel for you  I have to do more research anyway  this was just a quick vacation  Next time I return to Vegas I will splurge a little  
P =>  Still a good value Wife and I got the  quot luv tub quot  room and liked it very much  The room was very comfortable and the air conditioning worked well even with the    degree weather  The room was clean and we had no problems with the service The best features of this hotel were the center strip location  and the low price One down side was the really long wait to check in  We checked in about      pm on a Friday and the line was REALLY long  They had a security guard to keep people under control and plenty of desk workers  so the actual wait was about    minutes   much shorter that it first appeared Another down side is the slow and overcrowded elevators  At certain times it seemed impossible to get an elevator  We finally found another bank of lesser used elevators that were a longer walk away  but still a shorter wait The casino is not really very big  but very popular  and crowded   Michael Jackson may have something to do with it s popularity Parking was convenient  only because we rented a small car that could get into tight spaces  The parking garage is not well suited to large vehicles because of the tight turns and narrow parking spaces  
P =>  If you are looking for Price and Place I stayed   days in this hotel  I seems it is one of the oldest hotels of las vegas  Old fashion  Old style  if you are looking for price and you want to be close to everything this should be your choice  But you get what you pay  Low Price  low service and low luxury  The room was clean  I was all day out of the hotel and I never used any of the ammenities  like the swimming pool  I only went back every day to sleep  
P =>  great service great value great location This hotel is ideally situated for everything on the strip The service is terrific especially the waitreses Watch the dealertainers they are very good This hotel is not big by Vegas standards but is very homely The staff are very helpful and polite Lots of Penny slots to keep any one happy Overall a brilliant holiday  
P =>  Wouldn t stay here again There s a reason that the Imperial Palace is one of the cheapest hotels on the strip and that is because it s one of the oldest hotels on the strip  and it shows  Lets get the bad stuff out of the way first  First thing is the decor  I swear this place hasn t been re modeled  repainted  re carpeted  re tiled or re anything since it was built  Only half of the elevators work and are very slow  The carpeting throughout the entire hotel is dirty  torn and tattered  The paint on the walls is yellow due to all the nicotine and cigarette smoke which tells me that the ventilation system is out of whack  The rooms are clean however our air con unit was very noisy  our shower didn t drain until    minutes after showering  the balcony door didn t lock  there is no mini fridge in the room  that s a tough one to figure out  and again the decor is ancient  We had a room facing the strip on the   th floor and I have to warn you that if you turn in before  am don t count on any sleep before then because there is a bar right below the hotel that plays live music turned up to infinity until that time  Thank God we only retired to our room   night at around  am  We also took notice of room service trays dishes sitting in the hallway for   days before being picked up  can you say cockroaches  yikes  The pool is way to small for the size of the hotel and most of the deck chairs are broken  The restaurants are overpriced for what you get and they re tricky to find  We only ate at the hotel twice  once for breakfast and once for lunch  Now on to the good points    Location is excellent  Center strip  but then so are a lot of other hotels  Ceasars is right across the road and so is the Mirage    The monorail is right out the back door of the hotel and this connects you to other hotels along the strip from the Sahara at one end to the Luxor at the other     The staff are all very courteous and helpful  Check in only took about    minutes and the maids always had a good morning for us     The dealertainers are a blast especially the Britney Spears one that made my time at the blackjack table well worth while In all honesty what the owner s  of this hotel need to do is spend some of that cash they re raking in and level this place and build a new Imperial Palace  seriously  The place really is a dinosaur  They could build a new hotel that would rival any place on the strip  If your looking for a throwback to the early seventies then stay here but if you want something a whole lot better for not a whole lot more stay somewhere else  When we return to Vegas we will be staying at Treasure Island  Mirage  the Wynn  the Encore  the Venetian or Ceasars  anywhere but the Imperial Palace I hope this review helps you in your decision  
P =>  Do you expect any better for the price  We have stayed at the Imperial Palace   times now  We really enjoy the atmosphere  Yes  it s smokey  Yes  it s older  But what do you expect when you pay so little  Imperial Palace is right in the middle of the strip  you are so close to other Casinos  shopping  and dining  We were not happy  with the view  so they changed our room   times  Now that s service  We like this hotel for affordability and location  How often do you actually stay in your room anyway  
P =>   NEVER AGAIN   Our first time to Las Vegas   Expecting something wonderful from the reviews that had been previously read on this site   Couldn t have been more wrong The whole Casino Hotel needs a facelift   Lifts slow and often out of order   Ice machines aways empty as with no mini fridge s in room  unless you pay an extra     a nite  ppl bring their eskies and fill them up with the ice  leaving no more ice     Food avail in the Hotel limited  No buffet breakfast   Staff tired and overworked  Wallpaper comming off the walls  skirting boards kicked in with no attention to repair   Pool area small and over crowded no cover from the intense heat of y   Perfect for young ppl who don t care about a little comfort   As for us  and everyone I spoke to while staying there   We will never stay here again  and I would never recommend this Hotel to anyone    
P =>   This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in  When I first arrived  I waited for about a half an hour to check in  The line at the front desk is always long  no matter what time you walk by  Finally checked in and went to the elevators  and called the elevators  it took about    minutes for an elevator to come down  Went to my room and the iron was missing  So I called front desk and they asked if they may send someone up  quot now quot  with a new one   quot Now quot  meant half an hour  before somebody came  The iron was ancient and the ironing board was so dirty that I had to put a towel over it  to iron my clothes  The iron was basically lukewarm  couldn t iron my clothes with it and opted for the old school steamy shower method  That was the only time front desk picked up the phone when I called for the rest of the trip  In the evening we tried getting ice  the ice machine was broken  We tried the ice machines on the   and  th floor as well  with no luck  Upon reaching front desk  my friend was told to try the  th floor  The funny part was  that in the evening you would see people running around the hotel with ice buckets  We were there for   days and every day we had to use the ice machine on a different floor  We asked for extended check out on our last day and yet they still proceeded to lock us out after    o clock  Called front desk to send somebody up with a key  and    mins later  no one showed up  My friend flipped out because she needed to catch a flight and decided to go downstairs and  quot raise hell quot   Well  as she was going down on the elevator  it got stuck     I talked to a few locals  one of them did some electrical work for Harrah s  which owns the Imperial Palace  and said he would never eat anything at these hotels ever again  Another local told me that it is and I quote  quot The most ghetto hotel in Vegas  You re better off staying at a motel quot  Take my advise and stay at Excalibur if money is an issue  although it s a little bit further down the strip  it ll save you lots of headaches  
P =>   You get what you pay for Although the IP is a great location  and a great deal  my husband and I are willing to pay more in the future for a better hotel  When we got there  we waited for about    minutes to check in  The elevators took forever and were crowded the entire   days we stayed there  Elderly people were also waiting with their walkers in hand  to go down on the elevators  since they couldnt go down the stairs  What if there was a fire  These people wouldnt make it out alive  All of the elevators didnt even work  The ones that did  the doors kept getting stuck or they couldnt move  EVERYONE was complaining  Anyhow  our  quot deluxe quot  room this year was way worse than our standard room last year  None of the ice machines worked  A man came down from the penthouse because his didnt even work  The rooms were as clean as they could be i guess  Beds were uncomfortable  you could feel the springs all night long  The bathroom looked outdated  but the water pressure in the shower was great  We could have changed rooms  but to noisy ones facing the stip  We declined  All I can say is  you get what you pay for  It is very affordable and a great location  but thats about it  We wont be back  
P =>   Could have been a lot worse After reading the past reviews of this hotel  I was a bit concerned with what I would find upon my arrival  I was traveling with my daughter and meeting some friends who were staying at another hotel  I booked my reservations in il and had a  quot non cancellation quot  clause attached to my reservation      so some of the reviews scared me because we were staying for   nights  I mentioned this to the receptionist at check in and she gave us a nice room  My biggest concern was the cleanliness of the room  and I would like to start by saying that I was pleasantly surprised to find myself on a non  smoking floor that didn t have that lingering smoke smell that is often found in hotels  plus the room was very clean  The hotel is older  so the bathroom needed a little repair  sink crack   but it was still clean   and the maid came in daily to check on our supplies and make the beds  Our room had a little balcony that overlooked the pool and provided some free entertainment   the music from the pool was upbeat  as were the poolside games  In the evenings  the room and hallway were both quiet  The free entertainment in the casino was excellent  We thoroughly enjoyed the impersonation shows and attended Human Nature  a motown review show that was awesome The concierge  Ryan  got us tickets in the front row  and we had a blast during the high energy show  The hotel is centrally located near all of the big attractions  We did find the buffet here to be lacking compared to others we have eaten at  but again  the price was lower  We had dinner at Toby Keith s bar and grille right next door and walked the block to garitaville and to watch the Bellagio water show  Caesars Palace and Forum are right across the street as well  The monorail runs from this hotel  so there is access to any hotel on the strip     excellent location for the price   Okay  now for the downfalls     only   out of the   elevators worked and they were always packed or very slow in coming  luckily we were on the  th floor and used the stairs quite a bit  The same thing goes for the ice machine     there was NO ice on our floor  and I had to trek the different floors to find ice  I actually believe only   floors had ice at any given time      kind of a necessity during the month of y  If you don t mind the inconvenience of ice hunting and using stairs  then I would say go for this hotel Overall I would give this hotel a good rating for the price     basically  you get what you pay for  If you want fancy pay the bigger dollar and head to one of the newer  bigger hotels  I think asking for a nice room at the beginning helped     get the pool view  
P =>   Don t be misled by negative reviews My wife and i spent a week here after getting a cheap deal despite reading some negative reviews What we found was a Hotel with a fantastic location right in the middle of the strip rooms are clean and well serviced staff are friendly and helpful  OK it s not Caesars or the Bellagio or the MGM but more than good enough  Bettys Diner Burger Palace and The Tearooms have good food at reasonable prices but in our opinion stay clear of the Pizza Palace all you can eat pasta as it was absolutely rank   You really need to get out and about and prepare for some serious walking as Vegas is HUGE  Take advantage of the Deuce bus service which runs every      minutes and will take you all along the strip and further a field for    for a day ticket but make sure you visit Fremont which is on the bus route and is an absolute must for all your Vegas souvenier tack        but a great light show and all the original Vegas hangouts we can highly recommend the Bay Street Diner located in the Golden Nugget Hotel and Casino Have fun 
P =>   Great value I stayed at the Imperial Palace with my partner for five nights the week of y  th and was a little leary after reading some not so good reviews  However  I know you have to take the best ones and the worst ones and just disregard them and go with those in the middle  You certainly can t please everyone  So I was pleasantly suprised  The hotel was a little gaudy  but nice and clean  And I found the staff there nicer and more pleasant than at any other hotel we visited during our stay  The rooms were clean  of average size and competely adequate  I was led to believe by Travelocity that our room would have a    quot  plasma television  which it did not  And when I called the front desk  they said they didn t have any rooms with    quot  tv s  And of course  it wasn t printed in my Travelocity itinerary  so beware of that  We went to the Luau that they have at the pool every Tuesday and Saturday and it was relaxing and fun  Not the greatest show  but worth the low cost  We got the VIP seating for this and were right up front  It included open bar  but they didn t allow you to order any top shelf booze in your drinks  I thought the pool was just fine  though it is ranked as one of the worse in Vegas  It of course is just a square pool  but I don t require anything fancy  Just some water  a bartender  towels and a lounge chair  I also had my lunch at the pool one day and it was very good and very reasonable  They offer   for   drinks at the poolside bar every day  each day is a different special  We ate at the Burger Palace and wasn t too impressed with that  We also had a few meals at the Teahouse which I thought was very good  We didn t try the buffet here because of the bad reviews  The dealertainers were just wonderful  it was quite entertaining even if you weren t playing cards at the time  Regarding the elevators  we were in a section of the hotel that uses the room elevators closest to the front desk  which aren t as busy as the main ones  We never waited more than two minutes for the elevators  So I would recommend this hotel to anyone that is looking for a bargain hotel in Vegas  That is pretty much what it is  nothing fancy  but a clean room with a comfortable bed with adequate space for two people  
P =>   Always a good time I have never had a bad experience at this hotel  They have always been friendly and nice to me  The hotel is a little confusing but once you have been there a time or two you know whats going on  The dealertainers are always a good time  The elevators do take a little bit longer then I would like  But the location is amazing  You coudlnt ask for a better spot  Every room i have stayed in has been clean and people talk about how cheap it is    well you dont pay very much for a room are you thinking you are going to get a   star room  I love the IP they have always treated me very well and give me GREAT comps  
P =>   Great Location even better Price  I have stayed at the Imperial Palace on three occasions and was happy with our rooms  For the amount of time we spend in our rooms it was comfortable and clean We have stayed in the upgraded suites which we throughly enjoyed  Two Tv s couches and clean bathroom  The hotel and casino staff were awesome and extremly helpful  The only negative was the Timeshare vultures near the elevators      too pushy  I recommend this to all first time visitors as you cannot beat the price and location of The Imperial Palace  
P =>   Imperial Palace  Try  Imperial Prison   Seriously  I thought perhaps I had committed some terrible atrocity and was being punished  Okay  not really  but this hotel is awful  I had stayed here previously in       and I honestly remembered the hotel as being no frills but certainly not horrible  Alas  this time  I can safely say that no matter what a  quot good value quot  it might be  I am never staying there again It s y in the desert  for one thing  but you d never know it in the hotel  All the common areas were stuffy and hot  including the corridors  the elevators  and the stairwell  Why were you in the stairwell  you might ask  That would be because the elevators  all sixteen of them  were either slow or out of service  were there any signs indicated this service problem  No    and while taking the stairs down isn t a problem  let s just talk about how much fun dragging four pieces of luggage down eleven flights of stairs is  It s not fun at all     Also  there was puke in the hallways from the night before  which added to the ambiance in a way I could do without  When I emerged from my journey down the stairwell with all my luggage  it was in a back alley outside the hotel  which meant dragging my luggage all the way round and going back inside the hot  stuffy lobby  I was never as happy as I was when the cab took us to Caesar s Palace  we booked IP because it was a cheap room on the strip on a Saturday night  before our much better deal at Caesar s started on Sunday   Additionally  the rooms are boring and beige  I m not sure what is  quot Imperial quot  about this in the slightest  The pillows were ridiculous  too  They were more like a sack of hair than a pillow  Save yourself the trouble and either pay a little more for a better hotel  or book somewhere farther away and stay at the Motel    This place is seriously not worth the money  also  the pool closes at    wtf   unless you think dragging your luggage down the stairwell is a fun time     
P =>   friendly not over the top  have stayed   times and would not go anywhere else  Geisha bar very friendly and hasnt changed   still same staff which says a lot  Betty s coffe shop   scrummy cakes  all floor staff very helpful and pleasant  maybe because we are Scottish  Don t go for expensive casinos   you pay for the glitz and VERY small drinks   
P =>   i would stay here again I have stayed here for bout six year and have stood in other hotels sure no hotel is perfect but location is great rooms great for the stay clean and stocked ya elivators are slow but those are the ones by the shops there are other ones that are lot faster just need to look on the maps gambling is good low limit tables and the bar out side is fun casino at night is fun there is entertainment that make it fun i walk in to other casinos at night and not as fun compared to IP and the price is great for us non high rollers i have stayed at luxor and excaliber and mgm and other but i would rather stay were its right in the middle of the strip and not were half my money is tied up in a   star hotel were here to have fun and get away from everyday life and no one is really in there room but to shower and sleep and that only for a few hour if your here just to sleep and stay in just one hotel you should just stay at home  Ill be back at IP on the july   for sure here i come 
P =>   Only reason to stay is location price We kinda knew what to expect when we booked a room at the IP for one night in y  However  we wanted to stay right off the strip without spending all our money on the hotel  We got our room two hours after the check in time and were downgraded to an older room which had not been renovated for quite some time  At least we were compensated with a voucher that almost covered entry to the great dinner buffet at the IP  Be prepared for hour long check in lines and poor service from tired staff  The location is spot on perfect  though  Stay only if you want good location at low price and don t care much about the hotel standard  
P =>   rotten check out attitude i have stayed a number of times at the Imperial Palace because it is centrally located on the strip  However this last time  i could not believe when i checked out of the hotel  how rude and discourteous the hotel clerk was  I do not know what her problem was but she was so rude that i have decided that with the economy the way it is  i dont have to tolerate such ill mannered and rude behavior from a hotel employee As a result   i will never stay at the Imperial Palace again 
P =>   Excellant value for money and great location  We stayed for    nights in the Imperial Palace   a long time for Vegas but never a dull moment  We got a taxi from the airport cost    dollars it would be difficult to find the hotel otherwise   on the strip the front of the hotel is the Rockhouse Club which is part of the hotel  You drive by the side of this to the hotel lobby  A wait of about    minutes to check in and we were upgraded without asking to the main building  The hotel is a little tired but excellant value and the staff very helpful and cheerful  The place was clean and tidy and gets a little rowdier over the weekends but all good fun  You can get into the Rockhouse nightclub free before midnight if you show a hotel room key and ladies drink free on Thursdays from   pm  The pool are is also good fun   DJ plays on some days but doesnt start until after      am   good idea when having so many late nights   even though we had view of the pool from our room the room seems very well sound proofed  The layout of the hotel is a little confusing but again added to the fun   everyone was in the same position   the lifts can also result in a wait but this was worse on the morning of our checkout   everyone wanting to use them at the same time  The location was incredible   walking distance to everywhere and the monorail is closeby if needed  All in all good value not the plushest hotel in the world but who spends all their time in the hotel room  
P =>   Imperial Palace   No I mean Imperial DUMP   There can be no worse  ugly  dirty  old  disgusting hotel in the US  than the Imperial Palace in Vegas  If there is  I pitty the people staying there  This place is across the street from Caesar s  so it has a great location  but what a DUMP This place needs to be blown up and I mean soon  Bad rooms  bad casino  bad food  it s HORRIBLE  Do not stay here unless you are a bum or hobo   
P =>   I WILL NEVER STAY OR PLAY THERE AGAIN    NICKLED AND DIMED ME    We went to vegas for my girlriend s   st birthday  she wanted to stay at IMPERIAL PALACE  IP  because she stayed there before and thought it was a good affordable place to stay  well she was wrong  it was cheap  here is what I didn t like      room smelled like mildew  I think it was from the a c but it went away after turning on the a c brought in fresh air  so that was okay but not pleasant   the elevators take a very long time to pick anyone up  I would say about the longest we waited was at least      min every time  wasn t that busy of a weekend  sometimes when the elevators came quickly they were packed with people to the point that the overweight buzzer was always coming on   when I would talk to front desk or concierge  they were helpful but not nice or friendly  not a talkative group of people  now here is where I really got upset and annoyed      THE POOL CLOSES AT   PM EVERYDAY  who the hell closes their dinky little pool and spa area so early  when I called and asked about the pool  they said that it was closed at  pm   this was around      and when I asked if there was a reason why   thinking maybe there was some kind of show or party or luau or something   the lady said no  then I asked why and she said because thats how they do things at the IMPERIAL PALACE  very upsetting when someone answers you like that    at just about   am the fire alarm starts sounding off  its very loud and annoying  thats a good thing when theres a freaking fire  but when there isn t a fire and everyone is getting woken up  they need some kind of control over the alarm  so I call the front desk and ask about whats going on and the guy said that its a false alarm and they are investigating  please disregard  so then I asked if its some kind of test or alarm checking and then he very rudely tells me to relax and its not their fault its going off  they didn t do it  I was very upset and very offended so I just called him an    hole and then hung up  so the alarm continues to sound on and off for an hour  between     am  woke up late because of that  so I called the front desk and asked for a late check out til    they said only til    or they would charge me       for an hour         ME OFF  AND I WAS VERY TIRED FROM THE WHOLE ALARM SOUINDING OFF FOR AN HOUR      I thought that when you are playing video poker games at the bar tops the drinks were free  well i guess not at the IP  had to pay for all of them while I was playing and spending money  mind you the drinks are small and weak and exspensive  HATED IT  a  I had bought one of those big plastic cups from the stirp  so I decided that I would fill it up with my own alcohol and needed just a little bit more soda  so I asked the bartender for a just a little bit and he said that he can only give me a cup of soda for     are you kidding me  you can t spare soda without charging me up the       NICKEL AND DIMING     I m not being a cheap guy  I just figure there is a small give when your taking all my money at a high rate  heres the most upsetting and most important fact      when checking out I told the check out clerk about my stay and she said   quot that ll be      please  quot  she didn t apologize  discount or say anything  just acted like she didn t care and wasn t going to do anything about it so needless to say I m very upset and even more disappointed with the IP s costumer service  but I will say that the game floor and shows were good and very fun  I liked that part  from now on I m staying at the FLAMINGO and BILLS  perfect location and reasonable prices and the costumer service is fun  friendly  flexible  negotiable and very talkative people and I m very happy with them  
P =>   great centre strip location  We had purchased a   day Vegas Grand Canyon package that included the IP as accomodation  I was a bit worried that it would be a crap hotel  but it was perfect for our sight seeing  Right bang in the middle of the strip  Venturing out at all times of the day was so easy Check in did have a long queue  they had at least   customer service reps opened  maybe they should look at opening more if they queue is growing  Our room was located on the twelth floor right at the back  this was the part I probably didn t like the most  Getting in and out of the hotel took soooo long  factoring in waiting for the elevator  I guess this is where  budget  travellers are put  Apart from this  the hotel room was clean  serviced daily  a bit small but it s ok for sleeping  beds were comfortable  bathroom was old looking but everything still functioned well  We also ate once at the Teahouse restaurant inside the hotel because we were so hungry and tired  couldn t be bothered venturing out in the sweltering heat   Was quite expensive for   sandwich fries meals     soft drinks  so if you can  go outside to eat for better taste and value Since there is so much choice in Vegas  I probably would not stay here again purely just to experience something else  but it was a great budget hotel room for unbeatable location  
P =>   Great Location great value hotel  We stayed here in e      and had a brilliant time the hotel is perfectly situated in the middle of the strip  the hotel is very clean and there is a great atmoshere here that you don t get as much in the other hotels  Would reccomend to anyone wanting to go to vegas on a budget as the price for the rooms are very cheap  
P =>   Fantastic location great value   but not perfect So here s the thing  I keep coming back to this hotel for two simple reasons  There is no hotel at a better location on the Las Vegas Strip  Imperial Palace is the dead smack center of the Strip  and every single hotel and casino that s famous on the strip is an easy walk  You can be at any of these in    seconds  O Sheas  Bill s  Caesar s  Harrah s  Casino Royale  Flamingo  You can be Venetian in   minutes  It s really just the most prime location in all of Vegas  and for that  I will forgive much  And the price is right  If you re a member of the Harrah s Club  you can get rooms for practically nothing during the week  perfectly serviceable but not very fancy of course Unfortunately  this hotel is really showing its age  Many of the fixtures throughout the hotel and casino are    years old  the elevators are on their last legs  it seems to me   and being such a good value  it is quite busy at check in and check out  Some of the fixtures in the room are really in bad need of replacement   the GFCI outlet in my bathroom was actually melted  and that looked like OLD damage  not new damage   Definitely  the upkeep and maintenance of this hotel is   how shall we say   not a priority for Harrah s The restaurants in my opinion have gone from  quot decent quot  to  quot horrifying quot  in the past two years  The guys in my group  who were certainly not complainers     were mortified  But that s no big deal  there are somewhere around one hundred restaurants within a   minute walk from IP The casino is interesting  Lower limit games     craps  e g   are available       and the poker room is decent  Both the craps and poker areas were well maintained  and staffed by very strong dealers  Unfortunately  there is an extremely loud and schlocky  quot Dealertainers quot  blackjack area  which has  generally  very poor celebrity impersonators    times out of     everyone in the casino asked  quot and who is he supposed to be  quot   dealing cards  and every so often  they pause to do an absurd karaoke impersonation  It was actually horrifyingly declasse   Fortunately  the dealertainers mostly deal blackjack  and there is only the occasional idiocy with the karaoke The wireless internet  which will run you     per day  is actually superior  I got good solid up and down bandwidth of around   Mbps  and the configuration was professional and permitted all sorts of protocols to pass unimpeded  A business traveler looking to connect to a corporate VPN will have absolutely no problem The pool area is well maintained and busy  Again  since the hotel is such a good value  it is generally packed with beer drinking party people and or younger people  and so the pool area has gigantic speakers set up with music blasting   it s kind of like a frat house  You can forget about taking a nap during the day if your room is adjacent to the pool I like this hotel  There is no hotel with a better location in Vegas  this is the very best plot of land  The price is definitely right  It s not going to titillate anyone with more refined sensibilities  however  and it has its weak points in terms of eyesores and service annoyances  after a   hour flight  waiting    minutes to check in made me furious   But  I guess  you re here to gamble and do things  so the unbelievable value that the hotel represents more than offsets my complaints  I do recommend it  
P =>   Value for money Bargain price  I agree with others    waiting for lift is a pain   apart from that cheap cheerful  great location  Bearing in mind that the only time you are in the room is when you are asleep why pay the high prices of some of the other hotels   You can go in any of them anytime you wnat to eat drink or gamble   I would much rather have the extra cash to spend Our room was clean and thats all that I was interested in   i too lopve the dealertainers   Michael Jackson was on one table   even though he had died  Or maybe he hasnt      
P =>  Outdated and Dingy by Great Location Stayed at the Imperial Palace for a reunion this weekend  I will not stay there again  They should tear it down and start over  as it s in a GREAT location on the strip  The Imperial is NOT a   star hotel as advertised various sites online  More like       Star   We stayed in a  renovated  room  I did not feel safe in the hotel  The hotel lobby  casino and rooms are outdated and a bit dingy  Wallpaper on the floors were torn or dirty  Check in took over an hour  and we checked in early  Crabby front desk people  Elevators were broken  and it took    minutes or longer each time to use the elevators  as two of   were broken and probably will not be fixed   They no longer sell the parts needed to fix the old elevators   Phew  Only thing going for the Imperial is it s location was fantastic and it has free parking  
P =>   still as good   we have just got back from a twelve night stay at the i p this is the second time we have stayed at this hotel and i have to say there are no complaints check in was a breeze a bit of a queue but nothing major  we got a free nugrade to a deluxe room without even asking    all i did ask for was a room over looking the pool  this was beacuse if you get a strip view you also get all the noise from the carnival court at harrahs til about   am    so if you like youre sleep dont go for a strip view  we could still see the strip from our room we had a great view of caesers palace  the hotel staff are great the hotel food is good  the casino drinks service is good  the pool is only small but it has a great atmosphere there is a b b q and a d j there are some inflatables dotted round the edge of the pool and the pool bar isnt that badly priced   the only thing that isnt that great are the lifts     they are soooo slow   and the ones to the deluxe rooms are even worse  but overall this hotel is a dated little gem  and when we go back to vegas we will be staying there again its right slap bang in the middle of the strip and its very reasonabley priced its not luxury but you get what you pay for and who goes to vegas to stay in their room all day    
P =>   Good Value for the Deal Myself and   others stayed at the Imperial Palace on Thursday  Friday  and Staurday night in e  We arrived on Thursday night at about        check in took about    minutes  which isn t knock against the hotel  it s Las Vegas  this happens everywhere   and we were upgraded to a nicer room since the bed arrangement we initially requested wasn t available  As other reviewers mentioned  the casino is definitely older  but stil clean  and the waitresses still bring drinks  The location on the strip is great  and we weren t upset at all with the price we paid for the room because we did get a great deal and we aren t the type to hang out in the room on vacation anyway  Minor annoyances  there is no coffee pot in the room  I am not human until I ve had coffee  so this annoys me  I called room service once and ordered a pot       which i ended up canceling since they told me it would be over    minutes  I walked down to the  quot burger shack quot  in the casino  where coffee was  again  ridiculously expensive and not good  That was the same burger shack where   of us had to pay over     for some late night burgers that weren t any good  again  this is Las Vegas   Finally  we found out that there is a Burger King in the casino   or   casinos down I think it s the casino with the Irish name  I just can t remember the name of it right now   They didn t have raised prices  and there was never really a wait  either in the a m  for coffee or at night for snacks  Just a helpful hint for those looking for ways to cut unnecessary expenses  So  overall  IP was just fine for what we paid  but goodness  give your guests a little coffeepot  That s not too much to ask for  
P =>   Average hotel with excellent location   I stayed in IP on    th to   th with my girl friend  Personally I think this hotel locates at the best intersection on the strip  There are many affordable dining options nearby and a beautiful forum shops across the street I stayed in the deluxe room with a small balcony  The balcony is nice with the view of the swimming pool  however the room is no better than average  but who will stay in a hotel room for a day in Vegas lol Overall I would recommand this hotel due to its excellent location and affordable rates  
P =>   We lucked out   but it s not the best for everyone  Here s the deal  many people have complanied about the long check in times and the extreme elevators and long walks to their rooms  Basically they are right  BUT  and I mean BUT  there are reasons why this happens so often After reading these reviews  I decided to see what would make my stay better  I got   free nights comp  So  I hoped for the best  I didn t even request a quite room  I just let them pick it  Here s how I got a the best stay I check in before the  pm time frame  Many people would have gotten there around  pm thinking that s early  I made sure my flight landed around        I got the casino around       No line  no wait  Checking in only took me   mins or so  and we got the nicest Luv Tub room  Very spacious  As for the walk  yes  it is a walk  but     since we checked in early  we only had to take one elevator to our room  As for the elevators  they are extrememly slow  but what s the hurry  your in vegas  Here is why they are slow    The current elevators are running on a old motherboard and software  It would require extensive upgrading to make them run smarter and faster  Harrah s corp  seems to want to put their money elsewhere at this time  The room was perfect  It was located on the   th floor away from the pool area and concert near Harrahs  We were shocked when walking up to it  it had a Double Door entrance  The only one on that floor  It was a huge room and everything inside for the most part was clean  and no funny odor  The hot water didn t seem to get hot  but it did improve over the course of the   days  Overall  I don t think I would stay here again  since other casinos are now offering me free weeks  but if you re on a budget and don t mind the classic old casino  this is your place  I would however book the luv tub room or higher     The classic capri and deluxe are not worth the money  If you really want to treat yourself  get the penthouse suite which I believe is on the   th or   th floor  It s HUGE  
P =>   Disappointed We ve stayed at the Imp Palace four times in the past but this time was a disaster A great location but the hotel is now a dump  The place needs blowing up  Service was rubbish  on two days we didn t get the room cleaned and when we asked why was told that the staff finish at       The casino with the mime artists is a joke  and the surly barmen serving the drinks have each had a personality byepass  Bed linen is old and frayed and the rooms stink  The Emporers buffet used to be good but not any more Much better food all round at the Mirage  Sadly we won t be going there again  
P =>   Worth the Stay   We stayed for five nights and had the best time of our lives  This hotel needs some renovation  but the staff  casino and surroundings were not bad at all  You cannot beat the location in the heart of Las Vegas Boulevard  Best place for the money     
P =>  Dated but clean and good slot machines   you get what you pay for When we arrived we were allocated a room on  th floor overlooking the swimming pool  When we got tot the room the noise was loud approx  pm and we were advised that this could contiune until  pm on show nights  With this in mind we moved to a mini suite on the   th floor with a balcony and views over the rear of the hotel and the mountains  Room a bit dated and cost     per night extra but well worth evrey penny  Massive round bath in bedroom as well as bath and really powerfull shower in bathroom Room was cleaned very well every day and we heard no noise at all  All the Americans were complaining about waiting for the lifts but the most we waited was   minutes throughout the whole stay  usually no more than a minute or two Access to car park from strip can be difficult when busy but we found we could both exit and enter around the rear of the hotel Staff were very friendly and we won quite a bit on the slot machines Next time will stay at Monte Carlo but this was a late booking and although hotel is dated we thoroughly enjoyed our holiday  
P =>  IDEAL LOCATION Stayed in this hotel for seven nights never found anything to complain about the whole time Reception is busy all day just like every other hotel in vegas so you just have to be patient roughly about   mins wait time to check in we found the staff cheerful and helpful at all times  We were put on the  th floor not much of a view but very quite if thats what you want its worth asking for this floor We had a maid in eve ry day no complaints at all well worth her     tip  The hotel may not be one of the new ones but for the right price who can complain The location is right bang in the middle of the strip where the other big and well know hotels are a short walk away  
P =>  cheap and cheerful great location just opposite the ceasar palace  in the middle of the strip the room are clean and the staff friendly the casino a bit old but you only need a bed to sleep ask for a room at the back of the hotel as the one at the front could be really noisy  
P =>  I have stayed here   Times   Don t listen to the reviews If your coming to Vegas to stay in luxury then stay at the Wynn  This hotel is one of my fav s as I m a canadian who has been to Vegas    times   Yes the hotel is dated   but if you want to stay where ALL the action is then stay here  it s central to everything you need  It s located in the middle of the strip and you can via footwalk to anywhere you like  If your an all night gamer this is the safest relaxed place to be at  am  Highly reccomended  lt   
P =>  Centre Strip good location  A really good hotel  clean with friendly staff  Only draw back is the queue for the lifts  Other than that  large rooms  most with   double beds  Food is good in the Embers Restaurant  Buffet breakfast and buffet dinner in the main restaurant is good value for money  Casino is fair size  A bit darker than some  but plenty to choose from  Good pool and outside bar  And  walking distance to Carnaval Court with live music most of the day  and night   If you like to keep fit  a small gym with a beauty room is also available  Biggest sports book on the strip alsoHave stayed there   times and plan on staying there again at least twice in       
P =>  Perfect Hotel if all you need is a base while enjoying Vegas    I have just returned from a   night stay in the IP  and have no problem with the hotel at all  Let s face it  you are not going to Vegas for the hotel facilities  you are going for the casinos  nightlife etc The hotel is dead in the middle of the strip  i had no problems checking in  ok  you could wait a few minutes for an elevator  but so what     the hotel is huge The casino is big  some cheap table limits  which is a nice start to your gambling antics  and the staff were friendly and helpful at all times I personally think  that if you look after them  they will look after you  i left a     tip first day to the maid  room was spotless every day afterwards  maybe most of the Americans i bumped into need to learn a few basic manners  The only thing i would say  is that if i was going back with the wife  i would probably spend the few extra quid to stay in the luxury at Ceasers  but hey  that s a different kind of holiday       
P =>  Excellent value for money cheap as chips  You cannot get a better location for a hotel on the strip  I would recommend this hotel for anyone who isn t posh or stuck up as it s very down to earth but the emphasis is on fun not luxory  The room we stayed in was spacious and comfortable and cost buttons  When we checked in they gave us a room with a pool view as we were  st timers and a book of vouchers which was a very nice touch  I think all the rooms come with a balcony which is rare for vegas and a big plus point The pool was nothing fancy but nice and you can go to any hotel pool in the Harrah s chain    in total  Flamingo  Harrah s Paris  Ballys  Caesar s Palace and Rio  We took the free shuttle bus to Rio from Harrah s and spent a day at their very lush pool The casino has a great atmosphere and there is a real buzz as you walk through  The dealertainers are great fun and I would recomend playing at their tables on the way back from a night out when your well into the Vegas Spirit  
P =>  VALUE Stayed here before  cheap clean perfect mid strip location  More money for fun elsewhere  
P =>   location location location best value  clean   and in the middle of the strip previously stayed at ti across the street that was more modern and nicer but more than twice the price  going back in november and have already booked ip  less than two hundred dollars for five nights  
P =>   Another Great Stay  We stayed   nights in a luv tub room and loved it  I had requested a smoking room when I made the reservation but when we arrived to check in on Sunday night I was told there weren t any available for that night but we could change our room the next day which is what we did  Our first room was on the  th floor and had no view at all except of the parking garage  our second room was on the   th floor and had a great view of the pool  We have stayed here many times and will definately be returning  
P =>  Basic and Noisy Old fashioned hotel locaterd in the middle of the strip  rooms that face the swimming pool are very noisy due to disco bar until about  am  Rooms are very basic  queues for the lifts are common  No tea coffee faclities  Good clean linen and towels  good maid service  pleasant staff  Lifts are a good walk through the casino from the front desk  
P =>   PLEASE READ MY REVIEW I JUST GOT BACK     I just got back from Vegas and stayed   nights of my   week stay at the IP  Before I left  I read the reviews and was horrified  All of those reviews were so wrong  The only thing that was difficult was the elevators because the place is HUGE  Otherwise I have to tell you that all the staff in the whole place is awesome  and cannot do enough for you  I want to make special mention to TIM the bell man  who gave us extra treatment with lots of help  navigating the hotel  Room service that we got all   mornings was elegant  hot and delicious   I kept trying to figure out what everyone was trying to say but there really was no negative  The room was clean  very clean  and there were plenty of towels and when we needed extra blankets and in no time at all housekeeping came with a smile  The place is great and it hurts me when people so casually say negative things about a place like this  Think about who the IP is owned by    This is a beautiful well run place and all I can say is go and see for your self   VERY CLEAN    
P =>   Rennovate it      This hotel is in serious need of a rennovation or tear down  Our  quot deluxe quot  room had stains on the carpet  cigarette burns on the bedding  carpet and counter tops  and the box spring on the bed looked like it was picked up off the street  The bath tub and sink areas were chipped and stained  There was hair on the bathroom floor from previous travelers  I was glad I brought my can of Lysol    The balconys are standing room only  The elevators are extremely slow and the experience to get from the front lobby to the parking area and then to our room was really frustrating  On the flip side  the casino  gift shop areas and corridors were nice and appeared to be clean  
P =>   Good value for money You get what you pay for  there can be queues for elevators at times  room service not alaways in order  overall its a cheap feeling to it compare to other big hotels  BUT  here s the best part  for     a night  you get the best spot on the strip  its bang right in the middle  Everything within walking distance  We asked for a top floor room with strip view  we got the room right at the top with balcony and amazing views of strip and mountains  You can see the sunset over the mountains and lights at night just gorgeous  You can also see bellagio fountains in far corner from balcony  BUT again  staying in these rooms comes with a noisy price  just below this tower  theres Harras out door party tent which plays loud music from afternoon till  am in morning  During night time it is very noisy and total nuisanse  we thought of changing it after first night  BUT here s the trick again  if you leave the AC fan on  it does reduce the noise considerably  And so we stayed whole    nights in this way  But there are other towers you can choose to stay if you are not fussy about the views  Its perfact for budget travellers for its location  you cant beat it  but if you have few extra dosh then go elsewhere like caesars palace right opposite  
P =>   You get what you pay for Ok we just got back last week and had a good time in Vegas  The room was comped so why should I complain  The room looked very grimey but I can say the cleaning people came everyday to change towels  The furnishing  amp  decor is very outdated  THE FOOD  UGG  The buffet was very bland  My husband threw his breafast away  BLAND  I understand they can t over season but GOD  I hated that the pool closes       pm  we never got a chance to take a dip  The hotel staff is very pleasant  I want book here again  
P =>   For a few bucks more   stay somewhere else  We drove from California to Las Vegas and decided to stay at the IP  When we drove up to have Valet park our car   they yelled at us to move the vehicle and we hadn t gotten our luggage out of the car yet  They finally had us park down around the corner  by the entry to the parking lot  and told us they would take care of our car     minutes later   it was still sitting there  Don t stay above the fifth floor   you ll wait forever for an elevator  and at least you can walk from the fifth floor   We were on the   th floor   it was SO noisy  and you ALWAYS wait at least    minutes for an elevator  All we wanted to do was to go work out   found out there is a     charge person day to use the gym   and it wasn t that nice   Complained to the manager and left three messages for him to contact us   we never got a call  Guess they don t believe in good customer service at the IP  You have to walk through a wall of smoke to get to the elevators   the place stinks cigarettes and cigars  The only kudos I will give this place is the Housekeeping Department   whenever we called them for something they were always pleasant and johnny on the spot  The front desk definitely needs a few lessons on smiling and giving great customer service  My next trip  I will pay the additional     to stay at a nicer and cleaner place  This may be centrally located  but with the monorail   almost all the hotels are close to it  Do yourself a favor and stay elsewhere  
P =>   Fabulous location   best value hotel on the strip Having stayed at the Imperial Palace in       when my sister  some friends and I went back to Vegas in tember       I knew what to expect from this hotel and it easily met my expectations  This is the only place where you will get true value for money and personally I d rather save the extra     for shopping and gambling We booked via Expedia for    nights in Deluxe rooms   obviously a Deluxe room at the Imperial is probably on the same level as a Standard room in other strip hotels but let s face it  you don t go to Vegas to sit in your room and admire the wallpaper  Well  we didn t anyway Upon arrival  there was a fairly long queue at check in but this is to be expected anywhere in Vegas  especially as we arrived at the hotel not long after the official check in time of  pm  The queue moved pretty quickly and we were seen by a very pleasant woman who advised us that there were no Non Smoking rooms available but there would be some the next day  Therefore we stayed in Smoking rooms for one night which wasn t a problem as they were clean and didn t smell or anything  The next day we just had to call down to reception and they gave us Non Smoking rooms with no problems When we stayed in this hotel in       we were in Standard rooms and in my opinion the Deluxe rooms aren t much different except for the decor being a bit nicer  All their rooms seem to be spacious and clean and I love the fact that they have balconies  I don t think there are many hotels on the strip that offer private balconies  We had a view of the pool and our friends were on the opposite side of the corridor and had a view of the mountains and horizon  both views were great  The rooms had air conditioning units which worked fine and standard CRT TV s which had a decent number of channels  The bathrooms were nice and clean with a bath shower combo and a nice sized sink vanity area  Lots of towels and flannels which were changed regularly We loved our housekeeping lady  Linda  she was so funny  We had a good laugh with her when we saw her and she was so friendly  We always left her a few dollars each morning which I first read about doing on here and is definately worthwhile The casino area of the hotel is by far one of the most fun and relaxed environments out of all the strip hotels  Yeah it s a bit smoky but thats one of the things you have to accept if you re going to be hanging around Vegas casinos  We only ate in the hotel once as there were so many other places we wanted to go to   we stopped in the Teahouse place late one night after we d been out and I had a delicious BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger and fries   great value for money and just what I needed after a few beers We also stopped off in Betty s Diner quite a few times to grab coffee and snacks and I really recommend you try this place if you get a chance  The coffee isn t great  there s a Starbucks next door in Harrahs  but all the snacks are freshly made and delicious  The peanut butter cookies  chocolate croissants and pastries in particular  Mmmmm Overall  I highly recommend this hotel if you are just looking for a place to sleep and shower  etc   you can t get a better location for this price  If you have higher expectations of a hotel room though  you could be disappointed if you stayed here Personally  I ve already booked to go back to Vegas and guess what  I ll be staying at the Imperial Palace again  I love it there  
P =>   Great place to stay We arrived and was told there were no more double bed non smoking  We were then upgraded to a suite at no extra charge  The rooms were clean and comfortable  The room service was excellent  This is a gem it is located in the middle of the strip  I will use this hotel and casino again  
P =>   There is absolutely nothing wrong with this place  After reading some bad reviews here  I was apprehensive about staying at the IP  but I got such an incredible rate I just couldn t justify staying anywhere else  This was my first trip to Vegas and I was pleasantly suprised when our airport shuttle dropped us off at the hotel Check in was very fast   only had to wait a few minutes in line  The front desk staff were exceptional   friendly  knowledgeable and helpful  The concierge    different gentlemen  on   different days  were equally helpful  Checkout was even faster I don t understand the reviews with comments about the hotel being difficult to find your way around in  We stayed in a deluxe room on the   th floor  and the front desk clerk gave us a small map of the lobby which showed us exactly how to find the elevators to our room  Yes  it was a long walk  but all of the hotels parade you through their casinos en route to your room so the IP is no exception  And the elevators were very fast and all operable during our stay  I can honestly say we never waited more than a minute for an elevator We ordered room service one night  and received our food in about    minutes  The gentleman who delivered our food was extremely courteous and professional  Housekeeping staff was also outstanding during our stay   I m a firm believer in leaving a tip every day and it s amazing what a smile and a dollar can do   Our room was comfortable  the beds and pillows were great  the a c worked fine as did everything else in our room  The room was very clean and well maintained  The balcony was small but served its purpose  Our room facing the pool was nice and quiet in the evenings  During the day the music from the pool was pretty loud  but we weren t there to sit in our room The pool area is pretty plain compared with other hotels in the area  but it had a fun atmosphere and no shortage of sun  The poolside bar and food concession was convenient and they had a great drink special the day we were at the pool  Tuesday      Bud in a bucket of ice for       all day  It s hard to argue with a deal like that  They have a luau at the pool on select days of the week  which we did not bother with  although it did seem like a good enough deal  For     per person you got the meal  entertainment and unlimited drinks   On the days that the pool is closed to the public because of the luau you are encouraged to use the pool at the neighbouring Flamingo or Harrah s   all owned by the same group  So we checked out the pool at the Flamingo one day as well  To be honest  the IP reminds me of a typical Holiday Inn or Howard Johnson s Hotel  with a casino in the lobby  lol   There is nothing wrong with this place  If you are coming here and expecting the luxuries of The Venetian or The Wynn     you really don t have realistic expectations  This is a basic comfortable hotel and it serves its purpose well  I would not hesitate to stay here again  and the location in the middle of the Strip and the wonderful staff we encountered at every turn are the IP s best assets  IMO  
P =>  Great price great location  We stayed a the Imperial Palace for   nights earlier this year as part of a round the world trip  After travelling for over   months  price was the most important thing to us and I think we stumbled upon a little gem  We stayed in the cheapest rooms which are located outside and to the back of the hotel  they are still joined on though  The location is PERFECT for seeing Vegas  it s right in the centre of the strip and within walking distance of all the other large hotels  casinos  shops  restaurants etc  We ate at the all you can eat in the hotel once and had no complaints  it wasn t as good as some of the others we tried but was also better than others  The rooms were basic but great  large  TV  en suite with shower and bath  Our room was spotless and cleaned daily  We had no complaints at all I would definitely recommend this hotel to a friend who was visiting Vegas  
P =>  Excellent Location for the price This hotel is tucked away in the middle of The Strip where all the action is  It is right opposite Caesar s Palace and Mirage I had booked a room for the   of us through a Vegas tourism site  and even though we went during the slack season  i believe it was a steal to pay the kind of price i did  and stayed in such a location Since its bang in the centre of the strip and walking distance from the biggest and best hotels It is also connected with a kind of tram system with a stop within the hotel The rooms and bathrooms are clean and alright enough to spend jst a few hours to catch up on the sleep before you head out for partying gambling sightseeing It also hosts a music extravaganza in the evenings with the singers duplicates  like bette midler  elvis etc belting out numbers in the hotel theatre before doing some songs on the casino floor The dinner buffet was ok  and the swimming pool alright Must stay here if you plan a budget trip and would rather spend on shows and eating and partying than on the room itself Look out for good deals on the net before making a definate booking  
P =>  The IP is Centrally Located and Established This hotel needed to be imploded when the others were  but that time has passed and this place is older and showing it s age  The location cannot be beat  sandwiched between The Flamingo and Harrah s you will not be bored  The check in was flawless and the desk staff were courteous  Finding the room on the other hand was horrendous  it took us about    minutes because of the eclectic design of this building  the elevators were slow and many were out of service and with this hotel being so busy  it was to be expected There was no Starbucks or Seattle s Best but Betty s diner sufficed for the am coffee fix There is no midnight cafe for pancakes and eggs but there is a hamburger joint  we didn t eat there  The room was relatively clean although dusty under the bed and the bathroom was clean but old wallpaper peeling  The cleaning ladies are the best and they do a very good job  Hey People a couple of bucks for a daily tip does wonders sometimes I did order room service and it did come promptly and courteously  It was expensive but it s a vacation The entrance into the hotel by car is a nightmare  dodging the people crossing your path is an art form  if you wait  they will never let get by for entry  A word of advice is to valet   to self park is to self punish  you will see The gaming staff were OK  but that s hard to grade when all one is doing is playing machines  The cocktail waitresses were ok as well and yes we tipped them well The dealer tainers were entertaining and fun to watch No  I will not be staying there again 
P =>  HONEST opinion of Imperial Palace Firstly  I was very apprehensive after booking this Hotel because of all the bad reviews it has been given  Now that my husband and I have stayed there  I am giving a totally honest opinion from our   night stay Checking In   Checking Out   There was a bit of a queue  which took approx    mins to get through  but hey  this is Vegas  and the influx of people coming and going is phenomenal  We found both checking in and out no problem and were given a choice of a king size bed or two queen beds in the Deluxe Rooms  Room   We chose the   bedded room on a smoking floor  Our room was on   th floor   top of the hotel         The beds were actually two double beds  and the room was fine  The beds were very comfortable  and I am fussy with my bed   Bathroom was fine with bath and shower  Shower was spot on  Small balcony in the room which was ideal for me smoking as my husband is a non smoker  By the way  being on a smoking floor did not really affect him and he actually said  it wasnt bad at all i e smell etc  The only problem I found all week  is that the cleaners are not that great  My ashtray remained on the balcony and was never emptied  nor was the balcony swept at all  The room was fine overall and you get what you pay for after all  so all these people moaning and complaining  I would say  spend more and stay at The Mirage  Bellagio or MGM  We actually did spend my birthday night in a penthouse suite at The Mirage  suprise from my husband  and it was absolutely fantastic   like staying in a Palace  but the price matches what you get  Casino   My husband said he preferred Imperial Palace Casino as he said it was lively compared to the other casino s which he found a bit boring with not much atmosphere  IP Casino  with Dealertainers did liven things up  and we did have a few laughs with people around the bar area s  All other Casino s we went in  everyone seemed to keep themselves to themselves and seemed to frightened to  quot mix quot  Food   We only ate breakfast once at the hotel  so cannot comment  other than the breakfast was  quot a breakfast quot  and was fine  Some good places to eat would be Magaritaville  to left of hotel    LOVELY  My favourite was Tony Roma s which is in Binnions Casino in Fremont Street  Absolutely fantastic and reasonable  Ribs and Steaks to kill for  and have half an Onion Loaf with your main course MMMmmmm   We also found the Buffet at Harrah s very good and ate there a few times  Loads to choose from and all very good  We came out of there absolutely stuffed  So many good choices of dishes  we just had to try them all       Drinks in Binnions Casino are also very cheap   we had Vodka and coke and JD and coke for        Couldnt belive it   You can also have you photo taken for free  and put in a nice folder  with             Great souvenier TIPS   I would advise casual clothes and very  very comfy shoes as you will be doing a lot of walking  Best way to get around  we found  is the deuce bus  which runs    hours from one end of strip to the other     hr pass is     Well worth it  Just pay as you get on the double decker bus  They run about every       mins Swimming Pool AreaSituated on  nd Floor and we thought one of the best pools we had ever been too for atmosphere and fun  The pool is small and not a patch on the pools in most of the other hotels   but what fun we had  DJ around the pool playing great music from    s     s and    s and many a time people would be up singing and dancing   great fun  Burgers around the pool very good too Elevators   SLOW      We were there   nights and never  and I am saying NEVER had to wait longer than   mins for an elevator  Lucky  Who knows  but no problem experienced from us at all Anyway  enjoy your stay in Vegas   we did  
P =>  Location michigan The location on the strip is perfect  Walking distance to many attrations and casinos Yes the elevators were slow but they were working  Granted this is not a high end hotel but for the price I can not see a better value on the strip  Rooms were clean  service was good and the casino had a good variety of machine to play  Take your waling shoes and enjoy  
P =>   would still stay again if price right Have stayed at a number of hotels in vegas over my years of visiting  and a number of times at this hotel  Chosen because very cheap price and central in strip so easy to get to all attractions Rooms are very clean with   big comfortable beds TV and table and chairs The parking however is a long walk and the elevators took a long time to come  we were on   floor  The pool area was very noisy  
P =>   Grimy Rooms in perfect location Cons  We came for the World Series of Poker tournament and this hotel was one advertising special rates for players  The front desk staff  although courteous  were not aware of the special discount and we spent around    minutes  on top of waiting in line for    minutes  to get it all sorted out and into our rooms  We had booked a non smoking  quot deluxe quot  room with a King bed  While we were aware that this was a budget hotel  if what we got was  quot deluxe quot  then i wonder what passes for  quot standard quot   The carpet was mildewy  stained and the entire room reeked of old cigarettes and body odour  Neither the tub nor the sink drained properly at all   the most disgusting aspect of our stay  The bed was actually   bouncy twins wrapped held together by a thin king fitted sheet  Bedding was of course the cheapest  scratchiest type  The elevators were often out of service  No mini fridge in the room  We had a very old tube TV in the room Room service was incredibly expensive   with breakfast sides starting at    and going up to     for eggs Pros Wifi was available and working at a cost  AC worked fine TV actually had   working channels  Dry cleaners offered alteration services Very convenient access to monorail and free shuttle service on the strip Thank god it s situated within walking distance to the Venetian The lobby floor is noisy  smoky and cramped  The overall feel of the resort is outdated  faded  crowded and disconcerting  Would NEVER stay here again  
P =>   Aweful Place to stay  The Imperial Palace is definately a hotel I would not stay again The carpet in the rooms were stained with whatever Bathtub was dirty  Very old and out dated TV  Smoke alarms were rusty  and the general appearance of this hotel is terrible  Elevators are old  dirty and chipped railing Pool lounge chairs are old  mildewed  and disgusting to lay down on  Water in the pool was not heated and there was very little security as to who can use the pool I would not eat at this hotel after seeing the decline in appearance and unsanitary conditions  It s a dump  
P =>   Perfect Location  I cannot fault this hotel  it may not look as amazing as the Bellagio or the Venetian  but it is centre of the Strip and very easy to get to all the main attractions We stayed for   nights for my partner s   th  and we had a choice between saving           each staying at the Imperial  or staying in a better hotel like MGM or Venetian  So we decided that we wouldn t be in our hotel that much anyway and should just spend that money on shopping and roulette instead  The rooms were spacious and clean  even had a mini balcony for some fresh air  and the pool area had loads of sunbeds Would definitely visit again as such great value for money  I also recommend the bar in front of Imperial called Rockhouse for daytime beer pong and frozen margaritas  
P =>   Very dirty and not very helpful staff We stayed at the Capri rooms after asking several personnel  who just said down the hall  we found the room after about    minutes  Very sad the directions to get to the room and walked a long way to get to the casino or anywhere within the main section of the hotel  The rooms are very run down and felt dirty and not very clean  One of the worse hotels I have stayed at  If you are into the retro decor looks like it s been neglected a long time you can get beyond the stained carpet and dirty bathrooms  Drains didn t work well  I talked with others in the capri rooms who felt the same way  The price is not worth the value  
P =>   Cheap and Good If you want a clean hotel room on the cheap  we paid     a night   located right smack in the middle of the strip  with casino  food and shopping all in one place  this is it  They even have a free shuttle from to the airport  Expect no luxury  this is strictly a functional stay  You get a clean bed  trust me  I even took apart the bed looking for bedbugs  found none but did find a new matress and clean linens   If you want more luxury  go to the Montecarlo accross the street  Check in was fast  we arrived early so the bell boys securely stored our bags away until check in time  The Dealertainers will remind you were you are on a nightly basis  The casino is adequate  but kinda crammed  Great and cheap base of operations for your sojourn to Vegas  Tip  for a    tip on your pillow  you get great room service  
P =>   Loved this hotel First of all after reading the reviews I was skeptical  However  they were all wrong     Check in line was long  However it was Memorial day weekend Fri nite  they had all   stations going  The lined moved very fast  I got to choose my floor  and loud or quiet  When I got to my room I was very very happy  I booked the deluxe tub room  It was clean  and very very quiet  The hotel is very big  as all hotels on the strip are   Our room was clean and we never had any issues  Every room has a balcony that overlooks the hotel pool and a great view of Ceasars I would truly stay here again  If you are looking for cheap accomodation then you will get a room outside by the parking lot  which is NOT inside the main hote  However  if you can  get a regular room and you will be happy  The elevators move kind of slow  but again  if lots of people are staying there  its to be expected  The pool was fabulous  They had a live dj that Sat  the beer specials are awesome  Overall  I would definetly stay there again  We had no issues  
P =>   great value great value for the price  the elevators a little slow but they were doing the best they could do to fix it  would stay agian 
P =>   Better then Expected  After reading all of the negative reviews  I had very low expectations for this hotel and wasn t really looking forward to staying there  I was however pleasantly surprised by how much I liked this hotel  Our room was spacious  clean  quiet and comfortable  We loved the patio overlooking the pool area  We really enjoyed the entertainment in the casino with the dealers that impersonate stars like Alice Cooper  Michael Jackson  and Stevie Wonder   it was really fun to watch and created a lively atmosphere in the casino area  The location of the hotel is perfect and we were within walking distance of all the best hotels and hot spots  We loved the pool area which was great for lying out with a drink  Overall we had a great time and all of the staff members we came in contact with were helpful and friendly  I would definitely stay here again  Especially because it s a great deal  The only one negative comment I have is that the buffet was horrible  Even with it being so cheap I would never eat there again unless I was really desperate  Most of the food tasted funny and was cold  
P =>   Enjoyed my second stay here Stayed here before in      so knew what to expect and it had not changed much  Still offers very good rates for a great location  centre of strip really so near Venetian  Paris  Bellagio   This is not the best hotel on the strip by any means but room was fine and had no issues  Service adequate and lines were not too bad for checkin or for the elevators  The buffet breakfast was not bad but worth going to the Bellagio which costs maybe    more but was much better  Would stay here again  The casino is one of the more smoky ones on the strip so non smokers may like this less  
P =>   Excellent Location  We stayed here for   nights over Easter break  It s an ideal time for visiting Las Vegas as the heat wasn t too oppressive  unlike ust   The IP has a fabulous central strip location  It s a little bit tired  but for the money  I m not sure it can be beaten  The room was big and light and airy with a comfortable bed and a small balcony with lovely views of the mountains at the back of the strip  When we checked in  we were given a choice of rooms and I would recommend one at the back with this view   much quieter The bathroom was a bit dark  but the shower had incredible water pressure   it gave a massage at the same time  An excellent start to the day The hotel itself was like a rabbit warren   get the wrong lift and you walk around for a while  Quite a few eating choices  reasonably priced   although in Las Vegas  you can go anywhere A great base  but could do with a facelift perhaps  For what we paid though  it was great value  
P =>   Location location location That s the best thing about the place  It seriously needs an upgrade overhaul When we reserved  we were told that the beds were Queens  but they were only full sized The rooms haven t been upgraded since my last trip there    years ago  The bedspreads were very worn With that said  the location is awesome  Also  please get some new entertainment   we saw the Luau  the car museum  and Legends in      already  
P =>   Centre Strip great location you don t spend much time in your room in Vegas anyway Stayed here for   nights and had a high floor strip view room  Great view of the strip however it is loud  and the music is still continuing at   in the morning  It can be so loud you can t hear your tv properly  If you come to vegas though  you don t come to spend time in your room so it was great for us Great Drink prices in the bar downstairs  We had a smoking room and I m not a smoker but the smell was bearable  There were occassions where we would come up to our room and all you could smell was marajuana  Obviously the security in the building don t care what goes on in the rooms  Don t expect a  star hotel the pool is nice but always packed so we used the hotel harrahs next door   This is fine as they are both owned under the same company   Would be great to have a fridge in your room though Would I stay here again   be  but probably just pay a little bit extra and stay at Harrah s or Flamingos which is right next to it This is one of the cheapest hotels on the strip  so if your looking for a bed to sleep on and nothing more imperial palace is great  
P =>   Great bargain Vegas hotel  poker players This hotel isn t plush  and it isn t trendy  but it is clean  small  and perfect for those who aren t in their room much  Poker players love it here  Rooms are clean  but basic  and a bit old fashioned  It is also a lot cheaper than some others  so if you are spending a lot on upgraded flights  and want to make a saving elsewhere  here is great  I liked the fact it was not snobby  it was chilled out  and a bit tacky  The Dealatainers  and fun Great central strip location  and super cheap rates  
P =>   No luxury but clean and in a great location This is a hotel that offers the basics  Clean sheets  clean towels  hot water  cable TV  If you re looking for Vegas luxury  look elsewhere  If you need a bargain hotel in a good location  stay at the Imperial Palace  
P =>   Do not stay here  We spent   nights here and what a dump  During our stay we only got maid service once  the elevators were scary and the room was a nightmare  We gambled approx        here only received       in comps          it was pathetic  The only good thing about this hotel is the location  but I would rather stay at the MGM or Bally s as they are on the monorail route and easy to get anywhere from these two locations  The Buffet here was horrible and we will never stay at the Imperial Palace again  
P =>   Will never stay again My reservations got lost even though I called to confirm and my credit card had already been charged  Everyone I talked to about it was rude and it never got resolved  The place is a dump  The  quot deluxe quot  room looks like it would be at a motel    The housekeeper came once and didn t even really clean up  The pool is also a piece of crap and the waitress walking around the pool had horrible service  I will never stay there again or recommend it to anyone  
P =>   So Much Fun Let me say I love staying at the IP  It s not the most luxrious place in town  but they make me feel welcome everytime my girlfriend and I stay there  I could stay at other hotels that are also owned by Harrah s Resorts  and most always for free  but the thing is I like the IP  This time around we stayed in the Deluxe King Suite which was comped the whole time we were there  The room has been remodeled and was very nice and comfortable and very large  It also had a wet bar  I recommend the   th floor  We had a really nice view overlooking the pool and a great view of the mountains  We just love the room  Oh and it also had a very large love tub with mirrored walls all the way around  The bed also had a mirror above on the ceiling  Once you leave the room be sure to explore the hotel to see all that it has  If you like Karaoke then you are in luck  They have karaoke every night  The IP also has several pretty darn good places to eat some good food when you are hungry  The IP also has somewhat of a convienence store that is open    hours  Now be sure to go next door to Harrah s also for some great dueling pianos before you leave town  I could go on and on but beleive me you can t beat the Imperial Palace for location and price  Cheapest place to stay on the strip  If you have any questions please don t hesitate to ask  Thanks and have a great time if you choose the Imperial Palace  
P =>   Great Deal For Strip Location Stayed at the IP      th   Great Deal for   Nights       USD for the Deluxe Room  Basic rooms with two queen beds  Clean rooms  large bathroom  Hotel had room included balcony that overlooked the Hahara s Pool All in all Great deal for location  
P =>   Not bad at all  Wow   after reading some reviews about this hotel I was really impressed by what we found when we arrived  Some people wrote bad reviews but this is definately not one of them  Overall the hotel is a very nice place to stay for the money  For its age  the place is in very good condition and the rooms are spacious and comfortable  The casino floor is always rocking and the slots are fair  The view of the strip from the   th floor at night was stunning  Our room overlooked the carnival tent and listening to the bands play were a great way to wind down late at night  Sure  a lot of people would like to have a nice quiet place to sleep  but this is Las Vegas  Unfortunately we did not get to eat at all the dining spots  but the Burger Palace does a great burger and the beer is always ice cold  The only bad thing about our trip was a minor problem with some elevators  Other than that  I would definately recommend Imperial Palace as a good hotel to stay in  Dennis Lewis 
P =>   Best value for location and FUN  Imperial Palace used to show its age much more  but having stayed there a dozen plus times I can tell you the remodeled rooms are quite nice  Keep in mind  if you re booking Imperial you re doing so because it s a budget property  but based on that criteria  you ll be hard pressed to find a nicer budget hotel anywhere  I ve tried Stratosphere  Downtown  flamingo  Excalibur and other low rent properties  and nothing tops Imperial Palace  There s something about having your blackjack cards dealt to you by Alice Cooper  Madonna  Prince or Cher that puts a smile on your face  If you go in expecting a big casino operation  you ll be disappointed  But nighly Karaoke  fun atmosphere  a fair selection of restaurant choices  and a truly fun rock  n roll casino make this feel more like a Carnival cruise than a Vegas setting  Right across the street from Caesar s Palace in the heart of The Strip  it s right where you want to be  at a price     below the big boys  Count me in  Baby  
P =>   Don t let the poor reviews keep you from saving a ton of money by staying here We just returned from a   day    night stay at the Imperial Palace  Based on recent reviews  I was very worried about what the casino and rooms would be like and considered booking elsewhere  I m very glad I saved my money and stuck with the IP  Was this the best place I ve ever stayed  no  it wasn t  but it also wasn t the worst  You get what you pay for  Our room was basic but the bed was comfortable and even for a smoking room  it wasn t bad  The bathroom was fine and the housekeeping staff did a great job of keeping you stocked with plenty of towels  The casino floor isn t the best but you are so close to other casino s  we like O Sheas and Casino Royale for the cheap drinks  that it wasn t a problem  The pool was fine  Plenty of lounge chairs  Try a Miami Vice drink poolside  Very tasty  Will we stay here the next time we come to Vegas  probably not but we never stay the same place twice  We will stay with a Harrah property  
P =>   great hotel just back from vegas and could not say a bad thing about this hotel the rooms are large and cleaned every day   would stay here again with no hesitation   
P =>   Not as Bad as I was expecting We stayed here for   nights from il    through il     When I checked in   I announced that I would be writing a review on TripAdvisor and preferred a quiet room on a higher floor  I got Room       on the   th floor at the back of the hotel  There was no great view parking lots and backs of buildings but NO NOISE  I felt for the people who were staying at the front of the hotel  especially the ones on lower floors  because there was a lot of noise on the strip  The room looked like a      s Holiday Inn room  There were   double beds  a good tv with local channels and a few cable channels  ESPN etc   a table with chairs  The a c worked fine  There was no safe a big negative that should be updated  The bathroom was standard with tub shower combo and a clean sink area  There were basic amenities such as shampoo and soap  The ice bucket was there also  and free ice was available near the elevators  about     feet away  Sometimes there were drunk people in the hallway  but that could occur anywhere  The elevators were slow as everybody states  but I never had to wait more than   minutes  There was usually entertainment from the drunk guests but nothing violent or offensive  The location was fantastic and was convenient to everything  I had breakfast in the restaurant on the  nd floor  It was not the best but was comped based on my Total Rewards a definite must for anyone staying at a Harrah s property  I had stayed at the Paris last ember and had been receiving offers ever since so I decided to return  but the only available place with a comp room was the Imperial Palace so that s where I stayed so great for the price  free   I also had received a coupon for   free buffets at the Rio so I took the free shuttle bus there for a fantastic buffet with something for everybody  The free shuttles leave from the Paris or Harrahs next door  They also give you a coupon book at check in so I got my free Flamingos and Harrahs tee shirts after about    minutes on the slots  There was also a discount coupon for the prime rib Chinese place at Bill s  but I didn t realize I had one until I ate there the first night an did not have a chance to return  The casino wasn t as smoky as I was expecting  and I had fun playing the slots and drinking free beers  I lost a few hundred but had a great time  I am planning another trip in the fall and hope to stay at another Harrah s property so I can continue to sample them all  Good luck to all  
P =>   Perfect location great value for money I loved this hotel  it was recomended to me by a good friend so I knew it would be ok  but after seeing some reviews I didn t have high expectations  I was pleasently surprised when we turned up  we had a room on the  th floor at the back with a view of the mountains  it was very quiet at night  The location of this hotel is just spot on  right in the middle of thr strip  opposite Ceaser s Palace   last time I stayed in the Excalibur and it was just too far away from all the buzz of the Strip  It s an old school Hotel  with a dated Casino but I thought it just added to the experience of being in Vegas   take the old with the new I say and just enjoy the whole experience  The Casino has a Celebrity look a like pit and they have the best Elvis I ve ever seen  and Freddie Murcury was excellent as well  The pool was good and the frozen cocktails were delishious    out of      will recomend this hotel to everyone I know who is going to Vegas  
P =>   can t beat this place stayed may      Asked if we could be upgraded at check in and was given a nice suite on   th floor  All the staff was very friendly and nice  The bed was very comfortable and the pressure in the shower is great  You can t beat this place for the value and great location  Thank you to everyone at IP  
P =>   great location  We have just booked our  th trip to Vegas  amp  will be staying at the IP for the  rd time  You have to remember that you get what you pay for  The location is fantastic  ask for a quiet room when you check in and it s fine  Although not luxurious  rooms have basics e g toiletries  hairdryer  TV   anyway  how much time do you spend in your room when in Vegas    Bus stops are close  free shuttle from Harrahs to the Rio  also Starbucks for that late night coffee  Dennys for breakfast All in all a good value place to stay   the money you save on a more expensive hotel can be spent on trips  food  gambling etc  
P =>   Working class crowd with great location I stayed here for five nights at the start of  for Boxing The hotel is in the middle of the strip across from ceasers palace great location The atmosphere in the Imperial is great at the bars due to the working class clientele that stay here You can have a drink and a laugh it is no problem great fun The hotel is always busy which adds to the atmosphere We had a strip view room which was great although the noise from carnival court is loud and lasts from   am until   am so if you want peace make sure you dont get a strip view room The pool is adequate For a budget hotel with a great location choose the Imperial we had a ball The other hotels in Vegas are more classier ceasers mandalay mgm etc but have absolutely no atmosphere and are not worth the extra money    
P =>  Pay a few more dollars and go somewhere nicer We paid    USD a night and you get what you pay for  The rooms are very dated and feel dirty and grimey  The casino attracts a pretty dodgy crowd  If I went again I would pay      USD and stay somewhere like the Venetian which was gorgeous  Was located in a good spot on the strip  
P =>  Don t believe the bad reviews its excellent    Just returned from Las Vegas and stayed at the imperial palace  dont believe the poor reviews  the hotel couldnt be better located  its clean and got everything you need  Right in the middle of the strip  better located than MGM or Mandalay bay  The hotel has its own monorail stop which is so convienient but the deuce bus is better value and again stops right outside  The imperial palace may not be the poshest hotel but if you just need a value for money hotel in a fantastic location then dont look anywhere else  
P =>  OK but           Checked in Monday night        staff was friendly  Our room on the   th floor at first seemed ok  but I noticed a partially used complimentary shampoo left on the tub shelf by the previous occupants  Then a moth died in front of the patio door and it was STILLTHERE on Friday morning       when we checked out  I of course assume the room was not vacuumed properly or at all  Then on Friday morning as we were packing up I noticed a blood spot on the bedspread  Didn t see that prior  or I would have brought itto someones attention  Location is fabulous  Burger place not the greatest  Did not try the buffet  Too many timeshare people right near the elevator  And I would have likedan in room coffee pot  Why don t hotels have this amenity  Dealertainers are fabulous It was my first stay there and probably my last  Too bad  its such a bargain price wise  and as long as business is down  they should see that the customers they do have are happy  
P =>  Stay There All The Time I have really never had any issues  other than they need more people at check in I stay there every time I go out to Vegas and have never had any complaints If I wanted a high classed room and wanted to pay the price          I would stay at one of THOSE hotels             I just want a room that is clean and inexpensive with a good location and I have that with this hotel IF I had to pay more for a hotel  I would not be able to spend money on fun things to do  on shopping and certainly not on gambling  As they say   quot location location location quot  and they sure have that  
P =>  Great Value  I read the other reviews of the hotel before we booked and thought we would take a chance since some were good and some were bad  My wife and I had no real complaints  The hotel is located in a great location  it was affordable  and we had a good time there  We stayed on the   th floor and was told it was the quieter section of the hotel by the desk clerk  Noise was definitely not an issue from our room  We only ate at the buffet for breakfast and it was average  They had a sign posted out side of what they were serving on it and that was a big help to decide whether or not to eat there  Another plus was that it was connected to the mono rail  After a couple of days of walking the strip  our legs were sore and the mono rail came in handy  As I said before the location was great  The Mirage was across the street  Harrahs was right next door and other places like the Venetian  Treaure Island  and Fashion Show Mall were within a short walking distance  The people staying at the hotel were a mixture of young and old  So I really couldn t say which age group was more dominant there  I also seen other reviews of people talking about a weird smell in the place  Neither my wife nor I noticed it  Overall the hotel was a great place for us to stay for our first trip to Vegas  Would I stay there again  the answer is yes  
P => location excellent had a great stay at this hotel  its location is excellent for exploring all of the strip  only complaint dont get a room overlooking Harrahs as you will be kept awake till  pm with the live music  rooms large  clean and comfy would recommend this as a budget hotel  
P =>  Amazing location I had read a few bad reviews for this hotel so I was expecting the worst but was pleasantly surprised  Ok you get what you pay for  It s a basic hotel but it was clean  the shower was wonderfully powerful and the rooms were a decent size  It provided us with somewhere to sleep which is all you really need in Vegas  Who goes to Vegas to stay in their hotel room  I d heard that rooms at the front of the hotel could be noisy and certainly we could hear the bands on at the Carnival Court quite clearly but as soon as we switched on the air conditioning it drowned out everything else  I didn t have a problem sleeping  The Imperial Palace is forgiven all of it s flaws when you walk out onto the strip into the middle of everything  The location is amazing and  with the price  this hotel is a bargain  
P =>  great value best location great variety of restaurants in over    years of coming to the IMPERIAL palace  we have never had a bad time in our experience over the years  the average traveler can have a great time without having to break the bank  most of the newer hotels are nice but they don t have the friendly feeling that you have at the I P   
P =>  Great value for money   ideal location This hotel is located in an ideal location right in the heart of the Vegas strip  opposite Ceaser s Palace   It s true that the rooms are a little dated and worn  however during my stay they were cleaned every day to a good standard  This may not be the best place to stay if you re having a romantic getaway with your partner  but is an ideal place to come if you re in a group of friends wanting to make the most of the Vegas nightlife This is certainly not a luxury hotel however my overall rating reflects the value for money that I think this place offers  
P =>  What a dump   This is probably the worst hotel I ve ever stayed in  It is one step above prison  The hotel is old and rundown  The d cor is really outdated  It was probably considered fashionable when it opened about    years ago  The hotel a damp  smell to it  And to make it worst  the tub did not drain when showering  So while taking a shower you have water up to your ankles  The beds were pretty uncomfortable too  The only positive was the location  Its right in the middle of the strip  The front desk staff was pleasant as well  The only people who should stay here are the    and under crowd who just needs somewhere to store there luggage while our partying  
P =>  Bargain rate for Outstanding location Stayed at the IP with a group of friends for   nights from  th il  We were a bit concerned after reading some reviews  however these just seemed to not be true or to be based on unrealistic expectations Anyone from Europe or Australia should not have any concern about staying here  The rooms were in good condition  clean and at     a night excellent value  The location of this hotel is simply fantastic  Contrary to reports on this site we did not have any problems with waiting for elevators  long check in  no dirty rooms  no dirty sheets and we had no expectations of having coffee machines etc in our rooms  What do some people expect for     a night Quite simply I would stay at the IP again on any future visits to Vegas  The IP is not the best hotel  but it never claims to be  It is what it seems a well located  bargain rate hotel in an excellent mid strip location  
P => Second stay at Imperial palace and would stay again  Stayed at the Imperial Palace from il   th thru   th  This was our second stay at the Imperial Palace and would definately come back  Room was clean  staff very courteous and helpful  Asked for a room with a vier of the Strip and was advised that it would be noisey  Appreciated this information but said that wouldn t bother us and were given a room on the   th floor with a view  The only thing was that the   th floor is where the Imperial Palace sign was so view was limited  Previous stay we were on the   th floor and view was much better  Do however think that there could be a better choice of eating places at the Imperial Palace  Because of the limited choices we chose to eat elsewhere  Did enjoy breakfast at the Tea House Whenever in Las Vegas will make the Imperial Palace our choice of a place to stay  
P =>   The Motel   of Vegas Strip Hotels This was our first time at IP  but not at Harrah s properties or Vegas  This was definitely the lowest quality hotel I have ever stayed at in Vegas  I have stayed at Excalibur  Harrah s  Pallazo  Mirage   amp  NY NY  This was definite y a case of  quot you get what you pay for quot  or in our case what you don t pay for  There is very little luxury at this property  but it is dirt cheap for strip hotels  Lobby and casino is out dated and not much appeal  The restaurants are nothing to brag about  but I would avoid room service and head down to the    hour burger joint  it s cheaper  The pool was nice and service was very courteous  amp  towels were clean and fairly good quality LOCATION  LOCATION  LOCATION    That is what you are paying for with IP  You are in the middle of the strip with easy access to Caesars  amp  Mirage across the street as well as Venetian Pallazo up the street  Metro at the back of the property is also convenient Stay sleep here and gamble at other Harrah s properies  amp  casinos to get your money s worth  This hotel serves no virtually no other functions  
P =>   Never again We stayed here as part of a very good package deal   should have paid a bit more for another hotel  We stayed on the   th and   th floors  try not to get a room on the upper floors  The elevators were always packed and took forever  The ladies restroom on casino level flooded and I was told to go to the  rd floor  Most casinos have at least two restrooms   one on each side  Not very friendly staff either  We had fun in spite of staying at Imperial Palace   they didn t eve acknowledge that it was my birthday when I checked in  When I go back  I will stay at Casino Royale  the casino is quite dumpy to some folks  When I stay there everyone is very nice to me and the rooms have been redone  
P =>   Great Location decent rooms lousy food and awful elevators  This hotel is in a great location center strip  Who could complain    The  quot noisy quot  side is truly  quot noisy quot   My family and friends and I all stayed on the   th Floor  Big mistake  The elevators were SLOW and CROWDED all the time  We found   sets of elevators and you could easily wait about    minutes to get up or down  The buffet sucked  Do not spend your money there  In the midwest and the south  you get hot crab legs and whole ones  I have never been served cold crab legs that have been sliced in half  I was venture over to Harrah s for better food  
P =>   its not as bad as I thought it would be Well I will say this   the location is prime  Considering where it is its a cheap hotel  With that being said  this is an old hotel  There are a lot of things that need to be updated  the rooms  elevators  restaurants  The food at the cafe is of poor quality  Eat some where else  The rooms are average  just the basic necessities  I stayed in room      The bathroom is in dire need of remodeling but its not horrible  If you get a room that is facing the strip get ready for lots of noise all day and all night  You see  the Carnival Bar is located right below you  and anyone trying to get some sleep will definitely be woken up  The windows don t stop any of the noise from coming in but on the flip side of that you have balconies that you can walk out on and watch the party at the bar  The elevators are the worst part of this hotel  Sometimes we waited    mins for the elevators and sometimes we had to wait for the next elevator which was the same elevator because only one was running   Chances are I would never stay here again but for anyone who has to stay here its do able  I would say the elevators were the worst part of the entire stay  
P =>   Stay away    Nasty  tacky hotel  We got the room for free through our Harrahs reward points  I would have preferred to pay for a room else where  Rough sheets  rough towels  old shower love tub combo with no curtain  Tacky mirrors everywhere  In the shower  over the bed       Front desk won t even answer their phones  The world s slowest elevators   you will literally wait for      minutes for an elevator to open up for you  Don t bother taking the stairs up every single floor is locked  Flea market quality shops in the lobby  I will never ever stay at this hotel again  Hope this place gets demolished soon   it s time to make way for a high class hotel  
P =>   Do not bother a waste of money Arrived over Easter    on the   th floor the music from the front nightclub until  am in the mornings had our room walls moving and at  am the planes start landing every    minutes  so hang on to your bed      but the best thing was the fire alarm going off every   minutes from  am Easter Saturday till     am       we had people on the   th floor with little understanding of English attempting to go down fire escapes    the only communication of the problem  please stay in your room we are checking if its a false alarm  when I went down with my family to highlight our concerns no one at the front counter had heard of the issues   on the   th floor    NO ATTEMPT BY ANY EMPLOYEE OR MANAGER OF THE IMPERIAL TO SAY SORRY    SO DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY 
P =>  A bit rough but decent budget pension The hotel is a short walk to a train station and subway  The accomodations naturally were a bit tight  especially the toilet and shower which were each separate in little closet sized spaces  and shared  Definitely in the budget category  Bed was flimsy  sheets were worn thin but clean  Sink and mirror in room  Just enough room to walk in and lay down  But the stay includes a decent breakfast  eggs  sausage  toast  juice  tea   Price was reasonable  Host staff was nice  
P =>  Read this if you want a review on the Basic rooms  shared facilities  This is my  nd time staying at Alhambra  First time was with a partner in a room with private shower   WC  This time round I stayed at the Basic room with shared facilities  shower   WC  I m not gonna talk about the location as every reviewer here can tell you how centrally located this hotel is  Instead  I m gonna share my experiendce staying in one of their basic rooms First things first  it s a long long climb up as the basic rooms are in the  rd floor  There is no lifts in the hotel  So  if you have heavy luggage  like I did   be prepared for a  quot good exercise quot   The rooms are relatively good and clean  The shared facilities are cleaned every day  so no issues with that too Wifi access in the room is intermittent at best  I had access on the first two days but not the rest  So  if you really have to access the internet  bring your notebook down to the lobby area or do it when you re having breakfast at the dining area  Both areas have excellent wifi coverage So  again all in all  a not too bad hotel in a very good location  Just a few things you have to take note which may or may not concern you  Other than that  the stay was pretty pleasant  
P =>  Great location Hotel is situated on great location just close to railway station  and Kings Cross tube station from where you can go whereever you wish  Very frendly staff in hotel and great service  Rooms could be bigger  but you can t have everything  thay are clean  Also  noise isolation between floors could be better  You also have free WLAN  
P =>  What a find  Read reviews  til our eyes blurred  and then there it was   Alhambra   with spotless  comfortable rooms  warm and friendly staff  classic full English breakfast  and located within view of   major train stations  buses and the underground and not far from a  rd station  all making for easy access into or out of London  On or near Euston St  are shops  churches  neighborhood pubs and the British Library  A family establishment  the Alhambra staff finds answers to questions and enjoys offering suggestions and sharing ideas  all making for a more pleasant visit  We do hope to return some time soon  and will certainly know where to stay  
P =>  Great    Stayed a couple of days in tember  then again earlier this month  Wonderful experience both times  Located on a quiet one way street a block from the tube and two train stations  Major bus stops by the stations all combine for one of the best travel connection locations in the city  Felt the value was good at   GBP for a double En Suite  The Comfort Inn a half a block away charges    GBP  a B amp B across the street from the Comfort Inn has a sign saying their rooms are from   GBP  but I suspect that is a cramped closet of a room  Nice family runs the operation  The British husband is working at   AM  taking the trash to the curb and starting the breakfast  The French wife must be the looks of the team and runs the front desk  Both very friendly and helpful  Every person that works for them was very pleasant  The first morning of our stay  I left some clothes laying around as we were in a hurry to see the sights of London  On our return  I was amazed to find that they had been folded and neatly stacked  They provide in room coffee and tea  as well as a top notch English breakfast which the husband cooks in their dining hall  They also provide a secure area to store you luggage before and after check out times if you get in at   AM like we did We stayed in rooms     and     As others have said      is great  in the back with a private courtyard     faces the street on the ground floor but is still very quiet     has the smallest sink I have ever seen outside of an airliner  but still big enough  The rooms are a little small  but still plenty large  Beds in both the rooms we stayed at were very comfortable  There is still some work going on as they upgrade their rooms  but nothing that bothered guest unless they are there in the middle of the day Cannot say enough good things about the location  If you want the hustle and bustle of Soho  it is only    minutes away on the tube  Around the hotel you will find nice pubs that cater to the locals  Just a couple of blocks away we found a pub serving pints of Carlings for     GBP  Food at the local eateries were some of the best we had while in London  which is really not saying all that much   The best meal we had in London was at Alhambra s breakfast  
P =>   An Amazing Place   They Made Us Feel Special   Recommend      We spent a week at the Alhambra in early t      for our   year wedding anniversary We stayed in room     The staff at the Alhambra were way beyond our expectations  Everyone made us feel special  from Breakfast in the Morning  to our rooms being tended to by the maids  Everyone was so nice and helpful   Words cannot describe our stay at the Alhambra  I recommend and thank the Valoti family for their kindness  The hotel is not even   minutes from the Kings Cross Station and there were many good restaurants within walking range  It was well worth the    We will stay there again and recommend it to everyone  It was all the little things that added up  
P =>   what a find would definately use again  Excellent value for money four adults stayed in quad room was a bit cramped but actually bigger than expected after reading some of the reviews  Room was in annexe across the road and it was clean and quiet after being on the go all day  Staff were pleasant and helpful and breakfast was superb  Excellent location for sight seeing  Thanks 
P =>   better accomadation in shop doorway stayed in a so called triple en suite room accross the road from main building   strange  the room was in the basement and on entry discovered that the room was so small that if i was swinging a cat i would have been jailed for animal cruelty  the room was so small that there was no room whatsoever for luggage  the two wall lights did not work and when getting into bed discovered tha the beds were made up with what looked like old military blankets   all this at      a night   marched accross road to reception to complain and was told that a few weeks earlier there had been a leak and so lights not working and as for all the other bad things about the room  well i may have been talking gibberish  the next day it was the wifes turn to have a go and eventually she got a massive refund of                my advice for anyone considering a stay here is do not believe the good reviews and pay a little extra and stay somewhere else  but not a shopdoorway that was just a bit sarcasm   
P =>   Good Budget Spot We stayed at the Alhambra on our first trip to London  We were looking for a budget place in London with some decent things in the area  and most importantly  quick access to the tube  We nailed it with Alhambra  The reviews on tripadvisor sum this place up The owners keep the place very well kept up  It s clean and friendly  It s definitely cramp quarters  but what do you expect for London  The Full English breakfast is hard to stomach morning after morning  Do locals actually eat that  or is it just a bad trick on tourists  Nonetheless  Frank is a great chef and we appreciate everything he  his wife  and the staff we able to provide The access to Kings Cross St Pancras station was very convenient  I love London because for as many people are in the city  you can get anywhere easily  quickly  and cheaply  use the Pearl card  on the Tubes If we re looking for a budget spot on our next trip to London  we ll stay here again  Although  it would be very nice to stay somewhere more central like Picadily Circus or Covent Gardens  
P =>   Great location   perfect for sightseeing My husband and I stayed at Alhambra at the end of e  and due to a miscalculation with time zones  I booked one night too early  which we ended up being charged for  which was fair enough  as the hotel was very busy and they had kept the room vacant for us   We decided to extend our stay there  so ended up having to move to two different rooms  one of which was over the road  The staff were all very helpful and the breakfasts were a fantastic start to the day  Please realise  however  that you get what you pay for  and you need to be prepared for the very tiny size of the rooms  Was also disappointed with the wireless internet  which was one of the reasons I chose this hotel  In all three locations we had very poor connectivity  I would not recommend this place for elderly people  or for those with disabilties  as you have to carry your luggage up the stairs  We discovered a great Irish pub around the corner  with reasonably priced food and a convivial atmoshere  Overall  I would recommend this hotel as a great place from which to set out and see the sights around London  
P =>   Echo all other good reviews   a real find  As others have said  this is an excellent little hotel for a few nights in central London in the perfect location for onward travel from St Pancras etc  Rooms are a bit snug  but the hotel makes no pretence to otherwise and following advice on this site  we stayed in twin en suite room which was perfectly fine for what we needed  Very clean and staff really friendly  And the breakfast was superb  
P =>  Great place   Stayed here couple of nights in e      Hotel is just around the corner of St  Pancras and Kings Cross stations  so location is just perfect   Even though located in vicinity of a busy station  the street was amazingly quite and peaceful  I was traveling with friends of mine and we had a quad room in a building opposite to the  quot main quot  one  Our room was clean and spotless   It was a bit small for four adults with luggage  but I know this is the case in most of the hotels in England  and anyway  who will stay only indoors while one is in London    Toilet and shower were also clean  Breakfast was good  served in a main building   Staff was friendly and polite  Great value for money   Will definitely go back on my next visit to London    
P =>   Nothing fancy but perfect for a budget traveler Very small  but clean rooms  The attraction  however  is not the rooms  but the central location and the very affordable rates  The included breakfast was also excellent  I would highly recommend it  
P =>   Great value This is the best hotel I ve stayed in in London  I try to avoid staying in hotels in London because I feel like it s impossible to find someplace decent at a reasonable price  but the Alhambra was good  You can choose if you want en suite or not  depending on your budget  My boyfriend and I are poor students  so we chose the room with just a sink  but it was fine because the toilet and shower were just a few steps away  The room was small but comfortable  with a tea kettle  flat screen tv  and desk vanity  The bed was basic  but better than some I ve slept in in my many budget travels  They have free wifi and full English breakfast included  The staff were friendly and helpful  and the hotel was clean and quite  no slamming fire doors   This is the first London hotel of which I can say   quot I would stay there again  quot  
P =>   Clean comfortable budget accommodation well situated with a good breakfast to get your day started  I have stayed at the Alhambra several times over the past years  They are well located  literally across the road from Kings Cross St  Pancras   The rooms and bathrooms are small but this is budget accommodation  T he rooms are clean with comfortable beds  tv  small bathroom and tea coffee making facility  It is excellent value for money and the staff are friendly  efficient and helpful  They serve a good breakfast to get your day started  They have refurbished since our last visit and everything is spotless  
P =>   Alhambra Hotel   Great Value We have stayed at the Alhambra before for just a few days  This time we were here for six days  and you just cannot beat the value and location  of course the rooms are small  but you are not paying for a luxury hotel  The rooms are clean and everything works in the rooms  The breakfast  and we are both vegetarians  certainly will fill you up and the staff is wonderful   I have stayed at other places where they toss the food at you   If you request rooms  they try hard to get you what you request  We have only stayed in the main building  If loud noises bother you  you might wish to request a room not facing the street  tho we live in a city and it doesn t bother us   having said that it was only loud on a Saturday night   When in London  one is out sightseeing and at the theatre   why pay more when you just want a clean  safe place to sleep The staff at the front desk are terrific  friendly and make you feel at home  Great access to the tube  including Picadilly to the airport   Thumbs up  
P =>   Nice hotel  Nice hotel  well situated  staff very nice and polite  Lovely breakfast The bedroom are small but normal with the price that we pay I definitly advice you this hotel  
P =>   Excellent Location with Great Breakfast  My wife and I stayed at the Alhambra Hotel for   nights in  of       I picked the hotel because of the TripAdvisor reviews that I had read and I was not disappointed  When I emailed the hotel to check availability  they had originally said that there we could have a room with a double bed  shower and toilet inside  for   nights  but by the time I replied to confirm the reservation  the room was not available all   nights  Long story  short   we stayed in three different rooms in this hotel in four nights  The staff was very friendly and helpful  When we switched rooms  we just took our luggage down to the front desk in the morning  and it was waiting in our new room for us when we returned at night  We spent a night in each of the annexes across the street and two nights in the main hotel building so we got to experience each part of the hotel  All of the rooms were clean and small   exactly what we expected  The free WiFi worked in all of the rooms  even on the top floor of the annex  The breakfast in the morning is excellent  though there can be a short line  queue  if you go too late You cannot beat the location of this hotel  As mentioned  it is half a block from the St  Pancras Eurostar station  which is ideal for early morning chunnel trains  Also  the tube station at St  Pancras connects with six lines  including the Piccadilly line  which will take you out to Heathrow  AND  there s an HSBC bank on the corner   Which is great if you are an HSBC customer   no currency exchange needed   This is an excellent hotel for its price range and I will not hesitate to stay in it again when I return to London  
P =>  Small Room but Otherwise a Good Option for London The Alhambra was very conveniently located close to St Pancras Station for Eurostar connections  The breakfast was excellent and the staff were very friendly  We were allocated a first floor bedroom with a double bed and showerbox  The room was extremely small  even by London standards  made worse because the room had a large dresser  which took up too much space for its utility  There was only room for one suitcase on top of the dresser  The room and showerbox was very clean  as was the adjoining shared toilet  This room would be best for a very short stay in London and not for more than two nights  
P =>   Excellent choice of hotel in London Chose this hotel on the internet after reading reviews on Trip Advisor and was pleased to find that the room exceeded my expectations  The rooms were decent size  very clean  and the staff was friendly and helpful  We were able to get in our room upon arrival at   AM and that was most appreciated  Terrific location  The bus and underground were were just down the street and we were pleased to find we could purchase a day pass for the buses for only      pounds per day  Another good value was using airportsrunner for transport from the pier and to the airport   they brought us directly to the hotel and handled our luggage and the price was very reasonable  I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone who wants a good value and does not need all the amenities of a five star hotel  
P =>   Excellent Hotel I recently stayed at the Alhambra Hotel  amp  must say this is a good find  The price is right and the location is fine with nearby Tube Stops  The breakfast is included  and it is a nice breakfast at that  There is Hot Food served with all the coffee or tea you asked for  The Staff at the Front Desk as well as the Breakfast Staff were all very nice  amp  pleasant The rooms are clean  and so are the bathrooms  Rooms are not big  but you are not in London to sit in your hotel room  I was very pleased with this hotel  It is Basic  but Good There is only one thing that concerned me  This hotel has the small winding stairs that so many hotels in London have  There is no way for Housekeeping Carts to be used  so Housekeeping keeps the daily fresh towels in plastic bags placed on the steps  On each day I was there  I noticed on various landings  some of the towels were not in the plastic bags  but just sitting on the carpet of the stairs If you think about that  it s unsanitary  That is the same carpet people are walking on with their shoes  amp  dragging their luggage over  I intended to point this out to the Front Desk while I was at the hotel  but between running in  amp  out  amp  people checking in  amp  out  I forgot  I hope that Management will point out to Housekeeping that the Fresh Towels should remain in the plastic bags until they are placed in the rooms  Other than that one point  I was very satisfied with the Alhambra  It really is a good find in an expensive City  I will be returning to the Alhambra in the future  It is a nicely run Hotel  and I give it an enthused Thumbs Up review  
P =>   everything you need at a reasonable price This hotel is   mins walk from St Pancras  Our en suite room was small  but very clean  TV  tea coffee making  and comfortable beds  A good freshly cooked English breakfast was included in the price  plenty of toast and tea  We didn t find noise to be a problem  but I suggest ear plugs  just incase  The price for two of us was      which I think is excellent value for London  Found the staff to be pleasant We had a meal at the Harrison Gastro Pub  it is a couple of streets away  very good food and value  
P =>   Great for a few nights My wife and I and our daughter and    year old grandson stayed here for   nights and found it ideal for our needs  An extended stay in this hotel would not be a great idea in view of the room sizes and lack of communal sitting areas  We were in a ground floor back room and first floor back room in the annex across the road from the hotel  The rooms were small but had all necessary furniture  twin beds with a shared bedside table  wardrobe  dressing table  hand basin  ensuite toilet and shower  TV and tea coffee making facilities  Lighting was excellent  There was even a centre ceiling light which makes living out of a suitcase much easier  These seem to be sadly lacking in most hotel bedrooms  There are safes in the rooms but the combination for each room is preset  known by management and cannot be altered  so of limited value for storing cash or documents Breakfast was cooked and served to order in a basement breakfast room in the main building The hotel is within sight of St Pancras station which is well served by tube and buses so is a good base for sightseeing  
P =>   Fabulous Value My boyfriend and I stayed here for two nights and we both agreed that we would stay here again  We stayed in a double on the third floor and shared a bathroom with the other rooms on our floor  The rooms were spotless  our bags were brought up for us  we never had to wait to use the shower  and the breakfast was great  The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful  As long as you are not looking for a huge luxury room  this is perfect  
P =>   Convenient clean and inviting We needed overnight accommodation convenient to St Pancras International and Eurostar for a journey to Perpignan  and the Alhambra fitted the bill perfectly  The staff were welcoming and helpful  the room comfortable  scrupulously clean and the price affordable  Added to that we got breakfast as well  Will certainly visit again for our next foray to France by Eurostar and the French TGV  
P =>  Very nice  We stayed a week in this hotel   it was lovely  The location  just around the corner from King s Cross  couldn t be beat  The price was VERY reasonable for being right in the heart of London  Rooms were very small  but clean  The showers are absolutely fantastic with the water pressure  I wanted to take the shower home with me Our room was a basement room en suite  in the building across from the  quot main quot  building  The building itself was very quiet  but there was a little bit of street noise occasionally on the weekend  never bad at all  and usually when we were awake anyway  And finally  the full English breakfast was absolutely outstanding  A wonderful way to start the day   it truly does keep you full until lunchtime  Overall   great hotel  The staff very friendly  the rooms clean and servicable  location fantastic  and wonderful food  
P =>  Clean cheap and cheerfull I stayed in a single room here midweek in il       My room was on the top    rd   floor and was accessed by stairs   no lift    Breakfast is served in the basement and from the basement to my room was an agonising    stairs Apart from the above  this hotel is a gem   as long as you know waht you are getting  The rooms are small but spotless  the breakfast is quite good  the hotel overall is very clean and the breakfast area is also spotless  Staff both at breakfast and on checking in and out were really friendly Not a hotel for hanging around in  but if you are looking for a reasonable priced room in an excellent location for a short stay in London  I feel it will be hard to beat this hotel 
P =>  Great   if you know what to expect Over a number of years I have stayed at the Alhambra Hotel about    times on business  In all these visits I have always found the hotel and service offered by the staff   owners to be consistent and reliable  As stated by many others in their review the Alhambra offers one of the cheapest rooms in central London   there is a reason for this  The hotel is in King s Cross  which although central is not exactly one of the most picturesque areas of the City  That said  if you are heading off on the Eurostar or on mainline rail from either King s Cross or Euston  then you are very close to these stations and the location is perfect  In general  the rooms are small  some even tiny  There is not really a lot of space for large luggage and to be honest you would not really use the hotel if you valued things like luxuriating in your room or enjoying a relaxing drink in a busy bar   reception area  Bedrooms are divided between the main hotel and its sister across the road  The standards are exactly the same  There are no lifts and some rooms are on the upper floors  Luggage can be left at reception and there is free wireless internet access if you have your own computer The rooms are spotlessly clean and are refreshed daily although you should bring your own toiletries as those offered are not very good  The breakfast is fresh with a choice between a cereal based offering or the more traditional fry up  grill up really  for the health conscious  of bacon and eggs  Lots of toast  tea and coffee  The staff are usually very friendly and helpful for those who want some advice about London  There is the added bonus if you speak French  so do the owners  The price is good for London and the hotel itself is very safe If you decide to stay here  and if you want a really good budget hotel I recommend you do  just be sure to say what you would like   as big a room as possible  private facilities and perhaps on the lower floors  The Alhambra is a very clean and safe hotel to use as a base for a trip to London   no frills  good service  good breakfast  good price  you decide  
P =>  A good choice for budget travellers We had a nice stay for   nights in Alhambra and I agree with most of the positive remarks here  It is situated in an excellent location with just   to   minutes  walk from King s Cross and a few minutes to Euston  The staff were friendly especially Bruno and Frank who arranged an early breakfast for us at      on Sunday morning when we had to hurry for the Stonhenge Tour  It was nice to have full breakfast every morning at a spacious breakfast room  We never had to wait for a table or the food  We stayed on the lower ground floor and could hear the tube noise but it wasn t loud enough to disturb us at all  But the negative side was  common to most budget hotels in central London  the room was very small  With   adults crowded in a family room of   standard double beds  we had to be tolerant  We had to put our luggage inside the closet as there was barely any extra space for the suitcases  The toilet and shower again were just basic and tiny  Well  for     GBP per night per room of   including full breakfast in a quiet and convenient location  I would think it good value  The free wi fi is a plus too  Next time  I may choose   family rooms for   people to get more space  
P =>  Very hard to beat for value convenience  Along with my wife I stayed at this hotel between       ch      The most striking thing about the hotel was how incredibily clean it looked  and was The reception area was very light and fresh and the staff interested  very helpful and efficient The rooms are admittedly on the small side but well equiped and comfortable The breakfast room was up to the same standard as the rest of the hotel and the service and food excellent I will use this hotel again and do recommend it  
P =>  Quality comes in small packages We picked out this hotel from past reviews  we can confirm these reveiwes are accurate and perfect for short stays we found the hotel extreamley clean  freindly and professional with an excellent breakfast as a bonus  Thankyou 
P =>   A very pleasent hotel in a great location I stayed for only one night at the Alhambra Hotel in the King s Cross area in London and afterwards I wished that I had spent every night during my week s stay in London there  The staff were very pleasent and easy to deal with  And the room resembled that of a room at the Hyatt Regency  though without the minibar   Not least when you compared it to what you get at some of the other trashy hotels and hostels on Argyle Street  Whenever I visit London I like to stay in the King s Cross area since it s so lively  My room at the Alhambra was very neatly furnished and decorated  and surprisingly spacious  for a London hotel   The bathroom was a bit on the small side  but big enough and with a proper shower booth  It was also spotlessly clean  The room had a big TV     inch screen at least   Sometimes at night you could hear the sounds of the underground trains arriving at and departing from the King s Cross station  which didn t bother me in the least  since the sound was very low  The one minor thing that could perhaps be changed by the hotel was that they could serve breakfast until    am instead of   am  because around      the breakfast room was very crowded and I had to share a table with complete strangers  All in all  however  for    GBP a night  I would most definitely choose to stay there again whenever I go to London again  
P =>   Cheap Clean Convenient and Cramped At           per night  this hotel is one of the cheapest hotels i could find in central London  It was quiet and located in a nice neighborhood with nearby pubs  restaurants  laundry  supermarkets  and convenience stores  It is also very conveniently located to the King s Cross and St  Pancras train and underground stations      block   The hotel has free wireless internet and a free continental english breakfast  which was exactly as depicted on their webpage  My only problem with the hotel is how cramped the rooms are  This wasn t a surprise   the pictures on the Alambra s website clearly show just how small the rooms are   which is small  I opted for a room with an en suite shower which had a shower that opened directly into the room  The toilet was shared with the other two rooms on the floor and was located in what could best be described as a closet at the end of the hall  The room was cleaned and the towels were replaced every day  The shared toilet was also kept fairly clean This hotel is perfect for anyone trying to stay in London for as cheap as possible  However  if you would like any space in your room  i e  somewhere to sit  somewhere to put your luggage  a  quot bathroom quot   etc   then i would suggest looking elsewhere  
P =>   Not bad  good location Stayed here for   nights First   nights were in a tiny room up   flights of narrow stairs Room was clean warm and fairly quiet Shared toilet and shower was small but ok Breakfest was pretty good also free wireless internet was a bonus too Last   nights were across the road in a room in the basement with its own shower and toilet Once again pretty comfortable and clean  
P =>   Right opposite Eurostar St Pancras We were leaving London on an early Eurostar  so wanted a place to sleep over after travelling into London  The Albhambra came up as a good recommendation on Trip Advisor  so we booked a double room with en suite facilities for one night The hotel couldn t be much more convienient for Eurostar being located just half a block away down Argyle street  you can see St Pancras from the front door   We were a little disaapointed with the size of the room and en suite  but given the price and location the rate is very good value for money  We were given a room located in the annex accross the road in the Lower Ground Floor  Unfortunately this meant that we could hear the frequent noise of each underground train passing close by until late and early next morning  so if this bothers you ask for a room above street level  Otherwise there was no disturbance from an area that until recently had a poor reputation for sleaze  Clearly the area is benefiting from the recent investment Our only other disappointment was not being able to parrtake of our included breakfast  as breakfast started at   a m  A      start or a breakfast pack would have been good for those catching an early train  However a generally good experience and I would consider using again for an early Eurostar train  though I would personally find the accomodation a little too clautraphobic for a longer stay unless budget cost was more important   Note the Alhambra is cheaper and better than the nearby Travelodge   
P =>   Alhambra Hotel is THE BEST  What a fantastic hotel  I must say that all the good reviews are true  I am from Italy  I went there last week with my family for a week s holiday in London  and I was very very satisfied  The location is very central and smart  the area around St Pancras Station has been transformed with lots of shops   the room was not huge but always clean  the breakfast is freshly cooked but the most important thing is the staff s friendliness  Especially Bruno at reception is always happy to help  he is very friendly  When I will return to London I would not consider going to any other hotel  I shall recommend the Alhambra to all my friends  it s the best  
P =>   ent enough for a London budget hotel While the room and bathroom were quite small  this was a decent budget hotel for London  It was clean and the breakfast  which is included in the room price  was a good start to the day  Our room face the street  so was a little noisy  It is in an excellent location as far as being close the St Pancras and Kings Cross train stations  but there is not much else nearby  However  getting around the London Tube system is so easy  
P =>  poor business behavior The story of a failed booking procedure  On Sunday  uary     at       I received a mail on my booking request  which said that the hotel offers a discount on its prices in ruary and that the reduced prices for a triple room with shower and toilet outside the room were     and     for Friday and Saturday and for a triple room with en suite facilities     for Sunday and     for Monday The same day at       I received another mail with the subject  quot error in the previous email quot   which said  that the person who replied this afternoon made a mistake in the prices  Receive our apologies  All our en suite triple rooms are fully booked for the required dates  All we have available is one triple room  double bed   single bed  with shared shower and WC  The price is     per night week days and     per night Friday and Saturday  The rooms with special offers are now fully booked for these dates Under these circumstances we did not proceed to booking  We were a little annoyed with this mail contact  First there wasn t only a problem with the prices but also with the vacancies of the triple en suite rooms  I understand that a triple en suite room was not available anymore although I don t understand that the employee who wrote us just   hours before should not have seen that  OK  something like that can happen  I would have accepted their apologies  But second and more important I believe that it s not the right business behavior changing the prices after giving a positive answer to a request like ours  If there was really a mistake  and they didn t just change their mind since e g  somebody else offered more money  they should at least have remained with the  special offer  for the room with the shared facilities  To change the offer after giving a positive answer on a request is at least not a very good style  
P =>   Great location very small room My husband  two year old son and I just returned from a weekend in London  We only stayed at the Alhambra Hotel for one night because we had free accommodation at another hotel  Holiday Inn Regent Park  through a British Airways deal for the other two nights we were in London  We stayed in a room with a double room  no ensuite bath I m glad that we only stayed at the Alhambra Hotel for one night  The Holiday Inn looked like the lap of luxury after staying at the Alhambra Hotel  The room was very small  like the other reviewers said  With our luggage  it was hard to turn around in the room  But  we weren t planning on spending a lot of time in the room so that wasn t that big a deal to us  My son had to sleep in the bed with my husband and I since there wasn t room for a cot  pack and play  in the room  The room was clean and there was a sink in the room which was a nice touch that I wasn t expecting  There was a very small shower down the hall  with no shelf and one small hook  It was hard to hang my clothes without them falling into the water  The toilet was in a separate room down the hall  There was no wash basin by the toilet  so I was a little put off thinking of the germs that must be on the handle to the toilet room and throughout the hotel  considering there was no place to wash after using the toilet except for in your own room  The shower and toilet felt a lot like the shower and toilet you d find at a campground in North America  I felt like I was car camping The breakfast was very good  I liked it better than the breakfast at the Holiday Inn  We had to wait for a table  but I assume that s because we came at      and breakfast was served until      am  The location was really excellent  Very close to the Kings Cross St  Pancras tube station and around the corner from the British Library  The free wireless was a great bonus and very appreciated Overall  it s a good  very basic hotel  I would go back again if I was only looking for somewhere to crash for the night and didn t plan on spending ANY time in the room  Also  next time I would pay extra for the ensuite bath  I saw that some people recommended this hotel for an amazing honeymoon  I would not recommend it for any special vacation like a honeymoon or for romance  but I would recommend it for a place to crash for the night  
P =>   Great location   Great Hotel I recently met a group of friends in London for the weekend and wanted a value priced hotel which was in close proximity to the King s Cross St  Pancras Stations  I m glad I chose the Alhambra Hotel  The hotel is family owned and the service and hospitality just can t be beat  Everyone was so kind  friendly and helpful and I felt very much at home and safe  The rooms are very basic  clean and comfortable and they serve a typical English breakfast which is included in the price of your room  You can also have cereal served with toast and a croissant if you don t want the English breakfast  There are many cafes and bars in the area as well as a post office and several Internet Cafes  Connection to the Underground is a   minute walk to King s Cross and several buses serve the area as well  When I visit London again  I will surely stay at the Alhambra  
P =>  Incredible find Nice cheap room  clean  shower  amp  toilet situated near room on same floor  bed comfortable  TV with Sky  lovely breakfast  pleasant  amp  helpfull staff and last but not least the location what more can I say it was so near to Kings Cross  St Pancras and Euston stations I could not believe it  this was a bonus as I travelled on the tube a lot  The bus stops were also near by if you choose to travel on the bus  all within   mins walk from the hotel with the exception of Euston which is   stop on the tube or short walk  When I arrived at Euston I got a taxi to the hotel which cost just over        not a lot  The only negative feedback I have is my room was on the third floor with no lift     stairs to climb  I planned it that I took my coat with me when going for breakfast so would only have this trek up stairs once a day when I came back later in the evening  but this will not put me off  I will definitely stay again  
P =>   good value for the cost Me and my husband sometimes stay here when in London for events and need somewhere cheap and cheerful to crash the night To the people complaining it s basic and small  What did you exactly expect for     a night in the middle of London The rooms are small but who cares  you re in London and when your out all day sightseeing and only sleeping in the hotel at night the size hardly matters The room came with basic things such as kettle and a t v and the rooms were very clean The staff were very friendly and we had a nice chat with the guy booking us in  He seemed like a nice chap and we chatted for a while I thought the breakfast in the morning was brilliant for a cheap budget hotel  I certainly wasn t expecting it to be as yummy as it was Over all I would recommend it to friends  Especially people like me who use it just as a base in London for doing things like going to gigs  Also it is located right nest to st pancras so handy for people that come in from the midlands  
P =>  very satisfied stayed here for   nights recently  very handy location near kings cross station and tube  everywhere very accessable  found the staff very helpful and friendly  the breakfast excellent and the rooms very warm and comfortable  serviced each day with nice fluffy towels  rooms not huge but plenty big enough for the time we were there  slight train noise but not enough to cause any bother  would certainly stay again and reccommend the hotel to friends  
P =>  Good stay convinient location We stayed two nights at Alhambra Hotel and were quite happy with our stay  We were three people staying in one room for about       a night   which was a good price  The room was also fairly small  but it was clean and the bathroom very clean and comfortable as well  The staff was very friendly and the breakfast good and the breakfast room cosy  The location is great  right by the King s Cross station The only thing that would have made our stay better  would have been single beds   or at least not a shared duvet for the double bed  
P =>  Great Stay We stayed at the Alhambra for   days from ember   th until uary  rd  As it was our first trip to London we were very happy with the location of this hotel as it is a minutes walk from the underground and the Eurostar station  It also had several coffee shops and restaurants nearby  Since St  Pancras is across the way there was also many convenient shops there as well We chose to book a room without toilet shower  The shared shower was always hot however a little small and another hook on the door would have been helpful  Our room was comfortable and clean and since we were out touring around most of the day  it met our needs just fine The breakfast each morning was very good  and although it seemed busy some mornings  we never had to wait for a table  We were very happy with our stay and would definately stay there again  
P =>   More room in a shoe box A lot of the reviews on here are very good and it has a good rating so maybe we were just very unlucky with this hotel  Also it certainly does have its good points   the english breakfast was excellent  the breakfast room very bright and breezy  the staff were friendly and the room and hotel were clean  The location is ideal for getting around London too  literally   mins from Kings Cross station  BUT  I have never seen such a small room in a hotel  There was barely room for the  small  double bed  a wardrobe  small chest of draws and a sink  This left barely enough floor space for standing in let alone   peoples bags  room to move while getting changed etc  Furthermore  I knew on booking that the room had no bathroom so toilet bathroom would be shared  but did not expect this to mean that there would only be ONE toilet and ONE shower between the whole floor  Therefore if you wake up at a normal time you will be waiting ages  constantly going back and forth down the corridor to see if they are free yet  And with so many people using it the shower was not in the best of states by the time it was free  so that my girlfriend preferred to wash at the sink rather than shower  If you do use the shower  there is no spare space to hang clothes or dry off  so you either let them get wet or run down the corridor in your towel I know its London and it was cheap compared to most the other places still available   weeks before Christmas  and its a real shame because it seemed like a nice hotel otherwise  and the en suite rooms may be much better  but for     a night i expect room to move at least  
P =>  Great Stay I ve been staying at Alhambra Hotel from   th to  th on my last London trip in       This time I visited here with my family and my friend s family  both of us have children in their   s  We chose triple and quad room  which we found absolutely comfy and wide  clean  fully furnished and equipped with fabulous LCD TV and kettle with choice of coffee or tea  Reception has been very friendly and breakfast  served both English and continental  really excellent  my compliments to the cook   I do recommend this hotel for all the above listed  together with the very good balance price location  We ll stay here again 
P =>  Alhambra   not eastern charm but British excellence Any hotel that one gladly revisits is worth recommending  as is the case with the Alhambra  situated centrally close to London s St Pancras Station  My family and I were recently there for a second time and enjoyed our stay very much The rooms are clean and tidy  the atmosphere in the hotel friendly and helpful  The staff speak a number of languages making it a good destination for those whose English is not       The English breakfast is more than adequate and well cooked  giving a good start to a day when one is wandering around London  All in all  highly recommended The Chislehurstian 
P =>  Excellent choice My   teenage kids and I stayed in a basic triple room and we were very satisfied with the experience  Yes  the room was small but certainly not the smallest I ve stayed in  The showers and toilets were down the passage and at no time in our   nights there did we have to queue for either  They were also very clean at all times  The breakfasts were very good   typical English breakfast or Continental with lots of toast  coffee etc  This certainly set us up for the day The B amp B is perfectly situated for the tube and or bus and we were amazed at how close things were  We felt quite safe walking around at night and were given our own key to the building I wouldn t hesitate to recommend The Alhambra if you are looking for a basic but safe place to stay  
P =>  Very convenient for Eurostar This is a small hotel down the street opposite the entrance to St Pancras station  split on opposite sides of the street  Some disruptive building work is going on at present  We stayed downstairs in the annexe which provided a small room and very small ensuite  It s fine for   or   days but you would feel cramped staying longer  The room was comfortable  had an electronic safe  and included tea coffee making facility  TV seemed restricted to the   main channels  The street was relatively quiet considering its position but the floorboards in the room above were quite creaky and the inhabitant seeemed restless  Breakfast is in the basement of the main building  a small area but food is freshly cooked and tasty  Not much variety but enough for a nice start to the day  Good value for money and very convenient for a morning Eurostar train  but bring your own shampoo  Also very near tube and good bus services  
P =>   Clean quiet   good for business travel I stayed at the Alhambra during a brief business trip to London  I stayed in a double ensuite  The room was small  but the shower was a reasonable size  I think I would have found the accomodations a bit cramped if I had shared the room with another  but it was perfectly fine for a single business traveler  My room was in the basement  There was a window through which a good amount of light came through  There was no view  but it didn t feel like a dungeon  There was no lift to the basement level and the stairs were quite narrow  It would have been tough to negotiate with large bags  The only noise I noticed was the sound of the underground trains  which wasn t bothersome in the least  I can t comment on breakfast  Not a big fan of English breakfasts  There is a Starbucks  Pret a Manger and Costa Coffee within a few blocks  which I preferred  This is not a part of London in which you will find a lot of fine dining  However  with the Kings Cross St  Pancras tube stop around the corner  it is easy to get anywhere in London  or Europe for that matter  from the hotel  I did not bring my laptop  so I also can t comment on the wireless Internet service  In a pinch  you d be able to get on the Internet at the Starbucks or the British Library  which is just a couple of blocks away  I was able to pay my bill the day before leaving and they ordered an early morning car for me  The car was waiting at      as requested  
P =>   very nice close to the city  We stayed here for three nights  the location is very close to the city  The undeground station kings cross has connections to   underground lines  so you can get to many directions  oxford circus in a few minutes  for example First of all  the hotel was full all the time  so book as early as possible  This is a budget stay  the rooms are rather small  but in London  this is normal  The service was always great  breakfast served immediately  the staff was alway friendly  
P => Well located budget B We stayed here for one night after flying into London before leaving the next morning on the train north from Kings Cross  The location was perfect  less than a block from the train station  There is also a tube station at Kings Cross and from there you can go anywhere in the city very easily  The room was small  as expected for the price and city  but clean and comfortable  They are in two buildings across Argyle Street from each other  and there was a very nice pub at the farther end of the street with good beer and fish and chips  Breakfast was the usual English Breakfast  egg  sausage  bacon  beans  and grilled tomato   plus juice  toast  and coffee or tea  There are no luxuries here  but for the money you can t beat it in London  We would stay there again  
P =>  Excellent location  Our room was clean  the staff was friendly and the location was perfect  We would definitely stay here again  
P =>  Convenient and clean We were looking for a cheap hotel to stay in for   night on route from Liverpool   Brussels via Eurostar  We had looked on the usual travel websites but could find nothing at a price we liked  We came across the Alhambra via Google Earth and were pleased we made the choice to stay there  It was relatively cheap   London prices   clean  comfortable and excellently placed for an early morning check in to Eurostar  We were in a slightly bizarrely laid out basement room  room     in the building opposite the main hotel building  but we had a clean shower  toilet  washbasin and double bed  The room looked onto a brick wall but we didn t mind as we didn t hear too much traffic noise  or indeed noise from other guests  Breakfast was included in the price and we found service at breakfast to be swift  efficient and pleasant  I had the cooked breakfast and found it to be of a good standard  We especially liked the area the hotel was in  walking away from St Pancras towards Russell Square are some nice roads that had a sort of villagey feel with a good mix of pubs  bars and restaurants  There is also an excellent arthouse cinema   The Renoir  about    minutes walk away  I would definitely recommend this hotel as a brief stopping off point if you are using Eurostar  
P =>   Excellent value service and location I can t believe the two previous posters were staying at the same hotel  This is a budget hotel and offers a basic service which represents very good value for money  Our twin room   in the annexe across the road   was very clean with comfy beds  and a phone   With two locked doors at the front  plus our own door  we had no worries about security  and it was very quiet  Our  st floor room had a large window which you could open a good way to give good ventilation  Yes  the room was very small but we didn t spend much time there The staff were extremely friendly and courteous   we arrived at       and were able to check in straight away  The breakfast was fine  and the waitresses offered tea coffee or hot chocolate  They were happy for us to leave our luggage there for the day when we checked out  It s a great location   a couple of minutes from St Pancras Kings Cross and the underground with a grocery and lots of places to eat nearby If people want air conditioning  more towels and fancy toiletries they must expect to pay more I would certainly use the hotel again  
P =>  Excellent Hotel for Price We stayed for three nights with Hotel Alhambra after reading reviews on Trip Advisor  The hotel is in a nice area close to the london metro  We found the staff  run by a family  very pleasant and our room super clean   The non ensuite room we had was small  as expected  but its soundproof walls and soft bed made it a perfect refuge at the end of the day  There was free wifi and cable TV in our room  making keeping in touch with the world easy  The bathrooms were literally two doors down the hall from our own  and since there were two toilets and two showers for our floor  we never had to wait to use them  This is the only hotel we have ever booked without an ensuite bathroom  and we didn t miss a thing The breakfast was incredible  the best we have had in our travels to London  A full English breakfast with coffee tea was perfect before a long day of site seeing  The staff were super friendly and accommodating  we were able to get breakfast a little early due to our early departure   Overall  we highly recommend this hotel as a superb value for money  
P =>  Very comfortable Husband and I stayed here   night as we had an early eurostar train next day  The room was very small  Barely room to move around beds  in fact I caught my toe on one of the bed legs and it was sore for several days We have stayed in Kings Cross before in nearby property and room was a much better size  However  the beds at Alhambra were extremely comfortableShower was good  We appreciated tea coffee making facilities  Breakfast was excellent  and service very quick  The staff were very friendly   Would definately stay here again in spite of sore toe  
P =>   Great Location My boyfriend and I stayed at the Alhambra for   nights at the beginning of our   week tour of Europe  The location is great  The rooms a little small  but with good closet space  The breakfast is filling and shower hot  A great place to stay on a budget  
P =>   Good value friendly staff at the Alhambra I had room number     across the street in no    argyle st  and although it was very small it was comfortable and had a modern lcd tv  tea coffee making facilities Breakfast was ok  full english or cereal   but the B amp B s strongest point is the friendly staff  The French lady who seems to run the place is particularly nice  as is the chef  whom I suspect to be more than that  who kindly took my key this morning when reception was closed So if you are in town for a short visit and you re on a budget  you can t go wrong with the Alhambra Oh  and book directly with them for best prices  They don t take Amex so have another card ready  although there is a    charge anyway  
P =>   A nice hotel perfect for London My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for   nights  and it was perfect  The location was excellent  as it was easy to find when coming out of the train station and it was right next to the underground  They sent us across the road to the Argyll  not sure if this is still part of the hotel but it was nice anyway  The room was quite small but with it being just the two if us we didn t need a lot of space  We didn t have an excellent view since we were kind of in the basement but it didn t bother us  we didn t plan on looking out of the window all weekend  You can hear some banging doors and trains passing but it s really not a problem  it won t keep you awake  One thing i liked about the room is that it was very bright and cheerful  and very clean  The bed was quite comfy  and the room had an LCD TV with freeview  which was an added bonus  The staff were very pleasant and breakfast set us up for the day  Overall  it s a lovely hotel in an excellent location  It cost us around      each for the   nights for an ensuite double room  and although I found other hotels which were a similar price or cheaper  the reviews I had read didn t even compare with the Alhambra  and I see why  I would definitely recommend this hotel  although the small size of the rooms might be a problem for families or large groups of travellers  
P =>  Great Hotel This is just a great little hotel  It is small  but clean and the people are very friendly The full English breakfast is very good and if you don t like your eggs in the morning there is toast en a array of cereal you can choose from Kings Cross and Pancras Station are around the corner so you can take any train or subway from there and you don t have to carry your suitcase all over town   very good if you are traveling from or to Luton airport  
P =>   Budget hotel thats quality We ve stayed in quite a few budget hotels in London and a lot of them are awful  Not the Alhambra though  The hotel is very clean and tidy  that was my first impression  Ok the rooms are not the biggest but there comfortable  One word of caution though  If you stay on the  st floor the toilets and showers are situated on the  nd floor but these again are clean and the shower had really nice hot water One of the best bits about the Alhambra  apart from the     per night for a double  is their breakfast  It really is excellent  You can have a full english or continental  As its situated in Kings Cross its near to all the attractions to  
P =>   great location great people My family and I first stayed here on holiday three years ago  Since then I ve stayed here on business trips when needing a cheap  cheerful place to sleep   It s not a multi star business hotel  of course   no phones in the rooms  although who uses those now when we all have mobiles anyway   The owners clearly love their work and go out of their way to make their guests as comfortable as possible  Breakfasts are good   indeed reviews of thier breakfasts on TripAdvisor helped us make the original decision to stay here  It s a great location  and getting better  the Eurostar terminal one minute s walk away  a quiet street  and I ve noticed fewer drunks in the street in the evenings than when we first stayed  the local authorities are cleaning the area up  The price isn t rock bottom but it s far and away the best value I ve found in London  I was happy to stay with my wife and teenage daughters here three eyars ago  don t get me wrong about the drunks in the street  and find the smaller single rooms just as good  
P =>  Loved the Alhambra Hotel I have just returned from traveling to Europe with my    year old grandmother  We stayed at the hotel numerous times during our trip   while sightseeing in London  when returning from visiting family up north  and again when returning from Paris  It was an excellent stay  The location was perfect for us  It is only a block from King s Cross  Euston and St  Pancras Stations  The rooms were very clean and the breakfast was wonderful  The owners were very kind to us  and very helpful  They tried to always give us a room on one of the lower floors  so my grandmother wouldn t have to climb very many stairs  They also called a taxi for us when needed  and let us keep our suitcases there after checkout time  The rooms are small  but we expect that in Europe  The price and location were excellent  Most importantly  it was clean  I would definately stay here again  There are some pubs right around the corner and other restaurants nearby Lisa Hegg 
P =>  London the Second Time Around We arrived at the Alhambra Hotel very early after our overseas flight  around      am  They were in the middle of serving breakfast  but still took the time to make us feel welcome  allowing us to put our bags in our room before it was cleaned  When we came back from our  quot pinch me  I m in London quot  walk around noon  the room was cleaned and ready for our   hour nap  The room was spare  but clean and serviceable  just as we expected from other reviews  The limited space is really not a problem in a city like London  where you tend to be very busy with sightseeing all day  every day  The staff was very friendly and accomodating  The breakfasts were filling and tasty  The location couldn t have been better  We took the First Capital Connect train from Gatwick and departed at St  Pancras  a stone s throw from the hotel and half the price of the Gatwick Express  The tube entrance is a block away with quick access to the rest of London  I doubt if there are too many better options at this price in this great city  
P =>  Book This Adorable Place   If   you want to share a room with someone for a CHEAP rate in London  this is the place  We are a couple who shared the room  and we had everything we needed for a private space  simple accomodation  modest living  bathroom SHARED across the hallway  Who needs a private bathroom anyway when you barely spend ANY time in the hotel  only just before and after bedtime If   you need something close to PANCRAS Station or King s Cross Tube  this is the place  We saved all the time in the world by arriving  dropping our things down  and not wasting a second to get out to discover the city  To catch an EARLY morning departure from London  this was two steps from the station  and we woke up a half an hour before leaving Breakfast    to   am  is a stellar introduction to a typical English breakfast  with an egg  sausage  ham  beans  plenty of toast  varied jams  orange juice  coffee  tea  and hot chocolate  or  the choice of a continental breakfast  assorted box cereals  muesli granola  weetabox   The staff is so welcoming and helpful  such as when we had to leave at six am  we were still offered fresh coffee and tea to go with the early rising staff member who let us into the dining area before it even opened  
P =>  I would recommend the Alhambra to my best friend I have been staying at the Alhambra every time I go to London for the last seven yearsit is always clean and the Valottti family always friendly and helpfulvery good value for moneyBeryl tyn 
P =>  lovely breakfast  Hotel very clean  hosts very friendly  let us leave luggage there for the day because we had to check out at   am  beautiful breakast  child friendly    will be going back very soon       
P =>   Excellent Value Hotel The Alhambra Hotel is situated about    metres down Argyle Street  directly opposite St Pancras Station  and coming from Leicester into St Pancras couldn t have been more convenient My partner and I stayed at the hotel   nd and   rd uary     Staff at the reception were friendly and efficient  Our room was in a building across the street  The room was clean with a narrow en suite bathroom containing a toilet and fibre glass cubicle shower  both worked fine  The basin was in the main part of the room which also contained a double and single bed and melamine bedroom furniture  There was a small kettle with tea  coffee and UHT pots of milk  Breakfast was in the basement of the main hotel across the road between   and  am  The breakfast room was clean and bright with very efficient service  Breakfast consisted of orange juice  choice of cereals  a full english breakfast  bacon  egg  sausage  beans and tomato  which was very well cooked  toast and a choice of tea or coffee  We were offered more toast and tea coffee Any negatives  Not really  my partner would have liked   towels instead of the one each supplied  one for her hair  and semi skimmed UHT milk pots rather than full fat For        per night each  the Alhambra was an excellent base for us to explore London from and we would stay there again  
P =>   very good hotel great place Stayed there with my friend   nights in        The hotel is clean  personn are very sympatics  breakfast is great  Our room is tiny but if it s just for sleeping  Great place  This hotel is very good for the price  
P =>  Very clean and very nice localization  Stayed there with my husband for   nights in december       The hotel is very clean  with towels replaced everyday  with clean bathrooms  we had room without bathroom inside  and a very good english breakfast  It s located a few meters from King s Cross St Pancreas station  so we had the underground and trains very near us and there are a lot of buses either  
P =>   Loved the Breakfast  Pros  The English Breakfast  Very close to the Tube stop  staff are extremely friendly  close to restaurants pubsCons  The rooms are small  no elevators  
P =>   what a nce stay my husband and I were looking for somewhere to stay for one night only as a stop off on our way to a few days in brighton  We have stayed in the area before and where unable to book into the usual B amp B but found the Alhambra on the net  Once I checked the trip advisor and read the many positive comments I booked  we were not disappointed  The room was a double en suite which was very clean and large enough for the two of us  The staff were very helpful from the moment we booked in to the time we checked out and allowed us to leave our suitcase to collect later in the day  The breakfast was more than enough to set us up for the day  and when served was very hot therefore we assumed was freshly made for each visitor  The Alhambra is within easy reach of Kings Cross station and tube which means London is on the door step  would recomment this hotel and would be the first place i try when visiting London again  
P =>   Comfortable convenient and friendly We have now stayed at the Alhambra Hotel on   separate visits to London  Our initial visit was prompted by a recommendation in the Lonely Planet Guide  and our subsequent returns have arisen from the pleasant experiences we have had This is a basic but consistently clean  comfortable and friendly place  reasonably priced by London standards  and convenient to the Tube and St  Pancras  soon to be the terminus for the Eurostar  and attractions such as the British Museum and British Library I have had no hesitation in recommending it to friends and family and have always found it to be a perfectly decent and satisfactory base while in London  Long may it continue so  
P =>  Great hotel location has pros and cons Great hotel  staff very helpful  The breakfast is excelent The double rooms are not huge but not too small either  and in good shape  Towels are replaced every day  the hot water is good and some rooms have LCD TVs  no cable but BBC is OK  Rooms in the basement are subject to a low rumbling from the metro  Kings Cross station is at the end of the street  some    meters away   but it is not a huge problem The general location  while great because of the proximity to Kings Cross station and St  Pancras  is not very nice  with an assortment of dodgy types and homeless in the main streets  not in front of the hotel   There is very little option of dining or shopping  While staying there  the best option is to take the subway and spend your time elsewhere  but that is not in any way detrimental to the hotel itself  The proximity of such a central subway station more than compensates for the downside of the dodgy neighborhood I would stay at the Alhambra hotel again and highly recomend it  
P =>  Superior Budget Hotel  Could not ask for more The Alhambra Hotel provided me with a truly outstanding experience over a two week stay in London  After reading review after review complaining about small room sizes  I was almost expecting to live in a closet  but my room  Which was located in the annex across the street  the ground floor room facing the street  had a nice big bed  a couple of end tables  a desk  and a wardrobe  and was quite comfortable even when I had other people in the room to chat The bathroom only had a shower in it  and a toilet facing the shower  it was very small for a bathroom  but I was perfectly comfortable  and the shower worked great  The sink was located outside of the bathroom  next to the desk  There was a TV in the room  but it only got basic cable  Overall  the room was simple  but clean and extremely comfortable As far as the noise situation goes  there is no room in the Alhambra  at least not in the annex  between my friends and I I had the opportunity to see a room at the back of the annex in the basement  at the back of the annex on the first floor  and at the front of the annex on the ground floor  but frankly  if you want to escape noise in London  you better be ready to shell out more than    pounds a night  You do  however  have options as to which noise you want to hear  In the basement  you will hear the tube passing beneath you  Facing the street  you ll hear  surprise  the street  and facing the back of the annex higher up  you will hear the schoolyard of the school next door  Personally  I d go with the street  It s not very busy  really The real perk to this hotel  though  is the LOCATION  You are literally   minute away from Kings Cross Station  one of the major connection points of the tube line  as well as the national rail services  This made getting around the city a complete breeze  rarely did we need to take a connecting train  This location also provides you with a straight connection to Heathrow  though navigating Kings Cross with giant bags at rush hour is not at all something I recommend In addition to the location and the budget price of    pounds a night  the hotel provides even more perks  Free Wi fi  if you re in range of the router  ground and first floor were  no luck in the basement  though the connection will go down occasionally  Also  the full English breakfast  coffee  tea  orange juice  toast  baked beans  fried eggs  bacon  and tomato  every day  but after two weeks it still tasted good to me  is really filling and more than the usual cereal juice option of most London hotels  Though they offer that too Is it any surprise  after all I ve said  that I recommend the Alhambra hotel to anybody looking for a cheap hotel option  I really  wholeheartedly encourage you to pick the Alhambra  
P =>  Nice place    I stayed there for   nights in ust      in a twin bedroom  without showers and toilets  with my brother and we had a really good time  The staff was really nice and the breakfast was good  The clean towels everyday was a good attention  We havent use the underground once during our stay since everything was within walking distance  Sure the rooms weren t big but it was alright for two  The bathrooms and toilets were always really clean  We really enjoyed our stay  
P =>   No frills value accomodation Stayed here for a   night stay in e       Mainly chose the accomodation as we were looking for somewhere cheap enough that was well located  It is as well located in london central as you will get without paying a small fortune   across the street from Kings Cross tube station I had read the reviews beforehand so thought I knew what to expect and we are not fussy travellers who expect much at all  It was a bit of a funny place   to use the word quot hotel quot  is probably stretching it a bit It is more like a fancy hostel  Every bit of space is used  If you are claustrophic this is not the place for you  The halls and walkways are so narrow that even a skinny person like me was surprised  If you were any way a big person this is not the place for you  When we got into our room I thought there was no ensuite which I had booked  But what looked like a wardrobe door  led into the ensuite  It was the smallest bathroom I have ever been in  There wasnt room to turn around in it  I m sure it was a converted closet The room looked like the pics on the internet   cheap and cheerful looking  small  but adequate  No hairdryers or any other facilities in the rooms either  The place was clean  and no complaints with the staff or the service  The breakfast was also more than fine  It was busy place and booked out the   nights we were there  Pick it if you really dont want any frills at all  It is not the place for a romantic trip to london  
P =>   Excellent hotel with excellent service   This hotel was fantastic  It is right near Kings Cross train and Tube station  There is a train direct from Gatwick Airport to Kings Cross  which is nice and convenient  and being near a Tube station in London  means you re near all the sights and attractions  no matter which Tube station it is  It is a highly efficient means of transport  The hotel was clean  and my room  on the top floor  was quiet  I had my own shower  but shared toilet  but had no problems with this  The service and the people working at this hotel are what make it exceptional  in my opinion  I arrived without my backpack  The family  who runs this hotel  were kind enough to to repeatedly call the Baggage Claims at the aiport to find out about the status on my bags  Despite the fact that we never did manage to actually speak to someone over the course of the two days we kept trying to call  they kept calling for me  When the bag actually did arrive  the night before I was leaving this hotel  Bruno actually hauled it up   flights of stairs for me  Sonia  Bruno and tine are just fantastic people and I cannot recommend this hotel enough  because the staff is outstanding  The breakfast was fantastic  and a good way to start your day  Within walking distance to the British Musem and the British Library  where they have a copy of the Magna Carta and many other amazing documents  I highly recommend this hotel   
P =>   Excellent place to stay and super convenient  I booked the hotel a few weeks before arriving in London and the woman taking the reservations was very friendly and cheerful  I was a little worried at first about booking a place near King s Cross because of the many rumors I ve heard about it being an  quot undesireable quot  area  and with just me and my   year old traveling  I thought about spending a little more ina known  safer area  BUT with money tight  I booked the Alhambra  When we got there  it was not at all the  quot undesirable quot  area that I had imagined  It was safe to walk out at night and it literally is just a hop  skip and a jump to King s Cross   St  Pancras station  where you can take six different ines to wherever you want to go in London and the outskirts   There s a Burger King a few feet away from the hotel for those who crave American fast food  but I would go with the scrumptious fish and chips place not too far from the hotel  It s a bit of a walk  but not a hike  and well worth it The staff at Alhambra Hotel were very kind and friendly  The rooms are very clean and although small  it s big enough to feel comfortable in  especially if you re only there to sleep  The only downside is that there are no elevators  lifts   so if you ge a room on the third floor  like we did   then it s a hike  I had injured my knee not long before the trip  so it was excrutiating  Morning of the third day there  I gave up and told the hotel staff about my injury and he worked to find us a first floor room  The place was fully booked but I got lucky and got a room that evening  The English breakfastis the same every morning   eggs over easy  bacon  sausage  beans and toast  but it was really good  I certainly didn t mind having it everyday  There is also cereal for those who prefer to eat light in the morning  The hotel really has a family run atmosphere and my son and I really loved it there  One day  when we scrape up enough to go back to England  we ll be staying at the Alhambra again  
P =>   Great Experience I stayed at the Alhambra hotel for   nights this past week and must say that the previous reviews are on target  I was pleased to see that cleanliness was not compromised for the affordable rates as it is quite high on my list of must haves  I stayed in a single room on the top floor  The shower and toilet were on the same floor and maintained in good condition  The room was cleaned daily and a clean towel provided  The breakfast in the AM was very satisfying  cereal  toast  OJ and a pot of coffee tea for those of us who like the continental breky  An English breky is also an option  The coffee was nice and strong as it should be    There are no phones in the rooms but messages are delivered very quickly should anyone call for you at the office  Couldn t ask for a better location  Located a block across from Kings Cross train station which is a major hub for getting around London and the outskirts  
P =>   Clean and practical     not glamorous Not a glamorous hotel by any means  The rooms and hallways are small and the shared showers and toilets are not on every floor  However  the place was very clean  everything worked and the staff were all nice to deal with  The location  directly opposite St Pancras station  made it easy to get about the city  Nights were quite noisy  we were on the first floor and over looked the street  but that goes with the busy location  Rooms higher up or on the rear of the hotel would be quieter I guess A good  practical hotel if you are wanting a clean and comfortable place to sleep and good value for London The National Library is a couple of hundred metres from the hotel and British museum and Russell square are a pleasant walking distance  
P =>  good location Stayed here last week for two nights  Although the room was on the top floor  no lifts  it was clean  comfortable and spacious with fresh towels being provided daily  Breakfast served over the road was good and set us up well for a day of sightseeing   full English provided as well as Continental   the most delicious porridge served with honey and cinammon                Staff friendly and helpful  Only criticism would be tha it was not possible to have both cereal and cooked breakfast  Handy for tube etc  
P =>   great choice for short stay Stayed in the Alhambra for one night with my sister last week while on a short break in London  We booked a twin  ensuite room for one night  We were accommodated in the Argyle Hotel directly across the road from the Alhambra itself  The very pleasant girl who checked us in referred to it as the annexe  Breakfast was served in the dining room of the Alhambra  Our room was spotlessly clean and airy  We were assigned a triple room for two so we had very adequate space It might be a tight squeeze for three people staying for a long period or for those with lots of luggage The breakfast was very substantial  freshly cooked and produced in a very short time  We did not leave London until  pm that evening and it was great to leave our bags in the breakfast room while we were out and about This hotel was exactly what we wanted for our short stay and represented very good value for money  I reckon many others think likewise as the hotel was full  We paid     for the room booked via the hotel website  We recieved a very clear map detailing directions to the hotel with our confirmation email  I would recommend this hotel to others and have no hesitation staying there again  
P =>   Exactly As Advertised Prior to the internet I don t know how anyone ever booked a hotel in Europe without getting a  quot Fawlty Towers quot  experience  With the plethora of reviews on the internet these days there is no excuse to end up in a bad hotel in a bad location  All it takes is some time and due diligence and anyone can find a nice hotel that meets their needs My wife and I stayed at the Alhambra Hotel in London for four nights at the end of ch       If you are looking for the Ritz Carlton at the Alhambra  you better look elsewhere  However  if you are looking for a clean  budget friendly hotel in a good location  look no further than the Alhambra  We really enjoyed our stay at the Alhambra  Being from the US  we had a hard time coming to grips with how absurdly small our room was  but from what we understand  almost all hotels in London are like this  However  the room was very tidy  cleaned every day and they provided fresh towels every day  The bed was very firm  but comfortable and plenty long enough even for me and I am     quot  tall  We had a sub street level room  but we never felt unsafe and only a couple of times were we disturbed by noise on the street Another positive of the Alhambra is the location  It is about   blocks from the Thameslink Station which connects to Gatwick Airport via First Capitol Connect  It is also about one block from the King s Cross St  Pancras Underground Station which connects to just about every Underground line in London  This made it very easy to get around London and to all major tourist attractions  While some people think the area is somewhat dodgy we never had any problems A third positive was the full English Breakfast that came with the room  It was delicious and very filling and a great way to start the day while enjoying some tea and reading the paper While our overall experience was very positive  there are a few issues some travelers may need to consider before staying at the Alhambra  The first is there are no elevators lifts in the hotel  If you are elderly  handicapped  or travel with lots of luggage  this could present a problem  The second was with the bathroom in our room  It was so small there was almost no room between the toilet and the sink  For larger  elderly or handicapped persons this may present a problem  Also the mirror above the sink was about chest high for me so I had to lean over to the side to shave or comb my hair  Finally  the shower had very little water pressure and the water out of the shower head hit me below the chest  which made it somewhat diffifcult to wash my hair Due to our research on Trip Advisor and other web sites  we knew about these few negatives so we were not shocked when we got to our room My overall experience at the Alhambra was very positive  As this was our first trip to London we sort of expected the worst  but were very happy there  If you are looking for an affordable B amp B in London  do not hesitate to book the Alhambra  but do know there are some negatives with the rooms  
P =>  great hotel i ve stayed   night at alhambra hotel the   of april      i was in room    in argyle hotel part of alhambra  it s the building in front of alhambra hotel the room is at the ground floor  just on left of the entrance the room was veeeeeeryyyyyyyyyyyy clean  nice  not enormous but enough space    a normal room for london standard the toilet was tiny but no problems at all  an ok shower the hotel is very close to st  pancreas as you an see in my pic  so very close to underground  the street is quiet   only hotels breakfast room is on the alhambra part   it is excellent  and huge  if you want english breakfast  i confirm the pics of previous reviewers  a bit poor for continental breakfast  only cereals and toast with jam  but ok very kind personal  i asked for   slices of bacon instead of a sausage and no problems at all only a little problem for the room  the roof of my room was thin so i can hear perfectly every step of people above  but i think that that day people above were   very huge persons     no complaints at all  a nice  great hotel i ll come back for sure    
P =>   Great breakfast  The hotel lies very close to King s Cross S t Pancras underground station so it is easy to access from airport or train  It is central London so the nights are not quiet  lots police cars and ambulances  but that what you can expect i central London The rooms are small but coosy and contains what you need  a clean comfortable bed  water zink  closett and TV Cleaning is excellent  bed is made everyday and fresh towels on the bed every afternoon Toilets and showers are clean and in good working order Breakfast i continental or english  if you take the later on no lunch is neede until   pm  Very nice The staff is cheerful  nice and service minded  Always availelble when you need them Summary  A small  quite cheap hotel in central London with excellent service and facilities and close to underground station  Well worth a stay  
P =>   Great For a Budget Trip Stayed here for a saturday night         Arrived at      am expecting to store our bags for the day while we went off to explore the big smoke   But No they gave us a room straight away       The room was small but adequate had TV  sink  wardrobe  and double bed  what more do you want for     and you get Breky in the morning    FULL ENGLISH    area is great easy to get anywhere by tube  a minutes walk away and the neighbourhood seemed fine even at midnight when we ambled back  They even stored our bags on the sunday after we checked out so we could explore some more  Very Good Value  The Ritz it aint A BARGAIN it is       
P => Makes You feel right at home  I have Just booked for Yet another stay at this very pleasent hotel  Nothing can beat this hotel when it comes to value for money  A friendly atmosphere  very clean rooms and a super english breakfast   all for a very favourable prize   makes this my first choice for a stay in London  Although in a busy part of the town  the small street is surprisingly quiet and very pleasant  Just now the confirmation on my reservation came trough  Looking forward to the Valoti family s hospitality again  A happy traveller from Bergen  Norway  
P =>  A great find The Alhambra absolutely lives up to what it advertises  Clean  pleasant rooms  excellent breakfast  very friendly staff and management  Ideal location to get to just about anywhere easily  I was in a very quiet and peaceful room and really enjoyed my   nights  My son and husband came after christmas for a short break and I was confident that they would be absolutely fine here   and they were  
P =>   Alll you need when staying in London This hotel was perfect for our needs in London  Our room was small but we didn t come here to spend our time in our room  it had a sink  a soft bed  tv  and it was clean Good English breakfast to start the day  Close to the Underground and train station  And a very nice staff  My only complaint would have been that the one of the showers didn t have hot water  Other than that great for the price  
P =>  Wonderful small hotel in London  This was a great place  The hotel is just steps away from the Euston Rd entrance of King s Cross  We walked over and asked how we should get our enormous number of bags over there  and staff advised us just to borrow a trolley from the station  We were certainly a sight     huge bags    backpacks  and a baby    but we made it  The hotel is a great location for transport options all around   we hopped on and off the Tube for the whole trip  and this is a safe  comfortable neighbourhood  Lots of restaurant options around  even though we couldn t enjoy the pubs with our baby  The double ensuite room itself was small but very clean  amp  comfortable  Luckily we were placed on the ground floor of the Argyle Hotel extension  across the street   and we managed to fit the   of us plus the bags no problem  The shower was tiny but worked very well The breakfast was excellent  and everyone was very friendly  We will definitely stay here again  Two thumbs up Johanna 
P =>   Friendly and welcoming Stayed with my grandson in y     Clean and airey twin ensuite room with comfortable beds  Asked for extra pillows and they arrived within   mins  Breakfast was in the hotel opposite and there was a good selection of starters  We both had full English and were very satisfied  Would recomend and gladly stay again  
P =>   Delicious Breakfast This was a great value hotel  The location was excellent   super close to the subway and to the station for north bound trains  The breakfast was spectacular   full English breakfast but they modified it on request  I got two rashers of bacon instead of sausages   The rooms were tiny   but well equipped  We shared a toilet and shower with other floors  Everything was clean and comfortable and I would say the Alhambra is excellent value for your money  
P =>   overall good experiance stayed in a quad  triple  double room all in one week  the quad was tiny with an even smaller bathroom which almost made us shift out  but glad we stayed bcos the triple with   single beds and seperate shower and toilet was great and so was the double  the valotis who run the place were very helpful  english breakfast was good  if u made it before   a m  or they let u take cereal juice back to ure room    super clean white sheets  location was fab really few mins walk from kings cross st and felt safe with people around till late night  overall good value for money  
P =>   great value  I booked a single room here for four nights based solely on the reviews I read on TripAdvisor com  I wasn t disappointed I only wanted a bare bones room  and I was willing to share a toilet and shower with others in order to reduce costs  My main concern was getting a clean hotel with helpful employees  I m kind of amazed that I got all that  plus breakfast  for    pounds a night  And on top of that  the hotel was only a block from the King s Cross tube station  The neighborhood was far from glamorous  but it never felt unsafe to me  even after dark  Besides  with the tube station being so close  time spent in the King s Cross neighborhood was limited  It s not like I had to walk for    minutes through the area just to get to the tube Because I arrived at the hotel a few hours before check in began  my room wasn t ready yet  They allowed me to stash my suitcase in the office while I went sight seeing  and when the room was ready  they went ahead and took my bag up there for me  so it was waiting for me when I returned  That was a nice touch My room was small  but very clean  It was tidied every day while I was gone  at that time I was also given a fresh towel and fresh linens  The bed was more comfortable than I expected it to be  and I was happy to have a sink and a TV in my room The shared toilet and shower cubicles were quite small as well  but both were always clean Breakfast was surprisingly filling  I could choose between a continental breakfast  eggs  sausage  etc  or cereal and toast  Service was very fast and friendly  The dining area isn t huge  so I did have to share a table one day with another guest  but that didn t bother me The hotel was pleasantly quiet when I was there  Sometimes I d hear doors slam  but there were no issues with loud TVs  loud voices  etc  And although I slept with my window open every night  I wasn t bothered by outside noises  I heard some sirens and occasionally I heard the traffic  but it was nothing disruptive   But then again  I was on the top floor  which may have muted the traffic noises  And my apartment is on busy road  so I ve gotten good at tuning out traffic noises  The only drawbacks    The toilet on my floor was very difficult to flush  I think it was either broken or close to breaking    I don t know if this was the case for all their showers  but the water pressure in my shower was awful  My hair s thick  so it took ages to wash all the shampoo out of it    There s an added charge for paying by credit card Other things to consider    The hallways and stairwells are rather narrow  and there is no elevator  so if you ve got a lot of luggage  you might have trouble maneuvering your bags    The hotel only provides one towel  so make sure you pack a wash rag and a shampoo towel  if you use them  Honestly  I had a great experience at the Alhambra and I d stay there again in a heartbeat  Unlike many budget hotels  it s owned and operated by a single family  I wasn t dealing with anonymous hotel employees who hate their jobs and therefore feel nothing but apathy toward their guests  The owners weren t nameless and faceless  they were the ones checking me in and out  cleaning my room  serving me breakfast  And they did so in a way that was warm and polite  
P =>   just fine We stayed here for   nights  The room we had was very small  but the bed was nice and the shower as well  The toilet was outside the room  but the corridor was very small as well so we had the toilet right around the corner  The rooms are cleaned every day and the english breakfast is very good  Yes the rooms are small  but what do you expect for this price  The beds are comfy and everything is clean  so what more do you need  You are out all day anyway probably  I will stay here again  
P =>   Nice hotel After reading the mostly positive reviews I settled on this hotel  I stayed there y              Check in was really quick and I was taken to their other hotel across the street   Argyle  My room was double room ensuite on the street level  facing street  The room was very clean and perfect for me  although it might feel a bit tight for   people with large bags  Towels and toiletries were changed every day  I stayed there during the week of the heatwave  and it was rather uncomfortable as there was no air con  I spoke to management about the heat but we were all suffering together and there didn t seem to be much that could be done  Having said that does not imply they were unhelpful  they were  My shower door would not close completely and I told them on my way out one day  When I came back it was fixed and they checked later with me if it was all right  Also  there were no phones in the room  although there was a telecom  which didn t work   and they would come and get me each time I had a call in the office  It was a bit incovenient being across the street  but I appreciated that they went to the trouble at all and not just insist on taking messages when they knew I was in  As the Kings Cross area is usually busy  I expected some noise from that end at night  but I had no problems from that end as the street was quiet  However  the noise arrived next door  the next night  thanks to some construction going on all night  A van would pull up and as my window was right close to the street I was privy to every sound  tools  conversation  banging doors  the like  This went on for about two nights  My first night was quiet  so this was a bit of surprise  I did ask for another room but the hotel was fully booked for the rest of my stay  I had the breakfast twice  which was fine and filling  Heatwave and construction noise woes notwithstanding  I m likely stay here again if I need to be in the Kings Cross area  as was the case this time  I would ask for a room on a higher floor and facing the back  though  The location is great   very easy to get everywhere on the tube from Kings Cross St  Pancras St  The staff is very friendly and I liked that they kept an eye out for me as I was travelling alone  
P =>  Good and bad Stayed for almost a week in a double ensuite room PLUS  bathroom is bigger than another B amp B down the same street  check in was quick and pleasant  great location  TVMINUS  breakfast was EITHER full English breakfast OR cereal  At other places  we could have the full English breakfast AND cereal  water pressure in the shower is terrible  you wait to be seated for breakfast  failing which  you get a muffled mumbling from the hostINFO  bacon and sausages are microwaved  rooms have no airconditioning  room is serviced everyday but towels and bathmats are the same cloths    so you do find some towels yellowish 
P =>   Nice hotel but beware of road construction My husband and I stayed in this hotel for one night on y   th  We had a double room and used the shared bathroom shower  Staff was very accommodating and cheerful  Rooms were clean  as were the shared bathroom shower  I never had to wait to use the bathroom  and there were two toilets  amp  showers on our floor  Our room was very clean  and had a tv  sink and cabinet where we could hang clothes  Breakfast was good  especially considering the price  They offered a variety of cold cereal  and also a full English breakfast My only complaint is that our room faced the street  and there was a lot of noise  so I would suggest requesting a room facing the back if possible  Also  there is road construction going on in the area  and  unlike here in the States  they do not stop working at   or  pm  They worked all through the night and we got very little sleep  Jackhammering at  am   So if you are thinking about staying here anytime soon  I would definately ask if the construction is still going on Only a short block away from Kings Cross station  Also close by  within   blocks  is a tourist info kiosk  which offers pay phones  money exchange  which had better rates than the airport  and charged no commission   and a person that can help you book tickets to various events attractions  Also close by is an internet cafe  a laundrymat  and several stores and restaurants  McDonalds  amp  Burger King are just around the corner If you are looking for a good budget hotel  I don t think you can beat Alhambra  I would definatley stay there again  
P =>  Good Value Stayed there for six days  Our room was in the basement  but other than that the room was nice staff were all friendly  Location was ideal for our needs  near our son s college dorm  and within a   minutes walk to King s Cross Station which made travel easy  King s Cross is also a major hub for trains traveling to other parts of England  We caught our train to Scotland there  For you bibliophiles  the British Library is a short walk  About    minutes away is a supermarket  I would stay there again  
P =>   I d not stay anywhere else I ve been coming to the Alhambra about   times a years since a friend recommended it the year before last  and can t imagine staying anywhere else  Those there are friendly and personable  the place is clean and tidy  and the breakfasts are exceptional  I couldn t imagine staying anywhere else when I m in London         
P =>  Great Budget Hotel in London   Just had the pleasure of staying at the Alhambra Hotel for    nights at the end of e  I booked it based on reviews on tripadvisor com and I was not disappointed LocationThe hotel is just steps away from Kings Cross making it very easy to get to  Kings Cross tube is acessible  meaning there are lifts and escalators to get you from the train to the street   Being on such a central stop was ideal for touring around London RoomsVery small but adequate  The wireless internet is a huge bonus as are the TVs  It was really warm when I was there     C  and the rooms were warm at day s end but as long as I left the window open for a breeze it was fine at night StaffThe staff are absolutely wonderful at this hotel  I was staying at the Alhambra while I was in the process of moving to London  They were always checking up on me   quot how s the flat search going  quot    stored my second suitcase downstairs the entire time I was there and were generally kind and wonderful CleanlinessNo complaints  The rooms are cleaned every day  The bathroom was very clean as were the communal showers  The showers weren t luxurious but the water was hot  they were clean and quite frankly what do you expect at a budget hotel ValueExcellent value  The breakfast is great   you can specialize it if you for example don t like beans and they will gladly give you an extra egg or something else  The breakfast was very filling and a great way to start the day  At    pounds for single  shared bathroom shower  in London  you can t go wrong ComplaintsThe only problem I had was that they made a mistake with my booking and I had to move rooms twice  tho they were very nice and apologetic about it and I was upgraded in each room I had   The bonus is I saw three different rooms  the double room on the top floor was my favourite  although it was a small inconvenience packing my things three times  If you are booked for a longer stay  I was there for    nights  perhaps you d want to email a quick confirmation before you leave to ensure that they have you booked in for one room Overall I think this is a great hotel  Its not the Ritz so don t expect that and if you are light sleeper  for heaven s sake  bring earplugs     I slept like a log and it was a really nice introduction to London  
P => Best budget option around  I stayed with my boyfriend at the Alhambra hotel for six nights in e  We were both very pleased  It took not more than a minute to walk to King s Cross tube station  the room was very neat and clean  the breakfast was great and kept us full for a long time  staff was friendly and helpful  Having chosen a room with shower and WC outside the room  we were a bit worried that we would have to face dirty showers and toilets that were always occupied  However  that was not the case  Both showers and wc s were really clean and there were always at least one vacant toilet  so no problem with that  Only negatives were that the pressure in the showers was a bit low  and  due to the hot weather  the room got quite hot at night  so we had to sleep with the window open  This made our nights pretty noisy  but we had no problem sleeping even so  We had a room facing towards the street  and I m sure that a room with window on the back of the house would be much quieter  Overall  we are really happy having stayed at the Alhambra Hotel  and will definitely stay there again next time we visit London  
P =>  The greatest  I travelled with a friend to London for the first time e   to           We were on a tight budget and had pretty low expectations regarding our hotel  Our expectations were totally blown away by the Alhambra  The room was super clean and tidy  we stayed in a twin room with ensuite and it was exactly what we needed  The staff were extremely nice and the breakfast was great  The location was perfect  Kings Cross is literally steps away  If you are looking for a clean  safe budget hotel  the Alhambra is where its at  Save your money for the sights and shopping  
P => Great for Low Maintenance Budget Minded Travelers Staff were very friendly  a family atmosphere among them  Everything seemed very clean  even the bathrooms  considering that they re shared  They re willing to let you check in early or at least dump your bags in your room if it s still being cleaned   you also can leave your luggage in the breakfast room upon check out if you have an afternoon flight on your last day  but you ll need to wait til after the breakfast service finishes      am   Traditional English breakfast  fried egg  bacon  sausage links  beans  grilled tomato half  OJ  coffee or tea  toast  jams  If you tell the staff you don t want one part of the plate  they ll generally give you an extra egg to compensate  You may choose some boxed cereal instead  if you like Rooms are very small by American standards  don t plan on leaving your suitcases open in a corner  there s not enough room  It s less hassle to unpack a bit and use the very small bureau in the room   If you re heavy on luggage  you may not want to stay here   Tiny sink and mirror in our room  so at least you can brush your teeth  wash your face  apply make up  etc  We were on the  nd floor    WCs  toilets  and   showers  never encountered anyone else using them  water pressure and temp  were always good  Shower rooms are small  amp  basic  think of the showers at your public pool  water park  etc  Bring shower shoes  amp  your own shampoo items  and maybe a thin robe if you re worried about encountering someone in the hallway  rare   it s not a room you want to be changing your clothes in  wet   As the walls are thin and the hallways are narrow  you can hear doors opening  amp  closing  We were directly across from one of the showers  but it never bothered us  Our room faced the street  and with no AC  you ll probably want it open a bit  The noise wasn t really bad  but you might want to ask for a room that doesn t face out  just to be on the safe side  Luckily  this area doesn t seem to attract a rowdy clientele  We never had any trouble sleeping  Double bed  fairly comfortable  Felt great after trekking around all day  Hair dryer available from front desk  but all the staff is working breakfast from     am  so timing s key    small bars of soap and basic towels provided daily  No issues with our sheets  clean  amp  white Nearby  King s Cross station is the station for this hotel  so you can get your Harry Potter fix on the upper platform  The Library is about a   minute walk  free exhibit hall featuring original copies of the Magna Carta  many other rare Bibles  folios  some Beatles  doodles  etc  If you re looking for a larger  American style room  we also stayed at  quot Club Quarters quot  near St  James Cathedral  The rates are lower during the weekend  a little bit of a splurge        with VAT  with no breakfast and still no tub  It was nice  though staff are a little stiff  
P =>  Great hotel  We spent a week in Alhambra Hotel in        We loved our stay very much   Hotel is perfectly situated   two steps from King s Cross subway station and train to Luton airport  Perfect place for sightseeing all the city English breakfast was great  we ask for vegetarian version   without sausage and bacon       It prepared us perfectly for a long day touring in London Room was very clean  quiet at night  has a big comfortable bed and TV  And all this in extremely low price   only    pounds per night for a double room The owners of the Alhambra are most pleasant and helpful people we ever met     We will recommend that hotel to our friends and surely we will return there  
P =>  Great friendly hotel My husband and I just came back from a trip to Europe  We stayed at the Alhambra on two different occasions  Both times were great  It is a family run hotel and they couldn t be more helpful  Because of construction going on in that area it was a bit difficult to find at first but it is   block away from King s Cross station and very close to everything  The rooms are small but very clean and the breakfast included is great  The only downside is the steep small stairs one has to climb with luggage and all  Due to the fact that it has no lift you must be able to carry your luggage up and down the stairs  This hotel was reccomended to us by a friend and we would recommend it to anyone else as well  
P =>  Good value hotel Thank s Alhambra for your hard work and low price  very comfortable bed and pillow  The breakfast and service I found to be a bonus  Very clean hotel  Close to the bus and tube  Good valueBarry and Natalie 
P => Can t find better value London is a budget nightmare but at the Alhambra you don t have to settle for second best  The staff take pride in good service and the rooms are a good standard  The free wireless internet saves you heaps on internet cafes and the cooked breakfast  available vegetarian on request  is a great bonus The bathroom and toilet always smell like bleach   you know it s clean   min walk Kings Cross St Pancras underground  Cheap chinese food nearby I don t understand the few people who have written bad reviews  If they know better value in London  they should be specific  
P => Fantastic friendly budget hotel After finding my way out of the correct exit at the new Kings Cross underground exit  I found myself    seconds away from the hotel The hotel is very well run by a lovely family  The rooms are typical small london rooms  but are immacutately clean The service from the family  Hi Sonia and baby Sofia   is excellent and hearty breakfast goes down very well Walking down the street you notice other hotels  but they were not very welcoming and looked quite dirty I would defintely recommend this well run hotel in central London  Just remember the rooms are London sizes not American I would also recommend the British Library and Museum   fantastic  
P =>  Excellent value After staying at the Travel Inn at Tower Bridge last time we were in London  my husband and I found the Alhambra to be much better value  It is in a very convenient location  Within a few minutes walk of the hotel there are several fast food places  convenience stores and ATMs for when you need something in a hurry  Each day we walked the couple of minutes to Kings Cross tube station and caught the tube  Several tube lines go through Kings Cross so it is easy to get anywhere  We also did a day trip to Cambridge on the train  which we also could catch from Kings Cross I don t know how we got so lucky  maybe because we stayed   nights  but we got a triple room on the top   rd  floor facing the street so we had two big windows  It must have been the best room in the place  We had only booked a double with ensuite requesting a quiet room  so we got very lucky  Considering how close the hotel is to busy Euston Road and Kings Cross  we found it to be very quiet at night and we slept well on the comfortable bed  I imagine a standard double room would be like any budget European hotel and only be slightly bigger than the bed  but we found our room very spacious with the extra bed in it  The bathroom is compact with just enough room for the shower and toilet  The basin is in the hotel room itself  We found it very clean and it was serviced daily  There was no phone or kettle or toaster  which was fine with us  but we liked having the little tv The breakfast was sensational  Two choices   cooked or continental  Cooked was one plate covered with an egg  bacon  a sausage  tomato and baked beans  lots of people chose not to have the beans    Continental was a choice of cereals  With both you got unlimited toast with various spreads  tea coffee and orange juice  Although you had to get up relatively early to get there  served    am   it was a great start to the day  There were a lot of French people  and other nationalities  staying there while we were there  so it was fun sitting in the busy breakfast room listening to the languages being spoken We found the service to be excellent  Always cheerful and helpful Keep in mind that the hotel is in a couple of old small multi storey buildings  so you need to be able to carry your bags up all the steps  As I said  we were on the  rd floor so that was   flights of steps  There were   rooms on each floor  Good security because you get a key to get in the front door of the building as well as the key to your room We will definitely stay there next time we re in London  Enjoy  
P => Not as good as everybody says We were greeted by an ice cold room along with a thick long black hair on the bathroom tiles and stains on the towels  The breakfast was poor in quality  Don t get me wrong here  the place is cheap  right in the centre of London and the staff is exceptionally friendly  But I have been to cleaner youth hostels with a good breakfast for a quarter of the price  
P => The best stay out of our entire vacation London was the last stop in our   week mini European vacation and my boyfriend and I wanted somewhere comfortable and pleasant to stay before our long journey back to California  Alhambra hotel made that wish come true  We stayed in room   which was a double    separate twins  with a sink for    pounds  about     USD  a night for   nights on y    and     Our room was located a little bit downstairs and faced the back of the building so our window was actually street level  The room came with a small color TV mounted on the wall  a good size closet  a dresser drawer    glass cups  and a night stand between our   twin beds  There was no fan or a c in our room but it was not necessary since the weather was partly cloudy  The hotel provides high speed internet access  a pay telephone  irons and iron boards  alarm clocks and travel adaptors upon request  from their website   Location  This place is located a block away from the King s Cross St  Pancras Station which is all west of the center of London  This is extremely convenient if you don t know your way around London  All you have to do is figure out the Underground system and walk a block to get to Alhambra  From Alhambra you can get a free tourist maps on their counter that is very detailed containing most of the street names even the smaller ones  The map only shows the west end and central London  though  There aren t many attractions nearby  The closest tourist attraction was the British Museum  which has the biggest Egyptian section that I ve ever seen  It s about a    minute walk from Alhambra and may be better than taking the tube because the tube fares for   way is pricey  especially since the Museum isn t way too far away  You can find restaurants bars and a quick mart if you walk along Euston Road  There is also an STAtravel on Euston if you are a student traveler and wanted to know what attractions you could visit or book a day tour with them  This neighborhood was pretty safe and didn t seem seedy to me at night  Alhambra is pretty close to a main street  Euston  that I wouldn t worry  Because of the recent bombing attacks at King s Cross Station  certain lines are closed which may be inconvenient to some  But you can always take a line and connect to another line  If you want to be closer to tourist attractions then I suggest planning out what you want to see and maybe centralize your location  Alhambra was more north to all of the attractions we went to see  Noise  Staying here for   nights  noise was not a problem at all  The only noise we got was from a couple of people using the toilet right next to our door at night  And since our room was at the back of the hotel  there was no noise from the main street or even the station  Everything was super quiet  almost too quiet that I turned on the TV for a little bit of noise  Cleanliness  As I had stated previously  there is a toilet right next to our door  It is very small and the hard part is trying to shut the door without your legs touching the toilet  When you do shut the door  you have a little bit more leg room  The toilet was kept clean  Around the corner to the bathroom  there are stairs to the basement that lead down to the breakfast room and a hall that leads to   showers  There are   complete bathrooms  shower  toilet  sink  and   room with just a shower  My boyfriend and I used the   complete bathrooms to take our shower  While I got hot water  my boyfriend complained that he didn t get any so he went to the other shower that did have hot water but it felt like he was in a dark cave  My shower was in the right most bathroom and it did take several minutes for the hot water to come out  This bathroom seemed the most clean and brightest out of all three rooms  Our room was clean with clean sheets and a clean bath size towel  We were also given a small bar of soap with our towel  My twin mattress was okay  I was able to feel the mattress springs but was still able to sleep soundly  They make the beds after each night but don t change the sheets  They do give another set of clean towels even though we still had our used bath towels hanging in the closet to dry  Breakfast  Breakfast is included in your bill and is served from   to   am  It is served in the dining area located downstairs  There are lots of tables giving you a clue as to how busy it can get  I suggest going down to breakfast by about  am before the masses of guests start coming down  You are seated at a table and given a small glass of room temperature orange juice  You have your choice of the English breakfast or Continental breakfast  The English breakfast comes with a sunny side up egg  bacon  grilled half tomato  sausage  and beans  The Continental breakfast is cereal and you choose from a variety of individual size cereal boxes  You are asked whether you want tea or coffee  There is room temperature milk already on the table  a bowl of sugar for your tea coffee  and butter and jam for you numerous halved slices of toast  If you ve finished all of the toast  they will give you a few extra more if you like  The English breakfast was very good and hearty Service  The staff was great and friendly  Whatever you need  they will try to accommodate those requests  Check out was at      am  There are phonebooks  travel books  leisure reading books on a shelf in the hall  Downstairs near the payphone  there are brochures for tours and attractions  The place was cozy and made me feel comfortable  I loved my stay at Alhambra and whole heartedly suggest this place to anyone wanting to visit London  
P =>  wonderful people We loved our stay at the Alhambra  The rooms were ample sized  for London  and includes a wonderful English breakfast  They were very clean and included a fan for use on the hot summer nights that worked well to drown out the noise of late night people and the underground   We were in the basement unit and could faintly hear the trains  Very few trains run at night   It is situated across the street from the King s Cross tube station which worked well for sightseeing thru the city  There is a Burger King and McDonalds within a block  as well as a few take out places and small restaurants  We were there on y  th when the bombing occurred  A young woman that was on the last carriage of the bombed train ended up on the Alhambra s doorstep crying  The owners took her in and let her use a room to clean up and called her a cab  The owners of the Alhambra are the most pleasant people that add to the enjoyment of your stay  
P =>  Reasonable Cheap Hotel The Alhambra Hotel is not much but it is very reasonable for London a very expensive city  The rooms are very clean though very small and they serve a very tasty English breakfast  Though the Alhambra is not in a main tourist area of London they are right next to Kings Cross Station a major tube hub in London where you can easily take the tube to practically anywhere you wish in the city  They will also provide rooms for four people  
P => Well run hotel but slightly seedy location This hotel was inexpensive and clean  the desk staff was nice  and the included english breakfast was very good  I had a single with shared bath  the mattress was just so so but it was fine  No air conditioning  but few inexpensive London hotels have that  I was there during a heat wave    However  I didn t like the King s Cross neighborhood at night  there weren t many people on the streets after    pm and those that were looked dubious  I wasn t actually harassed  but was uncomfortable enough that I would choose a different location next time  
P =>  What a joy  This hotel is run by the most delightful family  My sister and I stayed at the Alhambra for   days at the end of  beginning of e        We thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of our stay  However  the cleanliness of the rooms is unsupassed and the English Breakfast is very yummy and VERY plentiful  The staff owners are not only helpful and friendly but made us feel like we returned each evening to  quot our quot  very own neighborhood  There is a marvelous neighborhood pub where very inexpensive    pounds  and balanced meals can be had  A laundrette is tucked away in the neighborhood within a few blocks of the hotel For those plus sized visitors to London   please be aware that hotel rooms in London are notoriously small with a capital  quot S quot   However  don t fear  My sister and I  sizes    and    respectively  managed quite well in the rooms and toilet bathing facilities  True  you have to develop a  quot system quot  but I personally would trade extra size for the peace and attention received from the Alhambra staff  To top things off  we woke every morning to birds singing in the neighborhood trees  How much better could it get Thank you tine  Frank  Sonya  and Bruno for helping to make our stay in London truly wonderfull  You are indeed THE best  
P =>  A Good Value We stayed here for   nights in  on a recommendation from my friend who stayed here last ust  I guess she didn t have an underground room like we did  We had a double  with a toilet and shower in the room  We were put in the Argyle  which was across the street  in room     Yes the room was tiny  but I liked the fact that the shower and toilet had their own separate rooms  Loved the water pressure in the shower and the hot water never ran out  Beware the toilet  The door wouldn t open all the way because of a tiny sink in the room  so we sort of had to squeeze in sideways  plus it smelled kind of like a public loo  But we could open the window  so that helped  The sink is in the main room  Also  there were   large windows that overlooked a completely sealed in courtyard  so we felt perfectly safe leaving the windows open during the day  The double bed was absolutely tiny  next time we will get   singles  but lots of shelf space and drawers and small wardrobe  which made up for the lack of floor space  However  the room got quite hot at night so we had to leave the windows open  we could hear the trains constantly and the people above us sounded like elephants  I recommend earplugs  they saved me as i am a very light sleeper  The breakfast was delicious  we asked for scrambled instead of fried eggs  and no beans  The staff was OK  We felt like we were scolded at times  not sure why  as we were as polite as could be  They will seat you at a table with other people sometimes  which my husband didn t like  as there were other empty tables  but that is the European way  I guess  You do get fresh towels everyday but no more soap  so take your own    Also no phones in the room  so have a good alarm clock handy  If you need to use the phone  go down the street by the post office  It s better than trying to use the one in the hotel  Great location and there is a local pub up the street  turn right and it s on a corner on the left  that has the most wonderful fish and chips  All in all a great BUDGET hotel so if you re looking to save money  stay here  
P =>  Nice hotel nice location Alhambra hotel in London is a great choice if you re looking for a nice and clean hotel with a good position that s also not very expensive  We spent a weekend in it  paying our room with private bathroom    pounds per night  The room was very pleasant and recently renewed  even if I must confess it was very very little  And it s also nice you can choose between continental or english breakfast as well  In others hotels in UK I had to pay if I wanted english breakfast  The position of hotel is great  King s Cross station  where you can find several metro lines  is   minutes walk  
P =>  a couple from Spain We stayed at this B amp B for   nights  We were located in the Argyle Hotel  an annex to the Alhambra Hotel   We were on the third floor  Our room included shower with a shared bathroom  also  the room had a T V One negative aspect of this B amp B was that our room was very small  especially the bathroom  It was claustrophobic   Unfortunately  there was a dude in our floor that smoked a lot and the smell and the smoke entered through the door into our room  I guess that was bad luck  The most positive aspects of the hotel were the cleanliness and that it was in a very convenient location  centrally situated and with access to many undergroud lines  We received a cordial treatment from the owners and the workers  Also the breakfast was satisfying  Overall  we were very comfortable there  Definitely we recommend it to anyone   
P =>  disappointed We stayed at the Alhambra Hotel for   nights end of il      Hotel is in a great location  real close to the King s Cross station and Thameslink  The breakfast is very generous  The staff were on the most part nice  We encountered one lady who wasn t too friendly to us  We weren t greeted that warmly by her and she thought we had too many requests by asking for a non smoking room and preferably a room not in the underground  She also scolded us for entering the breakfast room through the wrong entrance  when it was perfectly fine to enter that way and besides  we weren t instructed which way to enter since we were put in the annex across the street  We weren t made too welcome by her and would not stay there again  
P => Nice but be aware of the underground We stayed in the Alhambra four days during Christmas  Overall it gives a good balance between price and quality within a very good location  served by many Underground lines  The rooms are simple  cozy and clean  but quite small   with one towel for each person that is changed every day  No cheap plastic like some hotel chains do  The staff is nice and cordial but a bit too professional  almost impersonal  We got a fair breakfast for the price  with tea and toasts or typical English desgusting combo  THE CAVEAT  we were given a room in the underground without being asked or advised  even considering that the hotel was     full  That was a pain in the neck  We had the feeling of sleeping in the subway  Picadilly Line    we could almost hear the guy saying  quot Mind the Gap  quot  Luckly  the Underground was on strike on Sunday and that saved us some sleeping time  SO  be aware of the underground rooms

P =>   First but not last visit The Allen House met all my expectations during a four day stay this past week  We own a time share for a one bedroom unit but I was assigned a two bedroom unit       on the Fourth  British Third  floor in the front of the building The main bedroom was very spacious with two twin beds pushed together to make a king sized sleeping area  A small dresser and a chair along with another chair with a dressing table made up the rest of the bedroom furniture  The second bedroom had two twin sized beds and another dressing table and chair  The living room was very spacious as well with a small TV  two easy chairs and a small couch  At the end of the room was a dining table with six chairs  All of this fit well within the room Furnishing appeared relatively new but not of absolute top quality  more like a  Super Ikea  variety  All of the seating along with the bedding were comfortable and on the firm side as typical for the UK  in my experience Both the main bedroom and the living room were on the street side of the building and one could clearly hear street sounds if the windows were open  Closing the windows only provided a slight reduction in volume  The sounds were not intrusive but light sleepers might prefer the rear bedroom or one of the units not facing Allen Street The kitchen was also well equipped for any level of cooking or eating in and had a small breakfast table with two chairs  There was also a washer  and dryer   unit as well  The bath was also large for Europe with a tub and hand held shower As there is no wireless system there due to the difficulty of transmission through the substantial construction  the staff provided a wireless USB modem which connected to the Vodafone  D network  This worked extremely well  Location was excellent with a short walk to shops  restaurants  a large Tesco Grocery and the High Street Kensington Tube Station  The staff is top notch and certainly responsive to any requests  They were most helpful with answers to my questions and a real asset to the facility I am very happy with this first visit to our small piece of London and definitely will use The Allen House at every opportunity available to us  
P =>   Great Location    My husband and I booked our week stay through RCI   feeling very fortunate to have scored a highly coveted week in central London  The few reviews I read about the Allen House left me feeling secure in our choice of accommodations  We had great communication with the staff before our arrival  ie arranged for a hired car to pick us up at Heathrow and it was lovely  We arrived on a Saturday afternoon  the drive from Heathrow took about    minutes  Our driver was nice  wanting to talk about US politics  we arrived the day after Obama chose Biden as his VP   He told us the neighborhood we were staying in was very expensive  which I knew  but didn t realize a typical two bedroom flat in that area goes for    mil USD  There was a kind gentleman to welcome us and give us our keys  Our two bedroom two bathroom flat was on the second floor      there is no way I would have paid   mil for it  The whole flat was compartmentalized   there was a main hallway and all the rooms were off of that  The walls were in desperate need of a washing and the carpet was very dirty  For the most part though the furniture and appliances were new looking and in decent shape  The first bathroom had a very small shower  toilet and sink  while the second bathroom was a little roomier and had a nice tub  toilet and sink vanity  The second bedroom was tiny with bunk beds shoved in there  luckily we didn t need the room   The master bedroom was decent sized with a king bed  two twins pushed together   a desk  bureau and armoire  The bed was painfully awful  We firmly believe what we slept on was the boxspring and not the mattress  You honestly could feel the wooden slats and at one point my husband heard a spring give  I kid you not  I had a bruise on my hip from sleeping on my side in that bed  We took the blankets from the bunk beds and put them down for cushioning  but it did not help at all  The living room dining room was decent sized and overlooked the garden  Our television was small  about   in  which was fine  but since we weren t sleeping much  we watched a lot of late night tv  The kitchen was nice as well  it too overlooked the garden  The dishwasher  a Bosch  a great brand  we have one in our home   didn t clean our dishes at all and we had to hand wash them as soon as we took them out of the machine  Also  you have to make sure the fridge door actually does close   it is designed to look like a cabinet and it didn t close one morning and when we got back that afternoon we had to throw out some our food because it spoiled The neighborhood and location are perfect  We were a five minute walk away from the Kensington High Street Tube stop on the Circle Line  We purchased a   day Oyster Card and we highly recommend that if you are staying more than five days   well worth it  We shopped at the Tesco across the street and also at Whole Foods  which was about two blocks further up from the Tube stop  So to sum up  location great  Flat not so great  but with just a little bit of elbow grease  warm water and soap to the walls and carpets and a pillowtop mattress  the place would get a five star rating from me  I really am not hard to please  
P =>  Great place We stayed at the Allen House for over a week in e       Fantastic location just off Kensington High Street  very close to the Underground Stn and Bus Stops  Large number of eateries and a Tesco nearby The apartment itself was very comfortable  though not modern  The housekeeping  security  etc  is of the highest standard though some of the apts are smaller than others  We stayed in one of the smaller apts and a family who we were travelling with were lucky to get a larger one  They offered to shift us to a larger one subsequently but we were settled in by then The lift is small and takes a very long time and the TV is small but you will feel absolutely at home  The Office and House staff is very helpful and accomodating  We would definitely back but ask for a larger apartment  
P =>   Delightful comfortable worth the very high price Overall our experience was great  Minuses   Doorstops were old and hard to use  and all the doors in the apartment fall shut without them   Kitchen window of a ground floor apartment didn t lock  which made us nervous from a safety point of view   Although there s a cool videophone for the front door  the feature allowing us to be heard by the person outside didn t work   We were charged    GBP for making a few local calls   beware  you might want to find another solution for making your local calls   One onsite staffperson was a little chilly and officious  though the other two were super friendly and sweet   The king size bed was actually two twin beds pushed together  but the seam wasn t too noticeable  We did sleep well on it anyway   Really expensive for us  though it felt worth it  We spent more on a week at Allen House than we do for a month s rent on our apartment   We thought that the High St Kensington tube stop being on both the Circle and District lines would be really helpful for transportation  but the District line didn t seem to run very often  and had many branch lines  so when it did come  it usually wasn t our train   so it was like having only one tube line Pluses   We loved it overall  It was roomy  comfy  pleasant  convenient to the tube  High St Kensington stop about   blocks away  and tons of grocery shopping   Google maps makes it look like a substantial walk to the tube  but it really wasn t difficult    maybe half a mile    We liked the decor  though nobody would call it gorgeous    sturdy and nice quality furnishings  nothing super deluxe  but good condition and a very home like feeling    Our apartment had a living dining room  a kitchen  and a bedroom  Great appliances  Good size fridge and freezer  dishwasher  washing machine  not every unit has those last     Nice kitchen furnishings and dishes cutlery  Plenty of towels  Good hot water supply  The kitchen was best equipped for breakfast   dinner was a little hard to cook  no large pots    Dining room has a table with   chairs  sofa and   armchairs  so you could definitely have people over for dinner   Kitchen table with   chairs  Oven  stove  microwave all worked well   Quiet at night  Great safe neighborhood near great grocery shopping   big Whole Foods about   blocks away  ks  amp  Spencer at the tube station  Tesco   blocks away  Waitrose about a block away  Post office a block away  ATMs were close at hand  as were several Boots pharmacies   The  quot shower booster quot  extra heater meant we never ran out of hot water  even after long showers  Towels were nice  and there were plenty  The bathroom was pleasant and had plenty of space  on a little shelf cabinet  for all our many toiletries   Maid service M F is included in the rental  They ll do your dishes for an extra fee  All was sparkling clean   They didn t require any deposit before our arrival  although they did charge us for our full stay on our second day there    We stayed in mid ruary and we were warm and comfortable in the apartment the entire time   The fact that it was staffed during the day was a plus for us One more tip  you have to flip the on off switches for each outlet in order to use them  So don t despair if you think the outlet isn t working Thumbs up    strongly recommended overall  
P =>   Loved the Allen House People were extremely helpful  Access to the internet available and made easy by the staff Location was great  easy metro access       about   blocks   near shops and busy area  Close to Kensington Palace and Hyde Park  We walked  but it is a long walk  nice on a nice day Groceries available nearby  Starbucks across the street Busy area  so there is some street noise    we were jetlagged  so slept through it all Beds were comfortable Read on one review that people had cold water  This was NOT a problem for us  There are actually switches outside the bathroom for the electric towel heater   think one was for the water heater as well  Check with management if there is any problem with heat or hot water and I m sure they would fix it for you  
P =>   Excelente situacion  
P => 
P =>   Good value and location  fine for a short stay  Stayed one night following a concert at the RAH  Nearly went for something more expensive on the basis of some of the shocking reviews here but were glad we didn t  Yes  the room was small and the decor tired but the bathroom was clean   the shower hot and the sheets clean  The location was great  an easy  safe walk from the RAH with a selection of restaurants nearby  We didn t have the breakfast but there is a large Sainsburys nearby  with a Starbucks  that can fulfil most needs  For     a night in this part of the world we thought this good value although a stay of more than one night may have been pushing things  
P =>   Good Location Everything else terrible First of all  this hotel is in a very nice and quite area  not too far from Hyde Park  near Earls Cross underground  By tube its only   stops to Covent Garden and its has not far some restaurants and pubs  And from outside the hotel doesn t look too bad  Ok  this is the nice part  Then comes the rest  my bedroom was in a basement  a lot of rooms are in the basement  were there is a awful smell of gas  The bedroom was tiny  we couldnt walk straight because there were practically no space between the bed and the wall   the sheets were too old  there was a cockroach in the bathroom  I dont ask much in a hotel but this one was bellow standarts     Most of all  the staff was very rude and everything we had to pay in advance  room  breakfast and so on   They could not charge in the room altought they pre autorized     charge in my credit card so if i didnt pay anything  who it was impossible because  as i sad  payed everything in advance including the   nights i stayed there   One night we arrived about   h   and the key didnt work  There was no one in the reception  We looked and found a girl in the kitchen  When we ask her to solve the problem or go get the clerk she stood there and sad that she couldnt do that because she had no autorization  Well  we had to wait about half hour before the clerk arrived    In conclusion  dont go to this hotel 
P =>  Good location room is poor ok for one night I stayed at this hotel for one night during Wimbeldon and it was reasonably priced considering most hotels were booked during this period  The hotel was a good location but the room was not good  It was extremely hot with no air conditioning or fan  The elevator was broken  The internet terminal was in the lobby and cost    There was no safe in the room for money or passports etc  All and all not the best hotel to stay at for more than one night  The hotel was clean and safe  The hotel was close to an internet cafe and the subway  
P =>   Better than the reviews led me to fear We stayed from tember   to tember     The hotel was booked in conjunction with our Air Canada flights  I was a bit worried from what I d read in the reviews  but we were able to check in early without any difficulty  Our room was on the third floor near the small lift  It won t fit more than two people with luggage but it got us to the third floor every time  The room reminded us of a university residence with an ensuite  The bedding and towels were clean  the shower had good pressure and the temperature was good  My companion asked for a second blanket and one was delivered  Breakfast was fine with toast  cereal  buns and croissants  Plenty of jam  The spread wasn t as extensive as an all inclusive  but the price was much less  Staff were friendly and helpful  although many had limited English  We did not visit the bar so can t comment  If you are in need of a clean bed in a great location  this hotel is an excellent choice  The location is roughly half way between the Earl s Court and Gloucester Road tube stations  If you are coming from Heathrow  alight at Earl s Court and use the lift  
P =>   Poor  Choose a travelodge instead  Even for what we paid at supposedly     off this was poor value for money The shoebox of a room consisted of a bed and   foot leg room around the bed  The bathroom was basic  dated and poorly constructed The check in was fine  after that it went downhill rapidly  The main lift didn t work  hadn t for sometime apparently  so you had the stairs or service lift  which could fit a maximum of   people  and you had to share with the dirty linen and staff that could not speak any English  The way it clunked its way up the through the floors had you offering prayers on a safe arrival at your floor The bed linen was pretty non existant  and appeared to have been in use since the war  No duvets here  just a sheet and tatty blanket The night time entertainment consisted of pornographic type soundtracks eminnating from a room a few doors down  At least he seemed to be enjoying his stay  The breakfast was very poor  A stale croissant and toast  though there was no toast left Oh yes don t forget the cornflakes  For an extra       you can upgrade to a cooked English Breakfast  based on the continental we didn t bother  McDonalds is just around the corner For a few extra quid you can stay in a travel lodge type establishment   it would be money well spent Whats good   great location for Earls Court   there are plenty of other hotels in the area you ll be pleased to know  
P =>   Absolutely Horrible   Don t Go There    Room tiny and dirty    Staff uninterested and unhelpful  Breakfast disgusting  Doesn t deserve any stars  
P =>  Horrible service Hotel is overrated  Service is terrible  Rooms are small  with dirty walls  and dirty carpets  If you need help than the hotel stuff wont be of help  They are very rude and nervous Only good thing is location Hotel is located in Kensigton aria  
P =>   location good value poor single room at double price The pictures on the website are nothing like the hotel  Our single room masqueraded as a double  We booked a twin and got a room with a double bed and nothing else  There was no room to walk round the bed jammed against the window  The shower leaked all over the floor  The blankets needed cleaning  No staff spoke at breakfast  very few seemed to speak english  Cooked breakfast resulted in the same breakfast being placed in front of everyone  including the vegetarian  no toast available  Visitors who asked for a cot were told  no cots availalbe  Complain in the morning to the manager  The morning receptionist was very helpful  More like a hostel than a hotel  definitely not   star  Definitely the worst hotel we have ever stayed in  
P =>   Very disappointing First impressions were good   the location is an expensive looking quiet street and the foyer and juice bar looked perfectly fine  However  our double room wasn t big enough to swing a cat in  Both my wife and I cut our legs on the corners of the bedframe squeezing round the bed  such was the lack of space   The hallways were roasting   heating must have been up full blast  Bathroom was basic and tired but adequate  Required renovation  Room appeared clean  but upon returning one evening we discovered a large cockroach in the bathroom   perhaps attracted by the warm  humid conditions  there was no fan in the enclosed bathroom   The     s portable TV barely had reception for   channels  Breakfast was mediocre and overpriced   we got a far nicer one in Covent Garden the second day for a fraction of the price  For central London this hotel was well priced  as long as you don t mind very small cockroach infested rooms with poor facilities  
P =>  don t let this place be your ambassador to London This was the worst hotel I ve ever experienced  Carpets are stained and patched with mismatched patterns  window blinds are broken  rooms are tiny  dirty  and undecorated  I had to borrow pliers from the front desk to adjust the radiator  The phone in my room was not wired for outside calling  Employees represent many nations of the world  which is great  but makes communication very difficult  The in house coffee bar doesn t serve coffee until after       AM  I was told that if I filled out the customer complaint form  the manager would just throw it away  
P =>   Wouldn t go back I booked this hotel because I had stayed there about   years ago and was very pleased with it  However  I was disappointed with my return visit  We arrived at the hotel after      pm and approached the check in desk  I acknowledged that we were early but asked if there was a possibility we could check in  I had checked the website before travelling and noted that check in time was  pm   I gave my name and handed the man on reception my print off of the confirmation email from Roomex com  He asked what name I booked under and searched for my booking  he then asked who I booked it through and continued searching  It was as if I didn t have a booking  I was then told that he couldn t find my booking and I was asked to take a seat and wait  Eventually he approached me and said we found it but you can t check in until  pm  I said that the website said  pm and he said  well its  pm   I had to ask if there was somewhere that we could put our bags for the hour while we waited and he said  ya  over there  without offering help  At no point did he apologise for the delay We returned after  pm to check in and waited at the desk and handed in the printed email again and he didn t even acknowledge the fact that we had been there earlier and had dealt with him  He then said  One twin room  yes  and I said  no the booking is for two twin rooms   we eventually got to our rooms   one twin and one DOUBLE  One of my companions contacted reception to say that they had been given a double room instead of a twin and was told by the person at the other end of the phone that they didn t understand what she was saying  Eventually  after the third phone call they were told to come back to reception where they were asked repeatedly if they touched anything in the room   which they obviously hadn t  They were finally given a twin room in the attic Based on my past experience I have recommended this hotel to friends and now I am sorry that I have  I certainly wouldn t book it again  
P =>  Basic but OK Stayed here on business for a night on the  st of ober and to be honest it wasn t that bad  The rooms are very small  but then I wasn t there to lounge about in the height of luxury so it didn t really bother me  The furnishings are clean and in good repair and the bed was pretty comfortable The staff were friendly and helpful  although I didn t really have cause to deal with them much    The restaurant does a decent enough breakfast  and the waiting staff clear and reset the tables very efficiently Probably the only two negatives were the bar didn t appear to have a licence and only sold non alcoholic beverages  hey I m not a drunkard  but it would have been nice to be able to relax with a beer  and that the wi fi wasn t free All in all  happy to have stayed there on business but if I was visiting London for fun I d stay somehwere a bit more plush  
P =>   Never again I had to stay in London for a few days during high season  This hotel was horrible  It was ust so terribly hot  but all you can do is open up one of the small windows  In the middle of the night  it s like   AM  the fire alarm goes off  So quickly into our shoes  alrady in the hallway when the alarm gets turned off again  Not one notice of why  how  or not even an apology  Rooms are very noisy  there was a big group so during the night doors keep slamming and lots of street noise  Breakfast was far below average  Rooms are sooo unbelievably small and the shower water gets all over the place  Only positive thing I can say about this place is that it s located near the subway  
P =>  Ambassadors   Basic but acceptable Had decided at very short notice  ie at  pm that day   to stay on London following a corporate event and a friend had recommended the hotel Rate was good   GBP   so booked the hotel Got there at       and the reception desk was smily and helpful  Life was a bit  bouncy  and small but it worked and was not groaning Room was really clean and tidy  little small but I literally needed somewhere to sleep and then to shower in the morning  Bed was clean and comfortable and there were tea and coffee making facilities  Room was on the road side so was noisy when a fire engine came for somewhere nearby   but hardly the hotel s fault Shower worked fine and there were fresh toiletries and nice clean towels and facecloth  A small thing which I liked   tissues in the bedroom and the bathroom  Small table which I sat at to blow dry hair and TV worked fine I did not have breakfast but the room looked lively  The hotel also has a bar  I did not partake but again looks nice Overall I was happy   I got what I paid for in London and I ll certainly go there again  
P =>   Good basic hotel We stayed   persons in two rooms at the Ambassadors at the beguinning of june     and had an excellent stay   The hotel is located near busses and the underground and all parts of London are easily accessible Staff at the hotel especially at the reception were very helpfull  The rooms were small and not very cozy but they were clean and neat as were the bathrooms Our stay included a fair continental breakfast When we vere there the temperature outside was around    degrees celcius and the rooms vere quite warm and I guess it will not be a pleasant stay during the summer as there is no air condition The Ambassadors is low priced and as such we got good value for our money and we will come back to the hotel  if it is not in the summer  
P =>  Would Never Stay There Again                      I wanted an inexpensive place to stay in London for the last night of my trip to England and Paris  I only stayed here because the B  amp  B I usually stay at in Chiswick  The Swan Private Guest House  a very nice inexpensive place  was totally booked  I stayed there the first night of my trip   I arrived and the check in staff was very nice  a bit inexperienced   That was the last nice thing I can say about the place other than the lobby cafe and internet services seemed nice but I didn t use them  and the hotel is convenient to the Gloucester Road tube station  I arrived to my floor in the elevator to see what I thought was a welfare hotel with old mentally unbalanced residents lingering in the hallway  When I arrived to my room the horror show continued with a very run down room  The carpet was wet and smelly  which I discovered why the next day when I was showering in the miniscule shower the water just gets all over the bathroom floor and proceeds to the rug hence the wet smelly carpet   The bed was uncomfortable  My room was on the street side and was noisy because of that  I could go on and on but overall a bad experience  
P =>  A nightmare I ve been at the  quot Ambassadors Hotel quot  on Work and it was a nightmare When we arrived we were amazed by the rude treatment at the reception and it just got worst  They give us a room on the  th floor  both lifts got broken on the  nd day  so  during   days we just had to use the stairs  We only found   nice members of the staff  All the others were just unfriendly and unpolite  For several times we asked them informations and they answered rudly and turned the backs on us for twice  that s not normal    The room was very small  When i had my bag open  my collegaue couldn t have her s open at the same time  There is no mini bar and no CD player on the room as they advertise The breakfast is nice  nothing supreme  has the basic things If we could  we would have changed hotel  cause is its the worst we have ever been  
P => Most Enjoyable Stay We stayed at the hotel for two nights on the  th and  th of ember      and to be honest I was extremely worried about the hotel after reading the reviews  I was however  pleasantly surprised  We arrived at  am and although the check in time was not until  pm we were able to leave our bags in the luggage room for the day and head to central London  On checking in we found the staff extremely friendly and helpful  The rooms were small  but they were clean  and very warm  The corridors of the hotel were very warm albeit in need of some decorating  The reception was bright and airy and the hotel is very close to the tube  Gloucester Road  which is on the Picadilly line  Again when leaving the hotel staff were extremely helpful  We were able to leave our bags in the luggage room and again shop without having to carry our bags with us  The receptionist then organised a taxi for us to take us to Heathrow and again I have to admit that this was the cheapest taxi ride to Heathrow that I have had a long while  I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a good budget hotel while visting London  
P =>  Filthy and Awful  I booked this reservation through hotwire com  which  in my previous and extensive experience of being a customer  has always been accurate with thier star ratings  This hotel  however  was a different story  Hotwire advertised it as a     star  a notch below the self procrlaimed   star rating on the hotel s website  but still well above the half star rating it actually deserves I arrived at the hotel at around   pm  with three bags ranging in weight from    to    lbs   I was staying at the hotel while searching the area for apartments as I was relocating to London for work   No one even looked at me as the cab driver and I struggled to get them through the door  I left the bags at the entry to go to the desk and check in I was ignored by the staff of three for about   minutes  as they collectively struggled to check in a single guest who had arrived right before me  When it was my turn  no one welcomed me or even said hello  The woman behind the counter just demanded my credit card  When she found my reservation  she pulled a piece of paper from a drawer  pointed to an amount at the bottom and said   quot You pay this  quot  I explained to her that my reservation would have been prepaid by hotwire  She checked with her collegue who explained to her that I was correct  She made no apologies and finished checking me in  When I asked for help with my bags  she looked at me like I was an idiot and said   quot We don t do that here  quot  Imgaine that  A self proclaimed   star hotel that expects a     lb woman to lug   bags totaling     lbs to her room without assistance  I asked the man who looked like he was the manager if there was any assistance he could offer me  He said no  A guest in the lobby actually helped me to my room Allow me to note that it was ober         and it was around    degrees outside when I checked in  My room window was open and the room was freezing  I closed the window and looked for a thermostat  There was none  just a radiator with the knob that adjusts the temperature taken off  The radiator was completely cold  I called and asked for a space heater  waited   hours for it  then called the front desk  At that point I was informed that they only have central heating and they don t have space heaters  They offered a blanket  Looking at the soiled and threadbare one on my bed  I declined  I wouldn t get under that thing if my life depended on it The room is tiny  with a twin bed  The linens were flithy  with black scuff marks and hair on them  I eventually elected to sleep on top of the blanket  fully clothed  The furniture was made of press board cork board and is full of holes  scratches and water rot stains  There were black scuff marks all along the walls  particularly on the wall up against which the bed is placed and in the hallway area  The bathroom was tiny and didn t look like it had been cleaned  The towels were thin  stained and worn  The foot towel that you throw down on the floor when you take a shower was thrown in the bottom of the shower stall and had black hair on it  More hair in the sink and on the toilet  The shower stall area was thick with black mold In general it was awful and the staff was rude and unwilling to help  Would never stay at this place again  
P =>  Don t be fooled  take flip flops Word of advice  DON T end your vacation in this hotel  it could ruin the experience of London  Granted we are in a large city with limited space  but this hotel could create space by losing the plywood  stained  unstable furniture  But then what would hide the light bulb that flickers on and off when ever it wants  be the electrical should be inspected  I will give create to the clean bathroom daily  however the carpet could use a cleaning and possibly the cobwebs in the ceiling  by the way don t expect air conditioning be I am just being harsh because they did NOT have a lounge to have a cocktail to unwind after a full day of touring The staff seem to be unpleasent but it most likely is because of the enviroment of their work place Anyhow England is amazing and I will not let this ruin the experience I had 
P =>   Never again  This hotel is awful  The rooms are miniscule  a twin room has two single beds pushed together  so you may as well be sleeping in a double bed There is only about    quot  beween the bed and the wall too  making it very cramped  Storage space is very  very limited  no drawers  just open shelves   there would be no room to open a drawer anyway  The  furniture  is poor quality  shabby and old  mattresses are very thin and uncomfortable  bed bugs abound and I have a bites all over  The carpets look dirty throughout the hotel  and there was no way I was walking on the bedroom carpet in bare feet The bathroom stank of urine when we arrived  and the towels athough freshly laundered are grey  rather than white The area is not quiet  it s very noisy  both traffic noise and the area seems to populated with drunks talking and shouting at night  The rooms were extremely hot and stuffy  and the blinds are indequate to block out the light in the summer mornings  all together making it difficult to get a decent nights sleep The continental breakfast was OK  but we saw cockroaches in the dining room  thankfully on our last morning   There is chaos  however when it s busy  leading to a wait of    minutes to be seated  The staff do their best  keeping the buffet well stocked and clearing tables The hotel was not cheap at     per night  and far below the standards I would expect However the staff were pleasant and helpful  and the faulty light bulb in the bathroom was replaced very promptly I wouldn t stay there again even if desparate  there are much better hotels in the area for the same price  
P =>   OK for the price I don t quite understand the hassle about this hotel The room was small but not tiny  We had enough space for our bags and to move around The bathroom and the room itself were clean  the maid cleaned it every day  There were no stains on the sheets or towels whatsoever The only thing that didn t work was the blinds  they were kind of stuck  But that was no big deal after all  The staff was friendly and helpful A bonus was the good location of the hotel    minutes walk to the tube and a huge    hours open Sainsbury s nearby  The only thing that wasn t the best was the breakfast  They provided a good choice of fruits  juices  jams  honey  cereals  yogurt  cheese  rolls  croissants and Danish pastries but the latter weren t very fresh  The yogurt was expired for days and was kept unchilled for the whole breakfast time        am  like the milk for the cereals  All in all it was a reasonable   star hotel with a good location and friendly staff  
P =>   Well Located Budget Hotel If you are looking for a budget hotel in a really central location of London  such as Earl s Court   then this hotel has a chance  But otherwise find another alternative The first night we were given a basement room   even though I booked the room   days before via internet  The front desk just kept saying that they had no other room available at the time  The basement was warm  on  nd il  and when I inquired about any air conditioning  I was told that I should have booked one of the pricey suites  rude  We were ultimately moved to a  nd floor room the next day  which was much better The Tube station is just   minutes walk  and you are in Zone    so its pretty easy and quick to get anywhere within London If one is on a touristy visit  the hotel should only be cozy enough for a nice sleep  The rest of the day should be spent exploring London  where exploration just never ceases to end  
P =>   Fine for the Price My friend and I stayed in the Ambassador s Hotel during our vacation to London  Our room was VERY small but everything worked and was clean  The maid service was good and quick and breakfast was a decent variety of foods  The location was great  it s pretty close to two different Tube station s and lots of grocery stores  internet cafes  etc  I always felt safe walking back in the evening  
P =>   gross hotel  Hard to imagine that a travel agent actually booked us into this place  It smells  it s dirty  it s threadbare  it s cramped beyond belief  couldn t open two suitcases at the same time    it s noisy  it has crawly things in the beds  the bathroom is moldy  and some of the lights in the room didn t work  Frankly it looks like a place where drunks go to dry out  Stay absolutely away from this hotel    
P =>   Moldy and gross We stayed here for   night and I refused to stay for any more  We got stranded in London after the terrorist scare so we picked this hotel last minute  We stayed were assigned a basement level room  The bed was uncomfortable and the pillows looked dirty  The bathroom walls were covered with mold  Everytime anyone flushed a toilet or closed a door we heard it all through the night  I took a shower in the morning and water covered the entire floor since the shower curtain didn t go all the way around the bathtub   I can see why there is a mold problem  The hotel staff was fairly nice about letting us out of our reservations for the additional nights we were going to stay  The phone and internet service were a decent price compared to other London hotels  I wouldn t stay here again  
P =>  The Ambassador Hotel   Insect Infested LONDON  ENGLAND  THE AMBASSADOR HOTELDon t believe the website   The hotel is bug infested   ust         I have just returned from a much anticipated trip to London  as a graduation present to myself with my Sister and her family  Upon return to the U S A  I noticed a bump like rash on my one arm  I called my doctor and made an appointment yesterday             Upon inspection my doctor concluded the problem was due insect bites  I checked with My sister and her daughters  who were in different rooms  to find that have also been bitten  and unfortunately  both their arms  necks  etc  I believe I am blessed because for most of the trip I slept in a sleeping sack I purchased from Travelsmith    I am now taking Zyrtec to help curb the itching  applying calamine lotion and taking prednisone for the inflammation    And I don t feel too good about having had to pay for the doctor visit and the subsequent medications  I will be contacting the travel agency to let them know   not to book the Ambassador and will be contacting the Ambassador about my problem  
P =>  BAD HOTEL   No A C or fan   the room was very stuffy  Very bad smell in hotel and room  Room card did not work  A lot of people unhappy with their room  TV did not work  We requested a wake up call in the morning and never got one   Hotel is very noisey   you can hear everything that is going on in the hallway and neighboring rooms  Staff not very friedly  Rooms not too clean  stains on carpet  stains on pillows and bedWould only recommend this hotel for students backpacking or those that are traveling on a budget  Yet  I think for the same price you can get a better deal if you look hard enough  If your just looking for a place to sleep and shower then maybe its not that bad  but don t expect anything too luxurious  And don t count on a timely wake up call  The benefits   Complimentary breakfest  Pretty decent location   although not the best 
P => Nice hotel in great area We arrived in London several hours before check in  The hotel staff allowed us to leave our luggage behind the desk as we toured London  The room  a standard double  twin  was teeny tiny  but quite clean  The en suite bathroom was large with a tub shower  and also clean  The maid cleaned the room daily  The staff was friendly and helpful  It is a good hotel for the price and location  The only complaint I can think of is that the room doors are right next to each other  so if you have an inconsiderate neighbor that comes and goes late in the night  you will likely hear it  So bring some ear plugs and enjoy your stay  
P => Stay Away   Stayed at this hotel for two nights at the beginning of ch  The hotel bedroom was tiny and the carpet looked like it hadn t been hovered all week  sheets were clean on the bed but the one blanket and throw were filthy  came up in a terrible rash when i got home all on my legs  The breakfast was the one good point about this hotel  How it got a   star rating i will never know  Stay away at all costs 
P =>  Not As Bad as some reviews made out The hotel is conveniently situated about     metres from the Earls Court Road Tube Station  The reception area is bright and looks like it was recently refurbished  There are a couple of internet terminals  pay  there The breakfast area is small and is not able to cope with the rush at peak breakfast times when the hotel is busy  The complimentary breakfast is reasonable and you can upgrade to a cooked breakfast for       The room        Double  is small but that is not unusual for this standard of accomodation  It would not suit a long term stay as the luggage storage is poor  The furnishings in the room are old and show a great deal of wear but the room was clean on arrival and the house keeping was faultless The bathroom was fine although the shower head kept slipping  There was hot water on demand during our stay I found the staff polite and friendly There was obvious ongoing work  painting  replacement of carpets etc  in the area of our room during our stay so standard of the decor might improve Overall a fine hotel for a short stay  
P => Could have been worse    The main reception areas are nicely decorated  and the staff were pleasant enough My single room was tiny  even by London standards  but clean  I had a few small niggles though  For example  there were no blinds on the window and I could see across the road into the flats across the road  the room was roasting and I had to either be too hot  or listen to the traffic all night  I used to live in central London so I chose the noise    and the bathroom flooded no matter how carefully I arranged the shower curtain  plus the water temperature wildly fluctuated whilst having a shower  But for     a night I wasn t expecting the earth  and there were no major problems  What I got was a clean  basic room in a good location with decent facilities nearby such as the    hour Tesco  
P =>  Having read the previous reviews I feel obligated to report I booked the Ambassadors Hotel for   nights on laterooms for                After doing so  and right before departure  I stumbled across this website and arrived at the hotel with fear and trepidation  However  my fears were certainly unwarranted  I can only speak for room       but  though small  it was clean  everything worked  no bed bugs  No urine on toilet seats  The window opened and provided fresh air  It was more than adequately warm  The cold breakfast was included free with the room  and was so good we didn t want or need to eat anything till dinner  A hot breakfast was available  but we didn t feel the need to order it for only about    extra  My roomate said the coffee was the best she had ever had  anywhere  The personnel were nice and extremely accomodating  It was two blocks walk from Earls Court tube station  a bit more from Gloucester  Extremely convenient location  I will definitely stay there again  All budget rooms in London are small  If you can manage small quarters  you could not go wrong if you could get the rate we got    nights for     GBP  The price was that low because the  th night was free  What s to complain about  Though obviously some people have had bad experiences  I think the hotel more than deserves my feed back  I could not have been more satisfied  
P =>  More Bed Bugs Like another of your contributors we also experienced the bed bugs in Ambassadors Hotel  Waking up on the first morning we noticed that we had been bitten and then found bed bugs crawling on the bed  Left two samples with the Receptionist and got moved to another room  Noticed one live bed bug clinging to clothing later when we were out and about  After returning home the following week I found another live one in my suitcase  Research revealed that these were  quot Cimex Lectularius  quot  Not a pleasant experience

P => One of the BEST Stayed here for a weekend trip to London and my experience of the hotel was exceptional  The hotel is well situated and close to Kings Cross Euston stations  On arrival the welcome was great  the receptionist was very smily and the welcome was natural  The room was clean  although a little small with little closet space  was fine for our   night stay  The restaurant and bar staff were the most friendliest i have come across in a long time  The food was great in both breakfast and the one time we had for dinner  Overall i would highly recommend and will be back to visit in in       Thank you to all at the Ambassadors Bloomsbury  
P => stars only by London standards The best thing about Ambassadors Bloomsbury is its location  In other respects  the hotel is just average  Four stars is an exaggeration as their  quot superior quot  double rooms are smaller than singles normally  Storage space is very limited  definitely not enough for two people  and I would advice the management of the hotel to do something about the issue  Mould and other signs of humidity are not something that one would expect to see in a four star hotel room  at least not outside of the UK   The breakfast is ok but the selection is somewhat limited   here again if one uses other four star hotels as a standard  For a London hotel  Ambassadors is quite ok but do not expect too much from it  
P =>  Simple Hotel Good location  Altough a bit pricy  this hotel is great for visiting to London for several days It is right by Euston station  and minutes away from King s Cross The hotel look s is sophisticated  the rooms are new and clean  medium size  
P =>  ON A PAR WITH TRAVEL LODGE We only stayed for one night but having stayed in many   star hotels I fail to see how this can be rated a   star The bathroom had very little room for toiletries  the wardrobe was hardly adequate and the air con was very noisy  The one saving grace was  the staff were very friendly and proffesional  
P =>  Lovely hotel great location and nice staff  The hotel was situated in an ideal location  a  minute walk from Euston station  which meant we could get to the many parts of London easily  It was on a quiet street just off the main road We travelled as a group of     ages        and although check in wasnt until  pm we were able to check in when we arrived at around   pm and still get adjacent rooms  I had read reviews before arriving and many mentioned the size of the rooms and how small they were  but i felt the size of the rooms we had were fine  We had   double rooms and one twin and because of the shape of the building all the rooms were all slightly different shapes  Breakfast was included in the price of our stay  There were two sessions for breakfast        am and        am  This meant that it was never very busy and you could get seated  There was a huge selection of breakfast  The cold breakfasts  cereals  toast  croisants and fruit  were set out in a buffet and the hot breakfasts  full english  were cooked and brought out to you  There was also the choice of juices  water  tea or coffee  The food was lovely and the staff were very efficient and polite My room was at the back of the hotel and i didnt hear any noise on a night time  There was another hotel around the back of ours and their windows faced ours but i just kept the window blind down most of the time so it didnt really bother me  The wardrobe space was a bit small  but as we were only staying two nights it didnt really bother us  The main doors of the hotel are locked between      pm and  am and there is a member of staff there to open them for the guests of the hotel The gym was also free for us to use but we didnt go in so cant really comment on what that was like I really enjoyed my stay and felt that the hotel was excellent value for money  Ive noticed on a review below that its      per night  We booked through superbreak com and paid         for  nights  including trains and breakfast  breakfast was about     to pay for separately   so if you book in advance and look around you can get some really good deals  I would definately recommend this to anyone wanting to stay in London  
P =>   Tiny rooms modern clean great value  I d just spent   nights in the Holiday Inn Express Victoria for a business trip  which is very basic  amp  dated at      per night  I moved to the Ambassadors in Euston for the rest of my stay  leisure  to be closer to friends  and was really happy I did so So  let s get the room size comment out of the way  I was in the standard single room  room       and yes  it was only slightly larger than a shoe box  As all other reviews will tell you  rooms here are tiny  In fact the wardrobe space was so small I laughed out loud  amp  sent the photos to friends  check attached photos   Room size aside  the hotel had all the comforts and modern conveniences I want  amp  expect in a hotel  The hotel s public areas  amp  rooms are very clean  bright and modern  Singles are most certainly only built for singles  The room s bathroom has a great shower head and complimentary toiletries  The room itself was quiet  amp  contained a large flat screen Tv with some Cable channels  There s also complimentary water in the rooms  amp  temperature controlled air conditioning  Best of all  there s free wifi in lobby  amp  in rooms Joe the concierge was really friendly and helped me out a few times which was good And at      per night  the price is perfect  amp  location handy  great access to many Tube lines from Euston  Ambassador Bloomsbury is fantastic and I d recommend it to anyone who s in london for a few nights and wants modern  comfortable room to rest their feet between shopping and nights out  Just don t buy too much as Im not sure where you d put the extra bags  
P =>  Good for business travellers Location is perfect in the centre and surprisingly the room was quiet  But try to avoid the proper single rooms  Incredibly tiny  Otherwise liked the simple  clear design and colours  The best of all is the glass walls in the bathroom  Staff really helpful  enjoyed the short stay  Good for business travellers  to  cold  for families  
P =>   EXTREMELY OVERPRICED FOR WHAT YOU GET AND THATS ASSUMING YOU GET IT AT ALL  im here now and have had   nights here for work porposes with colleagues  Check in is ok  the staff at reception are fine my room was basic but clean and modern with a shower tiny cupboard some nice toiletries and some bottled water  not sealed so probably tap the rooms are as previous comments have stated  very small  I had room      which for   nights is not too bad at least i had a view of the street below  i looked into one of the others  with no windows at all  i would not like one of those its like a cell  The walk up price for a single room is             per night  i had a double  so i dread to think how small the singles are the internet was down for the first night  which was poor for what you pay  the resturant is way  way overpriced with a poor menu  i like soup as a starter they had none  we turned up at      but had to wait   hour  as they had a function down stairs   shouldnt they be putting guests first   they add     to the bill including the overpriced drinks at the bar   you can always have this charge removed on request  as per the law  the second night i tried to book a table for       for   of us but was told the earliest would be       so we didnt bother and went down tottenham court road and found a nice place with a large menu and fair prices The beds are fine the breakfast surpassed itself  it is expensive at         but it was very good  with a good selection of everything cooked to order Finally  on arrival i ordered a daily paper for the morning  it didnt show  when i asked where it was they said they would deliver one to my room whilst i was out  it never showed  i live in hope for the morning   nd time lucky maybe i personally would not recommend this to any friends  its way  way overpriced for what you get and you could do far better for the price in london but its ok for   or   nights if the company you work for  is picking up the bill  
P =>  Great location This hotel has a great location near all the shops  restaurants and attractions of Bloomsbury  and close to Euston station for sightseeing in the rest of London  Our double room was small and a bit cramped  but it was nicely furnished and very clean  Staff were very helpful  especially in the restaurant  
P =>  very clean and tidy but room size like a mousebox  very nice clean hotel but room and bathroom the sallest ive ever seen  not enough room for   people in the bathroom at the one time and just a pathway round the bed  we didint even unpack suitcases as wardrope was so small  
P =>  Good Hotel good location easy London and European access The Hotel is situated accross Euston Road from Euston station so offers great and easy access to all of London  St  Pancras station is only about    minutes walk away too which is ideal for the Eurostar and services heading North Check in was smooth and easy and we checked in quite a few hours before the  quot official quot  check in time  Our room was      which looks out on the front of the Hotel  The room had a modern feel to it and was clean and comfortable  There was a complimentary safe in the room The Bathroom consisted of a walk in shower and the usual accessories  but no bath  The complimentary toiletries were very good compared to other places we have stayed in Pro s Great location Con s Room is fairly small   but comfortable  No tea and coffee making facilities As there were so many places nearby to eat and drink we went out and didn t sample the hotel food or drink  
P =>   Good hotel The hotel was nice and the location was good as well  I stayed at the  th floor and I could not hear the street noise at all even though the window in my room was facing the street  I was very pleased with the hotel and would stay here again  
P =>   Great modern hotel brilliant breakfast Nicely designed  modern hotel with friendly staff and in a good location  The wetroom bathroom is a great novelty  The breakfast is a delight  
P =>   Great location clean and quiet room The location is great  just around the corner from British Library and British Museum  Euston tube is really close  and King s Cross and Russell Square are just a few minutes away  If you are travelling from Heathrow by the tube  I d actually recommend you to get off at Russell Square  King s Cross is much more crowded My room       was quite small for a double I d say  but very clean and the bed was comfy  Small but modern bathroom with a lovely shower  The wardrobe is a bit on the small side with about five hangers in total  and you wouldn t be able to get two peoples clothes in there  Tea and coffee making facilities are in the left cupboard by the bed  The in room safe can be found in the right cupboard There was complimentary wifi internet at the hotel  but unfortunately it didn t work properly  I stayed for   days  and had to phone the reception a couple of times every morning or evening to ask them restart their router A nice touch is the complimentary bottle of water they put in the room every day  You also get a morning newspaper for free delivered to your room if you want it  Just tell them when you check in  
P =>  Find a cafe for breakfast Gorgeous hotel and in a prime location  Minutes  walk from Euston and Euston Square  Pleasant walk to the bus routes serving Trafalger Square and Westminster if you don t like the Tube Women judge an entire establishment on it s toilets  so do not miss the public toilets on the basemant level   best basins I ve ever seen Exceptionally friendly and helpful staff  nothing seemed to much effort for them We were in the seemingly notorious room     and it wasn t that bad  I imagine  from the floor plan of the first floor  that all the  quot    quot  rooms are the same  Yes it was small  ridiculously so  but it was reasonably well equipped for an overnighter  There were no opening windows on account of the fact it was in the middle of the building  and therefore no natural light  But it was more than bearable  I wouldn t recommend one of the  quot    quot  rooms if you plan to spend a lot of your time in the hotel though This place let itself down completely in the breakfast department though  Let s face it  the biggest thrill of a hotel stay  apart from all the obvious DIY ones  of course   is the breakfast  Undercooked bacon  undercooked sausage  burned black pudding  anaemic tomato and greasy eggs that gave me a quite unpleasant surprise the next day  The mushrooms were gorgeous though  I ll give them that Ultimately  the perfect hotel for using simply for night time activities  sleeping  etc     whilst you enjoy London Town  Not a place to book if you want to stay in your room And there s a cafe at Euston for your breakfast rather than the evil they turn out  
P =>   Modern Up to date Neat Great Location Tiny Rooms The building is a nice red brick structure  recently renovated  Once you enter the lobby  its modern  looks new and very neat  The check in process was quick  and staff was courteous Once we got to our floor  the walk to the room was through a very narrow passage  We opened the door  and our fear of a tiny room came true  But I suppose this is London and one must expect this The room seemed very recently renovated  with a modern and straight line design  and a nice and simple colour scheme  It had a very comfortable bed  a small desk  and a good TV  The bathroom  though tiny  was again modern and up to date  All in all  comfortable enough  Most of the time we were out  and only came back in the afternoon to rest and at night to sleep  A little stuffy if you are planning to spend a long time in the room Negatives of the room are minimal  basically no view  and a little dusty The location of the hotel was perfect for us  It was close enough to the centre of town  yet away from the chaos  It is close to   tube stations so very convenient  and neighbourhood is nice and fairly quiet  The staff is friendly and helpful All in all  we had a good stay  
P =>   Excellent stay superb location This hotel is in a superb location     mins walk from Kings Cross  within easy reach of great shops  restaurants and sightseeing  Room was small  not much storage space for clothes  but very clean  modern and comfortable  Our room       was very quiet  The staff were very welcoming  polite and friendly  The breakfast was superb  All in all  great value  Would not hesitate to use this hotel again  
P =>  Make sure you ask for an outside room We stayed for   night at the Ambassadors for a weekend break in London and were given room     which is in the middle of the building  The room was very clean and we liked the modern decor  The staff were very friendly and attentive and the breakfast was good  The location is also convenient     minutes from Euston Station for tube and train  and walkable in    minutes to Covent Garden We were however disappointed with the tiny size of the bedroom  There wasn t even enough room for a bedside cabinet on both sides of a small double bed and storage space for clothes was very limited  More seriously the bedroom also lacked any natural light or opening windows making it quite claustrophobic  The only outside light was from some opaque glass at the end of the bathroom which was part of the wall  We therefore had to rely on the air conditioning to keep the room cool   however this was too noisy to leave on at night making for an uncomfortable night s stay We would suggest avoiding     and specifically requesting a room on the outside of the hotel   with a window looking onto a street  
P =>   No complaints at all  Brilliant room breakfast and staff  Was very satisfied with my stay here  Good location and nice helpful staff  The room was big enough   not huge but not as tiny as some people have said  though maybe we were lucky and had a slightly larger room as we were on an end   Rooms provide nice shampoo  shower gel and a good hairdryer so no need to pack these and there s a full length mirror  Breakfast was brilliant and served till   am  although it s only included when booking through mini breaks  theatre breaks companys  otherwise you have to pay over    pounds for it   You can leave your luggage with them when you check out and collect it later  No complaints at all  Was very happy with everything  
P =>  Great location comfy bed small room I stayed at this hotel for one night  I booked online and paid     pounds for bed and hor breakfast  While London prices are always a shock  this seemed about right  The hotel porter was extremely helpful and polite  He hooked my iPod up to the hotel s wifi when I could not  My room was small but bright with a small but new bathroom  The bed was lovely and all amenities worked fine  This hotel is just fine for a short stay  It is very close to Euston tube station  several places of interest and in a pleasant location  
P =>   Great location   modern amenities I m slightly torn on this hotel  As a place to simply stay the night and then get out and explore the city it s perfect  As other reviewers have noted it s super close to the Euston subway line and there is a bus stop right in front of the hotel  The Bloomsbury neighborhood is really charming and so many wonderful things are in walking distance  British Museum  amp  Covent Garden ket  We had a fantastic rate  which included breakfast  however every morning we weren t on the list  which was a bit of a pain  If it just happened for the first day it wouldn t have been such an issue  but we stayed for   days  There seemed to be one gentleman who was rushing around to make sure people were happy or offered beverages  We didn t end up ordering off their menu  because it was more of a hassle  The rooms are super small  but still nice and modern  Internet is included free  as is a safe  The bed isn t super big or luxurious  Our comforter had several cigarette burns on it and one morning we were awoken by the fire alarm around  am  These are probably  one off  occurrences  It s a nice enough place  however I think I would look for other options on a future visit and I certainly wouldn t pay their       rack rate for a super tiny room  
P =>   Fantastic Location Average Hotel My partner and I have just returned from a most fantastic trip to London  We stayed at the Ambassadors and although the rooms were very VERY tiny it didnt distract from the fact that the hotel itself was smart  immaculate and modern  The restaurant was very good  breakfast served until   am and offered a wide selection of both hot food  meats  cheeses and cereals  We didnt actually dine there on an evening as we went to Fifteen  AVOID      Hotel is in a very good location  only   mins walk from Euston Tube and approx    mins from Kings Cross  I would definately return again  
P =>   Perfect perfect perfect perfect The breakfast was one of the best we ever have had  It was like being in a top restaurant  There was a big buffet and a la carte menu and it was include the room price  And the service was excellent  Top modern hotel whit every facilities you need  Only two minutes walk to the metro  And   minute to city centre with the metro  One of the best hotels we ever have stayed in  
P =>   Clean but small room We ended up here after that the place we usefully stay in was full  Yes  the room is small  very small  Staff is friendly  the rack price is ridiculous  we paid    pounds per night  and that s the maximum what the room is worth  The rack rate is     pounds for the same room  The breakfast is good  buffet for the cold things and a plate  made after order  with English breakfast  We really didn t like the surroundings  
P =>  Good location very nice room I stayed there for   night and the hotels is better than I thought Great price  good location  nice sized and designed room  nice flat TV  free wireless internet  
P =>   Good design and Good Value A very convenient location  just across the road from Euston  and yet very quiet  Everything smart and well designed  cheerful service  and very good value at the price  
P =>   Great Hotel Great Location This is a high quality hotel in a great part of London  Within spitting distance of the British Library  UCL  King s Cross and Russel Square this is the ideal place to stay if you are in town for business or pleasure The room was a good size  had a huge bed  plasma screen  safe and tea and coffee making facilities  The bathroom was small   more of a wet room really   but well appointed and clean  The room was equipped with a smal desk and wifi   so ideal for business customers There is nothing I would have changed about my room or stay   happy days  
P =>  Good location Modern and friendly situated close to Euston station  Small and personal check in area with nice and service minded staff  My luggage acutally spent more time in the storage room than in the room     The room was kind of Scandinavian less is more looking  Since winter struck  snow  the indoor temperature needed a boost from the heater which inititally did not kick in  The staff solved the problem very efficiently  In spite of its modernity I found the tea kettle and the bags in one of the cupboards  The hair dryer was placed in a cupboard with mirrors on the inside of both doors which actually provided a good view from all sides when blow drying  Why havent anyone thought of this before   The bathroom  only shower in mine  was nice and new and the towel rack very warm   good to heat up your socks on  
P =>   Fab modern hotel We stayed at the Ambassadors Hotel Bloomsbury for one night  Overall it was excellent  The staff were lovely and very helpful  The hotel is very modern and bright  Rooms were excellent though just a little small but adequate for a one or two night stay  We had breakfast in the hotel which is one of the best I ve ever had  Good selection of hot choices and lots of breads  They seemed to top it up regularly too  The hotel is in a great location with Euston and Russell Square tube stations just a few mins walk away  We d defo go back there   
P =>   Clean friendly good value and safe The rooms may be small and the wardrobes tiny but the location of this hotel is ideal  The beds are comfortable and the air conditioning is good and efficientIt is on a main thoroughfare and our room was opposite the lift but we heard nothing throughout the three days we stayed The breakfast was a great bonus and has something for all tastes The staff were without exception friendly and helpful  It is worth shopping around the various internet sites as the difference in price is considerable and many do not include breakfast  Our deal did and it was also the cheapest we could find It is not a cheap option but it is VERY good value for money for central London  Only    minutes walk to Trafalgar Square  Many good restaurants in Fitzrovia about    minutes walk and the British Museum back entrance is    minutes away  A real find  
P =>   Recommend Ambassadors Bloomsbury Excellent hotel for the price  staff very helpful and friendly  Breakfast very good and relaxed atmosphereDont be put off by the decor in the corridors the rooms are very good albeit small and clean Can recommend this hotel 
P =>   Fantastic value Booked via alpharooms com and paid only      reasonable for London  The rooms are small but perfectly formed for just one night  any more than one night and you might have difficulty unpacking your luggage as the wardrobe space is tiny  We arrived early and the receptionist made arrangements for our room to be made available as soon as possible which was much appreciated  The breakfast was one of the best hotel breakfasts I have ever seen with a wide variety available including kippers and excellent smoothies  I have already recommended this hotel to other people and would certainly return  
P =>   Nice hotel and close to train station Great hotel and great location in London if you are taking the Eurostar and need to be close to the station  Hotel was only a few blocks walk to St   Pancras Station and close to restaurants and coffee shops  The Staff was very friendly and helpful  welcoming lobby  and really nice rooms  The beds were very comfortable  nice clean bathroom  and the rooms were not a bad size  actually rather spacious compared to what I normally see in London  There was a small restaurant and bar but we did not use it  but it looked very nice  
P =>   Good hotel but small rooms overpriced restaurant Good hotel  excellent location  everything you need is available  including L Occitane products  free water  free internet  air condition  Rooms  bathrooms and closets are very small  Restaurant is overpriced and portions are tiny  Will use this hotel again  without a visit to the restaurant  
P =>  Great for a short stay Stayed here for one night  on my own for business in London  Service was fantastic as was both dinner and breakfast  The twin room was very clean and well furnished   and for my purposes did the job  However  other people have commented on the size of the bathroom   I didn t find the size too small   but certainly the sink was far too small to use comfortably and there was nowhere to put your toiletries in the bathroom  Other negative would be the size of the wardrobe   very small   I didn t have much stuff with me but you could probably only get a couple of jackets in there  Other than that the hotel is great  in a good location and very comfortable  I would certainly stay there again overnight  
P =>   great breakfast shame about the rooms Probably the best breakfast I have ever had in a hotel also the staff were great and couldn t be more helpful  That were the plus side end  It might be my own personal taste but I tend to find that floor landings that are poorly lit and decorated in a stark style remanisant to a prison to be oppressive  Once inside the room little improves  The porter  who was as helpful and beyond recrimination was keen to point out the  plasma T V  to my husband  This bonus was marred by the fact that I couldn t actually see the t v as I was not able to get in the room until the porter had backed out  The truth is that unless the T V is susspended on the wall there wiould be no where else it could fit  The wardrobe is a six inch recess in the en suite wall and the coffee facilities can be found stashed inside the bed side table  A final sticking point was the glass door on the en suite shower room which opened stright on to the side of the bed  I am far from being a prude but I do not relish being on full veiw whilst sitting on the toilet  
P =>  Good Location We booked the Ambassadors  Bloomsbury mainly for location and because it had reasonably good reviews  We came into St Pancras and the Hotel is only ten minutes away  straight up Euston Road   we had booked for the Terracotta Army exhibition at the British Museum also only ten minutes away from the Hotel  through Russell Square  The Hotel is also only   mins away from Euston train  bus and underground station  We were very happy with this hotel for our one night stay but if we had a longer stay in London the room we had would be too small  The rooms on the front did look slightly bigger than ours which faced the rear of the property  The room was clean and nicely furnished although the carpet had a few stains  there were plenty of mirrors  The shower wet room was great and the toiletries were good quality  The bed was not very comfortable though with what seemed a very cheap mattress  The wardrobe was very small with   hangers but as we were only staying one night was plenty for our needs  Really good points were the tea and coffee making facilities with biscuits and a complimentary bottle of mineral water and also a safe and hairdryer in the room The room service menu looked very good but we did not use this  We did have breakfast included in our room rate and this was a very good buffet style breakfast with freshly squeezed juice not the packet stuff and the waiter brought as much coffee tea as you wished The best point about the Hotel are the staff  Reception staff in particular are very efficient  friendly and extremely helpful  The bar restaurant staff are also very friendly and nothing was too much trouble  You are able to leave your bags at reception if you arrive early or wish to leave later after checking out We chose the Hotel so that we would not have to use taxis  always an expensive option  We got day passes for the underground and went out to the O  to the Tutankhamun exhibition  This was OK  we had timed tickets but they let too many people in all at the same time and it was too crowded  and we were disappointed in the actual exhibits  However  the Terracotta Army exhibition was fantastic  we had       p m  tickets and we enjoyed the experience of the British Museum at a time when it is usually closed  There were a lot fewer people than we expected and you were so near the exhibits you could have reached and touched them We enjoyed our weekend in London and would certainly stay at the Ambassadors in Bloomsbury again  
P =>   Great value city centre hotel A great central hotel  Clean  well located and friendly  Single rooms a little on the small side  but apart from that can t fault it  Room service breakfasts brilliant value for money and Occitane products in bathroom a bouns  
P =>   misleading and very different from advertising On website and checking in you think this is the greatest little find in Bloomsbury handy for everything from Station to sights  They have taken minimalist a little too far for my like  The rooms are very small and probably would have been fine for single occupation but as a couple not enough space  Wardrobe will take a coat and that s about it  Add two suitcases and your really start to feel cramped  The desk is so small it will only take a laptop and nothing else and if you are a lady wanting to put on makeup or do hair you have major problems  The showers are great but I think the bathroom was designed by a man with a beard   impossible to shave in  That said the beds are great and very comfortable  Will go back   if only the rest of London is full 
P =>  perfect location for the eurostar modern not too big I chose this hotel because of its proximity to the Eurostar terminal at St Pancras  It is perfect for singles  The room was small but had everything and was quiet  overlooking the back   The staff are friendly and the hotel has a brand new fresh  modern look and also feels quite intimate  The cupboards are tiny but I didn t need anything large for one night I loved the toiletries   l occitaine  The shower room was very modern and clean I didn t have breakfast or dinner so can t comment on the food It s a good location for central London and the price is reasonable  
P =>  recommended We chose this hotel for its central location and reasonable price and we were very happy with our choice  The hotel was very quiet and very clean and modern  the staff were helpful and pleasant and the breakfast was really fabulous  The room IS small  no two ways about it  so if you are planning to stay in your room a lot or have a lot of luggage it is maybe not for you  but otherwise  it s great   we were out all day and only sleeping there   and the bed was extremely comfortable  The volume on the great wide flat screen TV does not go up beyond a certain level  so maybe this place is not good for you if you are bit deaf  seriously    
P =>  Very Modern loved it This hotel is very stylish  sleek and ultra modern It is round the corner from Euston Station Tube Station and is very easy to get around all attractions and Oxford Street It is ideal location and it may be on a main road but it is very quiet We stayed on the  th floor which was unbelievably quiet  We never even heard anyone in the room next to us It is across the road from Hilton   Euston but is not upstaged by it at all In fact this hotel looks better I only had one problem my whole stay and that was breakfast was cold on the first day but after that it was lovely and hot  DI would stay here again without a doubt  
P =>   good staff but tiny rooms    hi   we stayed for a two night  friday  amp  saturday trip and found the hotels staff particularly friendly giving us maps of the area   and even giving their opinions of where to go really helpful   we had breakfast on both days and it was excellent with the full english breakfast option or cold meats fruit  pastries  breads we found this a big plus better than many other hotel breakfasts we have experienced however the problem we had were the rooms  they were really small even for two people the bed was very small  possibly a three quarter bed and we could not walk past each other in the room with any ease  it felt very restricting  The bathroom was also tiny with an underpowed shower although the lo ccitane shampoo and s gel were a nice touch  overall the room reminded me of a travelodge type of room   basic and a bit sparse  I personally wouldn t want to stop for a longer stay it would get me down   but again the staff were fine   the reception helpful the decor tasteful the problem was the room size   Thanks 
P =>  A comfortable hotel for a good value  At a walking distance from St Pancras   The neighborhood is ok    
P =>   small but clean and comfortable stayed for one night on business  the room was very small but clean and comfortable  I like the showerroom as it does make a fun experience  easily walkable to kingscross   St Pancras  Euston and a bus stop just outside the hotel Not somewhere I wuld stay for several nights but for one or two it is fine  
P =>   A good nights sleep Had a one night stay here and could not fault it  For the price  one of the nicest hotels we have stayed at in London  Euston station and the underground   minutes walk away  The room was spotlessly clean and quiet  Everything worked as it should  The beds were exceptionally comfortable with large fluffy pillows and soft duvets  The room was on the small side but if you wish to use it for purely sleeping and changing then it is perfectly adequate  Staff were courteous and very polite  The buffet breakfast was vast with a fantastic choice of dishes   bacon  eggs  fried  scrambled  poached   sausage  tomato  bubble and squeak  mushrooms  beans  cold meats  smoked salmon  cheeses  cereals  croissants  toasts  etc  More than enough to fill you up for the day  Would we return   yes  
P =>  Small room very basic a bit pricey Stayed one night after christmas party nearby  I booked a double  the room was small just enough space for the bed and a small table and chair  Only had a shower room no bath  The room was clean and functional but nothing special  The wi fi didn t work and despite saying there was    hour room service I couldn t find the menu  Good location and clean and tidy hotel but wouldn t rush back  
P =>  Minimalistic just back from   nights at The Ambassadors Bloomsbury and overall it was an above average hotel to stay in  The staff are friendly  and the rooms are very trendy with lovely L Occtaine toiletries On the negitive side  sort of  the rooms are very minimalistic which meant that for a   night stay there was nowhere for us to unpack and we lived out of our suitcases for the week  Also in the bathrooms again there was no where for you to put your toiletries  They are currently digging up the road outside the hotel and it is quite a busy road  it would probably be best to ask for a room near the back The breakfast during the week is made to order which is really nice and fresh  on the weekends however they serve it buffet style  which although its still good is not as good Close to Euston Station  its a great location to explore London from   just make sure you get an Oyster Card to save on the London Underground  
P =>   Excellent value Booked a one night stay looking for somewhere near Euston  so we could drop our bags off and head into town   good quality and not too expensive  The Ambassador fit the bill in every respect Literally   minute walk from the station  spotlessly clean and great value we paid      for the room including breakfast  which I thought was excellent for    in London  The breakfast buffet was superb  all fresh  piping hot and a great selection of everything  The room was small like other posters have said  but it was perfectly adequate for what we wanted in an overnight stay  Huge comfortable bed and plasma telly  Nice touches of complimentary newspaper and mineral water as well as the usual tea  amp  coffee tray Try Prezzo italian restaurant just across the road  we have now been there three times on our way to the station to come home and never been disappointed  again great value    courses for   people with drinks      
P =>  style and very friendly service Would definitely recommend this hotel   great location for those travelling into Euston station  Very clean  well appointed room   comfortable  large bed  Excellent breakfast   great choice and very friendly attentive staff  Had a great one night stay 
P =>   Excellent This hotel is really nice  It is clean  uncluttered and functional  We asked for a king size room and got one   the only problem being that it took up     of the floor space  but hey  it was a really comfortable bed Wardrobe space and bathroom space were at a premium and this was supposed to be one of their best rooms   it s great for one night but would find the room far too small for an extended stay The hotel was supremely quiet  
P =>   OK but dont expect a lie in The hotel is modern and clean having been recently refurbished  The rooms are large but the bathrooms are very small  When you use the shower water floods the whole bathroom as there no seperation between shower and bathroom  All this was fine but the blinds on the window are Ikea style  Even when shut light floods through  Unfortunately I picked the only sunny morning in London this year and was woken at     am with the sun in my eyes  The angle of the blinds seemed intent on maximising glare when lying in bed  Its a shame that an otherwise nice hotel is let down by such a small oversight which massively affects the quality of stay  
P =>  Small but perfectly formed Very welcoming staff at check in was an excellent start to my four night stay  The single room I stayed in was incredibly small but the space could hardly have been arranged any better  The wet room was kept spotlessly clean  although I agree with some of the other reviews about the too small sink and the slightly dangerous position of the shelf above the sink  The tea and coffee making facilities  including biscuits  were perfectly adequate but the lack of storage space and ironing facilities could be problematic  However  the free WIFI and the digital TV channels were welcome bonuses while the breakfast was faultless  An impressive range of continental and cooked breakfasts combined wih the efficiency of the breakfast staff made a pleasant start to the day  On a negative note  I suffered from a sudden lack of water pressure in my bathroom one morning and there was a mix up over the inclusion of breakfast in my room rate  in this situation the staff were pleasant and helpful  
P =>   Would definitely use again Having read some earlier reviews on this site  commenting on the poorstandard of decor  I decided to think for myself     What a great decision   The Ambassador Bloomsbury is a perfect place to stay for any visit to London  Handily placed for the majority of Tube lines it is also within easy walking distance of a number of theatres  Although compact the rooms are tastefully decorated in modern tones  and the same effective  and well thought out  use of available space is a theme throughout the hotel  From the first minute of arrival til our departure we were looked after by helpful  friendly and professional staff  I will definitely be visiting here again  
P =>   Great Hotel  Great property  Newly renovated hotel that looks wonderful  Had a room on the  th floor that was bright  light  and clean   The location was perfect  wither a   min walk to Bloomsbury  Russell square stn  or St  Pancreas and Kings Cross Euston just   mins away to  Service was great and the hotel offers great value at        a night  Free  fast WIFI along w  desk work area in room works wonders  Next biz trip to London will have me staying here  
P =>  Great business hotel I stayed here at the end of ch on a two day business trip  The check in process was very different from the usual run of the mill experience you get a most London hotels  The reception staff were incredibly welcoming and efficient  they even took my luggage and showed me to my room  I don t think that s ever happened to me in my    years of making regular business trips to London  Lots of other hotels would do well to learn from these people about customer service The room was very modern  this has been covered in other posts  Importantly it was very clean and the little wet room was great  Things that I really liked about the room were having a safe that s big enough to put a laptop into  the free wifi connection and also having a large complimentary bottle of mineral water  Stuff that could be improved   virtually no storage space with a tiny wardrobe and   coathangers  My own personal bugbear   no iron and ironing board   I had to phone reception for this  it took    minutes to arrive and the first iron was broken  Also the windows have wooden venetian blinds which means the room is not completely dark  I know they are trying to keep up the modern feel with this but a nice blackout blind would have been better  Although they have good double glazing it s pretty noisy given it s proximity to Euston  the first night I was woken up at  am by an ambulance going past  Can t comment on breakfast  the restaurant or the bar but from what I saw it looked good  Without doubt one of the best business hotels I ve used in London and such as short walk to Euston station  Will definitely stay there again  
P =>  Very nice hotel   Recommended for short business trip I stayed at this hotel for   nights and I found it to be very pleasant  Inside the hotel is VERY modern and decorated in a clean  colourful  minimalist style   Note   some of the photos shown in the Hotel Photos link above are out of date   the exterior of the hotel and the lobby are much more modern now   The rooms are also decorated in the same sort of style although they ve kept the colours mostly neutral  The room I was in was quite small  but with a large bed  the bed actually took up most of the room   Apart from the bed  with built in bedside units  the only other furniture in the room was a small desk and chair  not very comfy   There was a also large flat screen TV on the wall and there was a small safe in one of the bedside cupboards and tea coffee stuff in the other bedside cupboard  There was a SMALL wardrobe in the room  which was just deep enough to hang   items and that was about all you could get in   I ended up hanging a couple of things in there and then left the rest of my clothes in my bag The bathroom was very small with the shower being open to the rest of the bathroom  so the bathroom floor ended up very wet after a shower  I wasn t too bothered about the fact the bathroom was so small  but my biggest problem was the sink   it was tiny and there was a small glass shelf above it which was quite low which meant it got in the way when trying to use the sink  However  the bathroom was cleaned thoroughly every day which was good Breakfast in the hotel was excellent  The staff serving breakfast were very efficient and pleasant  but not overly friendly  The food available for breakfast included a wide choice from a buffet style selection  cereal  fruit  patisserie selection  etc etc  and also a selection of hot food  Unlike most hotels the hot food wasn t just confined to a full English   there was a choice of several things including pancakes with bananas  my favourite    boiled eggs with soldiers  eggs benedict and few others  I can t remember them all  I only had one meal from room service   ceaser salad with chicken   which I wasn t particularly impressed with and was rather expensive for what I got I didn t have too much trouble with noise whilst staying there  I certainly couldn t hear anything from the street outside and most of the time I didn t hear anything from any of the other rooms  There was one night that another guest was being a bit noisy in the corridor and I could hear them loud and clear  but in general in can t complain about the noise levels One other important point regarding this hotel   it has FREE wireless internet access Overall I d definitely recommend this hotel for a short business trip   anything more than a week and you d probably get fed up of the small room size and lack of wardrobe space  Definitely wouldn t be any good for couples due to the small room and bathroom sizes  
P =>   Not bad but could be a lot better This hotel isn t bad  but isn t great either  It s fine for a one or two night stay but I certainly wouldn t recommend it for longer  It is non smoking throughout the hotel  which was fantastic for me but might not be so welcome for smokers  The food and service were excellent  but there was a general lack of organisation which made simple things unnecessarily complicated  The rooms are clean but not very small and not well equipped  It s fine if you intend only to sleep in the hotel and spend the rest of your time elsewhere  and don t have much luggage The rooms are very small and the tiny amount of wardrobe space has to be seen to believed   and there aren t even any drawers or alternative places to put clothes that can t be hung  There is space for three fairly thin garments to be hung  and no more  The flat screen TV was good  and the bed reasonably comfortable  The bathroom was clean and modern  with an integrated shower  no bath   However  there were no toiletries provided   not even a bar of soap  I don t know whether this was an oversight on one occasion  or whether none was ever provided  The room on the whole was very clean  even though it was quite bare  The kettle provided didn t work very well and there were no biscuits The staff were very friendly and the service excellent  although reception took a long time to sort out quite simple things and there were usually very long queues  There was some confusion over what menus would be available and what choices from the menu were allowed  meaning a lot of reiterations with the staff before even arriving  adding unnecessary stress to organising the trip  The food was excellent  and the bar a pleasant environment  Breakfast was poorly organised  with not enough space for the number of guests and people waiting for a long time to be seated  and the food kept running out  although it was replenished eventually  The communal areas of the hotel were clean and decorated in a modern  interesting way  The non smoking rule was very welcome and meant nowhere smelt of smoke  The location was also good  quite central but not in too busy an area  There was no noise from the road or guests on the night I stayed  which was good  Overall  I am lukewarm  Some very good aspects were equalled by some very poor aspects  Simple measures like putting soap in the rooms and ensuring facilities like the in room kettles worked would have made my stay a lot better  as would organsing reception and breakfast more efficiently  I would not recommend staying for longer than two nights because of the tiny rooms and lack of storage space  I think the hotel has good potential  but a little way to go yet before I d really strongly recommend it  
P =>  Getitng better and better I have now stayed at The Ambassadors   or   times in the space of about three months  When I first went I was pleasantly surprised by the place as the reviews on this site about the refurbishment indicated that it was a bit of a nightmare and that the rooms that had not yet been refurbished were very tired    but it wasn t as bad as I expected  But each time I have been the rooms have been better than the time before and as of my last visit the refurbishment seemed to be completed  there is now a tastefully furnished bar  the boxed in entrance is now properly open  the list are working again     it is excellent  But that doesn t really tell you much about the hotel itself  so here goes  the location is not great for shops  restaurants etc  but it is very close to Euston so its really easy to get about with this place as your base  The rooms are really nicely  and tastefully  decorated in a clean  trendy  modern style  Some of the larger rooms have bathrobes  slippers  etc  provided  Some of them are a little small  the rooms  not the bathrobes  but if you can get an upgrade then the amount of space is better than average  The price varies from one week to the next so  as I am on a budget  I sometimes can t afford to book in here  but whenever the price drops below my magic      threshold  I book here without a moment s hesitation  The only downside is that the dining facilities are a bit underwhelming  I have only eaten breakfast here once and wasn t over impressed   it wasn t bad  it was just ordinary and not up to the standard of the rest of the hotel as it now stands  I like fresh  not tinned fruit  I like to have the tea and coffee made to order  not dumped out of machines etc etc  But if you can cope with that then this place will do you fine  Forget any older reviews that had this place down as being in need of an upgrade   its happened now and the hotel is one of the best in its price bracket in London  
P =>   Will book again Summary  I ll be using the hotel again next time I go to LondonMy needs  so you know where I m coming from   A one night stay in London and a mid range budget       for one night  for business What I thought about it Location   great    minutes walk from Euston  opposite Hilton   Busses outside went direct to most parts of London tooBuilding Presentation   Currently undergoing refurbishment  so mostly painted boards surrounding the construction area Reception   Very friendly    staff on the desk both smiling and happy  Showed me to my room rather than just give directions  a nice touch I wasn t expecting   They were also smiling and happy when ever I passed Room   Very Clean  modern style  recently refurbished  good lighting  good shower   wet room    plenty of towels  shampoo  dressing gown and slippers provided  hair dryer  shaver point  No trouser press  complimentary  L bottle of water  Tea  Coffee  Chocolate Mints and Shortbread Free Wi Fi connection throughout the hotel  numerous access points to ensure excellent coverage in the room Room Size   not big  but ample with two beds  very small wardrobe  perhaps   garments  TV   I didn t have time to watch TV  but I m not sure there were too many channels available other than the normal array of BBC  ITV  Radio etc Food   I didn t eat in the hotel  the option is available but I went to a restaurant for dinner and chose to get breakfast in the City   
P =>   noisy noisy hotel On the positive side I found all of the staff very helpful  the room was newly decorated and wet room newly fitted with a good shower  It was also immaculately clean However the room was very small with very little room to walk around the bed  The bed may have been the lumpiest bed I have ever had the displeasure to sleep in  The problems started when I tried to sleep  There is some kind of night light in the bathroom which couldn t be turned off  I tried everything including removing the power card  This would not be a problem if there was not a glass door between the bathroom and the bedroom which is directly opposite a mirror  Therefore the light reflected all around the room  Then I had the loudest air conditioning heating unit ever  And to top the above  everytime someone in the hotel used their bathroom it sounded like it was in the room as the water and sewage system was so noisy  This wasnt helped by the person in the room above me taking a shower at three in the morning  I had breakfast in the restaurant  I didnt touch any of the hot food on the first morning as it didn t look appetising however this improved on the second day  
P =>   Under renovation    As someone who stays in hotels for around     days a year  The reviews of this one are a little unfair   The refurbishment is looking stunning  though still underway  so I do feel the rooms are too pricey considering the residents are having to put up with it  The food is excellent and despite the above I keep returning rather than using the Radisson Edwardian  It s clean  rooms totally modern with DTV  and the staff very efficient  Exactly what business travellers need  I ve stayed almost    times over the past few months and it s been nothing but superb  
P =>   Successful refurbishment I suspect that the refurbshment programme has had a negative impact on this hotel  to judge from the previous reviews  I stayed there last week and was quite favourably impressed  Some of the public areas were still be worked on and the outside clearly has some way to go  However  I found my room to be clean and to make effective use of very limited space   a triumph of design for compactness  The rooms will feel small for North American travellers but they are comparable with others at this level in the London market and the attention to design makes them feel more spacious than they are  The handbasin in the shower room is indeed small   but I noticed that the toilets had a dual flush and I suspect that water conservation was very much in mind  This is likely to be a growing problem for all London hotels and the Ambassadors are simply ahead of the game  I did not find cleanliness a problem anywhere and the front desk were conspicuously pleasant and helpful  I would certainly use this hotel again  although the previous reviews are obviously a reason for some caution  
P =>   great hotel after staying in the worst hotel ever  the lonsdale just down the road we relocated to the ambassador and the staff were delightfull the rooms spotless  the food to die for  in all a really nice hotel    
P =>   At Bit Austere but not Bad especially for London This hotel was fine after I asked to have my room changed  Why is it  please do tell me  that automatically  when assigning a room  the reception staff give me a room facing a wall  This has been the case without exception  I stayed in   different hotels during this most recent visit to London  and without exception  the room I was given faced a wall  there is no other way to put it  In this particular case  I asked immmediately for a change  and I was given one  without question  which makes me wonder  is this the policy of these hotels    see if the poor sucker accepts the worst room  and if not  no problem  change it Anyway  the second room was absolutely fine  a bit austere in decor  the bed and a plastic seat serving as furniture  but clean  comfortable and with a flat screen tv  not that there is anything to watch on British TV  if this is cable there must be absolutely nothing with no cable Everything very modern  not a bad size room  but remember  I paid for a double  I know better now than to get a single unless a broom closet is what I want I have yet to find a hotel in London that gives value for money  This hotel was fine  I believe the best of the   I stayed in  but for    pounds excluding the taxes and charges  that is way over      Cnd  no  sorry  it couldve been better  
P =>   Good from far but far from good I travel a lot  around the world  for business mostly  The website made this look like a very nice remodel of an old hotel  The reality was quite different The room was the smallest I have ever seen anywhere  When you exited from the right side of the bed your feet were in the bathroom  The bathroom was really just a shower with a sink and a toilet on the side  While sitting on the toilet your feet are in the shower  The shower was installed in such a way that you could not turn up the water over a certain temperature which meant I took almost cold showers for a week  In addition  there was no room to put anything in the bathroom or in the room in general The bed was comfortable but that is the only saving grace of this hotel  I left the hotel and moved to the Apex in town  highly recommended   Since I booked online I lost the amount I already spent on the last two nights but it was worth it  I was being joined by my partner at the end of the week and there was absolutely no way two adults could live in this room  
P =>  Loved it  What a lovely Hotel  I just come back from my Honeymoon around Europe and London was our last place to visit  The Ambassadors Hotel is an excellent place to stay and its staff delivers the real professional and personal service  no robots  The rooms are all brand new  stylish  very quiet and modern with all the conforts     hours room service  double glazed  in central London   big LCD TV and even comlimentary WiFI  As soon as they learned we were on a honeymoon they surprised us with a bottle of wine in the room  The service was impeccable  The restaurant is pleasant and the food is delicious  Another surpirse  however  was waiting for us in the morning  the breakfast  a huge buffet with everything on it  I was a bit warried when I read the other comment and I was double surprised when I saw the rooms and experienced the hospitality  I even spoke to the Manager who nicly explained me the changes they made thouout the whole Hotel  I will visit the Ambassadors again and I reccomend it  
P =>  A big disappointment Looked very impressive and stylish on the website  Unfortunately its not finished   nd and  rd floors are a building site with banging and drilling from   am to   pm   days a week  Carpets loose on main hotel stairs  lifts intermittently out of order  The bar was closed to residents for   nights we were there as there were private Xmas parties  the music from which went on until after midnight and could be heard on the  th floor  No apologies made for this Room Ok  rather small for the price and nothing like the picture on the website  Comfortable and clean  but no storage space at all  However  bathroom was nice For the price I paid  average      per night  a very big disappointment  
P =>  Stylish new rooms Something different happening at this hotel  After staying many times in tired looking rooms  I was really pleasantly surprised when I was offered one of their new rooms for a small upgrade supplement  The corridors smelled of new carpets and I was told they just finished that floor  Entering the room was a very pleasant experience  The design is stylish  modern and refreshing  yet elegent with wide screen LCD wall TVs and full air conditioning  The bathroom walls are are clad in full sheet glass or mirrors  Unusual but attractive  The shower was excellent with plenty of force  The sleep was excellent  comfortable bed and silent  surprising for such a busy city centre location   Overall hotel staff service satisfactory  Breakfast was OK but could be better  Otherwise  quite an impressive experience overall  
P =>  Friendly service I stayed here in e of this year  It is curently under going a refit which it needs  but on the whole my stay here was very pleasant  The rooms are a bit small but they are clean and comfortable and once the refit is completed then i am sure they will be more than adequate  I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful when i asked for local information  The resturant was clean and the food was great  there was always a wide variety of dishes on offer  It was a good  base for my trip to London and i will stay here again in the future  
P =>   To be avoided Unpleasant  shabby guestrooms and bathrooms  this place needs a major rehaul  As some of the other reviewers mentioned  it s far from clear where this hotel gets its three star rating from  When I checked in after a long day on the UK railway system  I couldn t even get into my room as there was a lot of construction work going on in the corridor  The bar lounge is pleasant  but have a look at the bottles behind the bar and ignore the drinks list that s on the table  I found that roughly half of the drinks I was interested in  was unavailable  No Grolsch  no Glenmorangie  not a single drop of brandy  The Calvados that I chose after the third  quot no quot  was generous    The good news is that it s very close to Euston Station and that there s a very good Nepalese restaurant within walking distance  The Indian place around the corner is average  
P =>  There are much better alternatives   
P => Horrendous   
P =>  Appalling  
P =>  Poor value  
P =>  Ugh   
P =>   Parfait et pratique  
P =>   Hotel recomendable  
P =>   Si pu  trovare di meglio  
P =>   Camera minuscola buona posizione prezzo elevato  
P =>  Consigliatissimo  
P => 
P =>   lovely and clean and modern place to stay in London centre close to Madame Tussauds in London  Baker streetthe rooms are small but all essentials are great and cleanand the staff is super friendlybreakfast is plentiful   but if you like some boiled eggs come quick  tea coffee machines in the lobby      hoursI was very happy staying there 
P =>   Good value and great location Pros   close to Baker Street tube station  which makes its location perfect for tourism  very good continental breakfast  polite staff  quiet room  we got a backside one   good shower  nice area  reasonable price for Central London Cons   tiny room  miniature bathroom  dirty carpet all through the hotel  it definitely needs to be replaced   they really need to care a bit more about cleanliness Overall it was a pleasant experience  I would recommend the Americana for a few days stay  
P =>  Great Hotel to stay the hotel was really pleasant and comfortable   close to center and underground  the hotel offered drinks tea coffee as and when you wanted them  the room was modern and bright   we enjoyed our time here and would defo go back highly recomended we booked through octopus travel online and got great deal      for   nights b amp b continental  for the   of us  parking is just     yards from hotel  ncp but quite pricey at     per day   but it is central london    
P =>  Americana We stayed at the Americana for three days in august  The location of the hotel is great  just a short   minute walk to Baker street underground  Good breakfast free coffee all day  amp  night  Smallish rooms but clean enough  The only thing it needs is a repaint of the walls which are looking a bit shabby  Would stay here again  
P =>   Not as I expected The Hotel is in a very good location The staff are polite and friendly Breakfast is great However the rooms are too small and tight you can t find a place for you suite case   I would recommend it for a one day stopover but for long stays I wouldn t stay there again as you can find cheaper hotels for bigger rooms the back rooms are more quit the front rooms are too noisy because of the busy street try to get a backside room  
P =>   Rooms disapointing and in need of updating We stayed at the Americana hotel for a weekend  and I booked it after looking at reviews here and on other sites  also the price was excellent and the location seemed ideal The room was very disapointing  on first look  it seemed nice until we turned the light on  The carpet was dirty  not that anything was on it  it was obvious it had been hoovered  but it was in bad need of shampooing  most of the carpets throughout the halls were the same  The blind  which had a leaf pattern which resembled a hash plant didn t go up  so lights always had to be on  The bathroom was small  the shower door  which was well worn  just about opened enough for me to get through and tiles were broken on the floor and the walls  It was in great need of updating Unfortunately the room we stayed in must have either previously been a smoking room or was above a yard used by smoking employees as a stale smoke smell lingered in the room at all times  Also when we stayed it was very hot in London and that didn t help the stuffiness of the room Apart from that I couldn t fault anything else  plus points  the staff were friendly  the hotel breakfast was fine  the location was excellent  just a few minutes walk to Baker Street tube station and ten minutes walk from Oxford Street I wouldn t stay at the Americana again  unless I knew the rooms had been updated  if you don t mind the above I would say stay there  but for no longer than a few days  
P =>   Slightly disappointing considering all the good reviews I stayed at the Americana with a friend for   nights in e  I had booked this hotel based on its good reviews  The location of the hotel is perfect  it s really close to the Baker St tube station and there s a few shops and pubs near the hotel too The website where we booked didn t specify between twin and double room  but I asked for a twin room in my booking  When we got there  we got a double room at the back of the hotel  It was tiny and stuffy  didn t seem very clean and the toilet flush wasn t working  Based on this room  I would have rated this hotel at a    we were very disappointed  We spoke to the guy at reception  who was very friendly  if we could get a different room  but unfortunately they were booked out that night  but he offered to give us a different room on the following day  The second room we got was a twin room and it was a lot bigger and nicer  Everything was working fine and we were happy enough  Both of the rooms could ve done with a lick of paint though  Breakfast was OK  I m not sure if I d really stay there again  but it s good value and in a great location  so if you re only going to stay for a few nights it should be grand  
P =>   Perfect location for a short stay in London We stayed at the Americana in y       We had   days to see the sights and the Americana was a perfect base with the Baker Street and ylebone stations only a few minutes  stroll away  Having Regents Park so close is lovely and there are several pubs and restaurants nearby  The Volunteer pub was a great find   We had a room at the rear of the hotel which was really quiet   unexpected for London  The bed was really comfortable  room was clean and the bathroom small but with a good shower  Breakfast was adequate  We would stay here again on our next visit to London  My only suggestion would be a kettle and teabags for a late night or early morning cuppa  
P =>   Brilliant would definitely stay there again  Stayed here for   nights whilst in town for the LIMS show  Lovely clean foyer  excellent fresh continental breakfast  free drinks from the lobby  polite staff  very secure  Great location for tourism  being about a   minute walk from Baker Street tube station  Room was on the small side but inconsequential as we were out until midnight every night  Clean bathroom  safes fitted in rooms  Lift stops on the  rd floor and is small  so beware if carrying large amounts of luggage  Quite a lot of traffic noise at the front due to location on main road but this didn t affect our sleep On the basis of our stay  I would most definitely stay there again  
P =>   a real find  this is a great little hotel tucked away behind baker st the rooms are lovely and clean with beautiful decor The staff are superb nothing is too much trouble As a single woman traveller I felt very safe in this hotel I will DEFINITELY stay here again when in London I do hope this hotel keeps its lovely atmosphere and dosent resort to any gimmicks to raise their profile Stay just as you are    
P =>   Excellent location and very clean Great location and very clean but take a kettle if you need a drink first thing in the morning as drinks available only from downstairs  Also take ear plugs if a light sleeper as traffic very loud  Staff really friendly  breakfast good  would go again but maybe not in ust as it would be a choice of being too hot  window shut to eliminate traffic noise  or being subjected to rumbling lorries and buses all night long  
P =>  Great location cheap price for London This hotel is in a great location close to Baker Street Station and Regent s Park  It s also walking distance to St Pancras     minutes  where the Eurostar leaves from  My room was a good size and quite comfortable  The complimentary tea  coffee  hot chocolate etc from the coffee machine is a lovely added touch  And the price was cheap for such a central location in London  
P =>   Excellent   especially for location and price This is a small bed and breakfast style location in an excellent location just   minutes walk from Baker Street Tube station and near everything in London  I recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to London on a budget  I stayed in the hotel for   nights after an extended trip to Egypt  The rooms are small but extremely quiet  tons of hot water  excellent spa bath products and an amazing staff with buffet breakfast included  The front desk is open   hrs  There are many excellent reviews on this hotel already so I won t go on   I ll just say that I agree with every positive comment and have absolutely nothing negative to say about this hotel  
P =>   Home away from Home    I booked   nights at the Americana recently and was very pleased by the accommodations  the helpful and friendly staff as well as the convenient location  On a previous trip to the UK in       I stayed in several reputable hotels in Earls Court  The rooms in the Americana were larger with better storage areas and new flat screen televisions  and personally I felt like the Regent s Park Baker Street area was a more desirable place to stay   and the room rate was actually a few quid less  The en suite bathrooms were also larger and well appointed  I extended my stay there for a day and later returned after a week of travel to stay for another day before my flight home  Finally  everyone who worked there was cordial no matter the time of day or night that I encountered them  and helpful to me for local information  This was definitely not the case in several of the other hotels I have encountered  many of which put restrictions on the times you can come and go  I would recommend this hotel to any American traveler who is looking for a good value in a safe comfortable and convenient hotel  
P =>   A little disappointed overall but plenty of positives  Just come back from the Americana  I would have rated      but my good lady thought   at first but then   by departure Pros  Location  close to Baker Street tube     mins walk from Oxford Street  Hyde Park    mins walk to Regents Park  Very pleasant staff  complained about pokey double room so they gave us a nicer twin in the basement with no cafuffle  Bathrooms nice and modern with mosaic tiling  Reception area very nice with free coffee  not great  mind    tea and apples  nice touch  Breakfast an ample continental with boiled eggs and a choice of cooked meats Cons  First room tiny  once you get past the reception area  the light colour carpets and decor is not in a good state  in need of attention soon  Our second room was more spacious but walls and carpets badly marked  ceiling marked       lots of cobwebs and bathroom a little grimy in the  quot hard to get quot  areas I would go back  my good lady would at a push but she would prefer to return to the Astor Court if available Highlights of break  Dinner at Langhans Bistro  fab  and late night kebabs from the peculiar kebab shop just over the road from hotel  small but incredibly tasty with home made chips    
P =>  very good decision to stay in americana the real reason for myself to chose americana hotel is to stay close to the venue where I had a very important appointment the following day and I required a good night sleep Inspite of being in the heart of London  it was very quiet and my room was very neat and tidy  The automatic coffee machine was an asset for the place making a coffee so easy  The gentleman who was at the reception was very kind and helpful as well  The breakfast was very good and served well Overall for the purpose of my visit and stay I can t ask for anything more and it served its purpose more than anticipated I am sure that I will be staying again in this hotel if I have an important venture in London Excellent for a single person staying for official business and possibly for anybody who wants to stay in the heart of the city but a quiet and neat place  
P =>   Really lovely hotel Just came back after saying   nights here  What can I say about this place  Firstly it s in a great location  safe and easy access to town  The room is tiny but as we only stayed in the room to sleep  I have no complaints  The shower room was small also  but the shower was fantastic  powerful and hot  The breakfast was lovely and the place was clean  the staff were very helpful Overall I really loved this place and will return here again  The only thing that stopped me rating this hotel the highest was that it need a coat of paint and new carpets but I have stayed in far more expensive hotels and which were not a patch on this place  
P =>  great location and super clean Been in the Americana hotel for   nights  Cannot fault it  The rooms are normall for london quite small but do the job  The location is absolutly fantastic   stops by the underground from Oxford circus   Hotel staff were really friendly  Cannot do enought for you  Highly recomanded  Will go back 
P =>   Super experience at Americana This is a super hotel although the weather was poor being in such a nice bright clean and convenient hotel made up for everything  It is perfectly located for shopping in Selfridges and other stores in Oxford Street  For guests the reception area is a spot where one can watch tv  have coffee and wait in great comfort in beautifully decorated surroundings  The rooms are well appointed with lovely interior decoration Also  the linen and bedroom furnishing were delightful  The helpful check in and continued support of the staff at the desk with information throughout our stay from sunday until tuesday made our short break in London memorable  Just one small thing the brass on the front door should be polished like the Brass Rail restarant on the ground floor of Selfridges  
P =>   Typical tourist hotel in overpriced London Stayed one night in this hotel  Rooms quite small  but very clean and within easy distance of Regents Park  Baker Street and other transport  Okay for a night or two and doubtless a typical tourist class hotel in over priced London  
P =>   Great location for the price Booked this hotel for a mid week break in London  Really liked the townhouse style of hotel and its great location near Baker street tube station and Madam Tussauds  Tour buses also go from the area  The hotel itself has a few down points  as other reviewers have noted  The Carpets  where do I begin    They are in a bad state  If they replaced them this would be a really nice hotel  We had booked a twin room for two nights but they only had a double  so they offered us another room free of charge  which was very nice considering we weren t bothered  Bathrooms very clean and modern  Rooms are small but do the job  They offer really nice tea coffee all day in reception which is a nice touch after a long day sight seeing  Would recommend it for its location and price but wish they d just get new carpets  
P => Very Nice  Nice area with few shops and restaurants and very nice parc across  Easy access to the underground  Breakfast was nice  Cheese  toast  croissants  Toilets are very nice  which room also is  All in all really nice hotel   D 
P =>  Enjoyed our stay This is a great hotel  especially for the price and location  It s located near beautiful Regent s Park  the tube  restaurants and a laundromat  There s also a mini grocery and an internet cafe nearby  Robert and Simon at the front desk were very helpful  changing my room when requested  due to construction noise   the new room was fine  and going out to purchase clothes hangers when I requested more than were in the room  Beyond that Robert was very helpful in suggesting itineraries and places to visit and overall he was very friendly  making our trip even more enjoyable  The negative points of the hotel were not many and were not significant or sustaining  I would definitely stay at the Americana again  Our stay was in the first half of       this review is way overdue  when there was construction in the building next door so  as I mentioned  our first room was noisy but Robert moved us to a new room which was nice and quiet  The room faced the street which I didn t find to be loud despite what others have written  The rooms are small  only one person can really walk between the bed and the wall at a time  but unless you plan on spending a lot of time in your hotel room I wouldn t worry about it  The elevator is a neat  old style one with a gate  but it s small and doesn t go to the very top floor  If you have a large suitcase you might not be able to fit a second person into the elevator at the same time  Regarding the television  I remember that some people wrote that the stations were limited and that there was no remote control in the room but we had quite a few stations and there was indeed a remote in the room  All in all it was a great deal  After hours of online research  the Americana was the cheapest  yet still decent  hotel that I could find  So if you want to save money this is the place to go  The free breakfast is also a great draw  I m from the US and only remember that I paid      US dollars per night for two people in a double for ten nights through Otel com  I think that might have converted to    British pounds per night at the time  
P =>  A good choice I have stayed at the Americana on business on several occasions during       The hotel is in a nice location  close to the tube  Baker Street about a   min walk   For a small  comfortable hotel in central London  I think this hotel is very good value  I ve stayed in several different rooms and found each to be clean well laid out and functional The bathrooms  although small  and minus a bath   are clean and modern  the water is hot throughout the day  The breakfast is continental buffet style but there s a reasonable choice and as much as you want I ve never had a problem checking in or out Things that could put off some visitors    it s on a busy road and anyone staying at the front of the hotel WILL hear traffic noise    there s no restaurant so you ll have to eat out or bring something back  Tesco is only just down the road    the TV gets tuned from the reception desk  you can t do it from your room  Every time I ve stayed I ve only had   channels on the TV but different ones each time   can be annoying if you d planned to watch football on ITV and there isn t an ITV  Reception can sort this out though  
P =>   Fine location nich bathrooms   Very bright   on   th floor   but small rooms  Very good closetspace   and very beautyfull new bathrooms  amazingly big The carpet all over was looking very dirty  and as other rewiers  we found some dirt under the bed that wasn t ousr  A very big shame  cause expect from that  it would be a perfect place  to that price Practical location  only   minutes walk from the easy bus stop  and Bakerstreet subway and close to oxford street  
P =>   Great Hotel for high priced London I was pleasantly surprised with this hotel  I did a ton of research on trip advisor until I found the best hotel for less than      a day that didn t look or sound absolutely disgusting  Once we found the hotel our experience was great  we took the long route  but it s really only   blocks from the tube   The desk attendant was helpful and efficient  When we asked for a fan for the room he had one there when we returned  The room looked just like the pictures I saw on here  It was small but not claustrophobic  clean  and nicely decorated  The only problem we had was the shower did not work the first time we tried to use it  We called the front desk which did not seem that surprised to hear about our problem  However  within    minutes someone came down and fixed and we didn t have any other problems  The continental breakfast was excellent  Not only was there a coffee machine  there was juice  milk  cereal  yogurt  fruit  croissants  rolls  toast  deli meats and cheeses  This is a great  relatively inexpensive hotel for overpriced London and I would absolutely stay there again and look forward to it  
P =>   Satisfied Customer We found and booked the Americana at short notice relying on website reviews and were not disappointed  Walking distance from the Bakerloo tube station with an adequate number of bars and eateries nearby  Nicely renovated checkin with adjacent lounge and breakfast room  Our two rooms were not overly spacious or low in price  but it is London  However they were clean and comfortable and adequately fitted out  and there was an elevator  Included breakfast was not quite the full English  but still a good standard  A well presented hotel with friendly and helpful staff  
P =>   Good little find Brilliant little hotel   we stayed one night while attending a concert and   mins walk from Bakerloo line  the hotel was clean  en suite had just been done out and it looked like the room had been too Staff very friendly on reception  would definately recommend if going to London   we will definately use again   
P =>   Good for the price  lovely staff Myself and my fiance stayed here for   nights from y  th  th  We were in London for the Live Earth gig so i chose this hotel as I had read the good reviews on Tripadvisor and knew that it was near the Baker st tube  on the Wembley Park line  It was indeed VERY convenient  Near Oxford st for shopping  a stones throw from Madame Tussauds and handy for Wembley Stadium  We were in one of the basement rooms  which to be honest  were pretty small  There was a patio door rather than a window so I was a little worried about security but we had no probs at all  Room was clean and modern and the bathroom was good  with great pressure in the shower  Excellent hearty breakfast was available and the staff were lovely  a nice man at reception got us tickets to Madame Tussauds for     each vs the     we would have paid at the door    When we checked out they let us leave our bags there until we caught our flight  Good experience  would stay there again  
P =>   really nice place to stay What a lovely small hotel  Such a find in London when a lot of the smaller places are awful  The staff were really friendly and helpful  Rooms were quite small but were tastefully decorated and had a flat screen TV  The bathroom was very pleasant and the large overhead rainshower very boutique  The breakfast was plentiful and lots of choice  the lounge area with free tea and coffee very modern  The only very minor downsides for me were A bit noisy when staying on the fourth floor above the street   between   am and    pm  The room was very hot due to the temperature in London during my stay  no air conditioning but a large window  a nice area outside the window to sit if you can get out there  This hotel is in a really nice area  it is quite upmarket and felt safe at night for two females travelling alone I will definately return here again  its one of the best    I have stayed at in London  Compare this to the    Russell square  rooms were smaller but service and food much better  This hotel is quite central and its easy to get around with   tube stations so close  
P =>   Really VERY pleased with my stay We stayed just one night in the Americana  but I was very impressed  Yes  the room was small  but very well laid out and furnished in light colours so it didn t seem claustrophobic  The bathroom  although again small  had a very good overhead  rain  style shower  as well as a standard fitting  Breakfast was good  The lounge area is a real bonus for a    hotel  and the free tea or coffee a lovely touch  It would seem the bad reviews here are mostly from a couple of years ago  The hotel has been renovated since then  and is now of a standard to compete with hotels in the higher rating categories  I ll have no hesitation staying there again  
P =>   Great location lovely hotel We really enjoyed our stay at the Americana  We were there at the end of ch and stayed for four nights  The staff were all very nice  The room was small  but pleasant  and the location was excellent  It s within two blocks of two different tube stations  It s also on a quiet street  but near several good restaurants and pubs  Everything was very clean and comfortable  This is a great hotel for the budget minded  We would definitely stay there again  
P =>   a wonderful welcome  we stayed there for   days and it was an enjoyable stay    the hotel is small but cosy   somewhat noisy in the fact that we could hear our neighbours  but we were lucky to have considerate neighbours The hotel has a nice lobby where there is a coffee machine available so hot drinks are complimentary as there is no kettle in the rooms  The continental breakfast consisted of bread  toast  croissants and pastries  hams and cheeses eggs and other cereals and yoghurts    plenty for a hearty breakfast to set you for the day   and there was never a shortage of the food The shower room was of a good size  and so was the bed room Above all  the staff were extremely helpful and so welcoming Would definitely stay there again  
P => Great experience  Best location in a peaceful area in the heart of London A boutique hotel   a very cosy lobby   sitting room with a variety of complimentary coffee   tea  Very very clean and warm rooms recently renovated so everything is brand new Amazed with continental breakfast which included juice all kind of coffee   tea   selection of cereals   bread   croisants Also fruit   yoghourt  cheese   ham  smoked turkey   boiled eggs etc Above all the people that were very friendly   profesional and helpful  
P =>  Great Location Friendly Staff It was a very nice experience staying at Americana Hotel The staff is available anytime you need them   always willing to help with any information you require The location is great  just    min walk from Oxford Street and   min from Bakers Street underground station from which you can easily move around the city  Rooms are very clean  You can enjoy complimentary coffee  tea anytime in the  quot warm quot  lobby area  We also found breakfast to be very satisfying  Room rates are very reasonable Surely would enjoy using the same hotel during our next stay in London  D  Petrou S  ChristodoulouCyprus 
P =>  Good value hotel  We stayed for three nights at the Americana Hotel  The hotel has a very pleasant lobby area where breakfast is served and where complimentary hot drinks are available throughout the day  The double room we had was small but was clean and tidy  towels changed each day and the staff on reception were helpful and friendly  The hotel is very conveniently located a few minutes walk from Baker Street Tube Station  This is a budget hotel and for the price was good value for money  Car Parking is available outside of the hotel during the night but the NCP car parks nearby are expensive to use during the day  
P =>   good location decent price We stayed at the hotel just after it had been refurbished and are very satisfied about the new standard  especially the brand new bathrooms are nice   The rooms vary in size  you can barely turn around in some of the bathrooms  however  we were lucky to get a room with a large bathroom  Rooms have small LCD TVs which lacks international stations  unfortunately The staff is available      and is very friendly and helpful  Nice breakfast and complimentary tea coffee etc is available at any time  Good location  decent pricing  
P => Some problems but liked it Ipve stayed at Americana for   consecutive year and I agree  the rooms are small  the access to the  th floor must be made through stairs only  a nightmare if you are carrying heavy luggage    yes  the bedcovers are usually dirty  the breakfast is complete  however not tasty  but bath towels are clean  the personnel is attentive and helpful  not to mention the excellent location and    hour desk service   Indeed  it would demand a refurbishment  and actually it s going to be through one this year   Besides all that  I still recommend it  for we travel to see London  not the hotel    
P =>  Nice little hotel I stayed in a single room e        The room was downstairs and at night I could barely hear the rumble of the tube  Baker St  tube station is   blocks away   Walls were thin and I could hear my neighbors shower  among other things   Room was very small  but I expected that  I went to see London not to stay in the hotel room   The shower is the size of a phone booth  The room has no air conditioner  from what I could tell   but it wasn t really needed  The TV only had about   stations  and no CNN  The staff was friendly and helpful  I liked it when they handed me the key to my room instead of placing it on the counter  A small quiet pub is next door

P =>   A great stay  I stayed in a triple room with my retired parents for   nights at the end of tember  We had a triple suite with a double bed  chairs and a refrigerator in the main area and two small beds up a small set of stairs  almost like a large ladder   It was perfect for us as I had some space to myself  The rates are great for the location and the hotel  as it is very clean and well run  The breakfast was adequate for us and included in the rate  I would like to point out that the manager Judith went over and above good service levels for us  I was sick during the stay and Judith made a doctor s appointment for me and ensured we were able to get in quickly and get there easily  I would like to thank her for all her help and kind words  We all truly appreciated what she did for me I have stayed at other value hotels in London  but none so accomodating as the Amsterdam  
P =>   Affordable suite with excellent customer service  We stayed in two suites on two occasions  The twin suite      with   twin beds was small but adequate although you were aware of street noise because it faced the street  The wallpaper was old but the sofa was new  The mattresses could use updating but were acceptable  The double suite      we stayed in was large and very quiet as it faced the back  The suite was attractive and comfortable although the sofas  wallpaper  carpet  and mattress could use refreshing  Both suites had a refrigerator and microwave plus dishes which was very handy  Each had its own water heater so there was plenty of hot water  The best thing about this hotel was that it was kept very clean and the customer service was excellent  Also it had non smoking suites  It had a very nice continental breakfast that was included in the room rate  There were two computers with internet and a printer that were free to use plus they had free internet available in the rooms  The hotel is very close to the Earl s Court Underground station which was very convenient  The staff was friendly and helpful and the manager went out of her way to make sure that all was well with our stay  I would definitely stay in one of these suites again if I travel to London  
P =>  Integrity Service and Comfort   First Class All the Way  Stayed five nights from t               This hotel is well situated  just around the corner from the Earl s Court tube station  We had a two room suite  which included a separate bedroom and sitting area  Very spacious with lots of natural light  The bed was comfy  although the mattress could have been a bit firmer  Amenities included a microwave oven  kettle along with coffee and tea  dishes  and a small fridge  Very spacious bathroom with tub and shower  Take note  the hotel only has one very tiny lift  so be prepared to take the stairs on occasion  The head manager Judith  along with the rest of her staff  were absolute gems  Very helpful and pleasant to deal with  I mention integrity in the review title  Here s why     When we checked in  Judith did not charge us the entire stay in advance  as most other hotels in the area do     At the end of our stay  we ordered a minicab to London City airport for    pounds  Most other hotels charge between    to    pounds for the same trip  because they levy a  quot booking fee   commission quot  on top of the base fare  Judith does not charge this fee  These folks are a class act all the way  Judith and her staff aren t out to take advantage of travellers  like so many other hotels are  They are honest  genuine people   working to ensure that their clients have a stress free and enjoyable stay in London  Highly recommended  
P =>  depends on the room you get    I have stayed at this hotel multiple times  and I have learned that your experience at this hotel will very much depend on the room you get  The rooms range from tiny to huge   and sometimes the huge rooms are cheaper than the tiny rooms  You need to specify in advance if you want a larger room and they will usually do what they can to help  The smaller rooms are fine if you are travelling alone but they are really hard to manage with another person  The twin rooms are larger than the double rooms so if you don t mind you and your spouse sleeping separately  I recommend asking for a twin instead of a double  Some of the twins actually have two twin beds PLUS a double bed  For only    pounds Pros  The price is fabulous for London  and if you get a larger room  it s really a fantastic deal  Even with a small room it s a good deal given the price of most London hotel rooms  The location is excellent  It s a   minute walk from Earls Court subway and a few stops away from all the good stuff   shopping  restaurants  etc   Covent Gardens  Soho  etc    The staff are generally very friendly and helpful  The last time we came we had just gotten off a redeye transatlantic flight and we arrived at  am   and they did everything they could to get us into a room asap despite being fully booked  We got a room by   am  which we were very grateful for  They also have free wireless in the room  And if you don t have laptops  there are two computers with internet access  albeit slow  Cons  The breakfast isn t great   toast  cereal  coffee  fake juice   but it s included in the already reasonable price and for very little extra you can order a hot breakfast  The biggest con for me is that some of the hotel staff smoke  and they seem to smoke somewhere in the building  When they smoke  you can smell it in the rooms  This is really annoying if you are a non smoker  In general  I highly recommend this hotel  
P =>   Great hotel for the price and excellent service from the staff  We stayed here for   nights during our      trip to Europe  The hotel was great and the staff could not have been friendlier  They answered all of our questions and one extremely helpful lady went the extra mile and helped with laundry services Our room was very clean and nicely appointed  We had a balcony  but it was not private  There were complimentary tea and coffee making supplies in the room  I took an international travel charger and the room had several outlets available  I used the free WiFi everyday with my iPhone to check email and email pictures  The only negative I can report was the size of the shower  but this is London  The shower was maybe    quot x   quot  but it worked with plenty of hot water  I cannot comment on the breakfast because the service started at  a and we left every morning before it was served The hotel was literally around the corner from the Earl s Court tube station which was very convenient  There were several restaurants on the street as well as a Starbucks A great place to stay in London  
P =>  Excellent hotel for a short stay value for moeyvery good locationcleancomfortable and friendly  Situated just round the corner from Earls Court tube station in a very smart and quiet road the Hotel Amsterdam provides the perfect stop for a short stay in London  The staff are friendly and the continental breakfast is very good it is a long time since I have had really hot toast so quickly provided  The rooms are clean and comfortable  Some will say they are small but for a short stay they are all that you need  We will be going again  
P =>   Fabulous hotel with just a few minor problems The Amsterdam Hotel is beautiful  the staff is friendly and helpful  and the suite that I stayed in       was spacious and couldn t possibly be cleaner  There are only three relatively small things that made it less than perfect  and I have waited this long to write a review because I really didn t want to say anything the least bit bad about them because otherwise they are so very nice  Here it is   I ll get the three smallish things out of the way then will go on to the good stuff     As someone else mentioned  there was regularly an awful smell of cigarette smoke that came into the room from the hallway  I could not stop the smoke  even with a towel under the door  I called downstairs to ask what the deal was   it was a nonsmoking hotel  They said sometimes people smoked in the hallways  they couldn t do anything about it  I really have a problem with cigarette smoke so that was not good    The door bolt didn t work  The door did lock  but I felt somewhat vulnerable without a bolt    The bed was extremely hard  That works for some people  but not for me There  Those are the ONLY bad things  Other than those  the place was fantastic  The suite had a nice kitchenette with toaster  refrigerator  hot water maker  microwave  cutlery and cups dishes provided  They provided sugar  tea and instant coffee as well  The living area was large  the lift was hilariously small but did fit me and my suitcase  there s a grate that you close manually  and you see the wall going by as you go from floor to floor   the bathtub was fantastic  There is also a shower The room had its own hot water heater so there was an ample supply  and the water heater closet was somewhat warm so a perfect place to hang dry some of my hand washed items And the cleanliness    I don t think I ve ever seen such a squeaky clean hotel room and bathroom  Absolutely could not possibly have been cleaner  There are two computers with a printer and high speed internet available in the basement  Very convenient for printing boarding passes  directions or what not  I m not sure if there is wifi in the rooms because I couldn t be bothered to bring my laptop The hotel is right around the corner from Earls Court tube station  which has a lift  The Piccadilly  Circle and District lines all go through Earls Court  so you can get anywhere in London quickly and easily  And if one line is down  one of the others is working  You can take your luggage on the lift down to the underground and zip directly to Heathrow very easily on the Piccadilly line   it goes directly into the terminal  Also  there is a ks  amp  Spencer  Starbucks  several chemist shops  Wagamama  Sainsbury and post office very close to the hotel  Extremely convenient  
P =>  Good Value for Money This hotel is in a good location   close to Earls Court Tube station  We stayed in a flat  which was really roomy with a kitchen  bathroom and living room area  It was clean and comfortable  Breakfast wasn t great but I think they were short staffed  We would definitely stay here again  
P =>  Incredible Service Accommodations With A Smile and Much More  An incredible hotel in London that exceed all expectations beyond my wilest imagination  Below a description of some of wonderful experiences my wife and I encountered  My wife and I are seasoned international travelers for the past    years  Never before have we witnessed such excellent services abroad while on a budget when recently visiting London  We were very conscience that London hotels in Central London are either very expensive and or somewhat difficult to have everything you need in terms of economy pricing along with clean rooms with quality service that go beyond a smile and a handshake  In booking our rooms in Central London  we read the reviews in TripAdvisor Com with much interest  Over      hotels were given to me in my price range  The reviews for each hotel were very contrasting from terrible service accommodations to awkward location to expensive rates and lacking in quality service  The Amsterdam Hotel not only was rated at about     out of       reviews  But clearly exceeded all positive reviews published on line in every category  What a convenience to be located on the Piccadilly underground line directly between Heathrow Airport and Central London when arriving at night with only a simple   minute walk to the hotel from the train station at Earl s Court  London taxi s are very expensive and at no point did we ever have to use a taxi regardless of where it was in London with no more than one subway transfer  At midnight after just checking in  the night clerk could not figure out how to attend the London Temple the next morning in Surrey  a rather complicated trip of over    miles without subway connections  A taxi would have cost us    Sterling Pounds just one way  But the general manager was notified at midnight of our difficulty and immediately joined us in figuring out how to combine the London subway system with The British National Railway system at a rather modest cost and even outlined our first day s sight seeing excursion in a rather coherent manner for Central London  Every time we had a problem  she is the supreme problem solver that every hotel should have  For example  the latest Harry Potter had just come out and we wanted to see it  She figured out where the theatres were  only three in London  and recommended we see it in Wimbledon where there was a iMax theatre for more spectacular video and audio showing  And with the subway system  we could get there in less than    minutes at no cost because we had a unlimited three day underground pass Rooms are modest in size but exceptionally well kept  Clean linens are given daily  Continental breakfast is far more than one serving  You get multiple servings of fruit  juices  choice of cereals  toast  coffee tea and pastry plus you have the option of a hot breakfast for only   pounds more  My wife and I ordered eggs and pancakes prepared to our preferences and ate like royalty for   pounds each along with our generous continental breakfast  When we had to leave at      a m  for Heathrow Airport  they even packed a super breakfast with sandwiches  juice  yogurt and more the night before so we would have something to eat in absence of our missed continental breakfast  Their service desk is staffed      which is great when you need advise  wakeup calls  etc  after hours  Having free wireless Internet service in our room was a complete surprise when I checked in and used well by me  There are even computers in the basement that connect to their wireless Internet service and one of them prints out for you at no charge  And all with no charges for these valuable services  it is amazing and very convenient in a city that is the most expensive city in Europe to stay in and get such repeated excellent services free is an amazement to me  an experienced international traveler Thank you for the opportunity to share my positive experiences at London s Amsterdam Hotel at Earl s Court Till next time John Kuzmich  JrGolden  ColoradoP S  Location is perfect for modest restaurants and only two minutes from a good underground subway station for the District and Piccadilly Lines  
P =>   The perfect little place to stay  We had a suite combo living room  kitchen bedroom bath and balcony with table and chairs  How exquisite  Nothing fancy but definitely comfortable  The bedroom had to put one of suitcases on extra bed to open it up but that is so minor compared to the comfort and the way we were treated  Carried our bags up for us   no lift   the concierge Judy so delightful and helpful and this was during a tube strike  The tube is just around the corner  The continental breakfast was excellent fresh croisants  rolls  toast  cereal  fruit  yogurt  juice and more  Along with a very pleasant serving staff  Felt right at home  
P =>  Excellent exept for a few details This a good hotel  It s conveniently located very close to the Earl s Court underground station  and at the same time you never hear the trains We had a double room on the ground floor  The room was spacious enough  with sitting space  and nicely decorated all in white neutral colours  It also had a direct access to a lovely backyard  The bathroom was fabulous  large  new  tiled  with a good showers  and perfectly clean  In the morning we could hear people talking at the entrance and at the reception desk  but this was a minor problem  The problem was the bed  short  narrow  with an uncomfortable mattress Said that  all the rest was ok  staff  breakfast  wi fi  value for money I read other reviews where people complain about the owner  but I talked to her and she was friendly and helpful with me  
P =>  Fantastic   nights We spent   nights in this hotel in e       We arrived the hotel in the morning  but it wasn t a problem to leave our luggages there until we can get our room  The staff was really nice during our   days  and the room was more than expected  It was very clean and modern  The hotel has a good location  the Earl s Court tube station  zone    is only   minute walk They have internet access and wi fi in the hotel  The breakfast is continental We recommend the hotel for everyone  It s a nice hotel with nice staff  good price and location  Next time we travel to London  I definitely will stay here A family from Hungary 
P =>  A real pleasure   just perfect The Amsterdam Hotel is  as many have said here  a delightful surprise  I have stayed in many London hotels and rarely have I found one as clean  THE top priority for me   friendly and accommodating  My room was handy for the garden and  since it was a sunny day  I was able to take my cup of tea and sit under the shade of the trees  working on my laptop  Shower  bed  TV  kettle etc all perfect  Will certainly try to stay next time I m in London  
P =>   Great value We stayed in suite   and found it clean and very comfortable  The only disappointment was the chairs in the lounge   the springs were broken and the seats were very uncomfortable  The staff were very friendly and the breakfast room staff equally friendly and efficient  The breakfast was adequate and we never had to wait for a table  The location to the tube and the buses was perfect as well access to restaurants and shops  I will definately stay there again as our stay was very pleasant  
P =>   Good location big rooms reasonable price   But not perfect  While the Amsterdam Hotel is not in an ideal neighborhood for tourists visiting London  there s not a lot to see in Earl s Court aside from a couple decent bars in the immediate area   It s location puts it at literally a minute s walk to the Earl s Court Tube Station  so using Hotel Amsterdam as a  quot base quot  for exploring London via the Underground is perfect The hotel staff is pleasant enough  though I have to question their general competancy as the desk person had no idea how their laundry service worked  and could not for the life of him manage to connect an inbound call to my room   And the clerk who checked me out wound up missing the phone charges on the first attempt at billing  BTW  make sure you have them bill you in Pounds and not dollars to avoid losing money on the coversion rate  The  quot rooms quot  are actually suites that have an apartment like feel to them  my suite had a bedroom  bathroom  and little kitchen with a sink and a mini fridge that I stocked up from the local Tesco down the block  It s quite spacious and the windows look out onto the street  The cleaning staff do a very thorough job of keeping the rooms clean  though their insistence on getting into the room to clean it  even if you re dead tired and sleeping off a hangover is a bit of a nuisance    The Internet access speeds are decent via the hotel s wireless service  but I found it a bit of a nuisance that I was continuously prompted to authenticate by their proxy server  The only real complaints I have about the Hotel Amsterdam are related to the plumbing and telephones   The hotel apparently doesn t have sufficient water pressure to all the rooms  so they ve installed a pump that kicks in whenever you turn the water on   This pump is fairly quiet  but can be heard distinctly from anywhere in the suite   To compound this  I found that the toilet needed to be  quot primed quot  before it would flush   Basically I had to repeatedly push the handle down until enough pressure had been built up to allow a proper flush   Very weird experience for me  And lastly there was a phantom water puddle that would appear in the bathroom after I took a shower or used the sink for any length of time   This wasn t a matter of me spilling water  as it would appear  as if by magic  about    minutes after I was done and out of the room  I can only conclude that there was a leak in the connection between the pump used to provide pressure and the room s water heater  and that as the heater tank was refilled  the water would seep up through the floor   This would explain the slight smell of mildew I encountered when entering the stairwell up to the room  i dealt with the issue by using one of the towels the cleaning staff provide each morning  they re VERY generous with towels which is a big plus  to be on permanent mop up duty during my stay  and it really had no major impact on my opinion of the room The telephones won t be an issue for anyone with a GSM phone who s bought a local SIM card  or who has International Roaming enabled through their service provider  but it was a pain for me   The call quality was terrible  The big problem was a great deal of background hiss on the line  which was probably a problem with the handset itself  as playing with the wires yeilded varying degrees of enhanced clarity The complimentary breakfasts are nice  if a bit spartan  croissant  toast  yogurt  milk  and juice   and you ll need to fight for space at a table in dinig room  as they fill up fairly quickly  The hotel also gives you complimentary access to a printer attached to one of their two guest computers  but you may find yourself waiting to get access All in all  this was an interesting hotel  it would be ideal for business travelers on a medium length trip  a small family traveling on a budget  a group of travelers who don t mind sharing accomodations and splitting the bill  but it s probably not ideal for single travelers looking for a place to crash  too big and expensive  or a couple looking for a bit of romance  service is lacking and the location isn t ideal   As I said  the hotel staff seem a bit iffy to me  they were pleasant and helpful  they just didn t seem well trained or fully interested in their work All that having been said  I would recommend the Hotel Amsterdam to anyone looking for a fairly comfortable room on a budget in London  The location  space provided  and cleanliness of the rooms all combine to make it a good value in spite of the odd shortcomings  
P =>   Good hotel reasonable price by London standards Good location  literally one minute walk from Earl s Court Underground station  reasonably priced by London standards      for a single room   friendly staff  room very tight but very clean and well maintained  couldn t get breakfast as the breakfast room was full  overall a good hotel 
P =>   We really loved it  My son and I stayed at The Amsterdam Hotel n the middle of ruary for    days  It was definately value for money  We found the studio apartment to be spotless and the staff friendly and helpful  We enjoyed the breakfast  it was good start to the day  The location is excellent and I agree  the tube station is alot closer than it looks on the map and it s so easy to get around  Earls Court is a lovely area with many restaurants  Judi was a big help to us and I would recommend this hotel and would stay there myself again if I m lucky enough to visit London again  
P =>   Perfect place to lay your head We arrived at Amsterdam hotel Sat  ch    at    am  left our bags with the front desk and we were off to see a little of London  Arrived back at hotel   pm and the staff had our bags in our rooms  Triple room was on the first floor and single on second floor  Being a senior and my room on the second floor my only problem  as others have stated  is the stairs but the elevator is roomy enough for three  The triple      was quite roomy with two double beds arranged almost like two separate rooms  Bath had bath and shower and overlooked garden  My room       had a double bed and shower in bath and overlooked Trebovir Rd  Both rooms were spotless and were kept that way during our week at the hotel  We didn t partake of the continental breakfast so cannot comment  Staff and the owner were very helpful  Except for a glitch we both had with the televisions on the first day  everything was great  Earls Court tube station right around corner just past Micky Ds hot coffee  and Somerfield store fresh breakfast rolls   With breakfast in hand we were on our way each morning to a new adventure  Would definately stay at Amsterdam Hotel again  
P =>   Really friendly helpful staff and great location Stayed here for one night for a visit to Hammersmith Apollo  Clean and well appointed rooms were all I expected and the staff could not have been more helpful and friendly  The continental breakfast was adequate  although the optional breakfast at extra an charge did not offer sausage or bacon  But that small gripe aside  omelette and baked beans was fine by me  The location was really close to the underground station  closer than it appeared on the maps  literally just round the corner in fact  a real plus Slept like a baby all night with no external noise distraction  Really good place for a short stay in the capital  
P =>   Awful arrogant place Well finally it seems this place has been discovered for what it really is  I am getting married in   weeks and booked   rooms for friends visiting from afar  I arranged this with a member of staff over the phone  emailed and received a response email from a member of staff  When I had not heard from the hotel  I phoned  only to be told that they have no record of my booking The lady I spoke to  told me she was the manager had no apologies for the mixup  she didn t care on the importance of the day and that my friends were looked after  She told me that my emails    of them  were not received  I work in I T  and my job depends email funcion  she was lying to me and she didn t even offer to check  She told me that she had to give her staff the benefit of the doubt  what ever happened to the customer is always right  She then told me that the same weekend was an exhibition at Earls Court and basically intimated that they weren t in need of my business  after which she told me that they were refusing my booking as I was obviously upset and my stay wouldn t be a happy one  What a horrible arrogant place and I would beg people to go somewhere more professional to spend their money   this place doesn t deserve the business and the only reason they get it is because of trip advisor  Go to the Premier Inn if you want value for money  
P =>  Excellent Location Geat Value We stayed for   weeks with our two children      amp      along for the ride  Only   minutes from the tube and we even managed to get there from the Heathrow with all our luggage  The location of the hotel was excellent and the tube is one of the best transport networks in the world  The accomodation was fine  lots of stairs but there is a small lift for when you run out of steam  If you think you will gets lots of space anywhere in London  you are kidding yourself  The price was right  the owner Judy was very easy to deal with  Breakfast each morning was a good start to the day  I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a good  safe and central location in London  
P =>   OK for location and service OK  for   nights I stayed with my family   p  in this hotel Perfect location  very close to Earl s court tube  district line  circle line  piccadiliy line  My  quot family room quot  was clean and confortable  not so great but it is normal   bathroom is a bit small Hotel s personnel available to help usBreakfast continental  quot able quot  to give us the strong for a walking day Hotel supplies a free wifi connection in each room  in my family room it was    Enrico  from Rome Italy 
P =>   Pleasant Stay As a single female traveller  after researching many London hotels  I chose the Amsterdam Hotel based on the good reviews  location and ultimately  the very good price Access to the hotel from Heathrow is very easy  It s about a   min Tube ride in on the Piccadilly line which is the cheapest option if you can handle all your baggage  Arrival at Earl s Court Station is easy as well since there s a lift to street level and the hotel is    min walk away Checking in was easy and I was giving a single room  The room is absolutely spotless  including the bedding and small bathroom  The room is fairly small  but as a solo traveller  it was good enough especially considering the price I paid  There was enough space to spread out my suitcase and a place to hang my clothes  In addition to the things needed to make coffee or tea  the desk also had a couple of magazines  like a included National Geographic which was a pleasant surprise  There are only a few tv channels available  which was fine for me  But I do wish there was a clock radio in the room for I prefer to listen to the radio and also had to rely on my travel alarm clock for time  I found the two free computers with internet access and printer  in the lower level very convenient and was a plus when booking the hotel  The bathroom in my room was very small  and as expected from others  reviews  taking a shower will make the entire floor wet  It s not the best set up for a bathroom  but I used towels  replaced daily  to protect the doorway and it was fine Breakfast was served from    am to    am  Continental style is free with your stay or you can pay a bit more for a hot breakfast  I didn t go with the latter because I was satisfied with the various cereals  toast  croissant and muffins available  And there was juice and tea or coffee too  In the neighbourhood there are lots of restaurants that can be used for takeaway and grocery shops as well I felt the reviews on TripAdvisor provided an honest account of what to expect with Amsterdam Hotel and I was very satisfied with my stay for the price I paid  I would definetly recommend this hotel to others who are looking for a comfortable stay in a good location  
P =>   Great Little Place This is a great little place to stay in London  and is not ridiculously expensive either  In fact  the price of the hotel is fantastic  when you consider it is more or less in central london and the hotel is also a very good   star The hotel itself is located just round the corner from Earls Court tube station  which gives easy access to all the great sites in London  Hotel is pleasant  with friendly staff and the room we stayed in was also very plesant  Very spacious and very modern  with a great view off the area from the balcony  At the time we were there  there was some renovation work going on but noise was unheard of as it was quiet the whole of our stay  which was good  The area around the hotel is busy  but not noisy     with lots of shops and restaurants to choose from  which is ideal if you want to avoid the expensiveness of central london Overall we really liked this hotel  and would defnitely return again to it in the future  
P =>  Amsterdam Location of the Amsterdam Hotel is second to none in terms of proximity to tube  and access from Heathrow and to amenities of London  Hotel is spotless  the included continental breakfast will get you started for the day  staff very friendly and helpful  bathrooms well supplied with towels  Have stayed here twice so far  and would definitely stay again  Have had two different types of room  a triple with reasonable sized bathroom  and a single which had a small double bed and a tiny bathroom  Rates good for location and convenience  Free internet access with printer very handy  The building is oldish but very well maintained  Plenty of places to eat close by  and a few pubs too  Have tried the Nandos and Gourmet burger Kitchen  both good  M amp S food place and Boots nearby also  Not too far to walk to museums  
P =>   Couldnt have wished for a better place to stay  We arrived at the hotel and the check in process was so quick  we were given our room key and all the details about breakfast  internet  its free  downstairs in the basement   etc  I have to say that the elevator is so tiny but cute and both my fiance and I and two suitcases did manage to squeeze into it Our room was on the top floor  and it was magnificent and very spacious  we truely couldnt have wished for a better place to stay in London We had two double beds  our ensuite  a tv and a lovely view of the rooftops of Earls Court Earl s Court is a lovely suburb with a quite small town appealI I would definately recommend this hotel  which is in fact a bugdet hotel  to anyone and everyone  We stayed during tember for   nights and paid around   pounds per night for a double room  which we thought was a steal  
P =>   Great place  We were staying at this hotel in uary of this year for   nights This hotel is realy excellent  Everything was excellent  quality of service  room  cleanliness etc Especially cleanlines was spot on  Room was not very big but it had everything you could need plasma tv and a coffee maker    and was nicely decorated  Our room NR     had a huge tarrace where  if the weather is fine  you could enjoy your thee or breakfast     Location of hotel is very good   minutes walk to Earls Cort tube station and trains  If you are coming from Gatwick its about   stops from Victoria tube station thats about    minutes   Proximity to the tube makes it very easy to go sightseeing  Area is also very good  with plenty of shops and restaurants and is safe to walk around  Especialy if you realise how expensive other hotels can be in London  then is this hotel realy extreme good value  We would absolutely recommend this hotel and we cant wait to come back to London and stay at this hotel again Thank you Amsterdam Hotel  
P =>   Vey Nice hotel   Quiet and Accessible I stayed at the Amsterdam London hotel for five days during early ember       My room was a single room on the second floor  The hotel is a very good budget hotel  quiet and accessible to the underground  one minute walk to the Earl s Court station on the Piccadilly line  The Piccadilly line is connected directly to the airport and to downtown   The hotel is recommended as a base for touring London  There is a large Tesco supermarket ten minutes walk and plenty of restaurants and shops along the adjacent Earl s Court Road The breakfast room is very clean  as is the entire hotel   and the continental breakfast with cereals and canned fruit is more than adequate  The staff is extremely helpful and courteous at the reception and the breakfast room  There are only    rooms at the hotel so there is not much traffic and the service is personal  There are two internet enabled computers and a printer in the lower floor which are free for use Although the hotel has been refurbished it is still an old building and therefore some minor maintenance is occasionally required  The water pressure in the shower is low as mentioned in a previous review  My room lacked a dresser or closet so I was essentially living out of my suitcase  but this is not a problem as everyday I left the hotel early in the morning and came back at night  The bed was very comfortable and I slept well  There is a small TV screen with the basic channels so you can see the news or a movie before going to sleep Overall I felt at home  and had a very nice stay  The price is right for what you get  
P =>  Very good value for money for London The location is quite good  Earls Court  close to the most excellent Balans   the room we were given quite spacious especially for London and for         Some non English native staff was quite hard to understand    but all in all I definitively recommend this hotel  
P =>   Nice budget hotel Amsterdam hotel is a very good budget hotel for travellers who need a tidy place for a rest and washing  The level of the rooms vary  our family room was not the  quot highest quality quot   but there was enough room for us      beds were ok and the room was tidy  The location next to the Earl s Court tube station is excellent and the Earls Court Road is full of restaurants  shops  pubs etc  If you need a peaceful and proper place to stay in London  but you are not willing to pay for high quality walls  this is just a hotel for you  
P =>  Lovely stay With just a   minute walk to Paddington station  this hotel is very convenient for both leisure and business  You can notice the cleanliness from the moment you walk in to reception  Beautifully decorated both inside and outside the hotel  Lovely rooms that make you feel right at home  The bathroom is in excellent condition  A pleasant stay and will defiantly be back again  The price is amazing for the good service and the overall excellence of the hotel  I would recommend it to anyone  
P =>  Great Hotel Great Location This Hotel was pleasant from the moment we arrived untill we left Rooms was small however very adequate Exceptionly Clean in fact i would say spotless Breakfast was ok however was dissapointed with the porridge   Minute from Earls Court station and the staff where very pleasent  Lovely touches like Free Newspapers and Tourist information Would Stay again 
P =>  A great little find  This was my first time in Europe and after   great nights in Edinburgh  See Clarendon Hotel Review  i headed down to London for   nights  A friend of mine who lives locally had arranged to show me around so i booked a double room so that he wouldnt have to commute back and forth We arrived at the hotel and a middle aged woman  I m guessing Judy   said to me the room wasn t ready but they d hold my bag whilst we had lunch  It was   pm and check in wasn t until  pm  So off we went and an hour later came back  We had a room on the  rd floor  Room     with   double beds and it was much more upmarket than i expected  Especially for the price  Beds were very comfortable and of good quality  The floors were wooden and it looked like the room had been renovated maybe a couple of years ago  I suspect though our neighbours might have been able to hear us walking on the floor but then again i never heard anyone above me on the  th floor  ent size tv with free to air and a few cable channels  About    all up The bathroom had a bottle of Gilchrist and Soames SHampoo and Body gel and the soaps were Gilchrist and SOames too  The hotel had a beautiful little garden backyard and a computer room that could be accessed    hours for the use of all guests for free  Next to the laundry in the basement  I really felt like i was staying in a local home it was great  The stairs are a little steep though so be prepared you ll get fit walking up and down them  I did notice too that yes some areas do smell of smoke  i m guessing smoking rooms must be on the  nd and  rd floors  The rooms are all key operated so just remeber to lock them before you go out as the door doesnt lock manually  I nearly got caught out doing that a couple of times  Silly me The lift is very old and as people say it s one of those manual ones you have to literally pull the doors closed yourself  Kind of gave the place more charm The reception is    hours and all staff i came across were pleasant  Couple of Indian guys and Judy The area of Earls Court felt very safe and there are numerous pubs  restaurants and chains  KFC etc  nearby for eating  The tube is literally   mins walk away  I d be very happy to stay here again  I highly recommend it to any first timers  
P =>   A pleasure to stay here We stayed in the Amsterdam Hotel for   nights in y and had a wonderful stay  The hotel is in an excellent spot just  mins walk to Earls Court tube station and really good value for a hotel in central London  Plenty of good restaurants and pubs all within walking distance from hotel Our room was very clean and bright and the staff were very helpful  Judi on the reception desk is lovely always had a smile on her face and was so helpful with information we needed to know Will definitely return some day and have recommened it to all our friends  
P =>  Great experience  My wife and I stayed at the Amsterdam Hotel for   nights from    y to    y       We had booked a suite which was on the third floor  with tiny but efficient lift  and consisted of a living room with kitchenette  equipped with fridge  microwave oven  cutlery  kettle  plates and basic utensils  but no cooking range   sofa  TV  little table and armchair  a bedroom with queen size bed and cabinet with plenty of hangers  a small entrance and a very reasonably sized bathroom  unfortunately with the usual   separate faucets in the sink for which you have the option of either freezing or burning yourself   The only thing we didn t like too much was the fact that the shower s water pressure was a bit on the low side  The flat was in immaculate conditions  spacious  clean  serviced regularly every day  and quiet  with free wireless internet connection and telephone  Breakfast consisted of croissant  tea coffee  fruit juice  cereals  yogurt  toasts  marmalade butter  and fruit  always grapefruit   Although not very varied  it was adequate and for a reasonable extra one could ask for eggs etc Staff were consistently friendly and very helpful  the lobby was full of newspapers and free information on things to do  There were also a couple of PC s in the basement for those without laptop The location is outstanding  just   minute walk from Earl s Court tube station which is serviced by the District and Piccadilly lines  the latter takes you to Heathrow airport in about    minutes   The surrounding area is full of grocery shops and reasonably priced restaurants of good quality All this came for a price of     pounds per day  they didn t even charge us for the phone calls we made   Overall exceptional value for money  certainly we will return  Recommended by all means  
P =>   Just as the reviews promised This hotel was chosen after much research because of the positive reviews and we were not disappointed  I have a girl and boy  ages    and     and had asked if there was any way we could be accommodated  We were given a huge room  room    in the basement with a double bed and   single beds   how perfect  The room and bathroom were clean  looked like new wood laminate flooring for the room  and they provided nice white fluffy towels There were cellar stairs from our room up to the peaceful backyard  Just outside our room in the hall were   computers available to any guests  so we could check e mail while away from home  or find the weather in our next vacation stop  Very nice added convenience I loved that the Earl s Court Underground station was   minutes away  and Judi had given good directions in advance from the airport  Since we only had       days in London  and one would be on the sightseeing tours  we asked Judi for suggestions for our half day  and she had plenty of options  We ended up going to Windsor castle     minutes by tube  then train  and it was great  But don t start too late because it takes a while to see it  She also gave a suggestion for an Indian restaurant just near the hotel which was very tasty In looking at the map  I had been concerned that the Earl s Court station was a bit far from the city center  but once we were on the tube  it didn t seem to be far at all Breakfast had toast  croissant  cereal  juice  coffee  etc  with an extra fee for cooked food I think  We were fine with the bread and cereal Overall it was a lovely experience  and I highly recommend this hotel  
P =>   Stop searching and book here  AMSTERDAM HOTEL LONDONAmsterdam Hotel was a nice surprise  It was better than we expected The staff deserves the best words  Thanks a lot to Judy and the punctual Alan for all their help  No matter how busy they were  they always had time to give us directions  arrange bookings and attend our questions  Months before going I exchanged some mails with the staff and they were extremely polite and friendly  The bedroom was spacious and very cozy  with nice decoration and light color furniture  Two magazines were on the table for us  The beds are very comfortable and it has a view to a beautiful courtyard  There are facilities to prepare hot beverages There s a little TV set  where I would have liked to see a Spanish channel  It also has a heater  The only minus was the little wardrobe  We had plenty of baggage because we were on a    days trip  but it s enough for tourists with less baggage  Everything is spotless and very silent in the night The bathroom has been refurbished and there s plenty of space for toiletries  The shower has a good flush of water The hair dryer is in the room  good idea to save time Don t worry about the adaptor because it s provided in the reception The lift is the tiniest I ve seen in my life  but it gave a touch of personality to the hotel There s a nice business center on the ground floor and both computers can be used freely  It was great  The iron can be used by the guests  though I never used it  There s so many things to do in London instead The breakfast continental is good  but once we had to wait for a table The location is excellent  just a few steps from the tube station  There is everything you need in the neighborhood  laundry  restaurants  supermarkets  etc  In one of them  open till midnight  almost next to the tube  they drop the prices of sandwiches  fruits and other fresh products in the evening  Definitely if I return to London  this will be my only option  
P =>   Greate location   quiet   super clean Finding a nice clean quiet London hotel for under     pounds per night for two  including continental breakfast was a challenge  Amsterdam was tops  Quiet      yeards from the Earls Court tube stop  and very nice people  Highly recommended  
P =>   Clean great service good breakfast quiet well located   After a long and careful reading of the reviews made on this hotel on TripAdvisor  my husband and I decided to book   nights at the Amsterdam in il       and it turned out to be exactly as described on Trip Advisor   FYI  we had a regular room  not a suite  We were in London for leisure purposes  to go out and visit the city  not to stay indoors lounging in the hotel room I hesitated with the Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington  and I asked the Shaftesbury a few questions by email  They never answered back  Ever  So I went for the Amsterdam  whose staff always answered my emails promptly and politely in a timely manner The Amsterdam is an old building  full of charm  the elevator is quite an experience    The key system is old school   they give you a real key that you drop off at the reception when you leave for the day and ask for when you return to the hotel  the desk is open         The staff is very pleasant   polite and helpful  both at the desk and dowstairs in the breakfast area The regular breakfast  buffet style  consisted of   fruit juices  water  tea  coffee  chocolate  milk  toasts    kinds   jams  butter  fruit salads  croissants and pains au chocolat  pas tout frais de la boulangerie mais raisonnables pour un petit d j    some Danish if I remember well  cereals    kinds   yogurts    kinds   apples  bananas  oranges  You can order a warm  quot English quot  breakfast for a surcharge  but we didn t try that  The regular breakfast was more than enough The internet nook  dowstairs  has   free access computers with a printer  Slow connection but enough for emailing and checking the weather reports  The premisses are kept very clean by the staff  Being allergic to smoke  I was a little worried about the  quot staff smoking quot  that other reviewers complained about  but we never had a problem  They lend adapters for your electronic devices  with a deposit They also lend umbrellas  that you just pick up in the lobby on your way out  No deposit asked Some complained about the noise   a fairly common nuisance in hotels   but we were never bothered by that  I am extremely sensitive to the noise  so that would have made my stay miserable  It is all carpeted in the common areas  that helps  be we were lucky to have mindful neighbors  The hotel is on a quiet street  no noise disturbance on that part either The room was nice  modern  very clean  small  by American standards   of course  as we had expected  It is London   Just look at the pictures posted by the travelers  small but functional  We had one big suitcase and two small suitcases  plus winter coats  There is enough space to put that away  in the pantry or on top of it   There was a kettle with tea and coffee  sugar  regular  sweetener  and milk or cream  Our room had a balcony  that unfortunately we could not enjoy due to the bad weather  One of the room keys is to lock the balcony door  The curtains provide a decent darkness for your sleep The courtesy wake up calls are reliable and on time The bed was not bad  it was a double size  which can be a little small for American visitors but normal for European standards  un      je dirais  The bathroom  small but by no means tiny  Very modern  recently remodeled  enough towels  and the toiletries  shampoo soap shower gel  hand soap  and not on the cheap side  The pressure is good  the water temperature is steady  One problem   the shower curtain  The shower is small  this is true  I am thin but I still managed to flood the floor   The curtain lets the water drop outside the shower bottom  It s okay  we just used a towel as a sponge and the room was cleaned every morning  The Amsterdam is located nextdoor to the Underground station    minutes  quot door to door quot   very convenient  We never heard any train noise  There are a lot of restaurants in the area  as well as little supermarkets and a post office The hotel has a little garden in the back  which can be relaxing when the weather is nice Coming from the US  the room was expensive  but this is because of the dollar weakness to the pound    to   almost     All the similar hotels were in that price range anyway  London IS expensive I would definitely recommend this hotel  
P =>   A very lovely hotel We enjoyed our stay in the Amstedam hotel in London  Perfect location A very friendly and helpful staff  The hotel itself is very clean and cozy  The room didn t seem to be small at all for   people  We will definiltely recommend this hotel to our friends  
P =>  Great Location Great Price We spent two nights at this hotel in il and really enjoyed the location and the room  The room would be a little hot during the summer as it does not have air conditioning  The staff were very helpful with the exception of a new desk clerk that tried to charge us again for the room  paid in advance   As we all have a rocky start to a new job  we weren t too upset  
P =>  Great place to stay   brilliant staff After a disaster with the hotel down the road  York Hotel   don t stay there   we arrive to take our twin room We were lucky enogh that they only had a suite left but at a decent price  It may not be the most modern of hotels but it s clean  the staff are great and it s got soem character If I need a hotel round there for the price I d definately stay again  
P =>   Too smoky Right off the bat   the biggest problem I had with this hotel was that it reeked of smoke  particularly during the day  I have asthma and I found myself having cough and itchy eyes all the time due to the smoke  Fortunately  when I was there  the weather was reasonably mild and I was able to tolerate sleeping with the window open all night to air it out The room was as described on the website  I had a single room and it was very small   mainly a bed and a desk   no dresser  but a small wardrobe  around    cm across with   or   hangers   The bed was pretty comfortable  The bathroom was very clean  I did have some trouble with getting the toilet to flush properly  The temperature on the shower was VERY difficult to regulate   I wasted a ton of their water and my time     minutes one morning when I was trying to get to a business meeting   running the shower to get the temperature of the water to somewhere between freezing and scorch  The shower curtain did not reach to the floor  so the whole bathroom gets wet when you take a shower  I used this feature to help get the wrinkles out of my clothes  I also did hear a quite a bit of noise from the room next door due to thin walls The proprieter of the Amsterdam is kind and helpful  Having Wi Fi access and the computers in the basement is a great service which worked well for me  The breakfast is basic  but healthy and tasty  As many have said  the location here is perfect  Easy access to the Tube  For those not familiar with London  Earl s Court station is at the junction of   of the most useful tourist tube lines  Picadilly and District   The hotel is near to a ks and Spencer  Post Office  Boots  and inumerable eateries of different types and prices  
P =>  Look no further  Chose this on basis of past reviews  amp  was not disappointed  CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN lovely crisp sheets  amp  room on  rd floor light  airy  amp  plenty big enough  On a quiet side street  Judith the proprietor is friendly  amp  extremely helpful  She goes out of her way to get the best deals for tickets  shows etc  Night staff equally helpful   a request for teabags had them delivered wrapped in a napkin immediately  Continental breakfast was plentiful Great location   Earls Court road felt perfectly safe to myself  amp  my teenage daughter   there are plenty of people about until midnight  amp  beyond The hotel is less then a minutes walk from the tube  turn left onto Earl s Court Rd as you come out of the station  then turn first left again  amp  you are on Trebovir Street   you can see the hotel from there   There are a few nice family run Italian retaurants on Earls Court Rd  Benito s is very friendly  amp  very reasonable  Easy to reach from St Pancras King s Cross  amp  plenty of routes on the tube to all major attractions  Will definitely stay there again  
P =>   What a find I ve stayed in a few hotels in London  and often been disappointed  This one was excellent  and great value Very near to Earls Court tube the location was great  Many shops and eateries close at hand  Reception was classier than expected  and helpful and polite The family room on the  rd floor was excellent  Very spacious with the   single beds in a separate room with both wardrobes    facing sofas with a good sized table between  and a small kitchen with microwave  fridge and sink in the main room  with stylish modern decor  and large  bright windows  A very comfortable place to spend time Bathroom well equipped and spotless Breakfast  included  was a bit eccentric  with cereals already poured out into bowls  with some    laid out for perusal  The charming eastern european breakfast staff were helpful but managed to overcook eggs however you asked for them  The toast and croissants and pains au chocolats were plentiful and excellent  
P =>  A Real Find I found this hotel via Trip Advisor and found the reviews were spot on  The accomodations were very nice  breakfast was good  the staff very attentive and the location can t be beat  Little touches such as a free wifi and an internet room were an unexpected bonus for price  There is a lovely garden area but it was too cold to enjoy The lift is quite small  so be ready for a climb up the stairs if you don t want to wait  The room I had  a Double  was newly decorated and had enough space to move around  Linen  towels etc  were of a good grade You cannot beat this hotel as an economy lodging alternative  
P =>   Best Place We ve Stayed in London We stayed here on our  rd trip to London  and it was  by far  the best London accommodations we ve had We had the room directly behind the front desk on the ground floor  It was small  of course  it s LONDON    but it fit the   of us just fine   I mean  seriously  you re in London  how much time you gonna spend in your room   There was a comfy bed for the two of us  and then a loft with twin beds for the kids  They loved climbing the stairs ladder to the loft The room was newly redecorated with fresh bright colored fabrics and a new coat of paint  We never had a noise problem even though our window was right at street level The free Internet access was great  and the breakfast was quite good  The women that worked there were all super friendly  One in particular kept feeding my daughter s carb addiction by bringing her more and more and more toast   My daughter still talks about that  quot nice lady that gave me toast  quot  Very conveniently located a short walk from Earl s Court tube station  which  BTW  is a station with an elevator for those with lots of luggage who are taking the tube to and from Heathrow   Many nice restaurants nearby  I highly recommend Zizzi  which is right around the corner from the hotel  
P =>   Loved it  My husband and I stayed at the Amsterdam Hotel for    days on our honeymoon  It was so lovely and everyone there was extremely nice  We especially enjoyed the breakfast every morning  Our room was a little snug  but it once we got use to it  it was great  I would stay there again in a heartbeat  We loved it  
P =>  Great  Situated conveniently just a couple of hundred metres away from Ears Court station  it s a great place to stay for a weekend when travelling around london by the tube  I stayed in room no     the only room situated beneath groundfloor  This was a family room for four  and contrary to what I expected  the room was huge  Although not exactly five star  it looked pretty new and modern  Despite the fact that the room was below groundlevel  there was a fullsize window and a door to the outside  so it didn t feel like being in a basement  But if you re looking for a room with a view  this would be a disapointment  In contrast to the room  the bathroom was cramped  It was clean and looked good  but it was the smallest bathroom I ve ever seen in a hotel  Also  the doorway to the bathroom must have been dimensioned for people under    cm tall  so you would have to duck down your head to not walk into the doorframe  The staff was very friendly and helpful  and deserves a mention  The breakfast was good  although not very exciting or varied  and there was also free internet access  Either by wireless  or you could use one of two desktops  next to my room   If you re looking for a really good and cheap place to stay in London  look no further  Although the area around Earls Court isn t the most exciting for the tourist  the underground is just one minute by foot  and the area has many good restaurants as well  
P =>  Liked the Amsterdam Had a lovely trip to London with wife and two kids  Amsterdam Hotel in perfect location  ajacent Earls Court station and perfect for tube around various parts of London  Hotel very clean and tidy  decent breakfast and staff very courteous and helpful  reception manned   hrs  plenty towels every day  really no complaint as well  We got room   which has a novel set up as family room with kids beds in a mezzanine level above receptions which you go up staircase in room to  kids loved it  almost like they had their own room Would definitely recommend this hotel if like us you are just looking for a good base to explore the sights etc  There were other facilities available i e  internet room  etc which we just didn t use so I m sure suitable for others who require a wee bit more than we do  
P =>   Comfortable Stay My husband and I stayed at the Amsterdam Hotel for two nights at the end of tember       Upon arrival  the woman behind the front desk saw us to our room personally  The room was small but comfortable  although it could be tricky to move between the foot of the bed and the wall  The bathroom was modern and clean  the only difficulty was that the water from the shower had a tendency to drip onto the bathroom floor  making puddles  as the shower curtain was not able to contain the spray from the shower head  The best thing about the room was that we had direct access to the garden from our room  a feature that was shared only by the room next to us  Other guests could gain access to the garden from the ground floor where the breakfast room was located  The breakfast consisted of breads  cereals  and yogurt  along with juice  coffee or tea The location of the hotel was great  It was just steps away from Earls Court Road  where there were plenty of restaurants and pubs  Also  Earl s Court Station was about one block away  If my husband and I plan another trip to London we will definitely consider staying here again  
P =>   Loved our stay  Myself  my husband and our young son spent a week in London the end of september  After weeks of research into many  many hotel we decided on this one  This place is truly a home away from home  We arrived after a long flight and via the underground from heathrow at about     pm  The front staff ran outside to help us in with all our luggage and the stroller and from then on the service just got friendlier  Judi is amazing and this hotel and staff are a credit to her  She would organise maps for us  activities that were child friendly  tour confirmations  taxi s and even played with our son for an hour on the floor with toys The hotel is very clean and our suite with seperate lounge bedroom was great with our son  The cot was provided free of charge and was made up everyday along with our room very cute touch  The kitchenette was great  microwave  toaster and kettle plus endless supply of tea  Mugs too     which was a bonus  The hotel is literally just round the corner from the undergroud   the location could not be better really  There is plenty of eateries and mini supermarkets to stock up  All in all we loved the hotel and area and would go back again   and again  
P =>  Better than first impressions    I ve just spent   nights in the Amsterdam Hotel  When I first checked in I wasn t totally convinced about the place as the room was small  typical for London  and the bathroom was tiny  However  over time it grew on me  The place was kept spotless and  as long as we kept order in the room  we managed with the space  A couple of shelves drawers would go a long way to helping with the lack of space there  Plenty of hanging space available but nothing for tops incidentals etc  The bathroom had great powerful showers compared to most places in the UK  Plentiful and good towels  with nice toiletries  It was kept very  very clean by the workers  The bedroom has laminate floors  so no smelly carpets  and any clothes shoes we left lying around were tidied up for us while we were out during the day The location is very handy and it was amazingly quiet at night  Direct tube from Heathrow and several lines into the centre  We had a room to the back and slept very well with the window open  The room would have been far too hot otherwise  A reasonable continental breakfast is included in the price  I d recommend this place and would probably use it again   though I may upgrade slightly to an executive room in the hope of having a bit more space  
P =>   raves for the Amsterdam   Earls Court Just returned from my first trip to England  I can t say enough about the Amsterdam Hotel  All of the staff were friendly and helpful  especially Judi the manager  My family and I couldn t believe the special attention we received  the phone calls for reservations and maps for directions  The breakfasts  computer room  courtyard in back  fabulous location  and excellent service made my trip unforgettable  I highly recommend  
P =>   More on the Amsterdam My husband wrote a review of our trip and I wanted to add my   pence  I think it is important to note that the hotel is only   blocks from the Underground  making it easy and inexpensive to get to and from the airport and also to see the sights of London without the expense of a cab  Earl s Court is a charming area and there were a variety of good restaurants within walking distance of the hotel  There were also grocery stores in easy walking distance and a post office across from the Underground  The manager  Judi  and her staff were helpful in every way  They provided fans when the weather warmed and blankets for cool nights  They personalized our stay beyond what you expect in a major city  and made the hotel feel like an intimate B amp B  Can t wait to go back  
P =>  Absolutely terrible I spent   nights here in late e early y with my wife and son  It was awful  I have nothing good to say about this dirty dump of a hotel  It would take too much time and space to list all the horrible things wrong with it  but my advice is never go near it  Another piece of advice  don t go to London  It s one of the worse cities in the world  
P =>   Great little hotel Very nice hotel in London  Have stayed there twice on business  once with my father  Very clean and comfortable rooms  about average size for Europe it seems  Free internet access in the basement  very helpful   Staff are very professional and courteous  is not in a particularily great location  but it is literally    seconds from the Earls Court underground station and you can be anywhere in minutes  My father  notoriously difficult to impress  thought it was pretty fantastic  
P =>   Good value friendly staff great location My wife and I stayed at the Amsterdam Hotel in London at the tail end of our vacation  e               We came in from Belgium on the high speed  took the tube to Earl s Court  the hotel is maybe a one minute walk from the tube station The check in out process was quick and painless  Staff was nice and even charged my credit card in dollars  which let me avoid the bank conversion charge One thing to note  if you re staying in the front of the hotel the noise from the street could be an issue for you as it is not very far from busy Earl s Court Road  Also  the walls are pretty thin and we could hear a baby crying in another room  Not a big deal  but it seemed to bother another hotel patron one night Anyway  one thing I wasn t aware of beforehand is that the hotel room had no air conditioner  but that s typical of most inexpensive London hotels  We kept the balcony windows open at night The bathroom  as mentioned in other reviews  is rather small and the shower area takes some getting used to  Actually  though  it wasn t as bad as some other reviewers made it out to be and I never had an issue with it  The room and bathroom facilities were spotless  although small  and everything worked fine  plenty of hot water and in room facilities  Honestly  how much time is a tourist going to spend in the hotel room in London anyway Also  there was a nice in room flat panel TV but no clock radio  The hotel staff does wake up calls though The bed and sheets were clean and very comfortable There are tons of grocery stores  coffee shops  restaurants and good  safe pubs nearby  There is no hotel bar  We never felt unsafe in the area This is a good hotel for the budget conscious traveler who wants to have a good location    Earl s Court tube station is on   lines and it never took us more than    minutes by tube to any major location tourist attraction in the city I can recommend this hotel without issue  For the area  I consider it a bargain  Having stayed around the corner at the much pricier K K Hotel George in       I know this is true  
P =>  Home from Home Just back from Chelsea flower show and   nights in the Amsterdam Hotel  Really enjoyed our stay  Very clean hotel continental breakfast was very enjoyable The staff were so friendly and helpful This is a lovely area to stay in and the hotel is great value for zone one   mins from tube station The best compliment I can pay the Amsterdam is that I will be back  Great value for london  Judie gives      as Manager  
P =>   Nice little hotel good value great location  When you stay in a budget hotel  you shouldn t expect too much  The room was small  badly located and a bit noisy  but it was nicely decorated  very clean  had a large bathroom and best of all  was cheap If you are a tourist visiting London  I wouldn t expect you to spend much time here anyway  you should be out seeing the sites The free breakfast was mediocre at best The staff were very helpful and nice The location could not be any better  as it is    meters at most from the Earls Court Metro station  The restaurants in the area are decent  and we loved a little place nearby called the  quot Little French Restaurant quot  that had a perfectly fine prix fixe dinner for    pounds  a London bargain All in all  not perfect  but a pleasant enough experience  
P => AMsterdam hotel in London   very nice I stayed twice in this hotel and enjoyed my stay there both times  In ruary the room was a bit small  but it was so neat and nice  that I did not really care much about the size  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful  So I wanted to come again  And I did  This time the room was larger  very cozy  light  and just as neat as the first time  I stayed almost a week there and was very pleased with the stay again  It is a nice hotel  And very conveniently located   just a minute from Earls Court  which makes you very well connected to everywhere in London  My greatest thanks to the owners and the staff of the hotel Tatiana Rybina  Moscow  Russia 
P =>   Good value for money A nice little hotel  very friendly and helpful staff at the reception  In summary a very good value for money     GBP   night incl continental breakfast   The room I had was quite small  but everything was impeccable  good bedding  very clean bathroom  flat screen TV and free Internet WiFi access  The pictures posted by previous reviewers are indeed accurate  The area is calm and well connected to the tube  so you can move very easily  
P =>   a great little hotel   cheap clean and comfortable The hotel is very well situated for earl s court tube station and the exhibition centres  It looks tidy and well kept from the outside  The reception staff were polite and helpful  There is a lift to get to the upper floors  but it is very small  I could barely fit in on my own with my suitcase  My single person s room was very clean and included tea coffee making facilities and satellite TV  The bathroom was very small but functional  Even though the room was a single  there was lots of room and a double bed  Continental breakfast is free  or cooked b fast is an extra        All in all i can recommend this hotel to anyone and would gladly consider staying on future visits to london  
P =>  Clean friendly and well located I wrote a trip report about our stay in London  but they move down the list very quickly and end up lost in the hundreds of other posts Moderate and budget priced hotels in London have very small rooms  That seems to be the general concensus in the various posts I read before we booked a hotel  So I was not suprised when we arrived at just how small the room was  OK I was a little bit  by North American standards I have clients with closets that are larger than the room we had  We were   adults and     year old boy  so we had a family room which consisted of a queen sized bed and a double  I asked for a queen and   singles but we didn t get that   The room was L shaped  and in the corner we had a small table with   chairs and a small LCD TV mounted on the wall above  Very small closets too  The bathroom as described in other posts here is also small BUT  it all is kept very very clean  They really do look after the rooms here After we got settled in everything was fine and comfortable The beds were really cosy too  everyone had no problems sleeping There has been mention about the lift here  yes there is one  but like many things it is really really small    person and   large suitcase is about all you can fit in it  But it does work  just takes a couple of trips to get your bags to your room Location is great  we took the Tube from Heathrow  got off at Earls Court station  which has a lift  walked out  turned left  took the next left and there it is  Earls Court is a great station for getting around from I am certain that when visiting London again I would stay here againHere is my trip reporthttp   www tripadvisor com ShowTopic g       i   k       Trip report London England html 
P => A GREAT STAY Stayed for   night at this Hotel on the   th ember and was very impressed  My single room was quite small but had the luxury of a double bed with T V   tea coffee making facilities and windows that opened plus a small but spotlessly clean bathroom with white fluffy towels  The dining room was spotless and a good choice of cereals  fruit  fruit juices  toast  croissants with jam or marmalade and tea or coffee with cream  not milk All the staff were friendly and very helpful and nothing was too much trouble  I would not hesitate in recommending this Hotel to anyone  The Tube station is only   min walk and a    min walk takes you to the Nat History Museum which is well worth a visit  
P => Clean and tidy I chose to live in this hotel in early ember      because of the good comments here  The location of the hotel is excellant  Just a few minutes walk from Earl s Court Tube Station which has lifts  You can also reach Earl s Court Tube Station direct from the Heathrow Airport without changing the line  The hotel also contains a tiny lift so you face no problems of carrying luggages  I live in a single room on   F  The room is small but clean and tidy  There is a LCD TV  a hair dryer  tea and coffee making facilities and fine bath facilities  The only thing I wanna point out is that it is quite  quot hot quot  when I sleep in the room at night  I need to open some windows otherwise I will get burnt  And you need to pay an extra in order to get hot breakfast including sausages and eggs  etc  I hope that these are included in the room rate  The Hotel is above average when compared with other hotels offering similar rates in London  The price is reasonable as I understand that everything is expensive in London  
P =>   Comfortable stay A pleasant hotel with accommodating staff The lift was out of action during our stay  but Judy booked as many people on the lower floors as she could  which was appreciated   those london town houses have murderous stairs  Our first room was beautiful  done out in shades of white and cream with direct access to the hotel s garden  The bathroom was spacious and clean with a heated towel rail  I d argue it s one of the nicest rooms in the hotel  but for one thing   the room is directly off the reception area  As a light sleeper I found this to be a problem  My partner  however  didn t   so you d have to judge for yourself  Judy was very accommodating and did some shuffling to move us to a room on an upper floor  She d put us in the lower floor room to save us the walk up  Even so  she was gracious when I requested a change Our second room was on the third floor and far more insular  but not as elegantly decorated  It was clean all the same  and rather large  which was a bonus I would definitely stay at the Amsterdam Hotel again   it is very good value for money and a pleasant stay into the bargain  The Earls Court area is lovely  For a good  authentic Italian meal try Venezia Ristorante in Kenway road  only a short walk from the hotel or tube station  
P =>  Great place to stay  My mother and I stayed at the Amsterdam Hotel for   nights in  e  We couldn t have been happier with the hotel  I have stayed at several hotels in London  and for the price  the Amsterdam cannot be beat We had a twin room  two beds  on the third floor  room      which was brightly and modernly decorated  and spotlessly clean  The room was small  as was the bathroom  but that is typical of UK European hotels  The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating  they took messages from people who called  made restaurant reservations for us and ordered taxis when necessary  and in general were just lovely  Although I never partook  my mother had breakfast in the morning downstairs in the hotel and said it was quite good   a nice selection of pastries and coffee  orange juice  etc  This is included in the cost of your stay  The location is also fantastic for this hotel  It is less than a block s walk to the Earl s Court Tube  underground transportation   which has the District and Picadilly lines running through it  Picadilly runs right from Heathrow  so instead of spending an exorbitant amount on a taxi from the airport  you can simply hop on the Tube  Unlike many of the tube stops  Earl s Court tube stop has a lift  elevator   so you won t have to worry about hauling your luggage up numerous flights of stairs    The Picadilly line has stops at lots of major tourist areas  and there are easy links to other Tube lines  The neighborhood surrounding the hotel has a bunch of cute little restaurants  all within a short walking distance  as well The only downsides of the hotel were these  and to be honest  they are VERY minor compared with what you could be dealing with at other London hotels of similar class         Water pressure in the shower was terrible  and it took a long time to get the hot cold ratio right because it took so long for the water to run through the pipes to us     Lift was pretty small  so for the claustrophobic or very overweight  you re going to need to take the stairs     Although they are non smoking rooms  some of the staff smoke at night and it wafts up to the room  I solved this problem by putting a towel along the bottom of the door at night      Because the halls are narrow  in our particular room  when someone got in the lift or went down the stairs  it was pretty loud  I don t know how it is for other rooms that located further away from the lift stairs     Sheets were kind of scratchy Overall  I would HIGHLY recommend this hotel to anyone who doesn t want to spend a lot of money on a hotel and wants a nice  clean  safe  centrally located place to stay  I would definitely stay here again  
P => Good but a few hiccups    I give this hotel an above average first of all because it was absolutely spotless  The hotel was meticulously kept  The staff worked very hard at doing this  My family  me  hubby and two daughters  visited and had the family room in the basement  One queen size bed and two twins very good since one of my daughters is notorious for kicking in her sleep her big sister was very pleased at not having to share a bed as she usually has to in a standard hotel room  We arrived at       a m  after an all night flight and were told to come back at       to a ready room  The management was true to their word and we were able to grab a nap before starting to explore the city  The bathroom was tiny  Not to be graphic  but I had to sit sideways on the toilet  That being said  let me say that the bathroom was very modern completely redone and very clean  A generous supply of towels and toiletries was left for us  The breakfast was adequate  Toast  croissants  fruit and cereal along with juice and coffee and tea  The staff was very courteous and prompt  The staff did  however  totally forget to clean our room one day  We came home at    p m  after a long day of sightseeing to find the beds unmade  wet towels in the bathroom  The desk clerk apologized profusely and immediately brought a supply of fresh towels to the room  Upon checkout  I found that had been charged    pounds more per night than my original quote but I do not blame the hotel for this  The reservation was made by Expedia and they quoted me one rate and sent an email to the hotel  which they showed me  with the higher rate  I m still fighting with Expedia about that one  All in all  I would recommend the Amsterdam  It is a short walk from the tube station on the very convenient Picadilly line and as I said  has friendly staff and a spotless facility  
P =>  Terrific  This was my second visit to the wonderful Amsterdam Hotel  and it wont be my last  After travelling Europe and enduring all kinds of hotel accomodation in a vareity of cities  it was such a pleasure to arrive in London at the Amsterdam and to stay in a place that is so comfortable  clean and accomodating  The hotel had been refurbished since my last stay    months ago  and a great job has been done in all areas  It was so comfortable and such an easy stay  The staff  headed by the brilliant Judy  also could not do enough to help me out with any bookings  advice  directions or deals I needed while I was in London  It is when staff go to that extra effort to help you out that makes the best impression and makes all the differentce  and the Amsterdam staff did just that  Also  at only about     metres from Earls Court Tube station  the location is excellent for tourist visitors as nothing is ever too far away  The Amsterdam is one of London s best Hotel finds   I have stayed in five other hotels in London  and The Amsterdam Hotel wins hands down as the best  and at the best price  They say word of mouth is the best recommendation  and I have already recommended this Hotel to three friends who have made thier bookings  They won t be disappointed  And I will be back within    months  so the same room again with the cute balcony overlooking the street would suit me just fine  
P => Wonderful Hotel  Our family of    two teenagers  had a wonderful stay at the Amsterdam Hotel  Upon arriving at Heathrow we took the tube  Piccadilly Line  directly to Earl s Court station and walked the short block to the hotel  Although we arrived late at night the area felt safe and many fast food restaurants were still open     perfect for hungry teenage travellers  We were given Suite    at    Trebovir which is actually in the basement with a private entrance to the street as well as an indoor entrance  Our room was newly and very tastefully decorated and included a beautifully tiled bathroom and an attached kitchenette with toaster  microwave oven  sink and utensils  A washer was also included but no dryer  The entire hotel was kept impeccably clean and tidy  The breakfast room was bright and airy with a plentiful breakfast  cereal  toast  juice  croissants  and heavenly tea  They do know how to make a great pot of tea  Free internet was included which our teenagers appreciated and a lovely garden area existed at the back of the hotel  The immediate area had everything you might need     a grocery store  bank  currency exchange  laundramat  camera store  restaurants  pubs and tube station giving access to the entire city  The staff at the hotel were friendly and very helpful when asked for directions or ideas for sightseeing  immediately finding answers on the internet and giving us a printout of the material as well as calling ahead to determine times and entrance fees  They couldn t have been more helpful  We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to London and would certainly stay there again if we return  
P => a few flaws but overall a nice place to call  home  in London Finding reasonably priced lodging in London can be a real challenge  You either go broke and stay in clean comfort or go the budget route and combat bedbugs  With this in mind  I scoured TripAdvisor reviews for a happy medium and found it in the Amsterdam Hotel The Amsterdam Hotel is in Earl s Court  a busy section of London that is packed with hostels  budget hotels  and eateries  I always like to stay in Earl s Court due to its good location  the Earl s Court tube services the District and Piccadilly lines   dining options  especially if you like ethnic food   and services  internet cafes  laundry services  and grocery stores abound   but I wasn t too keen on staying in some of the other hotels  based on past personal experiences and or TripAdvisor reviews Enter the Amsterdam  Its good TripAdvisor ranking and the overall good reviews led me to book seven nights there for the London portion of my holiday  I was not disappointed  and in fact  I was pleasantly surprised The Amsterdam s staff was  with a couple of exceptions  extremely nice and helpful  The owner  in particular  was wonderful  and I really got the sense that she wanted all her guests to be very  very satisfied  The housekeepers do an excellent job keeping the entire hotel spotless  My hotel room was always in perfect condition when I returned from a day out The hotel s facilities are well maintained and typical for a converted rowhouse  My room was much larger than I had expected and had a twin and a double bed  The beds were quite comfortable  not the slabs of granite that are so common in hotels  The room also featured a small TV  a teapot with teabags and instant coffee  and a hair dryer  On the downside  there was no air conditioning  except for a floor unit which was ineffective   and the heat in the room  even with the windows open  was stifling for the first couple of nights  I wouldn t want to be in that room during a heatwave My room s WC exceeded my expectations greatly  While the shower was part of the room  separated by a curtain you pull round you within the room    this is typical for many en suites at budget hotels   the WC was much larger than other en suites I have seen  and it was possible to shower without being crunched against a wall  The shower head detached from the wall  enabling one to shower without making a terrific watery mess The Amsterdam provides free internet access to its guests  and the owner said that wireless will be installed soon I was quite satisfied with my stay at the Amsterdam  but there were two things that tainted my time there First  while the housekeepers are very sweet and do a great job cleaning the room  they do not respect  quot do not disturb quot  signs or personal belongings  There was one day where we did not want the housekeepers in the room because we didn t want some computer equipment to be disturbed  charging a laptop   and when I returned  the room had been cleaned  our personal belongings had been moved around  and the laptop had been unplugged  The next day  I put out the  quot do not disturb quot  sign again  because it had been a late night  and we wanted to sleep in  Even then  the housekeepers knocked and started to come in  waking us up  One evening  after the housekeepers had cleaned the room  I couldn t find my contact lens case  which I had left on the vanity in a neat line  out of the way of cleaning housekeepers  with my hairbrush and some medication  All of those items were missing  After a while of hunting  I found that these items had been put in a drawer  This happened two days in a row  and then I politely asked the housekeeper not to move my personal items when she came in  She respected my request  but I was very surprised that the housekeepers would take such liberties with guests  belongings to begin with The second complaint I have is that  while the hotel is touted as a non smoking hotel and a sign clearly states that people who smoke in their rooms will be charged   GBP  the smoking policy is not enforced  and the hotel staff are the worst culprits  Every afternoon  the smell of smoke wafted into my room  and opening the window did not alleviate the problem  At first  I thought it might be hotel guests across the hall  but the smell continued after they checked out  Now I m thinking that the smoke might have come from a supply room that the staff used on my floor  And one evening  when I came home  the woman who gave me my key was smoking in the little room behind the reception desk  and she had a very full ashtray with her  I personally have no problem with smokers  but some people do and or have health issues that are aggravated by cigarette smoke  If people book a hotel  thinking it is a non smoking facility  the hotel needs to live up to that expectation Intrusive housekeepers and smelly smoke aside  I enjoyed my time at the Amsterdam and would definitely stay there again  I recommend it highly    just be aware of the smoking issue  
P =>  Felt like home great location  I am amazed by some of the reviews on this site  especially the person who stayed there on t          I was also there during that time  I stayed there for   nights  I had a twin room  since a friend joined me halfway through my stay  The room was big  the bathroom was clean and I don t know how anybody would get water all over the floor when taking a shower unless they are real slobs  The shower had a glass door to separate the shower tub from the toilet   The room was kept clean at all times  the owner was very friendly and always had a short conversation with me as I went in and out  The breakfast was more than adequate  The FREE internet access is available    hours a day  Unfortunately  there is no AC and it got quite warm while I was there  but that s not that big of a deal   The location is wonderful  on a quiet side street  yet plenty of restaurants nearby  a grocery store and about   minutes from a tube station   On my way out  the owner was great at calling the car service to confirm that they were coming to pick me up at a certain time  I also needed something to keep my extra bag closed properly  There was no lock  but I wanted a string or something to keep the zipper from opening  She called the electrician who brought me something to tie them together  he helped me do it   I am amazed that some people say that the staff isn t friendly  unless they are focusing on the maids  who just do their job and don t really interact with the hotel guests  The people at the desk were always very friendly and I would stay at this hotel again in a blink and would definitely recommend it

P => Contemporary and clean comfy beds convenient location and knowledgeable staff My husband and I spent three nights at the Andaz through redemption of my Hyatt Gold Passport points  and were very happy with our stay  We were offered coffee and tea upon our arrival  Our reservation was in order  we had requested an early check in when we booked the room  and the non traditional check in process was relatively seamless and quick  We were earlier than our early check in request  and they gave us the option to wait until the room with a view we requested was ready or take a similar room that was ready but internally facing   we took the ready  internally facing room We enjoyed the sleek styling of the lobby  and the traditional styling of the internal area between the hotel and the      restaurant  The decor of our room was also sleek and contemporary  just a bit dark for our tastes as our windows looked internally into the hotel  quot courtyard quot  or atrium  which we knew ahead of time  The room was very clean  and the bed very comfortable  The bath was okay  the shower s water temp would fluctuate quite frequently and seemed to lose its heat as the shower progressed  Also  there were no regular outlets in the bathroom except for face shavers   they did provide a hairdryer and hideaway mirror vanity at the desk  but I d prefer to have the option to dry my hair in the bathroom  my husband had to shave his head with his electric head shaver in the bedroom instead of the bath  We heard very  very little from our neighbors through the walls of our room  the noise we did hear was from the hallway   doors closing  the clinking of glasses bottles from the housekeeping carts  etc  But it wasn t an overwhelming bother Compared to the hotels I ve stayed at in the U S   turndown service here was pretty late in the evening   close to  pm We didn t use the workout facilities  but we did take a tour of them and were impressed  The gym was relatively spacious  with cardio equipment and weights  There was a steam room also  in addition to the treatment rooms associated with the spa The staff we interacted with were all friendly and very helpful  providing information about food and attractions both in the local area and in other areas of London We found the hotel conveniently located  right next to the Liverpool tube station and a short walk to the Spitalfields ket  St Paul s Cathedral  London Bridge  etc  What we didn t fully realize is that the area right around the hotel is mostly business oriented  so some of the shops and eateries are not open later in the evening or on the weekends  We were doubly surprised to hear that some of the Andaz s restaurants are also closed over the weekend  the sushi place and Catch   Their George pub was open on the weekend  and we enjoyed a pint there and the ambiance  On Friday evening  we had a late night dessert and coffee tea at Andaz s Eastway   both the sticky toffee pudding and the banana dish were fantastic We would definitely stay at the Andaz again for our next trip to London  
P => elegant hotel with very helpful staff  laid back feel  Only spent   night at the andaz but thoroughly enjoyed our stay  From the moment we walk in it felt special  with a relaxed and speedy personnal check in process  The rooms were well appointed and with the added bonus of a free minibar consisting of water  juices and snacks was a welcome surprise  The beds were comfortable and the room was clean and tidy  we would recommend this hotel for a perfect stay in london 
P =>   Hip stylish very friendly food and drink quite expensive Most things have been said about this hotel  It is very stylish  hip  cool but also has a very friendly atmosphere  Staff are really super caring and friendly   that is everyone from a cleaner you meet in the elevator to the check in staff  I loved the check in  very informal and efficient  I travelled with my   year old daughter and the staff called her by name during our stay One small crib was that we could not get breakfast in the buffet room on a Sat morn about     am   we would have to have waited    to   mins  That was disappointing as we went into the A La carte breakfast room and while the service was great  I thought that the cost of the food was outrageous for what it was  But then this is London All in all  a great hotel close to a major train   tube station  Absolutely perfect for anyone who needs to be in The City or East End of London  
P =>   Spectacular service ambiance style attention to customers I was impressed about everything  from innovative  and early  check in to my choice of eateries  price ranges  and personalization  I can t cite any one staff member because every Andaz staff member was outstanding  I feel like I stayed at the George or other expensive hotel  and yet  I saved money  The decor  free juice bar and chocolate covered hazelnuts  and access to the Net were just some of the special touches  The Andaz has it all and does it better than any other hotel in that price range  I shall return  
P =>   Would stay there again location is great and service is super  I booked this hotel over the internet as Hyatt members and seniors we got a great rate  I chose the hotel because of its proximity to the Liverpool St  Station  Our check in experience was smooth and the staff were welcoming  The room was a little small but clean and well equipped  It was obvious that this was an older hotel that had been extensively renovated  The hotel layout is interesting with open lifts running in an atrium  However the room was quiet and the bed was comfortable We used the hotel as a base for some sightseeing in London  Very convenient location for this   We took a walk through  quot The City quot  to the Thames and Tower of London  The station made our other trips easy  including catching the train to the crusie ship terminal at Harwich Throughout our stay  the staff was unfailingly pleasant  Check out went as smoothly as the check in  
P =>   A clean and austere place The hotel is located near my company s London office and is very convenient to Liverpool Street Station   you can take the Underground and Heathrow Express easily to and from Heathrow  The check in is nice with employees with laptops coming right up to welcome you  I know it is London so you can expect a small room  The rooms are small  the bed was fine   not lumpy  Everything was clean  The room was depressingly austere though  It struck me as grey and lifeless  Nothing warm or welcoming  It became a clean cell that I just wanted to sleep in  The gym was fine with equipment in good shape and available  Information about the hotel and its services was not easy to locate   I couldn t even seem to get the tv to work properly  For business travel it is fine  but doesn t give much respite or cheer after a busy day  
P =>  Excellent value and quality Spent a very enjoyable weekend in London staying at the Andaz  The room was wonderful  the food in the Catch restaurant exquisite and the staff amazing  We had a wonderful time  lovely place to stay  
P =>  Overpriced business hotel with central location stayed at the Andaz as the Apex was full  got a nice upgraded room  Good Hyatt status recognition  Relatively expensive for the value  unconventional check in out is not the quickest  Fantastic location  
P =>  Tremendous Tremendous hotel  everything exudes professionalism  Provides everything one would expect from a hotel of this class  
P =>   Fresh and convenient The Andaz is a design oriented hotel within Liverpool Street Station  conveniently located yet quiet  Rooms are simple but classy  Comfortable  good windows and aircon  nice colour scheme  good shower   all one needs for a weekend in town  There are a few loose cables here and there  but altogether rooms are a pleasure to stay in  The hotel appears quite anonymous  despite the much lauded personalised check in  and the lobby is rather dark and forbidding  leaving the guest with no idea of the pleasant communal areas behind the grey slate and concrete  I am not sure what they achieved with the refit  I much preferred the old COnran outfit for pure design  but for comfort and convenience look no further  
P =>   stylish hotel Great hotel  spacious room with lovely decor  Free mini bar in the room with juices and snack comes in handy  The staff were friendly and helpful  The location is ideal with lots to do near by such as spitafields and we found a lovely dinner in hoxton a   min walk away  The facilities are excellent  there is a steam room with comfy bathrobes  Only a couple of negatives  the duvet was small  in comparison to the size of the bed  not long enough  I m not sure the mobile check in works  it was busy when we checked out and the concept of a que went out of the window  An enjoyable stay nevetheless  i d definately recommend it  
P =>   Standard expected of a Hyatt Great location  staff efficient but friendly  Made welcome  room was excellent and complimentary upgrade for anniversary much appreciated  It was comfortable  hospitable luxury  Would recommend 
P =>   Modern clean hotel great location  First time being in the Liverpool St  area  There are so many shops restaurants around the hotel and the tube is right there  However  you may want to ask directions when you get to the station  we went out the wrong exit and found it difficult that first time to find the hotel since there are quite a few ways to exit Liverpool St  station  The room was a good size for one person  I had a single bed  my friend a double but the room sizes were the same so hers was a little tight but other than that  we were really happy with the room  Nice desk  great flat screen tv  Mini fridge with lots of water and juice  replenished daily  
P =>   Loud Water System    But very solid London hotel The Andaz Hyatt does a lot of things right  It s chic  I has a beautiful lounge area on the  st floor that was always deserted at night    I had a pleasant evening there one night with my laptop  There are many restaurants to choose from within the hotel    loved       Great service The minibar is free  breakfast is included  and there are are two places you can plug in American power cords Two complaints       the pipes water system is DEAFENING  It seems like whenever someone in the hotel flushes the toilet  the entire sink makes a massive sucking noise and the pipes sound like they re being rushed with water  it is REALLY LOUD    There is no iron and ironing board  I ve also stayed at the Waldorf Hilton  and they provide this  which is really nice for a business trip  
P =>   Wonderful weekend We stayed at this wonderful hotel for the weekend as we were going to a wedding  The welcome  the comfort and the total warmth of the staff were everything one could have wished  The room was large and comfortable and quite unique with a view across Liverpool Street Station  This could be off putting to some but I found it fascinating and no station noise entered the room at all  It s a five star hotel and it deserves to be  
P =>   Terrible experience lost personal belongings The hotel is located in a prime location with convenient London transportation network  but the services provided was totally unacceptable as a   star hotel or any star rated hotels for that matter  The booking system has serious problem and didnt confirm with you about the booking at any time  After I faxed and sent the email  the system shown that I have made   seperate bookings for my   day stay  which means I need to move around the rooms There is a large function hall down on the  nd floor  and rooms on third floor can clearly hear what is going on  The noise was annoying at night if there are parties going on To my biggest shocking  I lost my face wash during my stay  Apparently the housekeeping attends checking thru all my belongs and decided to  quot put away quot  one of my facewash  Do not recommend  
P =>  The Best Hotel in London The Andaz is a one of a kind place    restaurants    bars  and service always with a smile  Amazing lobby  Rooms are huge with high ceilings big bathrooms and free minibar   Tons of TV channels and the most confortable bed in the industry  Every time i go to London from now on i will stay at the Andaz  
P =>  Very nice  Stayed here last month  lovely big room  if a bit dark   when is there ever anywhere suitable in a room to put on make up Not sure about the check in experience   nice idea  though it does lead to a bit of standing around when trying to check out  And there aren t that many places to sit and wait We were eating out with friends at Smithfields  so great location The hotel does have several bars  it s a pity that none of them were open when we returned at        and in need of a night cap   room service just doesn t have the same atmosphere Lovely big clean bathroom  proper hairdryer   pet hate   the ones where you have to keep your finger on the button  and big towels  Pricey breakfast   we went back to Smithfields  
P =>   Fantastic hotel decent location Beautiful business hotel in very hip city location  Close to Shoreditch house  Boundary and Brick lane spitalfields    But maybe too close  At night time it is a ghost town  though liverpool street station does guarantee a bit of foot traffic until late  Great if you have business in the city but next time I cash in my Hyatt points for a london holiday  i think i will stick to the west end uber touristy hyatt  Still  an AMAZING hotel if you plan to hang out in the City east end  Bed was way too firm  i m spoiled by starwood dream beds  but room was very stylish a beautiful  PS  you can trust all the photos  Rooms are clean and look just like that  
P =>   Amazing hotel   luxury and value  This hotel was amazing and was at a great price  It is a modern architectural piece of art since I saw actual Londoners standing in line to tour the hotel  The have a great check in process where you sit down and relax and they come to you   with coffee and snacks  Room is modern  clean amazing with a place to doc your ipod  The mini bar is free and restocked  Also  this hotel is in a PERFECT location  This is now our favorite place to stay in London and we will be back  
P =>   Fab hotel excellent loacation  One of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in   Great service from check in to check out  Located by loads of great restaurants and bars as well as being around the corner from Brick Lane and Spittlefields market   both a must see  Sunday s are the best The decor is great as are the amenities  Free internet in your room and complimentary mini bar were definitely well received  Will definitely go back and recommend it to all   
P =>   lovely unusual hotel  Excellant location  staff extremely helpful and cleanliness was exceptional  Lovely complimentary mini bar and bath products  
P =>   Enjoy the hotel and AVOID THE SPA     Good located and connected  The hotel has nice looks and excellent hygiene  All clean and shinny  Food from room service was very enjoyble too  I like everything but     the SPA  with prices dearer than Claridge s or Berkeley  OMG   it doesn t deliver  With the rooms next to a gym with a very high music volume and the trains running every minute  you can t have peace and relaxation  You even feel the vibration of the trains  Service wasn t good either  Again  enjoy the hotel but do yourself and your pocket a favour and find another place for massage treatments  
P =>   If I lived in a hotel this would be it     no really So  I am the kind of guy who travels three weeks a month and has been in every kind of imaginable hotel on every continent  good  bad  ugly and sometimes  intolerable  I am a certified hotel snob but only because I virtually live in them  I discovered Andaz  quot by accident quot   London is full of very average dumpy places posing as four star hotels  so on an unexpected week of work  I was forced to go on TripAdvisor recommendations  site unseen  and chose the Andaz because of ranking  and its high end but practical  modern  uncluttered concept  I am a Hyatt Platinum member and had not heard of it  apparently there is one in LA and another opening in NYC  a no check in desk  business hip but classy  substantial and without the hype  customer centric concept  renovated loft feel  original building was a hospital  then hotel which was taken over by Hyatt a few years back to create the first Andaz   The location  literally right at Liverpool Street train station  is one benefit for easy access to the rest of London  bit that s just the beginning  I literally  quot live quot  here when in London  and in most hotels  I do find something to be displeased with If you are looking for staid  classical  antiquish traditional hotel service with all the usual  quot no s quot   stuffiness and rip off extra s  this won t be your hotel  Andaz s have done away with desk check in s  you know  where you stand in line for    mins and right when its your turn  the front desk person picks up the phone because someone apparently more important called from his her room   yeah  Well  these guys figured it out  All calls are answered by the back office of equally qualified and attentive staff  The front desk actually all about you and it really isn t even a front desk  but a group of well coiffed and suited  think GQ meets Walls Street  chic and competent looking  quot Andaz hosts quot  holding nifty hand held computers  if I can call them computers  they are tiny   who find your booking  call you by name  check you in and haul your luggage to your room  all the same person   Wait   and when you walk in  you never stand    they actually seat you in a lounge area where the host approaches you  Its all a very civilized affair but without being contrived or precious  They just get you in your room really fast and you don t have to fight for service They have figured out the internet and mini bar thing  just give it to your customers free  even if its built into the costs somehow  and customners will love you and come back  especially if the rest of the service is good  So all that is  quot free quot    and of great quality   fast internet  good quality mini bar food thats replenished  The rooms are all what you would expect  high ceilings  each has slightly different configurations  but very clean lines and  quot chic and modern quot  but solid think a converted loft  decorated by tasteful minimalists in Manhattan  There is nothing Ikea here  Spotless and no smells or noises  Sound proof   and clean as a whistle The hallways are quiet and smell nice  but neutral  no food or perfumy smells  I can tell the place is always clean and kept to the highest standards  Beds are top quality  dreamy  high count thread sheets  bathrooms large and have some of the original fixtures tastefully updated  There are high end  quality bath  shower products you will want to bring home with you  jojoba butter moisturizer  etc  gender neutral without all the perfumes  really good stuff I have brought home with me on occasion  The rooms are soft tones of blue  red and dark wood  lighter wood on sixth floor newer wing  and some cool red chairs you will actually love sitting in and reading  And  oh   the desk and chair are actually functional  dont you love hotels where the desk is actually not intended for anyone who actually has to work in their hotel room   These guys have it right  I work for   hours straight  often on the phone with clients when in London  and the ergonomic chair  right sized and spaced modern desk and fast no fuss internet are all I need  So  the space is airy  clean  and I am a fanatic on this one  and maybe a bit masculine  but feels like nothing was spared  tasteful  modern minimalism without the austerity  short lived fadism and or cheapness and cutting cornersFinal note  The gym is great  everything you need and right in the lower level under a restaurant    the gym space actually used to be some kind of temple and has been well renovated  latest equipment  sauna  massage available and trainers etc    always spacious  not crowded  open when you want it  I used it everyday  There seems to always be someone cleaning the place  almost compulsively  but that s kind of what you want in a hotel  isn t it So  dont think about it  Book it  you won t be sorry  The  quot team leader quot  for the hosts is a nice guy who looks you straight in the eye and cant do enough for you  the Andaz hosts are a global team of young women and men and lend a really nice   quot cosmopolitan and efficient feel to the place  Lots of bankers during the week and some weddings on the weekend  but  sorry to sound kid phobic  never any screaming kids running around  which works for me when I am travelling and working  I feel like these guys would be written up in  quot Fast Company quot  or  quot Business Week quot    they are listening to the customer and doing it right  they are also disrupting the hotel guest service model all the way to the bank  and being more customer centric not just in lip service like their competitors  but in the way they have designed check in and the whole guest experience literally from the time you walk in  If you are coming to London and want a  quot reasonable for London quot  hotel  I have paid anywhere from  US        per night   where you can rest  work  exercise  have good access to the rest of London have peace of mind and get treated really well but without pretension  pushiness or exorbitance  this is your place And yeah  I would live here if I lived in a hotel  Just go  Andaz is the place  Trust me  Book  em 
P =>   Great hotel and service  Next Liverpool St station The hotel is next door to the Liverpool St Station of the Tube making it easy to get around  It s not a straight shot from Heathrow but it wasn t too hard to connect  The Heathrow Express is definitely the best way to get to and from the airport  The local train takes far longer  The Andaz is located in the financial banking section of the city so it s perhaps not as convenient for sightseeing  The hotel and staff were great  We were trying to line up last minute tickets to Wimbledon and they bent over backwards to help us out  Our room  while not huge  was very nice  new and clean  It was well appointed and appears to have been built or remodeled in the last year or so  The bathtub is oddly high making it hard to enter and exit  Careful grabbing for the towel heater when you slip out since it s rather hot  Not withstanding the height the shower had good water pressure and the bathroom was well appointed There s a decent size gym in the basement  A half dozen treadmills  free weights  machines  yoga mats  fit balls and a good selection of equipment  We lifted weights and then ran around London s sights There are several restaurants in the hotel but we did not eat at any of them  They all looked good though  There s also an M amp S Simply Food market across the street with a great selection  Somewhat like an organic      with wine  We need them in the States We booked our room with points but i believe it s fairly expensive  Of course  all of London is pricey All in all the Andaz was great and I d highly recommend it  
P =>   Great stay Lovely modern hotel with great beds  We booked for a birthday treat and we were not disappointed  The real advantage is that it is right outside Liverpool St station  On a weekend the Spittalfield market is worth a visit with so many places to eat that breakfast is not needed  We had to wait    minutes for a cooked breakfast because all the cooked food had gone but that is our only gripe  We would definitely stay there again  
P =>  Best Hotel In London  Fantastic We stayed at this hotel for   nights over the ust Bank Holiday weekend  The professional and friendly service we received from the staff at this hotel was just fantastic from the minute we arrived to the minute we left  On arrival we were shown to some seats and then offered complimentary tea or coffee We were checked in by a guy with a laptop  There s no reception desk at this hotel  The whole check in experience was both welcome and informal and a refreshing change from other hotels We were allocated two adjoining rooms for our stay and even though we arrived early our rooms were ready The rooms were spacious and well appointed with complimentary mini bar with mineral water  fruit juices and granola bars  The Bose I Pod docking station in the room was also greatly appreciated  The beds were very comfotable and noise levels in the room were minimal We decided to explore the area  but on reaching the entrance realised it was raining quite heavily  Not a problem  one of the staff quickly appeared with   umbrellas  which again was typical of the service at this hotel Breakfast in the      restaurant was both plentiful and of excellent quality  Even though it was buffet style  the cooked breakfast was as good as  cooked to order  in many other   star establishments  My parents sampled this same restaurant one evening and were impressed with the quality of the food The room itself is very grand and again the staff excelled themselves When we next return to London  we will be staying at The Andaz  This is the best hotel we have stayed in and we have stayed in many   star hotels  The customer service is second to none  We went for afternoon tea at The Ritz whilst we were here and the customer service there  whilst very good did not come up to the standard of The Andaz   You just don t get service like this anymore  My thanks to the management and all the staff for a great stay   
P =>  Great location nice rooms but trying too hard My wife and I stayed at the Andaz for one night in ust as a guest of Hyatt and we visit London regularly so I am probably a bit cynical  We had a lovely stay and the hotel is in great location  just outside Liverpool Street station  The Andaz is pitching itself as a trendy and hip hotel in the equally trendy and hip Shoreditch area  But as I am well over    it was all a bit lost on me Anyway on to the review Check inNow the Andaz doesn t have the usual check in desk but instead has stylish people standing around with laptops  checking you in remotely So we were approached by one of these stylish people  who subsequently told me that the smoking room I had requested wasn t available and actually the room wasn t available as it was still being cleaned This wasn t a problem as we had plans and came back to the hotel later I did  however  feel fobbed off by stylish person one so when I went back I asked another stylish person  this time a very helpful lady  And as suspected my smoking room was now available The roomsOur room was fine  It was clean and had very nice fixtures and fittings that you would expect for a decent hotelYou can request a pre loaded i pod for the room  see very hip  which fits into a BOSE speaker system but you do have to leave your credit card details and they will charge you      if you nick it The bathroom was equally as nice but the water system did make a heck of a noise You do have a free soft drink mini bar which is pitched as a healthy mini bar   Ours contained   bottles of water    bottles of apple juice and one museli bar  Not a great selection  particularly if you don t like apple juice but a nice touch We didn t try the overpriced breakfast as there was a Pret over the road Overall this is good hotel in a great location but it just felt that it was trying too hard and not getting it right all the time  
P =>   Nice to have a hip hotel like the Andaz in a business area Sleek and modern  unique approach to providing accomodations  It was a pleasure to stay here and its my second time  which is as nice as the first  Plus the hotel is becoming surrounded by lots of happening places  so its not isolated by being in the business district at all  This is a plus for when you stay over a weekend as I did And they were so great after flying all night they had my room ready at   am even though check in isn t until the afternoon  They were so nice  Love it there  
P =>   Lovely Hotel I stayed at the Andaz Hyatt on Liverpool street for   nights The hotel is very well located  right next to Liverpool train station that connects to stansted airport the tube and national railway Also you can get buses to Oxford street and all major sightseeings   The hotel is beautiful and well designed The rooms are not very spacious but they have all shorts of utilities like ipod dock lcd tv wifi free internet and free healthy mini bar  The only thing that was a bit weird  is that when someone flashes the toilette  you can hear it very loud in the bathroom  either if it comes from the next room or another floor The breakfast is very good and had no problems there  
P =>   A Great Hotel A great hotel  Stayed in a king size room with the most comfortable bed ever  The bathroom had excellent amenities with a heated towel rack and a good size bath  Breakfast was excellent and was included in our price which we booked through roomex com  A free snack bar was included  Would stay here again without hesitation  
P =>   Wonderful Hotel    Do not miss the chance to stay in this excellent hotel  It may be a little expensive but it is totally worth it  Coviniently located in the City of London  the underground station is adjacent to the building  Very safe  very helpful  very good  Especially if you fly in Stansted Airport  you just hop in the train and hop off at the hotel s front door   Excellent big rooms if you spend a liitle extra  it is always to upgrade your hotel room to something bigger to experience the best that a hotel can offer   very clean  very contemporary  very nice bathroom  ipod is a blast  very powerful output     LCD a treat I was very satisfied with the served breakfast on a nearby restaurant and you will NEVER be hungry there  Cafes  restaurants  supermarkets and just around the corner  Shopping is also a treat with excellent street markets nearby  
P =>   Loved the Andaz  We stayed two nights over the weekend and really enjoyed our stay  Check in was unusual with the staff coming to you with lap tops  but it was efficient and the woman was very nice  She upgraded us for being Hyatt members and we got a corner room on the top floor  which she escorted us to  Great size for a London hotel  Modern  sleek and clean with a reasonable sized bathroom  The bed and bedding were one of the best we have ever slept on and I must find out how to buy one for ourselves at home  We slept like babies Room service was prompt and tasty  and the complimentary water  juices and granola bars were a delightful touch  The bathroom amenities were also very good and I felt like we got a very plush experience for only     pounds a night Location is extremely convenient being right outside Liverpool street station  We even saw the Liverpool Football Team stay at the hotel  Staff were very helpful and friendly  not a bit of pretense at all  We ve stayed at the Hoxton a few times before and found this to be more luxurious  spacious and high end for about the same price  We enjoyed it and will definitely be back  Well done  Andaz  
P =>   Excelent modern hotel If you like modern hotels  this is the place to stay  We had a huge corner room  with flat screen TV  Bose iPod docing station a mini bar with complementary juices and water and the most comfortable  huge bed  The hotel is conveniently located at the Liverpool trainstation  which allows you to get everywhere quickly and is especially helpfull  when you want to take the Stensted Express to the airport  Would always come back  
P =>  Excellent hotel Upon arriving at the Andaz  we were greeted in the lobby and checked in remotely  the hotel is well located and beautifully decorated inside  Our suite was out of this world with a huge bedroom and parlor and well appointed bathroom  The staff were warm  friendly and extremely helpful  The ala carte breakfast was excellent and great service  Conveniently located next to Liverpool St  Station and London s famous curry row  
P =>  Clean and Modern But Questionable Service This is a fairly new hotel with modern  minimalistic design  Very nice that the price includes internet and all drinks in the fridge  The rate is really not that bad considering it s in London  Great especially if you are traveling elsewhere through Liverpool station  However  choices of entertainment and food are limited  More importantly  I just do not understand the staff s service and behavior during my stay The strangest thing I experienced at this hotel is the treatment of my luggages and the service of the staff  I checked in on y    in the early afternoon and got a great corner room  After checking in  I left my luggages in the room and went out for city tour  When I came back in the evening  all my belongings were gone  After checking with the front desk  they told me they had to remove all my stuff because they thought they were the luggages left by the previous guest  It sounded unreasonble to me since I checked in on the same day and the room was cleaned  I would have called them for assistance if there had been lugguages left by the previous guest in the room  The fact that they took my stuff during my stay without asking is odd  Besides  there were name tags on my luggages and they should have known that they belong to the person who just checked in The strange treatments did not end there  The next morning at around   am while I was still in bed  I heard a person trying to scan the key card to get in to my room and playing with the door knob  I looked through the peekhole and saw a person with uniform  the hotel staff  at my door trying to get in  The point is  the person NEVER KNOCKED THE DOOR  I opened the door and was quite upset about the behavior  The staff apologized and told me he was just checking the lock  Checking what  There was nothing wrong with the lock and the key  It was the treatment of my luggages that was inappropriate  If they really had doubt about the lock and key and needed to examine them  shouldn t they inform the guest before trying and AT LEAST KNOCK THE DOOR  Sounds like a common sense  Well  the staff surely didn t show they understand it I did not lose anything during my stay but they lost my trust in its security It s a shame because I did like the design and facilities  
P =>   An absolute ripoff   Do not be fooled by the website pics The website looks amazing but the whole place is an absolute rip off  We paid      for one night in a pokey room that was no better than you would get at a Travelodge for alot cheaper  It s like they have put a funky facade on an old hotel but not bothered to improve what s beyond reception  It gets worse when we tried to eat something  I ordered a bowl of fruit for the room that i estimated to be around    but was charged     for   apples    pear    banana and some wrinkly grapes  I then ordered   sandwiches  Again  not being aware of the price i assumed these would be around    each  imagine how shocked i was to geta bill for        for two average sandwiches      can you believe it  I just feel like such an idiot for not checking but would never have imagined in my wildest dreams that a hotel company would so blatantly rip people off  I assume this hotel  being in central business London  is preying on business people and tourists  I am ashamed that this practice is going on in our country  Tourists   stay away from this place  You can get much better quality and value for money elsewhere  London has some great hotels with excellent food and service at a reasonable price and this place should be avoided at all costs  
P =>   Great Hotel but a bit too Trendy This hotel has great weekend rates and looks gorgeous so we booked here in spite of it being a bit far from the action The building itself is really quite beautiful and they have done a very nice job with the renovation  As noted  check in is a bit chaotic  They were not all that busy when we arrived so we did not have an issues and were even offered a drink while checking in  Check out was difficult ans there really was no line and the staff really had their hands full trying to figure out who was next  What is so wrong with a traditional front desk  Also  as noted  no real bell staff that I could see The elevators are a bit slow but once upstairs I was really happy that I chose this hotel  It is all done in a very modern style without being cold  The beds were great and large  The iPod dock was a nice touch  There is a small refrigerator built into the wall holding complementary water  fruit juices and snacks  Better yet  there was space in there for some cheese and salad which I bought at the M amp S across the street  I want the bath for my house  Good strong air conditioning   important as the big window in my room overlooked a noisy street so I could not open at night  With all closed  the room was very quiet We did not use any of the restaurants and the bar looked a bit trendy for my taste so I ordered a few beers from room service one night  The prices were reasonable and the service very quick Service overall was good  A lot of issues seem to come from the odd check in check out process The hotel is close to the Tower and Tower Bridge but really more suited for business  You can get to livelier areas using the tube located under the hotel  Having all of the shops at Liverpool Street Station around the corner is very handy  The rest of the area is fairly quite on the weekends The hotel is very expensive weekdays  If you can navigate the odd lobby processes and don t mind staying in the City  this is a good place for a weekend stay  
P =>   definitely no   star service Although the hotel looks quite modern and fashionable i don t have the best memories  It felt like as soon you booked the room and your credit card is charged they give a damn about you Especially if you pay a room rate of over       without breakfast  Already by checking in i felt put down by the reception lady  All the stuff is foreign and seems not very skilled in excellent customer service  I stayed with two friends and we booked a room for    The room was very small and an extra camping bed was put which was very short and uncomfortable  The breakfast was very nice in a beautiful Hall  The hotel is located right in the finance quarter and around the courner of a station  
P =>  wow  Stylish  comfortable   star hotel next to liverpool street station  The rooms are very spatious and well appointed and have lots of drinks snacks which are    wait for it   free   unheard of in UK   In room entertainment  music jukebook films internet excellent  Service is slick and friendly and unlike the other London five star establishments which are frankly stuffy and pompous The choice of restaurants bars is huge including japanese restaurant  fish restaurant etc  spa and gym on site  I highly recommend  
P =>  Great location  Booked for a one night stay   Saturday night   via Hotels com   cost was      Only   minutes from Liverpool St Tube as you exit the hotel you can see  quot The Gherkin quot  is visible just a couple of streets away  Fantastic location for Tower Bridge  amp  the South Bank with it s trendy bars  amp  nightlife  Bit of a different check in   we couldn t see a desk and nobody was about then someone appeared at an informal standing desk area and checked us in  Stayed in a special needs room   although neither of us is disabled   the guy who checked us in took us up and asked us not to pull any of the red cords   very polite and friendly service Bedroom was top quality with Queen bed  cool air con  just the job in the recent heat  and very minimalist decor   good    inch plasma too  Bathroom was spacious and bright with wetroom shower  Only problem was there was no plug on the sink   small gripe really and didn t bother to call for one Went out for a couple of hours and when we came back someone had been in our room and pulled the cutains and re arranged the bed linen  I can t say I was happy with staff just letting themselves into our room   so black mark there Apart from that everything was great  Breakfast was really good   had smoked salmon  amp  scrambled egg   price was     for two as I hadn t booked inclusive b amp b via hotels com I d recommend for the location and friendly staff  amp  quality room  amp  bed   just ask them not to make any unscheduled visits to your room  
P =>  Awesome Hotel   Very Impressive We found this hotel through Expedia and thought it looked very nice and it was in the perfect location for our trip  so we decided to book  As the hotel is in The City the hotel has a lot of business travellers staying on weekdays therefore this rates are double the price through the week and it is much cheaper at the weekend so we did not pay the full rate  As you go into the lobby the hotel is very grand and contemporary  the staff then checks you in using handheld computers  there is complimentary tea  coffee and fruit juices in the lobby as well as fresh pastries in the morning We arrived early on Saturday morning to surprise my husbands sister who was staying at the hotel for her birthday  it had been explained to the reception staff that we would be arriving and that they should let us up to there room for our surprise visit  they were very accommodating and helpful  We also checked in at this time which was very good because it was only   am  We found the staff very nice and they didn t look down there noses at us  which I had read in previous reviews We were asked when we arrived for a credit card which we gave them however what they don t tell you is that they hold     until you leave and if you don t have a credit card you are asked to pay     per night  When we got to our room it was very nice  there is a complimentary minibar however there is no alcohol in the minibar  The bed was very comfortable which I have found rare in hotels  there were also lots of pillows which is always good  Our room didn t have a view we were actually looking out into Liverpool St train station which didn t bother us  however in the morning we could slightly here the announcements in the station However my husband s sister was staying in another room on the same floor and although still nice it didn t have as much character as our room  I feel we got value for money however  if we had paid the higher midweek rate I would have expected more from this hotel The location is absolutely perfect for seeing London as you have the choice of   tube lines which all go to the major sightseeing parts of London  I am defiantly going to stay at the Andaz again  
P =>  Style over substance there must be better options than this  Arrived after a    hour overnight flight from the US  walked into the  reception   looked to my right and saw two guys in suits  standing at a table playing on their laptops  One guy turned his head  looked down his nose at me over his glasses and said  quot Hi quot    quot Do you know where reception is  quot  I asked quot This is it quot  he replied I couldn t help but think  if this is the reception of a hotel at this price  why don t you turn towards me properly  smile and say something like  quot welcome to the Andaz sir quot  Not a good start After he d finished checking me in I did comment to him that its a little confusing as there is absolutely nothing marking this table out as being the reception He replied in an indignant tone  quot yes  its very different isn t it quot  Next  up to the room  he d given me a room facing over Liverpool Street but unfortunately  when I went to un pack I opened the wardrobe to a bad smell of body odour  I left it open for a while to see if the smell would dissipate but    minutes later no change so  I called reception to ask to change rooms It took quite a while for the  guest services  girl to come up and I had to call them once to see what was happening  She seemed quite flustered when she arrived at my door but said she had found me another room  can a hotel in The City really be that busy on a Saturday afternoon  The previous   weeks I d been staying in hot  amp  humid Houston so  once I was un packed in my new room I thought I d open the window to get some fresh air You actually have to call security to get the windows un locked  they did this quickly and I threw the window open to enjoy some cool early evening air After watching TV for a while I realised someone must be having a BBQ near by as the smell was quite intense however  when I walked over to the window and put my head out I realised I was actually looking over the roof of Liverpool Street train station and the BBQ smell was coming from the exhaust vent from Burger King in the station Needless to say  I closed the window and that s the way it stayed for the rest of the week The TV gave some problems  it would intermittently flash up big messages on the screen about  quot Your Sky Box needs to re boot quot  and such like although they would try and fix this quickly when I called  I didn t watch much TV for the rest of the week though Bathroom ok although the plumbing in the walls makes some very strange noises  I guess because its an old building  The tap on the sink in my room had a tendency to leek and this would flow onto the floor making the floor quite wet  Oh and be careful with the showers  they are of that old style with a big lever for temperature  there seems to be only a small point in the middle for  warm   either side of that is freezing cold or boiling hot Breakfast is ok  if you can find it  I m guessing they must have had some problems with guests not being able to find the breakfast room as there now seem to be lots of signs on the walls as you go through all the various corridors and up and down stairs to make your way there The room they serve breakfast in is very nice  high ceiling and very grand The food though is quite averageOne good thing I remember was that the room service was quick and the food very good but overall I certainly wouldn t go back to this place or recommend it to a friend  
P =>   Stop seaching  Been to London more than    times and we finally found home Booked a doubleroom with queen size bed  but was  quot upgrated quot  to a truly king size Nice room with a bath top that fits tall people as well Breakfast buffet was absolutly amazing  the spacious restaurant was beautiful So  if you want a stay in London and want a hotel with perfect location  service  nice rooms and a breakfast that beats most other hotels  Andaz it is It is a little expensive I think  but instead of having trouble with things at a cheaper hotel  I would say that the extra money is well spend  
P =>   brilliant concept of hotel accommodation I was looking for a luxury type hotel in London which had availability at short notice and a good range of leisure facilities  I took my boyfriend here for a bithday treat It is a stone throw away from Liverpool St station and other tube connections so ideal if you want to visit theatre sites whilst staying in London We arrived at the hotel and were greeted immediately by a member of staff who made us extremely relaxed and offered us refreshments  Their reception is an informal area where you are checked in using portable laptops  We were offered a room upgrade which we accepted quite happily The room was fine all the usual mod cons flat screen TV and fridge where most of the drinks and food stuffs were complimentary no extra charge  The bathroom was nice it had lovely touches and again complimentary toiletries for you to keep  Both healthy ranges are on offer such as organic apple juice and biscuits to organic toiletries We dined in the      restaurant all courses were brilliantly made  especially as I am vegetarian  one that does not like cheese   they made a meal which was a combination of other elements from other menu dishes and they were most flexible in allowing me to make up a meal plan  The decor and atmosphere in this restaurant was fabulous  whilst you enjoyed your meal a cellist improvised to all kinds of music from mellow to upbeat tracks chosen by a trendily dressed DJ who manoeuvred around the room using a pace maker system  he controlled the order of play with a handheld device  you could if you wish choose tracks from the available music list  You could still enjoy a romantic meal or chat casually with your fellow guests We enjoyed a morning in the gym which is well equipped with cardiovascular and weight training equipment amongst free weights they had a Smith s machine and other comprehensive items if you like to weight train for fitness you would not be disappointed here We enjoyed our time in the steam room which is very large  At the time we visited we were the only two people in there so we really chilled out here  Other guest s came by and used the gym etc There are massage and treatment rooms available too  at additional cost  We did not try any as they were quite expensive at      an hour for a massage  I am use to paying no more than     at my local gym  You can also have beauty treatments if you book with the spa staff  We did not try any as we were only there for the evening until mid afternoon the next day We checked out about       am and were able to leave our bags in a storage room so we could do a bit of local exploring  We visited Spitalfields market which is under a roofed area  There were loads of places to eat and generally chill you can buy designergoods made by the stall holders who were all very nice and friendly We got back to the hotel and had a late breakfast there in their Catch Restaurant  service was a bit delayed but again they accommodated my vegetarian needs effortlessly and although we had to wait some time between the first and second course the meals were healthily made and delicious I would definitely stay again at the Andaz again  We enjoyed this hotel it is somewhere listed in the    s to    s for rated hotels in London  
P =>   Geekily Victorian Last stay here  until earlier this month  was   years ago  when hotel was named the Great Eastern  Location on top of Liverpool station is fantastic for City East visits  and the re do of the Great Eastern is an improvement by Hyatt chain  Gym is very good  but layout of hotel due to placement over the station is convoluted  as what may be placed  quot vertically quot  in other venues necessitates horizontal placement here  Bfast  for instance  calls for getting off elevator on Floor    not ground floor  and walking over into another building  Plumbing also resembles cross between what one might find on a airplane  high pressure toilets  with a shower from a caravan  Wifi either is underpowered or is being used by many teenagers streaming video  Also  for a modern place  some rooms can be dark and lacking outlets to charge laptops  Very clean place  though  and convenient  Restaurants bars during week are populated by local City workers  male thirty somethings wearing pin striped suits w o ties  Several small business meetings were being held in the hotel during our stay  Weekend is slower pace  but hotel is quick walk to East attractions  
P =>   ent but has some flaws My wife and I stayed at the Andaz for   nights  and I have to say that there were plenty of positives  but a few head scratching negatives The room that we got on the top floor was rather spacious which is understand is not the norm in London  The big ultra comfortable bed was fantastic  Hyatt always does this right   However  with this being on the top floor of a very old building  the only way to look out the porthole style windows was up  since they were high on the wall  That was strange We loved the free minibar and wifi  although it was brutally slow bandwidth for a hotel of this caliber   The flat panel TV was nice and large  however I believe that the list of available channels is very  very limited  I love the towel warmer in the bathroom   great trend in hotels This hotel has one of the best hotel gyms I have ever seen The downsides seem petty  but it made the trip a little frustrating First  we had to get a step ladder for the bathtub  It was a high step up and it didn t feel safe  especially since the handle on the wall was loose   After speaking with the hotel GM  they wound up also bringing us  my wife is short  a non slip stool  which was better Also it appears that this hotel doesn t believe that travelers want to look pressed and clean as the rooms do not come with irons and ironing boards  Upon asking for one  we were given an old crusty iron and an ironing board that not only had a nice tear in the pad  try ironing on top of that   but it also appeared that it had been thrown down a flight of stairs on more than one occasion  When we asked for a replacement  we were given a more steady board  still with a torn cover and another beat up iron with a broken switch on it After much back and forth with housekeeping  they finally brought us one more set  after being told that there were no more available in the hotel and the hotel has less than one per room  that was a slightly better iron and an ironing board that had the cover put on backwards  I swear it was comical at this point  The last issue was for my wife  The hair dryer isn t in the bathroom  it s in the desk   along with the makeup mirror  It s underneath the desk and it pulls up  We didn t know this and even asked for a makeup mirror to be brought up because my wife was having issues in the bathroom  again  she s short   Instead of telling us where the mirror was  they just told us that they didn t have a mirror to give us Now  in the hotel s defense  this could have been covered in the  quot let me show you to the room quot  that was offered when we checked in  but we declined after having gotten in on a very delayed red eye  Who knows    Overall  the location was fantastic for getting around London and the staff was efficient and pleasant if lacking a certain feeling of warmth  The GM genuinely wants the guests to be comfortable and was incredibly helpful when speaking to him Just get your clothes pressed before you go  
P =>   Great Hotel This Conran designed hotel is wonderful mix of modern and Victorian styling  with a great lobby area and pleasant  efficient staff  It s next the the Liverpool St  station so easy to get to if you choose public transport  Although modern  the rooms are very comfortable  Plus  they offer free amenities like bottled water and snacks in the room  which are replenished daily  This hotel succeeds in being modern and doing with style  
P =>   Get a good deal via lastminute s Top Secret hotels We recently got a good deal  approx      for one night  for Andaz via Top Secret rooms on lastminute com which we were very happy with The hotel has lost only a small amount of its character in its transformation from The Great Eastern to part of Hyatt s new chain   I d say hip and corporate contemporary rather than cutting edge these days  But onto our stay  our comfortable  well fitted out room was a good size and the bed was massive with good white sheets and bedding  We also liked the iPod docking station  the clean and super functional bathroom  with bath   the generous amount of Ren toiletries and the mini bar stocked with complimentary organic juices  water and nibbles Location  right next to Liverpool St  made getting about London on a hot Bank Holiday weekend really easy  A great choice if you can get it via lastminute com and need to be close to Liverpool St  Our only niggle was reception   they were so busy when we were checking in checking out  amp  retrieving luggage that it took forever and a day  the best part of     hr to actually get to our rooms  However  the desk staff were gracious  amp  as efficient as they possibly could be and the complimentary soft drinks they were handing out at check in went some way to assuaging the backlog of hot and sweaty guests building up However  if the company is paying and you don t mind a   min walk  Threadneedles has more character  but the rooms are smaller   and if you re on a budget   amp  can book in advance to get the super cheap deals  and looking for something a bit more Hoxton hipster  then The Hoxton might be more for you  
P =>   Great stay at a lovely hotel I stayed here on a Saturday night with my husband and    month old son and we would thoroughly recommend the hotel for a weekend getaway in London  The staff were friendly  the reception was impressive  and our room  although a little small  was well kitted out with everything we needed   including a complimentary fridge of water  juice and nibbles  a flat screen tv  ipod dock  bathrobes  lovely Ren toiletries etc etc  We were sorry to have to leave  
P =>  exactly like the pictures this hotel is extremely modern   the staff was friendly  the room was small  but perfect for me for a   day stay  definitely the nicest hotel i ve stayed at in london very close to the tube station with easy access to most lines of the tube  it is in the financial district which shuts down after work  but it at least it s quiet  
P =>  Great City location yet not a fab experience    The best thing going for this hotel is its City location   if that is where one has to be for business  it is very convenient    For the money  I would probably head somewhere else next time when staying in the City  perhaps even the the Hilton across the London Bridge  So the cons first  In many ways  this hotel is quite beautiful  I loved the domed areas of this old refurbished building  and yet  despite all the modern design features  eg  rather lovely sleek furniture  accents of colour in otherwise monochronistic colour scheme  and high tech touches   it lacks soul  It sure doesn t evoke in one any great feelings or memories to take away The floor plan  at least in my room on the  th floor  did not make sense  The bathroom i had was absolutely enormous  for no apparent reason  you could skate in it  and yet the room was so small for such a grand bathroom    Soundproofing is not great  Aircon is noisy and it did not cooperate on the temperature regulation front  so I had to switch it off which then made the room too stuffy to sleep in  Doors not easy to get into Last gripe  the laptop check in by  what seemed universally height challenged staff who insisted one sat down on backless useless round stools in the reception upon arrival whilst one s luggage and laptops were thrown all over the place  was inconvenient and slow  They need your credit card to swipe  but it was not working so one got stuck in there for inordinate amounts of time  Whenever one needed  quot real reception quot  people to talk to  the line up was there and it was frustratingly slow On the positive side  housekeeping and support staff on the actual floors were super helpful  in fact they are the ones and not laptop wielding snooties on the ground floor who are kind enough to help one navigate a rather meandering large building   Any calls for room service were handled in super efficient and friendly way  and I have to recommend the japanese menu for room service  which was very good for hotel food  So  to sum up  an OK hotel  but not great  
P =>   Amazing value     but       Extremely friendly and efficient staff  Offered  very welcome  cup of tea on check in in lobby  Shown to room where facilities  and use of key to access electric power were explained  Room and bathroom very clean   complimentary minibar a nice touch  BUT   why the silly  stylish  uncomfortable bench instead of a two seat sofa    much uncomfortable wriggling   Breakfast excellent and excellent value   serving dishes freshly topped up by attentive staff If only the hotel had been closer to the West End  it would have been pretty much perfect  
P =>   Best hotel in London for luxury and position This is an amazing concept in hotels  It is based around fitness and food  Included in your hotel charge is the mini bar  full of healthy food and drink  as well as all the Internet you can use The staff  especially the manager  go out of their way to help you with every bit of your trip  Rooms are big  clean and modern  Food is also something special 
P =>  So hip and modern loved it  When we got to the hotel  we were sat down and checked in while we were sitting down  once checked in  Took the lift to the  th floor and the view was amazing  Bed and bathroom  clean and roomy and comfortable Breakfast was the best part  we had a choice of salmon eggs  ceareals  different types of bread  juices and teas  We were allowed to use internet  spa and gym Friendly staff  everywhere  It was a real pleasure to stay at the hotel  I will recommend this hotel to any one of any age  
P =>  very very good but Stayed here for the first time over the may day weekend  the hotel was excellent   a large room which was quiet at night and a pleasant temperature cooled by excellent a c  This is unusual for London hotels of any class  Now come the but   hotel lacking in information re breakfast times   location of amenities  Breakfast itself was poor for a five star rated hotel   my wife sent her eggs back   they were cold   How do you fix it   stick it under the grill for five mins   now hard yolks   the way you fix it is to recook a fresh batch  Much prefer the buffet system at the Hilton  Second black mark   in room tea coffee mug was chipped and was not replaced over our two day stay  Overall as London hotels go this is excellent   just needs a few wee tweeks and it will be unbeatable  
P =>   Gem of a Hotel This Hyatt property is located directly above the Liverpool Street Station so it is very accessible to the tube   it is approximately a    plus minute trip from Paddington Station  if you are taking the Heathrow Express   I had read about someone s reservations on staying here because it was not centrally located   if you don t mind using the tube  and get a day pass   it really is very easy to get around   Figure    minutes to Buckingham Palace   The hotel is very stylish modern urban  The rooms are huge as is the bathroom  Both the room and bathroom was very  very clean  and when the turndown service came in  they resupplied towels and other amenities that had been used  The room was cleaned early and it was spotless  A nice touch was the water  cookies  and almonds that were located in the free refrigerator  The workout area is decent size especially for a hotel in a downtown location  It was clean and there was a variety of machines and free weights There are four restaurants attached to the hotel  Be warned  however  that on the weekends  only two of those restaurants are open  This is the City area and many things are closed in the area  However  the area is becoming more of a  quot hip quot  place to be and more and more restaurants and bars are staying open on the weekend  I did have breakfast at one of the restaurants and it was very nice   just a fry up but very plentiful and reasonable price wise for London  If you are needing a taxi  there are plenty right outside the door  My only unease with this hotel is the check in front desk staff  The gents that I spoke with were very helpful but the two women at night were not as good  They were very pleasant but their understanding of English was limited and it was difficult to discover what was happening in the local area  I know that the front desk staff is trying to be trendy and all  but it is just as easy to check in at a desk as to sit down in the lobby and have the staffer come to you  and then run back and forth to a desk station to retrieve information   Would I stay again  Yes but    I will probably try the Hyatt Churchill next time because it will be closer to the area that I will be spending my time in on my next visit  
P =>   Central location and high quality service I stayed at the Andaz last night and have to say the hotel is in a fab location  near Liverpool st station but you can t hear a train    the service was very efficient with staff running around with laptops and the room was lovely  I got this hotel at a top secret location rate which was definitely value for money  The gym was good and the steam room was nice  no jacuzzi sauna  I ordered a few things from house services and the items were delivered promptly  
P =>  Nice hotel good price a bit out of the way This hotel was good value for money in London  Style wise  it seems geared toward the    or    something professional demographic  teetering between design hotel and business hotel in feeling On the plus  the hotel is modern  visually interesting  and rooms are spacious  well laid out and comfortable  The rooms have nice  special touches  like complementary mini bar and wi fi  The reception service was good and  again  the price was good On the minus side  there was an issue with our bathtub that never got fixed despite a couple of phone calls to maintenance  There was some irritating  perpetual noise from the pipes and air ducts that made for a not great sleep  And location wise  it is in the heart of the banking district which means that it is a complete ghost town after five and on the weekend  If you want dinner after    forget about it  for example  It is right beside a major tube station  but still   the neighbourhood is certainly not ideal for a weekend traveller  I would recommend this hotel  but with the reservations above  
P =>   highly recommended This is a gorgeous hotel it has a very relaxed feel to it which is rare for a hotel in central London  The rooms are very spacious with EXTREMELY comfortable beds  The hotel has lots of nice touches like the small guest bar in the lobby  you can sit and help yourself to a complimentary glass of wine or two and bar snacks which we thought was really nice  The mini bar in the room was also complimentary and was fully stocked with lots of nice fruit drinks and snacks  They will bring breakfast to your room if you prefer for no extra charge and it was one of the best hotel breakfasts we have ever had  It is well located to see all the sights of London  as you are more in the cultural part of the city and the tourist centre of the West End a very short tube ride away  
P =>   True    accommodation  I took my son and his girlfriend to London for a Theatre weekend  We stayed in a King Suite at the Andaz  The value of the accommodation was excellent   I was only charged for   adult  both kids being under    went free   The suite was very large and with a very reliable air conditioner built in to the master bedroom  very controlable and made for a restful night s sleep in the very comfy King Size bed  The main bathroom and second W C was clean and in fine order  well supplied with REN toiletries which I had never used before   very nice indeed   The lounge and dining area was modern in design like much of the hotel  however  this is combined cleverly with some traditional elegence  particularly in the      restaurant   On our first evening we had dinner in the      restaurant  the service and surroundings were quite literally heavenly  An elegant live violinist played beautifully in the dining hall throughout our experience    she was in no way intrusive and enhanced the occasion perfectly  The selection of wines was superb and served with professionalism  Breakfast was included in the room price and arrived the following morning with obvious care and attention where quality and presentation are concerned   all room service was conducted in a friendly manner  We felt very welcome throughout our stay  Unlike other reviews which report noisy plumbing  we did not experience any such problem  The water temperature in the shower was a little difficult to control and my morning newspaper was forgotten but these I don t view as complaints  rather more like tiny blemishes on a fantastic hotel experience  Overall  i d recommend this hotel to anyone and I will definately come back to experience more of the many facilities and restaurants on the premises  
P =>   Superb   Blew Me Away  I do not normally write reviews  let alone gush  but this hotel is a welcome relief for a solo traveler on the road  I got in early today and wanted to store luggage until check in  but the three young men who work the lobby   all of whom were clean  professional and smartly dressed   let me check in right away  brought me a glass of water  carried my luggage to my room and refused a tip  despite my insistence  I am a very  very frequent Hyatt traveler  and Andaz gets right the few things Hyatt gets wrong  for example  they include internet at no extra cost  and some great other services  I love the room  the location is amazing  right next to a tube station  walking distance to Tower of London   I intend to stay nowhere else in London in my future trips  if I can afford to stay here  
P =>   Perfect wedding destination We held our wedding party at Andaz  and couldn t have been happier with the service  from start to finish  The events team were excellent   and the day was perfect  The bedroom was spacious  clean and bright and the staff very pleasant to deal with  We needed to leave some luggage to be collected the following morning and this was handled professionally  The hotel is stunning  really unique with its modern fittings in an old building  All in all I would stringly recommend the hotel for any reason for stay  The only negative I can think of was that the shower didnt drain properly   not an issue for   night though  
P =>   Really cool hotel great staff facilities and location  My wife and I stayed in the Andaz hotel  Liverpool St  last weekend  The location is excellent  literally around the corner from Liverpool St  station The reception area is very tastefully designed and the staff were extremely helpfulCheck in was hassle free and one of the receptionists showed us to our room and explained all the features in our room   We stayed in one the King rooms and both my wife and I agreed that it was one of the comfiest beds that we had ever slept in The bathroom  shower etc  were good and powerful and the room was quite spacious and nicely decorated  The complimentary juice and snack mini bar is also a great touch  I tried out the gym which was very modern and extremely well equipped  The steam room was just what the doctor ordered after a few beers the previous night  Tthe individual changing rooms and showers also added to the  quot   star feel quot  of the hotel  We didn t have dinner at the hotel but the we had a drink in the hotel Bar The George which was busy and had a great atmosphere compared to so many other dull hotel bars  Breakfast was included in our rate and is served in a trendy cafe next door  The breakfast was very good  it s not a buffet  but the portions are very generous and it was all freshly cooked The express checkout was also handy as we were in a hurry to catch the Stansted Express   All in all we re both looking forward to our next trip to London and to staying in the Andaz again  
P =>  Family Loved It Stayed here with the family  and chose it because it is so convenient for a Stansted flight  Staff were very good  breakfast in room very early prior to departure was top notch  No complaints and it really is quite different to the run of the mill London hotel Yes the area is quiet at night  but this is London and you are not short of transport options  
P =>  Funky Lush Hotel Next Door to Liverpool Street Station  My oh my what a lovely funky hotel this is  A lovely stay on New Years Eve        The hotel extended check out time and breakfast serving time with it being NYE Leave Liverpool St Station and turn right  applies regardless of which exit you leave  and within a matter of moments you will hit the Andaz hotel  So  location wise it couldn t be any closer to the station which obviously gives you access to the National Rail network and also the underground Having read reviews on this hotel I kind of knew what to expect and I wasn t disappointed  When we arrived there were quite a few folks checking in  we simply took a seat and waited a short time for someone to check us in  The service for checking in was efficient and fast and we were even upgraded to a king room free of charge   BONUS   You are offered a drink at time of checking in  although don t expect Coke  my boyfriend asked for one and was told they only do organic    So no fizzy pop here   If you want snacks or anything fizzy then there is a Tesco just over the road so fret not  The reception area is very modern as is the rest of the hotel  it truly was nice and my boyfriend was pleased as he is rather fussy with regards to hotels   Men   We were in room     on the  nd floor which is accessed by the lifts  We walked over a little glass bridge and our room was just down the corridor  The room was lush and the bed quite possibly the best I have ever slept in   As you walked into the room on dark wooden floor the bathroom was to your right and wardrobes  with lights in   and fridge filled with juice and water on your left  The bed and desk area were in front of you  Overall the room was lovely  The view was what was to be expected but it wasn t an issue  The hotel provides you with Andaz robes and slippers  nice touch   Plenty of lovely fluffy towels were provided in the bathroom  the bath ones were huge   My only faults with the room   hotel were that there was a rather odd sound in the bathroom every time the hot water was used   monster in the pipes perhaps  It only lasted a few seconds so didn t matter just thought it was a little random  Also  the temperature control on the shower was a bit hit and miss  it was either red hot or freezing cold  perhaps it was just me not knowing how to work it properly   The other thing was the temperature of the room  after getting in at almost  am after New Years Eve the room was freezing  I tried to alter the temp with the electronic control to no avail so it took a while to warm up so that was a bit of a downer when all you want is to get cosy in bed    Also  for those of you who want a kettle in your room  tough   You don t get one  There is also NO HAIRDRYER which was a bit of a bum as I didn t take mine  but never mind  Breakfast was included in the price  and my oh my am I glad it was  You had to sign a ticket with your room number on and for   breakfasts  some fruit  toast and   teas and a juice it came to over      as if   It was nice  but not worth     so it s a bonus you don t have to pay for this  You can pick to have breakfast in your room but we were advised that it was an hours wait so we opted to get up and go to the restaurant which was just outside the hotel a few doors down  I m glad we did as there was more choice on the menu than what was on the room service menu  which may I add is very expensive       for a sarnie  I don t think so    Overall I loved my stay at this hotel and will consider it in the future and also recommend to others  as it is so close to the station everywhere you want to go in London is easy to get to    The hotel is very modern and funky and bright and just very swish it was ace  I was here for New Years Eve      and if I was to do London again for NYE I think I would find a hotel as close to the fireworks as possible as it is near on impossible to get across London after the celebrations  it was a wicked NY but soooooooooo many people it was crazy  We ended up walking across half on London and finally got on a bus   
P =>  Chic cool and convenient This hotel is fantastic  The lobby area sets the tone  as there are some nice surprises  There is no traditional check in desk  but you are greeted by the staff who check you in with there lap tops  I stayed on the  st floor  I left the lift into a huge  modern atrium  with a really cool bar area My room was beautifully decorated  with a complimentary mini bar  and a full english breakfast included by room service Overall  it s excellent  The location is brilliant  right at the heart of Liverpool Street station seconds away I will certainly stay there again  
P =>   Nice Place Good Location My wife and I stayed on a Saturday night  Handy location if you are coming from Stansted airport  Also good location for some of the nice but less touristy areas of London   Farringdon  Clerkenwell  Shoreditch  Hoxton  All these areas are full of nice bars  clubs and restaurants  with arty vibe  latter two can be a bit rough late at night  If you want to go to the West End and Buck House  it would not make sense to stay here  But everything is accessible via Central and Circle tube lines  Liverpool St is quiet ish  at weekends  but you can always find a shop or cafe open Great reception  swift check in at  pm  helpful with local bus info  showed me the room and all mod cons  Room was medium size  modern decor  large bathroom with Ren products  the Mrs tells me these are good   Free juice and water in the mini bar  but no booze Free laundry  internet access  Bose Ipod speakers provided or is typical trendy modern  not too outlandish  Some of the corridors and areas of the room could have done with a good vacuum  but nothing too bad  Got a good night s sleep  bed comfy and temperature was right  all too often too hot in London hotels   Breakfast was good  in Eastway cafe  the hotel is a bit of a maze though  not obvious where the bars and restaurants are We didnt try any of the bars or restaurants  we staggered in late at night and went straight to bed   I am told by friends they are nice though Quite good value at weekends as this is probably aimed at city workers in the week  I would stay here again if I needed to be in the area  
P =>   Very good classy and convenient hotel This hotel in the city and just near the Liverpool Street subway station is really convenient when you come for business  Even for leisure  it is far from nothing in London thanks to the subway being just next door  And you are just minutes walking from Spittafields ket and Brick Lane  Barbicane  or Saint Paul cathedral Rooms are large and beds are really very very comfortable  The bathrooms are perfect Bars are nice  The room service is fast  Breakfast iin the Eastway restaurant is good as well as is dinner And the staff is very nice and helpful  
P =>   Serious Issues Reside Here This hotel is off the beaten path in the financial district of London which becomes a ghost town at      every night and all weekend long  The hotel is an supposed hybrid of the Hyatt chain which mantra is excellent service which is what I did not receive during my stay at Andaz  The maid room attendent was apparently riffling through my closet and decided they should elimate all the dry cleaning plastic hanging in the closet  I had planned to use those bags when repacking  the hotel could have cared less that their employee was going through the guests closet  The checkout from this hotel was another disaster  they could not produce an accurate bill before departure and said they would send one to me  I waited over three weeks and had to go back to the travel agent to receive the final bill for this stay  I had booked stays for the month of ember at this hotel and promptly cancelled them based on the above problems  While you maybe tempted to check this hotel out  buyer beware     while it looks like a great deal it will cost you far more than biting the bullet for a central London hotel in time  aggrevation and taxi fares  
P =>   Love the extra touches Since Hyatt took over this hotel  there have been some very positive and welcome changes  Unlike many hotels  there are a lot of extras included now   free internet  great breakfast  either in room or in one of   restaurants   laundry included  juice water in room  and a coffee and wine bar in the lobby with small snacks available  For the business traveller  these are really helpful   there is nothing worse than having stinky workout gear in your hotel room   here  its gets washed for you  The gym is extremely well equipped although small   it doesnt take too many users to make it crowded  The trainers are excellent   very knowledgeable and helpful  Room   big comfortable beds  TV sound is poor though  Bathrooms   extremely functional  although the vacuum flushing is very noisy  and travels from other rooms  Noise can be an issue here   try to get a room away from the event spaces  The doors slam hard in every room  and along with the vacuum flushing drains  can make for a noisy start in the mornings  And as the hotel has a high proportion of business travellers  people are up early  Service   i find the staff very helpful and efficient   service is understated and makes you feel  quot at home quot  Location   cant be beat if you need to be in that part of the city  Overall  despite the noise  this has become one of my favourite hotels  
P =>  Coolest hotel in London I stayed at andaz in tember after not having been there for two years  The lobby looks incredible and I found the reception team to be both friendly and informative  The atmosphere in the bar and restaurants was as fantastic as I remembered  if not better   is there anything better than having your server remember how you like your eggs and what your beverage of choice is  The rooms are still as crisp as they were when they opened  I was also really impressed by how much the area had changed  there are many great restaurants  bars and shopping choices available  Overall I loved my experience at andaz  the staff are wonderful and the hotel will always be my hotel of choice when travelling to London  
P =>   Unassuming Minimalist Chic Recently taken over by Hyatt   but kept majority of design elements from The Great Eastern it was  Perfect location for City and close proximity to West end by tube or on foot for avid walkers  Very quiet on weekends  Sunday esp but as for a New Yorker that s ok  Loved that the inclusive breakfast could be had in the huge  comfortable bed     many dining options and drinks  amazing welcome at check in   a drink on a leather lounge chair   ill take it  Fantastic bathrooms in the old fashion design  Free water and organic juices in fridge  very friendly staff  
P =>   Great Hotel in the City area of London I have stayed in this hotel on a number of occasions  both for business and pleasure  The general quality of the hotel is excellent  Each room has a very comfy king size bed  flat screen TV  complimentary soft drinks in the mini bar and free use of wireless and movies  Its location on Liverpool Street means that its regularly used in the week by business people  but it does serve as a great location for tourists as long as your prepared to use the under ground or walk a bit  Please bear in mind that at the weekend a lot of the area is closed as the sizable working population are not around Breakfast is included in the room price and offers quite a substantial choice of both hot and cold foods  The George Pub which is a traditional English pub offers a good selection of beers and bar food all at a reasonable price  The champagne bar is a nice place to sit and relax in luxurious surrounding although the last time I stayed at the weekend it was closed Check in and out is fairly relaxed  you sit on the comfy chairs and reception comes to you  In conclusion  it s a great place to stay if you like to explore a bit and don t mind using the public transport  Oxford Circus is   stops on the Central Line   If you want to be right in the Centre of London and walk to all the usual tourist destinations around Oxford Street  Leicester Square and Covent Garden then you may be better served looking at alternatives a little closer  
P =>  Funky weekend experience I stayed here in the weekend       y  The place is easy to find getting out Liverpool Street station on the correct side  out of tube on the left  up the elevators  where is the Macdonald  Just take left  the hotel is    mt far   No reception  basically  a bunch of guys welcomes the guests  doing the check  in straight away  Funky rooms  complimentary minibar  elegant bathroom  free internet on the  st floor and in the room s tv  max   hour here   charming and silent  I was on the  nd floor   The breakfast is served at the Miyako restaurant located just next the main entrance  menu  a la carte   therefore no buffet  I assumed I could order as much as I could  though  Pricey place  but as long as the breakfast is included    I had a couple of requests  and I was helped  I asked for a late check out and I obtained it in a minute  I was   hour late on that  and nobody complained  Highest rate for the Andaz  finally  also because of the weekend deal  I found reviewers quoting something like     gbp daily rates or just a little less  too much  but that s the weekday price for liverpool streets business travellers  I paid     taxes during the we  definetely a more than reasonable price If in London during the weekend  I ll be back here for sure  
P =>   Pricey Funky and less than we expected Stayed at the Andaz on business with a group  Hard to find the hotel from the street  and when we finally DID find it  the door was out of order  Made it to the lobby  then waited    waited    waited for someone to check me in  No apologies  no real help either  The room is modern and very small  very black  very chic  if you like that  I thought I did  but found more things difficult than enjoyable  The bathtub was hard to climb in and out of  and both the sink and shower drains didn t drain  It took me several tries to find the closet  and the in room fridge was barely cool  let alone cold  My room was cramped and not evenly shaped  which made matters worse  I liked the juices  the artwork  the atmosphere  Not enough signage to help you find your room in the hallways  and I m not a fan of the  quot smart card quot   but the hotel grew on me  I loved the glass of wine after work  wished for another  so I went to the bar  which is their intent   For    GBP a night  I find it expensive  regardless of breakfast and juices  We requested an early check in and received it  but were charged for the previous evening s stay   so be forewarned  There are several nice facilities adjacent or attached  we enjoyed one of the nearby restaurants quite a lot  I might go back at a lower rate  for a longer stay in a better room  The Andaz is an acquired  funky taste  Overall it wasn t terrible  but I would not suggest it to many people who expect a traditional hotel stay  For the artsy crowd or the nouveau riche  however  it might be just the right place to enjoy London  
P =>   Great service and contemporary interior We booked through the hotel website and got an offer including breakfast  mini bar  movies and internet  standard I think  for about      per night at a weekend This was well worth the money  lovely hotel  grand but contemporary lobby  well designed simple room with cool chairs  lamps and extras  Check in was a big free standing table to the side of the lobby and very informal and quick Located right next to Liverpool St station  good weekend location for Spitalfields ket  Brick Lane  Shoreditch and of course the City and surrounding attractions Definately will be back  the staff were so helpful and the free breakfast was a feast  
P =>   Andaz   Great start for a new Hyatt brand Have stayed at the Andaz on   separate occasions in y       Will be coming back for a third stay This is a new brand for the uniformly excellent Hyatt hotel group  It differs from the Park Hyatt and Grand Hyatt in that it attracts a younger  modern affluent group Hotel is very good to excellent  The hotel has the Eastway cafe for breakfast  I would def  avoid and have room service instead  They also have a decent pub called George attached  Gym is much better than average  however not on par with Hyatt offerings in Tokyo  The best thing about the concept is that laundry  excellent breakfast  minibar  movies and internet are complimentary  Yes  I did say laundry and excellent breakfast  The only minor downside and it is small  is that the flooring should be spic and span  The staff try hard but need a little more experience  this should come with time  Highly recommended  
P =>  Terrific Hotel with all the extras included    My wife and I stayed at the Hyatt ANDAZ in London for three nights in   while in town for the Chelsea Flower Show  It is located just outside the entrance of Liverpool Station  which makes getting around very quick and easy  There is no reception desk  When you arrive one of the staff greets you with a tablet computer and checks you in quickly and easily  We checked in early  about       am check in time is      pm  with no problem  and were also upgraded to a deluxe king room for no additional cost  Just a short aside here If you ve been to London lately you may have noticed that it is difficult to find English speaking staff in hotels  but that is NOT the case here all staff spoke perfect English  and many were clearly London natives a really nice situation  Our room was AMAZING  Sixteen foot ceilings  huge floor space  beautiful d cor  floor to ceiling windows  and a very large Plasma television  more on that later  The entire place public spaces as well as guestrooms  is ultra modern  This may be off putting to some  particularly when you consider that the hotel occupies a nineteenth century building  but we loved it  The large bathrooms are WONDERFUL  with huge soaking tubs and separate shower  The toilet is like the ones on airplanes  and can be a bit noisy unless you close the door  Everything was spotlessly clean and maintained daily to the highest possible standards  The bed linens and towels were of the best quality  and showed no wear or staining The room includes breakfast in the rate         American per person if you purchase it separately  and they will bring you anything that you want at any time  This policy includes ROOM SERVICE if you want it  One morning I had an English breakfast  but since I can t eat eggs  I ordered a double order of Scottish smoked salmon and an American style waffle instead  No one batted an eyelash  and everything was perfect  The meal also included FRESH SQUEEZED orange juice  The price of the room also includes unlimited laundry and dry cleaning  with same day service if you get your laundry in early in the day  The laundry is returned either hung up  or packed in wicker baskets lined in tissue  They even pressed my tee shirts  The minibar is also included  It contains bottled water  still and sparkling  and the most wonderful bottled organic fruit juices I have ever tasted  If you want more  just go down to the lobby pantry and help yourself to as much as you want The problems were minimal  We couldn t get the room cold enough for us  and the high tech lighting system was tough to figure out  Our main problem was the television  which turned itself on at      am each morning  We were told that this was an error  as      am was the time when the system was reset each day  I m sure that this issue has been resolved by now  but just in case  unplug the television before you go to sleep surely a minor inconvenience compared to the huge number of positives at this fine establishment I can t imagine returning to London without staying at the ANDAZ again  It was wonderful  Hyatt is opening ANDAZ branded facilities in New York  Beijing  and elsewhere  I will seek them out whenever possible  
P =>  Great New Hotel Concept I spent New Year s Eve in London and stayed at the Andaz hotel  We had a    layover in London and decided to make it part of our vacation  We ended up using our Hyatt points for the hotel  but rates were pretty reasonable          The hotel is near the financial disrict so it caers to business travelers  It is styled very similarly to the W hotel chain  For New Years the hotel did not seem to be very crowded and I m guessing the rates were lower that normal  The price includes EVERYTHING   laundry  dry cleaning  pressing  huge breakfast  bottles water and juice     for London this is an amazing deal  Our breakfast came to    pounds for   people  You can get anything off the menu  very extensive     we opted for room service and were not charged any extra fees  The hotel is literally right next door to Liverpool Station so getting around London is pretty easy  Staff is very nice and accomodating A few problems     The room was very hot and the inroom AC Heat controls didn t seem to work very well  We had an interior room     window looks out to an interior courtyard with in the hotel that in enclosed with a glass roof  I found this really odd  Had I been in London for longer that    hours I would not have accepted this room  the bathtub is REALLY high and difficult ot get in and out ofAll in all  it s a great hotel with a great concept  I would definitely return and look forward to this hotel line

P =>   We Survived        Don t book ever this hotel   We had to go there because the one we had booked was overbooked  Andrewshouse Hotel is the most ramshackled  shabby place I have ever seen in my life and I have travelled all over the world including Asia When we arrived an old man opened the door  totally unfriendly  uncooperative and indifferent  We had to ask him again and again about a manager s name which was given to us from the other hotel which booked us in there The room price was      which would be only worth like      I would say because this place is the most terrible hotel on this earth The hotel is totally delapidated  run down and I am really wondering how the City of London keeps such a rotten place running for international guests in this area wich is one of the poshest The lady   wife of the unfriendly old frustrated man  was actually a nice Brazilian woman  eldery lady  and very very nice  She cut the price by    because she found us so nice The ensuite room with WC is shown on their website and indeed on the website the bed and courtain was there but the picture was taken a century ago  The room was totally yuck   tapestry coming from the ceilings  ashes on the little lamp next to the bed from the previous guest who left the ashes from his cigarette just there  A cubicle in the middle of the room which was a shower unit  The white inside curtains were almost brown  never washed and the brocate curtaines were kept together by a piece of green package band  I couldn t close an eye because it was absolutely ice cold the room  Under the cover blanket was a woolen blanket from like    years ago with a whole from burning   The breakfast was totally miserable  just a totally cheap jam of I don t know nature  just sweet    hyperthin slices for us   of the cheapest white toast bread  NESCAFE  corn flakes and an egg which looked like moulded  was green  or then   hours boiled This place should be immediately closed and I will contact the authorities  It is a hell of a place  Don t ever go  book into Ibis or so    
P =>   Hell on EARTH HELL on EARTH  I have booked it online payed prepayment  photos on the i net looked good  The place is horrible  horrendos most important thing is the teatment  The MANAGER sort of old man Indian    was smoking in the lounge despite all restrictive signs  quot NO SMOKING quot     Carpet on the steps was kept together by duct tape     Rooms stinking I am sure service is as worse as the look of this hotel  i didn t stay let the prepayment money go and found a decent place just   meters up the street It is really shame that nobody in London municipality is not taking any actions  It isTHE SHAME  BLACK SPOT in the centre of LONDON

P =>  stay away what a dump   dont be enticed by cheap price and location  its a dump  
P => Well worth the money The hotel is just okay but for the price it is well worth it  It is clean and cosy and offers a simple breakfast every morning  very similar to a bed and breakfast in every way but the cost  My only warning is to bring earplugs because the tube station is right across the street and is not quiet  The beds are very comfortable though  Overall  well worth it  
P =>  ent enough   positive experience I have booked a double ensuite in jan      at this hotel through their website  The other   or   hotels b amp b in the same street  hugh str  are owned by the same management and basically are all the same so I got a view of what to expect by reading the other reviews  which were terrible I was tight on budged and I knew that I had to stay there just   nights  most of which to be spent outside  hanging out London til late night Another thing we totally need was LOCATION  And the hotel has it  Close to victoria station and the coach station which we needed at   am I made a phone call directly to them months before and they told me it was fully booked  they suggested me to try anyway with their website booking  Not only the booking system at their website allowed me to book anyway but for that period there was also a special discount for my type of room  which usually costs around        but I had for around     all GBP     I previously made a deep research  nothing in that area costs that amount  most of the places I contacted who had the same prices were with shared bathroom We have been given a room with bathroom inside  everything was decently cleaned  no bedbugs  no other animals  no hairs or traces of previous people  no dirt in the bathroom The room is very small  there is a double bed and you can barely walk inside  If you have small luggage you are lucky  travellers and luggage can stay altogether in the room  There is no drawer or other place to store things  There is TV and cups and necessary to have tea  We didn t use any of those things anyway The area is not noisy  the street is pretty silent and you cannot hear the trains at victoria station  It doesn t seem even a bad neighbourhood  since we got back from shows at midnight   am and we found basically NOBODY around The bathroom is proportioned with the room  small  imagine an elevator for max   people capacity  put a WC and small basin inside  that s the bathroom  The shower is provided from above  because the whole bathroom with water on becomes a shower  a bit odd for italian taste but we weren t in London to write an essay on brit showers  Me and my friend both used it and found no problem I remember there wasn t freezing cold  anyway  the windows although old  didn t have any hole and we didn t suffer any inconvenience through the night  Breakfast the morning after was typical from UK B amp B  cereals  milk  tea  coffee  bread whatever and it was included in that price I was in doubt to give this place a   or   star  I decided for   for   reasons  one is the price value which was good  remember I paid    per night  and the second because when we checked out at noon and had to leave luggage there to be picked up at   am later on  they let us with no charge  Both hostels I was in previously I visited London charged me an incredible amout of pounds just to leave luggage in a common room  Those guys kept our    suitcases there for     hours at no charge  They have no curfew  which is good also if you spend the night at pubs shows out The staff was overall friendly and not rude  I did see also many  quot clearners quot  during mornings going up and down the stairs who seemed to work a lot Keep in mind that I don t advice this to families with children  old people  there s no elevator and the building is a very old victorian one  with very difficult stairs   and if you think you need extra room for your clothes  or a desk to write read  I am sure they have bigger rooms on request and more expensive If you are   at this point a hostel will cost you as much  if you consider the extras  linen  breakfast  luggage deposit  lockers   If you are upgrading from hostels to b amp b hotels you can try I can understand the needs of the budged traveler more than the high class tourist at the hilton so I hope I wrote a clear and honest picture about this place  If I had to go again with a friend with my same needs and taste I would take into consideration getting back here

P =>   fantastic weekend   thankyou Antoinette hotel I organised a break in London for my husband s birthday and took our baby away with us for the first time  Needless to say we were a bit nervous  I have to thank the Antoinette for all their help   They helped us find restaurants   sorted our transport and gave us lots of baby related help  They were extremely accomdating with a young child and made the whole experience very easy  The location of the hotel is spot on for restaurants   theatre   Wimbledon shopping and lovely common and it is really easy to get into london  We got to do london in a   star hotel without the central London price tag  We had a lovely room   really spacious and had a nice en suite  It was also very handy as the hotel has a really stylish restaurant next door where we went for my husbands birthday   the staff made a real fuss of him and the food was great  It was very reasonably priced but we got a discount as hotel guests and it was great not having to go very far  esp with a little one  to find a good restaurant  We had a really fantastic weekend away and my husband loved his birthday so a big thankyou to the staff as we were quite demanding guests  
P =>   Great location good value for money would recommend It is very rare that you find a hotel in a great location to travel to London at reasonable prices  We found the hotel by chance and managed to book late on the Thursday for that weekend and it was at a reasonable price The room was spacious  I think they call it a superior double complete with balcony and it had plenty of room for the two of us  The reviews written are correct in that it is clean  modern and newly refurbished  The staff were friendly and welcoming and if I was looking for fault it would be the size of the lift  ok for one person and luggage  We didn t try the adjoining restaurant as we got back to the hotel late but the menu looks good and is also reasonably priced We would definately stay here again and would recommend as good value for money for the location  
P =>   Lovely relaxed modern hotel My partner and I visited the Antoinette Wimbledon for   nights during y  Staff were extremely friendly and helpful especially when recommending local amenities such as taxi s and restaurants  The Antoinette has a restaurant which offers     of the bill for hotel guests  perfect for our late arrival and the food was lovely Rooms were clean  comfortable and airy and the d cor new and modern  Our only criticism we had was that we found breakfast was fairly busy  probably because of Wimbledon Tennis and the hotel was full  and there were times when the lift was a bit tight  Otherwise we would highly recommend this hotel and will not think twice of booking in the future  
P =>   Renovated into Sterility Stayed at Antoinette because usual hotel in Wimbledon was full  The place is fine  the room was extra large  I had a Double Superior  and featured a large balcony with a limited view  BUT  there was NO character whatsoever  no charm  no warmth  to the newly renovated room  While the carpet  bed  and furniture were brand new and very clean  there was only   picture on the wall and there were no lamps  only dimly lit overhead lights  I would say it was Swedish sparse  but that would insult Swedish design  The bathroom again was newly redone  but the shower sprayed all over the floor even with the plastic half wall in place  using up the skimpy  cheap towels to clean it up  The room is poorly laid out  with the TV perched high on the wall and far from the bed  There are few hangers  and only shirt hangers at that  and no drawers  plus no place to put my suitcase  so I ended up laying my suitcase on the sofa and my clothes spread about everywhere  including my suits  It was not a dreadful place  I ve been in much worse  but they would do well to add some better lights and nicer towels   and maybe another picture on the cavernous  barren walls  
P =>   Great Value and Location My husband and I stayed here on a Saturday night and we paid     for the room  In London we consider this to be an absolute bargain Our room was large and very comfortable with a balcony and flat screen television which had a large number of channels  The room and bathroom were very clean and the shower was very good with good pressure and hot water  The central heating meant the room was lovely and warm The staff were friendly and efficient and organised a taxi for us  The free parking is also a great bonus in London  The hotel is a five minute walk from a shopping area and there are a large number of bars and restaurants very close by  We considered       too expensive for the hotel breakfast  however there were plenty of great local options nearby Overall  we had a comfortable room and the free parking and location made this great value  We would happily stay there again  
P =>  Smart clean modern  A modern well priced welcoming hotel in Wimbledon  A lift rises from the ground floor but disabled guests might have trouble with the changes in level of the passageways from which the rooms open  The rooms themselves are reasonably sized and very clean and have a modern bathroom  Satellite TV and free WiFi is available  although at the time of my stay the WiFi  bizarrely  only worked for Vista users  The room was quiet and the bed comfortable  Breakfast was also good with a choice of cooked or continental  I will certainly use this hotel again  
P =>   Avoid This hotel has gone through a massive renovation  Lots of money spent and it has improved  The new decor in the reception is cheap and tacky although the rooms are much better  But the room cost      plus       for breakfast  However  the rooms only had six coat hangers There was a problem as the showers would only run on boiling hot and while the management kindly sent up a bowl of fruit to apologise  it was delivered next door   and I never actually saw it There is no longer a gym at the hotel and while you can use Wimbledon s YMCA  it took me    mins to register When the hotel was the Wayfairer the staff were experienced and kknowledgeable   now virtually they all struggle with their English and are unable to help with details of the area I saw a couple of other occasions when they could not help their guests with simple demands If you are working in Wimbledon and need a stop over then fine  but anything more than that  I would avoid at all costs  
P =>  Great Location  I recently stayed at the hotel for   night  a great location especially as I was travelling into London  Wimbledon train station is only    minutes walk  past all the tempting shops in the Broadway The staff on reception were very presentable and polite and the reception area was pleasant with lots of seating which was great as my friend was meeting me and we could stop for a coffee I got chatting to the receptionist as you do and she explained that the hotel was undergoing some refurbishment so I was prepared for some disturbance but as I was out during the day this did not bother me at all My room was quite old fashioned but no problems  I would definitely stay again  especially as the rooms will probably be all refurbished soon Breakfast is not included in the price of the hotel stay but this is the norm at most hotels these days  A great stay and great value for a hotel near London  
P =>  Fantastic Hotel and Location I stayed at the Antoinette on a two day business trip  and was warmly greeted by the staff   who explained that the hotel was going through a complete re fit  The reception was well laid out  and the staff were welcoming  the food was excellent     All in all no problems    No worries    its in a great location so will definitely stay there again  James from Bath  
P =>   Flatters to eive  We just stayed there this weekend to see friends who lived nearby  On arrival  the hotel looks clean and modern with plenty of pleasant staff on reception  We were alllocated a room and given directions via the lift  FYI the lift can only just fit two people in with very little luggage  not good if you re claustrophobic  As we progressed along the corriders the hotel began to show its true colours  It is tired  dated and unclean  And that s just the corridors  Unfortunately  it didn t get any better when we reached our room  The bed is very hard  the carpet dirty  the windows and doors do not fit their casings  The shower  no bath  had mould inside the cubicle and the towels were less than white  Fortunately  we didn t spend long in the room  We paid     for the room and this did not include breakfast which was       each extra  We didn t bother as you can get an EXCELLENT breakfast at Reds cafe  about    yds down the road  for less than     Also  the parking is limited at the hotel so I would recommend getting there early to secure your space  
P =>   Avoid this place hopefully the renovation will improve it  To confirm what the previous reviewer said  Hotel Antionette used to be the Wayfairer hotel and is currently in the process of renovation  Upon walking into the lobby you are confronted with a construction site with people moving furniture and making repairs  I arrived at  am after an international flight and train tube ride down to South Wimbledon  I was told that check in was at  pm  I asked if they could check to see if something was avaiable which the receptionist wasn t eager to do  Thanks however to the other employee there at the time who volunteered to look for me and found me a room  Well the room I got was much less than what the previous reviewer enjoyed  I had a tiny single bedroom  with decor right out of the    s  The bed felt equally as old and my feet hung over the end  The bathroom was carpeted and smelt of mold  There was no remote for the small tv  I also found that no internet access was available  I paid    pounds for the room and breakfast  delivered to the room  was   pounds     Upon leaving the next day  I saw that they already replaced the furniture that I was sitting on the day before with mdern looking chairs and couches  however I wonder if they intend to replace the old and worn green carpetting  The only positive about this hotel is that it s pretty close to the tube station  wimbledon south  and there looks to be a few interesting restaurants nearby  I imgaine this hotel will improve following it s renovation but I don t think I d ever want to return  shame that there really isn t much other option in that area or near St George s hospital in Tooting  
P =>   Not recommended The Antoinette Wimbledon has just been taken over by Antoinette hotels and used to be called the Wayfairer  I stayed there for two nights in tember because I wanted to be near St Georges Hospital in Tooting and the only room available anywhere in the area at short notice was the suite at The Antoinette  The cost was      per night   approximately the same as a similar sized suite at the Ritz Carlton in Sarasota  Unlike the Ritz Carlton  full payment for the room has to be made on registration First the postive things  The hotel has a small indoor pool and its own free car park  The suite was a good size   around     sq ft at a guess   and had a very solid feeling floor  The bed was large and comfortable  There were coffee making facilities in the room and two televisions  one of them in the bathroom   and there was a small fridge  but no mini bar   The toilet was a separate room off the bathroom  there were plenty of towels  There was a wall mounted air con unit   although I didn t test whether it worked  The hotel was relatively quiet and looks pleasant from the outside Now the negatives  The suite has a full width window at one end  Unfortunately  literally two feet in front of it is a high brick wall so there is no view and little natural light  consequently the room has a dingy feel which isn t helped by the low power light bulbs  At the other end of the suite the bathroom and toilet have windows overlooking Wimbledon Broadway The decor and furniture were old fashioned and very tired with lots of scuff marks  The bath was a shell shaped  two person jacuzzi bath with peeling trim and overhead shower nozzle  A notice taped to the bathroom door warned me the jacuzzi didn t work  The shaver socket didn t work either  On my second morning there was no hot water in the shower The tick of the wall clock and the noise of the fridge running disturbed my sleep the first night  but the second night I was too tired to notice them  A bigger problem was the sound of the lift which is located right next door  the lift shaft actually occupies one walled off corner of the room  and which woke me up early both mornings and kept me awake late There were two small holes in the ceiling which looked as if they d been made when someone stuck a screwdriver into the plaster to test its solidity The hotel is in the process of a much needed renovation so is something of a building site   and looks as if it will be that way for a considerable time  Nobody warned me about this when I booked by phone and there was nothing about it on the hotel web site   In fairness  I would have stayed there regardless because there was nowhere else available   Owing to the renovation  the restaurant was closed so the only breakfast on offer was through room service  I didn t take up the offer but it was a reasonably priced       for as many items as you wanted from a short menu I managed to get into the small car park both nights  but on my first morning I found myself blocked in by someone attending a mother and toddler session in the hotel pool  I had to wait twenty minutes for her to reluctantly get dressed and move her car  The next morning I had no problem getting out Although the hotel advertises its well equipped gym  when I went to investigate  I found half a dozen bits of basic equipment in an attic style room with a ceiling so low I decided not to risk the solitary jogging machine for fear of banging my head  I m      quot    When I went to look at the pool  there was a sign saying  quot Out of order quot  The sun deck was sunny with wooden benches and chairs but had an abandoned air about it  I had it all to myself  
P => 
P =>   Location  Location  Location  Too bad it s a dump  You get what you pay for   it s cheap  And it shows in the upkeep  Hotel Pro s  Location   you re a   minute walk from Bayswater and Queensway Tube stations  making it easy to get anywhere in the city  and from beautiful Hyde Park  great for people watching and relaxing   Hotel Con s  Size   I don t care if my room is small  I m only there to sleep  The bathroom is a different matter  The entire thing is tile  floor  walls  with a shower curtain down the middle and the floor sort of slopes towards a drain  After your shower you ll be standing in a puddle while you brush your teeth at the sink  Everything is damp including the TP roll  Cleanliness   I am not a clean freak  However there are certain standards that ought to be met in hotels  The Annur had stains on the carpet  stains on the bedding  I don t want to know   we slept on top of the covers it was that gross   water stains on the ceiling  lack of fresh towels  considering the bathroom   you need more towels because everything is damp after a shower   window wouldn t budge so it stayed open the whole time  Continental Breakfast     types of breads  with toaster     kinds of cereal  milk  coffee  jam  No fruit  vegetables  meat  or eggs  If you don t love toast and cereal   opt out of paying extra for this breakfast and go get some real food elsewhere  Would I stay there again  No  Would I recommend it to my mother  Most definitely NO  Would I recommend it to others  Only if they were incredibly broke  fifthly  and generally not people I d want to stay in touch with  
P =>   You get what you paid for HiI ve just come back from this hotel  I know most of the reviews are very negative  However  I would challenge anyone else who can get a triple room for     a night in the Bayswater area At the end of the day  the maxim  quot You get what you pay for quot  really applies here  Our room was fine  Had clean linen and towels  we even had a colour tv  Having hot running water  albeit the noisy pipes  was good We only needed a place to lay our heads down at night  after a long days sight seeing The staff were very helpful and allowed us to chose from a number of rooms so we ended up picking the nicest one  Some of the rooms were pretty awful This place is going to be closing down at the end of ember  It is a building owned by the Sultan of Brunei   who will be converting it into    luxury flats The key with this hotel is to negotiate the price right down with the receptionist  He  Stancho or Malik  will be very willing to give you a room for a knock down price   however  time is running out for this hotel  
P =>   Ignore other reviews                  I booked this hotel  for a   night stay then read the reviews  Big Mistake  Most of these reviews are not accurate  Ok the hotel is not a   star hotel but we paid for a budget one and thats what we got  We paid around     per night for a double room bed and breakfast  I have paid alot more in   star hotels and they have been of poorer standard than this hotel The staff are very friendly and helpful  On arriving at An Nur we were offered a room but was told it was a little small  if we didn t like it we could choose another one  If nothing had been said we would have been happy to take this room  but when a choice was offered we took it  After looking at   rooms we picked one on the fifth floor  The lift was not working  but we are fit and healthy so climbing five flights of stairs was no problem The breakfast consists of cornflakes or rice krispies  toast and breadcakes  Tea and coffee are available all day   The shower in the room worked well with hot water all the time  Towels were changed every day  The carpets in the rooms are stained but are vacuumed daily An Nur hotel is in a prime location close to   tube stops  Kensington Palace and Hyde Park are only a short walk away  The area close by has a good selection of places to get good food The next time I go to London I will stop at An Nur again  You pay for a budget hotel and that is what this hotel is  
P =>   A Disgusting Experience We stayed at the An nur on the Saturday   th y to see the West End show Lord of the Rings which was the last night of the Musical Show Ok I know this hotel is a cheap hotel but I would have expected more from it for the price I have never been so disgusted at a dirty hovel of a Hotel  and I shall be finding out who I can contact in London regarding ths flea pit  The room it self was filthy  carpets were a disgrace where some one had vomited on the floor in the past and it had not been cleaned off the carpet properly and left to dry  We were allocated a room on the sixth floor which was right up the top of the hotel  and as the lift was not working we had to climb all the stairs to the top which was hard going  good thing we only had small bags and not suit cases to haul up the flight of stairs The rooms did not have smoke alarms fitted to the ceilings which is against the Fire Regualations and there were no Fire Alarms in the corridors in case of a fire  Also when we were climbing to our room  the stairwell on the fourth floor was blocked by rubbish etc against the wall  again a hazard in case of evacuation of the the Hotel The room itself was so drab with paint on the walls discoloured and cracked  The shower was something out of a third class rated dump And as for the Breakfast in the morning that was a joke  a so called Continental breakfast  it was disgusting  rolls  toast  cereal  and tea and coffee  no meats or cheese  which should be included in a Continental style breakfast  and just orange juice The jam and marmalade were in large bowls and you had to help yourself with a spoon in each  which was unhygienic for a start  as this contravened Food Hygiene regulations I would not stay in this Hotel ever again and would advise other people to do the same  I know it is cheap and that you get what you pay for but not at the cost of my Health and Safety But I will find out who I can contact to report the broken Fire Regulations of this Hotel  
P =>   Stay Away From This Dump   UGH  The rooms in this hotel have paper thin walls  the room is the size of a childs bedroom and the bathroom was a kindve wetroom with lukewarm piddle water for a shower  I know that this sounds extreme to have stayed in for   nights  but the rate was low and we did not want to trapse about the area looking for a better accomodation  although there are several in the area  Do yourself a favour and trust all the other reviews on this site  IT SUCKS  
P =>  tiny   This is definitely not the worst accommodation we ve stayed in  but I m sure it s the smallest  The room was a small single room with two beds squeezed into it  The bathroom was also tiny  with the shower being basically a nozzle in the wall over the toilet  so you got the whole room wet when you showered  There was no water pressure and the water temperature never crept above tepid  The room and bathroom were quite clean but everything had a very worn and old appearance  e g  the bedspreads both had tears in them  The carpet in the hallways appeared to be covered with old drops of white paint or plaster The lift is tiny  slow and very old Finally  the breakfast is pretty basic  Toast and cereal  tea  bad coffee and very cheap  i e  fake  juice are all that s on offer On the plus side  the staff are quite nice  the location is very good and since we booked through a discount website  the price was OK too Don t stay in this place is you want to do more than sleeping there  It is not romantic at all and there is also no room to work or study  This is absolute bare basics budget accommodation for the easy going traveller  
P =>   An Nur   No Way We have just returned from a weekend in London  I can honestly say that i have never had a more terrible expereince For the duration of the stay we had no heat  and no hot water  and the hotel staff did not inform us that this was to be an ongoing problem in sufficent time for us to rrelocate The rooms were tiny  poorly furnished and in dire need of redecorating  The bathroom looked as if it had never seen a cleaning product  There was a light over one of the beds held together with masking tape Location wise it was spot on  Everything else     dont bother Avoid it like the plague  
P =>  Baffled by positive reviews of the An Nur I am not picky about budget hotels  I stayed in a comparably poor hostel in London two weeks prior for much less money  You will be deceived by the cleanliness and facade of the lobby as they are the cleanest aspects of this hotel   My wife and I stayed at the An Nur hotel y    through y     the last   nights of a two week trip to England and I felt suckered for booking this DUMP after reading the dishonest reviews on another website  We paid      a night  which I realize is nothing for London in y  If I hadn t already paid  I d never have stayed here  Pay more and sleep well  The staff are nice  but the hotel is a dump  I wish I could have seen the rooms people who have written positive reviews on this website are referring to  because I don t understand how anyone can say anything positive about the facilities themselves  The hotel is disgusting  Stains everywhere but the lobby  It s the kind of place that makes you feel dirty the moment the elevator doors open onto your floor  We stayed in a room on the first floor  It was DISGUSTING  The sheets  towels  and bathroom counter were the only things clean about the hotel  You won t want to sit on the bed or walk without shoes on the floor  There is a telephone in the room  BUT it doesn t work  Not Safe   There is a drain in the middle of the bathroom floor because the whole bathroom serves as the shower  You can LITERALLY sit on the toilet and take a shower at the same time  The shower sprays all over the toilet and would fill it up if you left the lid up while showering  The shower  quot curtain quot  is so close to the shower head you have to practically wrap yourself in it like a cape if you want to prevent it from soaking the disgusting  worn  moldy  bathroom floor   which incidently floods when you take a shower   If I haven t persuaded you NOT to stay here  then I don t think anything will  Bring flip flops for the shower  Better yet     Just stay in a hostel and save yourself some money  This is one sad hotel   Never ate the breakfast after reading the reviews  but sure heard everyone else eating in the atrium below our window at      am   Believe the reports about loud garbage collection at the An Nur Hotel  The Thisleton Kennsington Gardens Hotel around the corner  probably a  quot real quot  hotel  has a dumpster just outside the windows on the back of the An Nur Hotel that its staff throw bags of empty wine bottles into at late and early hours      am and      am during our stay  Garbage was collected and woke us up at       Hotels comparable to this one line the street   Queensburough Terrace  look at them before you stay here  Pay more if you have to  but please DON T STAY HERE  Please  I feel bad for the staff because they work in such a dodgy establishment      Josh  California 
P =>   Don t get to know Anna Our travel agent booked this hotel for us in London  Although the location is convenient to two tube stops there is little else good to say  Read the other reviews  we would concur  The rooms were hot  extremely small  carpets and walls were dirty  non working phones  small television with about three channels  We had two rooms for my wife and three older children  The only salvation was that we were gone most of the day  I travel a lot for business and this is by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed in  
P => YUCK My husband and i arrived here after    hours of travel  on our honeymoon  we weren t expecting too much  we aren t high maintenance at all  but this place is awful  I don t like to say negative things  but i have to say  don t stay here if you have ANY desire to enjoy ANYTHING about where you stay   as well be a hostel  The rooms are tiny  which is OK if you don t mind stubbing your toes everytime you try to move at all  The phones don t work at all    and they won t let you use their phone  They lock the doors at night and there is a sign that says ring bell to enter when door is locked   NO BELL    they sleep on the couch and hopefully hear you when you get back  It just wasn t a nice experience   and as for the breakfast  great if you like stale bread and rice crispies  because that is ALL you have to choose from  Not to mention it is an OVEN in the hot little box of a room  and the window must remain WIDE open for any hopes of breathing  which  in turn  leaves for a restless night of sleep  constant LOUD garbage collection   just NOT anywhere near ideal  I suppose we are mostly upset with the fact that they advertise as newly remodeled with phone internet  etc    they have NEVER remodeled  when i asked if certain rooms were remodeled  he laughed and said  quot no  no remodel  all rooms same quot    don t go here unless you were planning on a hostel and they were all booked    worth spending a few extra dollars to go anywhere else    our humble opinion     the newlyweds    
P =>  Cold Showers poor service Ok so we didn t expect much from a cheap hotel  whilst the location is good there is nothing else good about this hotel  We were charged for parking     for    hours and then sent down the road to a mate of the concierge to park  when we could have parked on the road for free but did nt realise untll we left  We had no hot water for our entire stay  So we had to endure stone cold showers in a bathroom where you have to nearly stand on the toilet while you are in the shower there is so little room  We complained about the cold showers to reception  it seemed like they new very well that this was the case and could do nothing to help us  apart from say that if we booked to stay again they would give us a discount   I don t think so  The rooms are terrible  the decor is falling off  the road noise is bad  the lift feels like it needs replacing before it falls off  The staff  whilst most are tryiing quite hard  struggle to converse in English I would not stay here again  it is cheap  but there are cheaper that are better value 
P =>  I sure WOULD stay at the AN NUR hotel again We stayed in this hotel from t    thru     The staff is very cordial and the rooms very clean  The Continental breakfast is good and more than adequate  There are many ethenic restaurants nearby and also several tube stations within several blocks  Kensington Palace is a short walk and there is a shopping center several blocks away  It is a convenient location  The rooms are small  but if you plan on sightseeing most of the day  they are fine  The bathroom has a unique arrangement of the facilities  It takes some adjusting to  Steve and Linda YoungFloridasty   hotmail com 
P =>  Best value hotel for basics If you don t expect much for the price you pay then you won t be disappointed  The rooms decor is falling apart but the rooms are extremely clean  Breakfast is all you can expect for this price  The staff with the exception of the breakfast staff  who don t smile  are the best i ve experienced   all are very happy and helpful  This hotel does not try to rip you off like so many others  Great location  I make this my regular hotel when i come to London  RobNZ 
P => Noooo  Booked the An Nur by virtue of its price  and the favourable reviews on this website  Whilst this isn t the worst of budget hotels in London  I m certain you can do better  even at this price  The first room that I was allocated had a curtain rail which immediately fell down on my head upon closing the curtains  The second room was a little better  ie  nothing fell off the walls  but both rooms  and bathrooms  were tiny  terribly  tired  and shabby   the whole place is in dire need of a thorough refurbishment  On the plus side  the bed linen and bathrooms were very clean  despite their condition  and the location is very handy   just a couple of minutes  walk from Queensway Tube  
P =>  A work out I stayed at the An Nur hotel              and well  it was interesting  Me and my friend stayed in a twin room  and it was the smallest twin room I have ever encountered  This was small even for London budget hotel  But not so small it wasn t manageable  The bathroom was even smaller  You could sit on the toilet while showering and brushing your teeth  When you showered the water got everywhere  and there was no way of drying it  Mind you  you do get your money s worth at the An Nur  It is very cheap  We paid     each for   nights  Our view was of a parking lot and an alley  so not the best  but cudos for the possibility of sitting on the ledge of the window  TV with   channels with all good reception was nice  Breakfast is cereals  white bread with jam or cheese  croissants and rolls  milk  apple  and orange juice  Staff was very friendly    for snack machines in the lobby    for elevator out of service  We lived on the  th floor  and carrying a    kg suitcase   flights of stairs is a hassle  So is carrying a whole bunch of shopping bags while wearing high heels  But also a good thing seeing that we could have a piece of cake for lunch and work it off walking back up to our room later     
P =>  Great hotel if you forget the bathroom The staff was great and humorous  excluding the rude Russian    breakfast staff  Location is also excellent as there are two subway stations nearby  offering access to three metrolines  Breakfast was better than I expected as it wasn t just jam and toast style continental breakfast  however no sign of meat and fruits    Beds were nice to sleep and TV had some watchable channels  But then the bathroom   I guess the Brittish bathroom designers must still be living at some dark centuries in the past  Otherwise it cannot be explained  why the bathrooms are so tiny that there is no room to take shower and if one manages to do that  then the bathroom floor will be wet for the rest of your stay as not all of the water will go in the drain and there is nothing to dry it  
P => Small rooms On arriving the staff were very friendly and this was evident all through our stay  We had a lovely continental breakfast with hot coffee  croissaints and bread rolls with cheese in the lovely light and airy conservatory  Everything was really clean On the downside  We were really looking forward to our stay in London and the An Nur seemed to fit the bill  What a disappointment  The room we were given was very small  about  ft wide then narrowing to  ft at the door way to accomodate the ensuite   The cupboard to store clothes had no door and was about   feet wide  The mirror was missing from the wall in the bed area leaving   screws  We had a chair at the side of the bed that had to be moved about to get into the cupboard and then into the bathroom and again to get out of the room I had to climb over my partner every night to get into the double bed and one of the bedside lights was out of order  At the foot of the bed was a telephone and a tv on the wide window sill  The window was large making the room light despite the net curtain and we were above the breakfast room The shower and toilet area was also very small  I am only short but found it uncomfortable to shower in such a small area  I kept knocking into the toilet or the tiled walls and the feel of a cold shower curtain is never pleasant Despite our niggles   On the positive side    Yes it is opposite Kensington Gardens where you can either stroll along to the Diana Memorial Fountain or walk the other way and see Peter Pan  It has the Big Bus Co  City tour that stops at the road end  It is on the tube line and it has a cafe culture feel just off the highstreet with the local Bayswater shops and cafes  Walk further along the road and you are in Notting Hill  Well situated for exploring All in all if you are not bothered how big your room is and its not going to affect your stay  then the An Nur is the hotel to suit you  
P => Great Staff A Nice budget hotel that manages to combine great location  near to Bayswater and Paddington  with good facilities  wonderful staff and a reasonable price  Something that very few hotels in the area can manage to do Facilities are adequate with rooms coming equipped with a walk in shower and TV that manages to get watchable satellite channels  such as Sky    as opposed to the usual Eurosport that is the norm at this price The real acid test is  would I be willing to stay there again  and to that the answer would definately be yes

P => Great hotel quiet location ideal for weekend away  We stayed at the Apex for a weekend in ember based on the reviews from this site  We were not disappointed  We stayed in a King Deluxe room on the first floor and the room was HUGE  The bathroom had a large bath and a walk in shower My only gripe was that the pillows were terrible  The standard ones are feather so I would suggest ordering extra or foam ones for a more comfortable night The room was VERY quiet for London as we could only hear the wind in the trees of the small square opposite our window  It is within   minutes walk of Tower Hill tube station  which will take you to Embankment which is only a   minute walk from Leicester Square etc  Ideal for Tower of London as it is just across the road  We didn t have any food in the hotel as there was a pub just around the block that did full English breakfasts for       which was OK for us  There is also a pizza place  noodle bar and various other eateries within a   minute walk  I would also suggest walking over Tower Bridge and walking towards London Bridger on the South Bank as there were a multitude of places there All in all a fab weekend at a fab price  
P =>   Excellent hotel very pleasant stay   We stayed overnight at the Apex City of London  this weekend  it was very  very nice  The rooms were very clean and welcoming with everything you would need for an overnight stay or longer  The hotel is very modern and spacious and is set in a quiet sidestreet in easy walking distance of the tubestation  The staff were most helpful nothing was too much trouble  Lovely breakfast with lots of choice  We will definatly be staying again  
P =>  Absolutely brilliant place to stay for business or pleasure  First of all  Apex City London lives up to the outstanding reviews on Trip Advisor  We arrived after a    hour flight from Australia at  am in the morning  it is literally   minutes from the Tower Hill tube  The staff made us welcome until our room was available  The beds are fantastic  as is the free WiiFi  The toiletries are great and the staff can t do enough to make your stay pleasurable  We used it as a base to explore all of London and we found Tower Hill a quieter part of town  The gym is excellent  and better than most Hotel gyms There is a Pret a manger nearby and it was great for a quick bite or lunch on the go Rooms were spotless  and we liked it so much we upgraded to a deluxe room for the last   days  It is worth the upgrade  I would stay at Apex City London on any return to London  Don t look anywhere else this place is it for tourists and business in London  
P =>   Excellent choice for the City  Stayed for   nights in        It is a great location for the Tower of London  Tower Bridge  and doing business in the City  Lloyds office and Leadenhall ket a   minute walk and plenty of food choices nearby   The staff was helpful but definitely opt for the buffet breakfast as the in person service was painfully slow  by any standard   Most taxi drivers seem to know where it is and finding a cab is VERY easy   if they re not out front there s one a block away in any direction  Good Tube options with Tower Hill a block away  Monument  and Bank all very close   The only thing to be aware of is that the location is solidly in the City  If you re going to be running around all over London  beware  Either plan on taking the tube and making a transfer  or spending a lot of time in cabs  With zero traffic it took       minutes to get there from Paddington  and in thick midday traffic a full HOUR to get back TO Paddington   ent bar but not a thriving bar scene after hours  Overall relaxing  I paid up for the Superior King room and was amazed by the size of the room as well as the bathroom  However beware   shower head is tiny and low pressure  
P =>   Great London hotel in a quiet location near the Tower of London Stayed Saturday night to attend a birthday party in London and although the party was over near Hyde Park we were really pleased we chose the Apex  It is smart  very modern and the service efficient  Highly recommended  
P =>   A good base to see London We were given a room upgrade during our   nights stay here in tember  The room was spacious and well appointed as was the bathroom  The bed was big and comfortable  and the room was quiet at night  Didn t spend too much time in the hotel  but it was located near a very good pub for meals and a short walk from shops  tube station and The Tower of London  We booked this hotel based on what Trip Advisor had to say about it  and were not disappointed  
P =>   great location Well located  well priced modern hotel  Very nice waiter served breakfast and professional service from all staff  
P =>   The nicest hotel I have ever stayed in This hotel is in a fantastic position  close to the Tower of London and very close to several tube stations  The Reception staff were most helpful with maps and directions and various suggestions to make the most of our stay in this lovely hotel The rooms are outstanding with several little touches that really improved our comfort  the bed and bedding were amazingly comfortable  and the breakfasts were truly out of this world  I have never stayed in such a friendly and luxurious hotel  
P =>   Fantastic Value We recently had a weekend break in London  using the Apex as our base What a good choice we made  We has a standard room and it was more than adequate  Comfortable  clean  convenient and very friendly staff  After long days sightseeing the local Wetherspoons is very convenient half way betenn the Tube and Hotel  for a nightcap Can t wait to go again Keith  amp  Debbie  Manchester  
P =>   nice place   great location Only a few mins walk from tower hill station on the victoria tube line    mins walk from the DLR stop  Nice modern hotel  pret a manger   mins away if breakfast isn t included in your rate  Stayed on the  th floor  Room was a little small   standard for London  but was spotless clean  large bathroom with walk in shower  Staff were very helpful and allowed us to check in early on the day of arrival  Breakfast was fine   standard buffet selection  Bar was quite pricey   though there are a few bars within a few mins walk  
P =>  Convenient to the Tube and Tower of London My daughter and I stayed at the Apex Hotel for a couple of days after traveling around during her spring break from college  The staff at the Apex Hotel was friendly and efficient  The room was upscale and comfortable  We enjoyed having the chance to watch a DVD from the hotel s collection  The Tube stop was just a few blocks away  but be sure to get directions so that you don t wander around like we did  While we were there  we visited the Tower of London  which is huge   you could spend an entire day there  We brought home the little yellow rubber duck that was in our hotel bathroom for a souvenir of our time as Apex Hotel patrons  
P =>  Good Name  good Service  excellent stay had to book the hotel at the last minute  had trouble with booking online   reservation desk was closed but left name and my number  when i called to book the next day  internet rate was honoured  furthermore when i decided to extend the day by   more  i was offered the same rate buy the hotel staffhotel is very close to tube station  lt   mins walk and next to famous tower of london  and getting anywhere into london is made so easy by the fact tube is so close by what i find most interesting and love about this hotel is that it had free wireless internet service  so you can plan your weekend  or look for deals to you heart s content without having to worry about paying ridiculous prices of internet use if you love your sport  like me  then you would be glad to have sky sports channel as part of the TV channels  for free  in you room  so you dont miss any football rugby cricket games if you are away from home if you fancy a nigt in  you can get a free dvd from front desk to watch on a flat screen tv second time i stayed at this place  no change in service  totally felt relaxed and hassle free  staff very polite and helpful as usual thanks  C u soon 
P =>  Peaceful We stayed in this hotel in late tember  Although in busy part of London it was quiet at the weekend  Overall the staff were very freindly and the accommodation excellent for our needs 
P =>  Awesome hotel with HUGE BEAUTIFUL rooms This was a fantastic hotel  Very near a tube stop and the Tower of London  There are plenty of places to eat nearby as well  We stayed in a basement room that was great  very quiet and quite large  Hotel had a very cool look and was very clean  The only complaint I had was on the shower  it is separate from a huge tub   Water leaked out onto the bathroom floor so we ended using the bath mat as a water dam to prevent the leakage  The bed sheet was also not really wide enough for the bed but we managed  The free internet was a welcome surprise since many hotels charge ridiculous fees for it  
P =>  Great hotel Stayed here for   nights in     and loved it  After a minor hiccup checking in the room turned out to be fantastic  staff great and very clean all round  The location is great with easy access to Tower Hill Station  the Tower of London and the Tower Bridge  but it s a fair way from the rest of the touristy areas  Use the tube and this is a great place to base yourself when visiting London  Great service     great hotel  
P =>   Great Hotel The hotel is beautifull and the price is great A little far away from downtown London  but really close to a subway station  
P =>   An amazing hotel   exceeded expectations There is nothing to fault about our stay at this hotel   staff were friendly and professional and the room was very clean  spacious and modern  Despite being minutes away from the tube station and some large roads  there was absolutely no noise within the room  with enough space between rooms so other guests can t be heard  We booked a budget room but there was definitely nothing  quot budget quot  about it  Bottled water and a variety of toiletries  replaced every day  were a nice touch  We really enjoyed our stay and will definitely be going back  A top hotel without the   star price tag   what more could you want   
P =>   Superb Excellent hotel   rooms were great  clean and contemporary  Extras were nice   complimentary water  tea  coffee etc  full size ironing board  iron  and a fridge  Liked the touches  such as being able to play the TV into the bathroom  and the little rubber duck  Staff were pleasant and very helpful  I thoroughly recommend this hotel  the location is great for the underground  close to tower bridge and tower of London  and within walking distance of Southwark  St Pauls etc  Handy Pret a Manger next door  and a couple of bars close by  plus their own very nice restaurant and bar  Nice and quiet area  Couldn t have asked for better  surprised it s classed as   star on here  as it s probably best hotel I ve stayed in for ages  within Europe  amp  US  
P =>   Great staff Very friendly staff and a good sized comfortable room  Pleasant location  near St  Katherine s Dock  The only downside was that my room wasn t ready until      p m  which was somewhat inconvenient  Recommended otherwise  however  
P =>   Great Value  Was thoroughly impressed by the Apex  service was impeccable as was the room  The room safe didn t work on arrival and the maintenance guy replaced it straight away  Will definitely stay here again  Free bottles of water in the room is a nice touch as is the choice of pillows on the bed  foam or goosedown  
P =>   one of the best stays we had in London excellent hotel  the staff is so helpful and pleasant  everything is modern  in excellent working order  the perks of telephone rates and free internet were greatly appreciated by this new york city couple  we ate several meals in the Addendum  and it was excellent and the room service is prompt and served very nicely we had special needs over the weekend wherein we could not travel  it was a pleasure to be in our lovely suite  junior suite very nice  in this excellent hotel we will stay there any time we are in London  
P =>   Absolutely brilliant hotel This was the best all round hotel that I have stayed in when visiting London  A total surprise  as I was not expecting it to be just as good as it was  Very modern and spotlessly clean  just a few hundred yards from Tower Hill underground station and the Tower of London  Within easy walking distance of St Katherine s Dock with it s many restaurants  Perfect for anyone visitng the eastern side of London Upgraded to an executive room which was spacious and well equipped  If you are tired of tiny grubby hotel rooms then this is the place for you  Breakfast was excellent and this is the only hotel in England where the bacon is cooked properly  Usually you get a greyish pink limp offering on your plate masquerading as bacon  why can nobody else in England cook bacon properly   but here it is crisp and delicious  It was accompanied by pancakes and maple syrup  PerfectThe staff were unbelievably good  with both receptionists helpful and professional  while the concierge was the best that I have experienced in the UK We had tickets for Coldplay but I would have almost preferred to hang around the hotel A terrific stop over and will definitely use it again  
P =>   first class base to return to after a busy day s sightseeing We spent   nights at the Apex and found the staff very helpful and courteous  the room very clean and spacious and the breakfasts were excellent  We couldn t have asked for any more and would certainly go back  
P =>   Excellent design of rooms energy saving elegant and trendy Very neat and elegant decoration  full of all kinds of energy saving ideas   light bulb  toilet flushing  etc  
P =>   Great value for money We paid     for this hotel including breakfast and thought that the price was very fair  Our room was nice  clean and modern with a well equiped bathroom  The breakfast was good  all you could want like pastries  juices and lots of fruits except cooked things like sausages and eggs  which I don t like anyway so I didn t mind   Service is superb in this hotel  staff are extremely friendly and welcoming  Free WiFi in our room worked well too  so really no complaints at all  The hotel is not very centrally located  but you ve got a tube station right around the corner  Tower Hill   This is where you want to stay if you don t have a massive budget and still want to enjoy some luxury  
P =>  Superb Choice iding to stay at the Apex London was a superb choice  Perfectly located only a short walk from Tower Hill station and the Tower of London it was readily accessible to all that London has to offer  At the same time the location was quiet being down the wonderfully named Seething Lane opposite a small park  The room was large by London standards and had a stylish  modern bathroom with a large bath and separate shower  The  rubber ducky  was a cute touch  The  king  bed was firm but comfortable  There was an ironing board and clothes iron and hair dryer and well stocked tea  hot chocolate and coffee options  There was a wide screen TV and wifi access  The only thing lacking was a clock or clock radio  The continental breakfast was better than most we have experienced in large hotels with great varieties of bread  fresh fruit  beverages and cheese along with generous special options such as smoked salmon  Cooked breakfasts were also available  but really not necessary to get a good start to the day The hotel has a restaurant which we didn t try  and there were lots of other eating options nearby and over the other side of the Thames after a short walk over Tower Bridge There is also a gym which we were too busy to use Staff was helpful and friendly  with special mentions going to the breakfast maitre de and the concierge  We stayed for six days and it was a nice touch when the breakfast maitre de remembered our name after the second day and our beverage order   and it is a large hotel  We are now on the road to Edinburgh and after our experience in London we are booked into the  Waterloo Place  Apex there  One good piece of advice is to check the hotel specials before booking  We managed to get an off season price in late summer  
P =>  Apex is at the apex Having a course for   days in London City is not a bad idea at all  Add to that the excellent hotel  and you can add those days to your holiday total  Apex staff were very helpful and Wi Fi in the room was very good   My room was       I had a technical problem the first time  at        but the receptionist and technician helped in no time ROOM  Large  with twin bed  warm cover for my taste  but manageable  Large screen TV when trying to fall asleep or to wake up  Two phone sets  and free local calls helped when I used my Phone card  There were no open able windows but the climate control was excellent  it could warm and cool  depending on your feel  This is important  as you usually get only one option  depending on the time of the year BREAKFAST  The breakfast was continental  with plenty of fresh fruits  watermelon  melon   two varieties  strawberries and pineapple   smoked salmon  fruit or plain yoghurt  mortadella  ham  parmaham and Milanese sausage  cheddar  edam  ementaler  brie  various cereals  fresh apple and orange juice  white and full grain bread and deli  I hope I did not miss something  it was the same every morning  but I can not complain LOCATION     m from Tower Hill tube station     m from Monument station  Walking distance to Fenchurch Train station and from bus stop for     It was very close to Tower of London  Reaching city centre could be a challenge since you have to change lines  but you could walk the last    m  It has access for disabled  
P =>  Top quality thoroughly professional and great value for money  My fiance discovered this hotel on line and we based our booking on the outstanding reviews it had previously received  These were fully justified and our   night stay taking in the sights of London was superb  On checking in the staff at reception were particularly friendly and upgraded us to a luxury room at no extra cost  The room turned out to be fantastic with an extremely comfortable quality    bed  full sofa and a huge flat screen TV  The sound system even had speakers mounted in the ceiling of the bathroom  The sound insulation and black out curtains ensured undisturbed nights of sleep and the whole place was spotlessly clean with a very high standard of decor  The linen was Egyptian cotton and there were even bath robes and slippers provided  The dining room was first class with discrete  friendly  cheerful and thoroughly professional staff and the continental breakfast splendid  Whilst this hotel is located only yards from the Tower of London it is some distance from the majority of London s  sights  and   tube journeys from the West End theatres  This is the only aspect that we can criticise and we ve tried hard to be as honest as possible  This hotel gets our  thumbs up  and is highly recommended  
P =>  A hit in the City Our first stay at the Apex City of London in ust was most enjoyable We were pleasantly surprised with a room upgrade  which unfortunately we weren t able to make the most of as we were out and about The room was spacious  tastefully decorated  extremely comfortable and with a fantastic bathroom  big bath and separate walk in shower  The Tower Hill tube station is nearby  but we preferred to take the bus number     which takes you past St Paul s cathedral right into central London  with the bonus of a few of the old buses which I miss so much The staff was friendly and helpful Highly recommended  
P =>  Superb   Clean Great Location Spacious   generally Excellent I chose this hotel after reading the Excellent reviews on here  and i wasn t disappointed My girlfriend and I stayed for the night on Bank Holiday sunday whilst visiting the Natural History Museum and the Tate Modern  The location was perfect for us as we came into Fenchurch street  which is about   or   minutes walk away   its at the end of the road opposite The Grange Hotel  next to the back entrance of Fen Street   and is also about   minutes walk to Tower Hill Underground  As we had Travelcards we used the Underground to get South Kensington     stops on the District Circle lines  for the Natural History Museum and also later in the evening to Leicester Square    stops to Embankment then   stops to Leicester Square   The following day we took a nice stroll along the Thames to the Tate Modern via the Millenium Bridge  i would say its about a    minute walk  As a few people have mentioned  we received a complimentary upgrade from City King Room to Superior Room  which we loved   it was very spacious  unfortunately the view wasn t but that didn t really bother us  We were very comfortable and loved the Bed  Bathroom  the big flatscreen TV  had the main Terrestrial channels aswell as Sky Sports      amp     plus the News channels and Foreign ones  and the general ammenties   aswell as the Rubber Duckie in the Bath too  The Bath was really big  and with myself being quite a big guy was really comfortable in it  The Shower was also huge  easily fitting   people in if that takes your fancy  We paid the general price for the hotel of     which didn t include breakfast  i thought this was a really reasonable price for a lovely hotel in a good location  I did see some deals later that did include breakfast for a similar price so would probably do that next time as i did think the breakfast was expensive      or     i think    we ended up just eating out across the road in the Wetherspoons pub  Liberty Bounds  which is about a   minute walk to the back entrance to the right as you leave the hotel  if you are happy with a Wetherspoons then i would suggest it as its one of the better ones i ve been too  plus its cheap food and drink I thought the receptionists and concierge were very friendly and helpful aswell  and was very impressed with the casual seating area  lots of sofas and comfy seats  where i saw people using the free Wi Fi on their Laptops  We ended up taking our drinks from the Bar to our room  but would have easily been comfortable sitting there  Overall i would definately use this hotel again  as we both loved it  Plus after reading some positive reviews of the City Budget Rooms  Basement rooms   would consider this as the price is very reasonable  But i suppose if you are after a room with a view then this wouldn t be your thing  
P =>   Excellent location   minutes walk from Tower Hill  located in the city of London  Reception  and bar area  very welcoming and modern Room slightly on the small side with and old fashioned TV  LCD would be more appropriate  but bathroom area very roomy Bar and restaurant get lively in the evening  slight downside was the       service charge on ordering drinks  although this is discretionary Would recommend and would stay there again  
P =>   Will most certainly be back again stayed for   nights mid week while doing some tourist sights with my mum  Excellent location beside tower hill tube station  Hotel was tip top  bedroom has plently of space and the bathroom was huge and extremely clean  friendly staff  great choice of breakfast  couldn t fault our stay and would recommend to all     
P =>   Just what I had hoped for Good location for T of L  st Pauls and can walk to Parliament square along the river  or the Eye  Tucked away  Most convenient  Everything very immaculate  Good cheap pub close and restaurants  People very nice  
P =>   Excellent Good location  quiet street    mins from Tower Hill Station  Helpful staff  good size room  very clean and very good price  We will stay there again 
P =>    Left to my own devices I definitely would   go again  Can t fault the hotel for anything We were attending a concert at the O  arena so the location round the corner from the Tower Gateway DLR  was perfect for us Check in was executed as it should be the Deluxe King Room was as described on the website and the Bar area at the front of the hotel had a nice atmosphere My wife had a problem with her passport and the concierge dealt with the matter admirably All in all a hotel that delivered the goods as per it s websites promise which is not always the case with other hotels we have encountered  
P =>   Great Location Perfect Rooms Really Nice Staff This hotel is in a great location  just around the corner from Tower Hill station and the Tower of London The rooms are very nice  they have an excellent interface for their TV s  it provides component video in  etc  
P =>   Nice contemporary hotel Nice contemporary hotel tucked away on a quiet street just by Tower Hill tube station  Friendly efficient check in with free upgrade which was a nice touch  The room although modern was lacking somewhat  Old fashioned huge TV and radio with manual search  Scuff marks on the wallpaper and skirting boards  The carpet was torn where furniture had been moved  However  the room was nicely decorated with contemporary furnishing and bedding  The bathroom had a separate walk in shower big enough for two and bath  Nice toiletries and plenty of them  The toilet seat was round and very uncomfortable  we both thought so   I presume this was just a quirk of this room but to flush the toilet took huge effort and muscle power   room      There is a fridge in the room but nothing in it  It is handy for storing snacks or drinks  Generally it was very quiet for a London hotel  but there is construction going on nearby which started at      in the morning  Also there seemed to be quite a lot of after party noise around      in the morning  not sure if it was from the hotel or local bars but it did last quite a while  Continental breakfast is minimal and really not worth getting out of bed for  The only member of staff who was unfriendly was the man who greeted us  grudgingly  and showed us to our table  Everyone else was friendly  professional and efficient  We had difficulty accessing wireless internet in our room and used the meeting area in the lobby free they even brought us an extension lead to charge our laptops without being asked  Overall I would recommend this hotel  However  be aware it is a bit pricey and there is not much going on in the way of nightlife or convenience stores as this is in the city and therefore geared for the business traveller  Very handy for the Tower of London  
P =>   Great Hotel   Modern Building  Stayed her as a surprise for my girlfriends  birthday  The hotel was very clean and the staffs are very friendly Stayed in a  Superior King Room   this was very nice  arate bath and shower The only disappointing part of the whole weekend  was the breakfast  Continental options were very limited and the main breakfast wasn t much  small beans  one sausage  mushroom and   eggs  personally not worth the     There are many caf  s pubs within a couple of minutes of the hotel  so would use them the next time we stay  
P =>   Excellent stay Just had a very enjoyable stay at the Apex  chosen because of the reviews on this site  We stayed just one night  and found the staff  room and service hard to fault  The feel is modern  with some nice views towards The Gherkin  The hotel is within a two minute walk from Tower Hill tube  and close to the Tower of London  The location is quiet  a couple of pubs close by Our room was  superior   we got a free upgrade  and was not huge  but was perfect for two  
P =>   Just fantastic Just returned from a weekend stay here and have nothing but praise for the place The location was great     mins walk from Tower Hill tube for easy access to the whole of London and being in the  quot city quot  it was very quiet at night We booked the Deluxe King room on the top floor  which was fantastic  It was so nice to have a modern hotel room for a change  rather than the typical old fashioned rooms one gets used to  The view out of our window over Tower Bridge was especially good   and all for about the same price as a basic box room in the west end  Look no further  
P =>   Very pleasant stay Everything is Ok with this hotel  Clean  luxurious  continental breakfast very rich  free Wi Fi  Complimentary newspapers  room service  location Would recommend and would stay again  
P =>   Great hotel base for seeing London and coming back to your own relaxing space  We stayed here in a City King room based on the reviews of this site and I wasn t disappointed at all  The room was just around the corner from the Tower Tube Station and made life easy getting to anywhere in the city  we bought a   day Tube pass  so we hopped on and off it all day   The Tower of London and the nice river walk is very close  When we arrived in London after traveling    hours with no sleep  I didn t think I was going to have the energy to do anything that first day  After checking into our hotel  taking a shower  nice shower and bathroom  and a little nap in the comfy bed I was ready to go  First stop was the Tower of London since it was right there  get the       deal on the web   I enjoyed the location and the nearby pubs  financial district felt safe  even at night   It was nice to relax after a long day of running around London  The bed  A C  bathroom  and shower were great  The staff was also wonderful and really helpful  We did have the continental included and I found it to be very filling  and was a healthy start to the day  We didn t order from the menu  so I can t comment on that other than did look a bit expensive  but that s just London  We saved my money for nice dining experience elsewhere in the country during our trip and ate at the hotel for breakfast  cafes for lunch and pub for dinner  We was on the  th floor  so I outside on the walk around I had a great view of the Tower Bridge  especially at night with all the lights  If I had any  quot non positives quot   it would be the room wasn t very big  It was just big enough to get around in  but it did have a corner chair  a desk and a nice flat screen TV on the wall  There was a good sized closet  small frig and a safe  I went to London with the impression of the rooms being average to small sized compared to other places  so I wasn t surprised  The bathroom was a nice size though  bigger than my guest bathroom at home by far HINT  Watch their website for deals and book way ahead of time  We got a great deal and saved     with a promotion that was going on  
P =>   Wonderful Hotel One Block From Tower of London We arrived at Gatwick at     am this past e           and had arranged for London Country Tours to transfer us to Apex City London  We dropped our luggage at the hotel and had a short half a block walk to the Tower of London  They checked us in and held our luggage in a secure area until our return  The bell service was outstanding  and were a great help on our departure as well  that included calling our transportation service when they were a bit late picking us up  We spent a few hours at Tower of London  and returned to Apex City to relax in our rooms  we had booked two rooms  One for the teenagers  and one for the adults The rooms were clean  and spacious  with a large bathroom with separate bath and shower  There was an outlet to convert to our    v for a shaver  as well as overhead speakers from the TV if wanted  I have never encountered that in a hotel bathroom before  The supplied shampoo  conditioner and lotion were in large    ml bottles  The rooms had free wifi service  a small refrigerator  iron and ironing board  hairdryer  and a digital safe  The service of our room was outstanding The continental breakfast included a tray of cold cuts  salmon  and cheeses  as well as fruit  cereal and pastries  more than adequate for us to eat in the morning  Walking towards the Tower  there were at least three pubs  two of which had good food menues  Two to three blocks in the other direction takes one to the Fenchurch Train Station  and Fenchurch Street were I was able to find a Jessop s Camera Store to purchase a battery charger for my camera  There are a couple ATM s at bank branches there as well  Fenchurch Station had a drug store for toiletries and softdrinks and water  and if one really had to have american fast food   a Burger King The location was great for our purposes in proximity to The Tower of London  Besides the Tower tour  we had arranged tickets for The Ceremony of the Keys at the Tower   The ceremony was over by   pm  and it was a short walk to our hotel after it was over  Transportation to the rest of London was quite easy from the Tower Hill Tube Station two blocks away  or the Thames River Boat that has a stop at The Tower of London pier  The boat trip up the Thames to Westminster Pier by Big Ben was a nice sightseeing tour from the river  We had been asked why we would pick the East End as opposed to West End of London to stay  and the proximity to the Tower of London was the answer  The Apex City London provided us a quiet  modern hotel for our chosen location by the Tower of London  and insured that our vist to London would be filled with many fond memories on this first stop on our European vacation  
P =>   Lovely Hotel Fantastic Value for Money in a Great Location The fact that this hotel gets such great reviews made the choice of staying here very easy  I have always stayed in budget accommodation when visiting London before but got such an excellent rate for the Apex I went ahead and booked it for   nights  The hotel is in a great location just a very short walk to Tower Hill underground station and very easy to find  It is in a great location for the Tower of London  Tower Bridge  St  Paul s etc  I stayed here on the weekend so I imagine this area of London is probably much quieter than it would be mid week which isn t altogether a bad thing  Checking in was straight forward and hassle free  My room was located on the top floor of the hotel  Didn t have any spectacular views but the room was lovely and very bright  had a very comfortable bed and the bathroom was lovely with a separate bath tub and shower and generous sized toiletries were provided  I didn t spend an awful lot of time in the hotel Breakfast was included in my rate but only a continental breakfast I was told when I arrived down in the morning and if I wanted an English breakfast I was told I had to pay extra  This annoyed me a little  So I just had the continental breakfast and I felt there could have been a much better selection to choose from at the buffet  The breakfast room was a little on the small side and filled up very quickly but it was nice and bright and the staff were very pleasant  
P =>   Book Now  Excellent accommodation and well located  Staff are friendly and helpful   Tube and Tower of London on the doorstep  If dining out there is a good choice of restaurants within walking distance either side of Tower Bridge Loved the rubber duck   
P =>   Excellent City of London Business Hotel Very nice quality hotel in a very conveient location for the City of London  Also not badly placed for tourists as the Tower of London is just nearby  along with good transport links to the rest of London Check in was not great though   they put us in a smoking room without asking us  But when I complained they upgraded us to a nicer room to apologise  Apparently the whole  nd floor is smoking  so watch out for that  Also that first room was very dark  so try and get a room higher up Our upgraded deluxe room was very nice  see attached pictures from phone   Widescreen  CRT  tv  free internet  ok speed  and a big bathroom with separa shower  The bed was super king  but a bit uncomfortbale  could feel the springs   Room service was ok quality and delivered quickly  Lots of good chain restaurants in the surrounding area  
P =>   Absolutely Fabulous I was quite skeptical when I booked the hotel  After numerous reviews of dozen and dozens of London hotels  I had an impression that there is no way to get a nice hotel  with decent size of rooms and bathrooms  with A C and in good location at my price range  I was so delighted when I entered my room at Apex of London  Very modern  clean and beautifully designed  good size of the room and bathroom  Bathroom had a bath tub and separate shower with all the modern appliances  granite counters  and big size toiletries  Free WiFi  Location just great   close walking distance to the Tower of London  Tower Bridge  and Themes River walk  Bus  Tour buses and tube stops just around the corner  and also river boats just next to the Tower  Nice restaurant downstairs and bar  Surprisingly quiet place although just steps from the major busy street  All the staff was very attentive and pleasant  Will definitely stay again  Planning trip to Edinburgh  hope Apex hotels there are as good  
P =>   Believe the reviews   this place is good On    y      we stayed just one night at the Apex and were delighted with both the hotel and the service we received  The location is good at just   mins from Tower Hill tube station  The double room we had was well equipped with a good firm bed  The iron and ironing board in the room is a useful touch  The air con is good for the summer months  The hotel has good facilities for leaving luggage before check in and after check out  All staff were professional and friendly  We ll absolutely use this hotel again  
P =>   best hotel I have stayed in in London to date great value and service Convenient yet relatively peaceful location  Great rooms and excellent service   nothing too much trouble I ate alone in the restaurant and did not feel uncomfortable  very reasonable prices for London and better quality than most hotels I have stayed in  
P =>   A lovely contemporary hotel with friendly staff We stayed one night in the Apex hotel in London  Our new favourite hotel BookingWe booked on the Apex website and got a superior room with cooked breakfasts for      for the night  This was about the same price as the cheaper websites I did not receive my email confirmation for my room ao I used their  Webchat  facility to confirm my booking  which allows you to speak to a very friendly operative  Very useful LocationThe hotel is next to London Tower  it has all the transport links near and is accessbale by the circle line  but unfortunately for us there was maintenance works on the tube during our stay and the closest station  Tower Hill  was closed  meaning a longer walk  a lesson learnt would be to check the travel information before you book  especially if you have difficualty walking far Check InStaff were very friendly and happy to help  We arrived early and they did their best to get us a room quickly  As none were available we were happy to leave our bags and go out sightseeing until later  When we came back they had a room waiting for us  Check in was smooth and they offered to take our bags to our room for us RoomWe had a superior double and it was lovely  It was situated in the new annex and had a contemporary feel  The room was a generous size  bigger than most hotels we have stayed at in London  and had a window that stretched the full height and length of the wall  We had a generous  very comfy  double bed  my boyfriend noted that it was the best sleep in a hotel he has had    lots of wardrobe space  a hairdryer  tea  coffee and hot chocolate  biscuits  shoeshine  sewing kit  a desk with lamp      plasma TV with digital channels  free water and a massive en suite  The bathroom had all the freebies  and had a huge shower wet room and a free standing bath  Lots of towels were also available  More importantly though it was clean BreakfastWe had ordered the cooked breakfast at time of booking and my partner had the full English which looked lovely and not greasy and I had poached eggs on toast  My only complaint was no salt in the water when they poached the eggs  but I can live with that  We also could help ourselves from the buffet  which had the usual hams  cheeses  cereals  pastries  bread and fruit  What was on offer was very nice but not loads of choice  so I am glad we went for the hot option to  But it would have been more than adequate  Overall we had a lovely stay and would definately return  
P =>  APEX or Average   Are standards at Apex lowering  The near by building site is causing noise and disturbance for some months to come They want full payment in advance VAT extra Dont expect help with your bags We paid for a superior room   but it did not show Looked dull and cheap  Room     Draws in wardrobe faulty   one poor arm chair  one bar of soap for first   days had to be moved between basin  bath  and shower Cheap towels  Bathroom speaker for TV sound was good Old TVHad to ask for robes and slippers   slippers too cheap Smallish lifts   public spaces too hot  Breakfast room still not working smoothly  Coffee and toast poor   expect the fresh bread to run out  Good free newspaper supply except at weekend  Ate dinner on a Sunday never again   Room menu dull So not on top form  looks more like good   star Lets hope for better in ember when the second of   London Apex hotels opens  
P =>  Great Hotel Great Location  This hotel is in a great location  easy to get to from Paddington  we were impressed with rooms  service and attention to detail  Staff very efficient and friendly  Rooms very high standard  lots of nice extras like  robes  slippers  lovely toiletries  nibbles  Breakfast was included in room price and was great  Continental  smoked salmon  cheeses  croissants  yoghurt etc  We were so tired after walking around London for   days we stayed in on last night and hired a DVD from an extensive range at hotel   no charge for this    We visited Trafalgar Square  Leicester Square   to see Blood Brothers  Amazing     Covent Garden  fair and on last morning lovely walk down to Tate Modern via Tower Bridge  Getting around was so easy from Location  bought a one day Zone   card   can use on train and bus  cost approx       and used it over and over to hop on and off tube to various locations  Only wished we could stay longer  but will definitely return to hotel  
P =>  Great place to stay My husband  amp  I together with our   mth old recently stayed here for   nights and have to say it is one of the best hotels we ve stayed at considering the price  We got a special prepay rate which included contintental breakfast for     pounds We had booked a deluxe room but as I had requested a rollaway bed for the little one they contacted me and told me they would be downgrading us as the standard room    pounds per night  actually had a sofa bed which they would make up for us  They then refunded the difference without delay  On arriving we unfortunately couldn t go straight to the room but they took our bags for us and when we returned at the time they said  the room was ready  Even though the sofa bed was made up the room still felt quite spacious and made us wonder what were we missing in the deluxe room  As previous reviewers have said the bathroom is a decent size with plenty of toiletries  Lovely butter biscuits  amp  cookies to accompany your tea  complimentary water and the fridge was great for us as it meant we could have cold milk for our little one when required Staff were all very friendly and even though we were the exception having a toddler  it wasn t a problem  Continental breakfast more than adequate  even if we have seen more impressive ones  The only other negative I can think of is that our room didn t have a lot of natural light as the window was tiny and also it got very hot so we had to constantly have the aircon on which was quite noisy  Apart from that the rooms are well soundproofed and we didn t hear anything   and I m a very light sleeper If we ever have to stay in London again we ll definitely stay here  There s a little park opposite the hotel and a bigger one a minutes walk  Tower Hill tube station   mins and Tower Gateway a  mins walk  which is great if like us you fly into London City   Although it is in the City area and a lot of places do close at the weekends  there are a number of restaurants within a couple of minutes walking distance still open at weekends   especially at St Katherine s Quay which is only about   mins from the hotel  I definitely would recommend this hotel  
P =>  Highly recommended Getting a decent hotel in London without spending a fortune can be a real problem  I would highly recommend the Apex  It is a located in the City but the Tube is    m away so getting anywhere is not a problem    there are a lot of attractions nearby anyway such as The Tower   just across the road   Tower Bridge  St Paul s etc  and its close to the Docklands railway so convenient for Greenwich The rooms are much better than any similarly rated hotels I ve stayed in in London  They are large  clean and modern with fridge  flat screen TV etc Staff are very helpful   ask them about transport to and from Heathrow  
P =>  Lovely hotel in a good location We stayed at this hotel for our tenth wedding anniversary and we had a lovely weekend  The weekend started with a delayed flight but this   hr delay was all forgotten when we got to the hotel  It was close to Liverpool Street Station  where we arrived on the Stansted Express  so we walked  It was about   mins walk from the Tower of London and Tower Hill tube station  The staff were very helpful and friendly and the room was spacious and clean  Everything we needed was in the room  including a fridge and an ironing board and iron  The only food we had from the hotel was a light breakfast in our room but there were no complaints there  it arrived on time and was exactly what we asked for  We made use of the extensive list of DVDs to hire  free   We would definitely stay here again  
P =>  good location and value We stayed here in the weekend from    july till august  nd  The cabdriver couldn t find the hotel at first  because it s a new hotel and because the surrounding streets and buildings are under construction a lot at the moment  When we got there we saw a nice hotel with a handsome interior  Our room was spacious and the bed was large and really nice  The bathroom was also good with a seprate bath and shower  The service in the hotel was also good  and guests receive a complimentary newspaper everyday which was nice  The bars and shops in the area were closed on Saturday and Sunday  so we had to walk a bit or take a cab to find somewhere to eat  but the location was still good  The hotel is right next to the underground station Tower Hill and next to the Tower of London and the Tower Bridge  Would stay here next time  
P =>  Excellent London City ApexFrom the off we were welcomed to the hotel by very friendly reception staff and to our surprise were given a free upgrade to the best room type in the hotel  I guess that since it was Friday all the business guests had left hence free upgrade The room was huge with large super kingsize bed     inch flat screen  and massive wardrobes  Only minor down side was the view from our room  at the top of the hotel  looked onto a building site  We weren t in London for the view from our hotel so didn t matter a jot The bathroom was again huge and very luxurious  A deep single bath  walkin shower and full height frosted external window added to the feel of the hotel  Toiletries were excellent though unfortunately at    ml we couldn t take them on the plane with us At just over      for the room in London  the quality suggests this is a steal  Sure you have to take a tube to get there  But who cares when you get a spotlessly clean room you might not get in a hotel in the centre of London costing double the price and nowhere nearly as clean of good quality We would definitely stay here again  
P =>  must stay here if in london lovely rooms with great room service twice daily   all staff very helpful and polite  great location   min walk from tube  Upgraded us has it was our  st wedding anniversary  amazing room   
P =>   I totally agree with all these other reviews  I had high expectations after reading all the reviews on this hotel  My husband and I were above satisfied with our stay at Apex of London  We had a deluxe room overlooking a little park across the street  Location   Because this is in the business district  many places close early around the hotel  We had a difficult time finding somewhere to eat around    pm  but then I remembered that another reviewer said that there are plenty of options across the water  That was true  and it s an easy walk to get there  Still  note that some places stop serving food by or even before   pm  Overall  the location of the hotel is still great for easy sightseeing  and a quiet night s rest Room   Our room had a couch and coffee table and we had no issue with space at all Amenities   There were slippers  robes  and an iron and ironing board  In one closet there was a kettle with coffee  tea  and a pack of hot cocoa  I can t stand it when hotels fill their mini fridges full of expensive items  Well at Apex  also greeting us in the closet were a few snacks Pringles  jelly beans  cookies  that weren t replaced everyday  but was still a very nice touch  Plus  there is an EMPTY mini fridge which was very handy for storing extra drinks and whatever else you wanted cold  Like others said  the bathroom toiletries are huge  shampoo  conditioner  lotion and body wash   We stayed for   nights and we didn t even use up half the bottles   they are over   ounces each  I would think this is a huge expense for the hotel  but it s certainly generous and different  The fitness room was also very  very nice  and on the larger side of hotel gyms  I never saw anyone use it though  We also took advantage of the free in room wifi  If you need to print something  there is a printer in the lobby that is free of charge too  We also borrowed a dvd one night from their dvd library which was fairly large  To our surprise  they also have a few  adult  dvds  but note that you will have to ask for it  and sign it out Staff   Like others have said  friendly and super helpful  There was an issue with the lobby printer when we were trying to use it  and one of the staff behind the counter let us immediately use his computer and printer to get what we needed Breakfast   The continental breakfast that is included in some bookings consists of various danishes  loaves of bread on a breadboard  about   different kinds of dry cereal  a couple kinds of dried fruits  platters of fresh cut fruit  glasses of various yogurts  platters of cold cheeses and cold cut meats  They bring you a personal pot of coffee or tea to your table  as well as toast  We found the continental breakfast to be very satisfying so we never upgraded to a hot breakfast  but on our last day which was a Sunday  they were offering the hot English or Scottish breakfast for no extra charge  Not sure if that s a regular Sunday occurrence or not It was an awesome stay  and our high expectations were thoroughly met  
P =>   Four Star Hotel with Five Star Service I stayed at this hotel on TripAdvisor recommendation and it was all of that  The room was excellent  I was upgraded to a superior room as it was our anniversary   The service was friendly and helpful  from Check In through the stay to Check Out  The breakfast was excellent  though a little pricy if you went or the Braveheart Breakfast  I am always up for a challenge  the location was quiet but only   minutes walk from Tower Hill Tube Station  For me personally  the quiet was worth being removed from the Centre of London  For some  it might be a little too far away from the hubbub of the City  The only downside of the stay was that I had my daughter and boyfriend join us for the evening and when we asked whether we could have a pot of coffee and some tea at       pm on the Sunday  we were told there was no bar service and we could find tea and coffee in our room  The Service Notes stated that there would be bar service until       pm  That was the only hiccup in an otherwise perfect stay  
P =>   I hated to leave  This is by far the best hotel or B amp B I ve stayed at in London  and I travel here regularly  Their international staff are impressive   from the quick to assist bellmen to the friendly and helpful reception personnel   and In particular  the breakfast staff  whose warm smiles make you feel right at home in the mornings  And the breakfasts were well above the norm in quality and taste  I particularly enjoyed smoked salmon on toasted but and grain bread  and Greek yoghurt with fresh whole berries in parfait cups The entire hotel has a fabulous  calm ambiance  with muted colors  good lighting and stylish furniture  Just walking in the corridor had a wonderful rich feel  The workout room was also well equipped The room had a super comfortable bed    pillows and a duvet I didn t want to move from each morning  Layout  lighting  fabrics  furniture and bath facilities were both functional and fostered a totally relaxed feeling  The free in room wireless worked perfectly  Plush towels  spa toiletries and the rubber ducky in the tub was a cute extra in the bath The location is superb for restaurants  the Tower  walking along the river and accessing other parts of London  After   nights  it was a disappointment to leave   the accomodations and the friendly personnel  A fantastic base in London  
P =>   Excellent Hotel for value location service and cleanliness  My wife and I stayed at the Hotel for a weekend break  it was very good value for money for a   star Hotel in London  We have stayed at other London Hotels and paid much more  but this one had the lot  price  location  service and cleanliness  We would definately go back  There are several pubs and restaurants in the immediate area so if you don t want to stay in for food and drink it won t be a problem  Weatherspoons is just round the corner  and a full English breakfast for       is a bargain   Butlers Wharf  just over Tower Bridge is also worth a visit for Restaurants and shops  Tower Hill tube station is only a   Minute walk away The local area is also good  felt quite safe walking out at night  some areas in London can be a bit dodgy   One thing we noticed was that some of the smaller local pubs and restaurants did not open Sat and Sun  they probably make enough money in the week from their business customers who work in the local offices  
P =>   Excellent   will be back After a lot of research we decided on this hotel  We stayed in the budget rooms which are in the basement  They were absolutely devine  I could have moved in  The only downside  which I knew anyway  was that there are no windows down there so you can t see what the weather is like  Area was perfect for us  Busy all throughout the day sightseeing etc so came back in the evening to freshen up and go for a drink and a bite to eat  Quite a few pubs around  Weatherspoons  All Bar One  Hung Drawn  amp  Quartered  Pizza Express  Cannot recommend this hotel enough  
P =>   Hidden Gem in London We recently stayed here for   nights and had a wonderful stay  We were upgraded from a Superior King to a ior Suite which was LOVELY  The room was very big  a separate sitting area and bedroom  The decor was great   lots of attention to detail  the room was very clean and the bathroom modern  The mini bar was all free   so rare these day   which was a great touch  I would highly recommend this place  On the downside  while the sheets were great  very soft   the bed wasn t very comfy   in need of thick mattress pad  and the towels were thin and very scratchy  However  it was easy to look beyond that because everything else was so nice  Another downside is the location  depending where what you are doing in London  It was a bit far from most major attractions  but quite close to a few as well  I really enjoyed our stay here  
P =>   Excellent Hotel and very good value Everything about our stay was first class  from the moment we walked through the doors to be met by one of the very friendly staff to our check out  The only slight moan would be a lack of proper view from the hotel window  apart from that the room was perfect  offering everything and more from a    hotel  The continental breakfast was excellent and the menu for the evening meals seemed very reasonably priced for a London hotel of this standard  The location is very good as you are only two minutes walk from Tower Hill tube station  Overall great value for money given what you can pay for hotels of a lesser standard in London  
P =>   Fab  We have just spent two nights staying here for a leisure weekend in London  What a fab hotel  great spot  only two minute walk to Tower Hill tube station and the Tower of London  Lovely comfortable room with a sofa bed made up for our son  Includes a safe  air conditioning  separate bath and large walk in shower  fridge and so quiet  Spotless and lovely bath products including a rubber duckey which was a big hit with our son  You cannot get better value for the quality and service  The area is quiet but we got the tube to the Embankment   the West End  within    minutes for lots of restaurants  shows etc  Friendly professional staff  free internet  We didn t have breakfast with our deal but it looked fab and next time we will indulge   Stay there  
P =>  Close to Tower of London and St  Paul s Cathedral We stayed at the Apex on a Saturday and Sunday night  This hotel is in the business district  so weekend rates are pretty good  The Tower of London is across the street  The service was excellent  and the room was very nice  There was free wi fi  iron ironing board and a large safe in the room  There was a heat wave in London  so we really appreciated the air conditioning   All the amenities were really nice  We had breakfast in the hotel restaurant the first morning  but it was pretty expensive for what we got  and we re not big breakfast eaters   The next morning  we walked to the corner and had coffee and muffins croissants at Pret A Manger  which was wonderful  and a lot cheaper   
P =>  Excellent We stayed in this hotel the weekend before last and had an excellent time  The hotel was conveniently located    mins walk from tower hill tube and the tower of London  and we found it very easy to get around  We were particularly surprised by the  extras  that you don t normally get in hotels of this price range  toiletries  tea  coffee making  free in room safe  bottles of water  The bedrooms were well equipped and stylishly fitted out  not the normal bland budget hotel interior and the staff were really friendly  Also on my rate continental breakfast was included which was excellent  a good selection of cereals  bread  pastries  cold meats  cheese and fruit  all fresh and tasty  I would definitely stay there again and would have no hesitation recommending the place to friends and family who visit the city  
P =>  great place to stay Free internet was a great perk to staying at this hotel  Also the location is convenient and quiet  The rooms were awesome  Great value and service  
P =>  Very Good Hotel   Service Could Be Better Booked this hotel through     Hotels com after reading reviews on trip advisor We paid        night including continental breakfast for   Reception  Staff very helpful  some minor problems with the computer system checking in but no trouble to ourselves  One of our keycards stopped working after the first night typically it was on our way back from breakfast so everything was in the room but a quick trip down to recption and confirm who I was and I was furnished with   more with no issue Rooms  We stayed in room     an end of corridor room  it had king bed  nice walnut finishing  a good size desk     quot   quot old quot  CRT TV bathroom with shower and bath  A word of warning however the wardrobe has limited hangning space  we had   hangers and just enough room for them  the iron and ironing board are stored in the wardrobe   good to have them in the room but a bit of a pain for hanging stuff up  As others have commented the rooms were spotlessly tidy  including the bath room  Next to the wardrobe there was anothe cupboard containg free room safe  fridge and kettle with teas Breakfast  We managed to get the continental breakfast included in the room which noow looks like a good deal  as breakfast was the least efficient part of the service at the hotel and paying the     or so per person would not have have impressed me for what was on offer   st morning they struggled to get tea and toast out   arriving some    mins after prompting and also prompting for buttter and jams   nd morning there seemed to be a change and everything ran very smooth   a credit to the young waiter who was serving us   rd morning normal service resumed  table had no side knives  milk or butter and toast only arrived after prompting again  My thoughts are that even the least sharpest of tools in the box should be able to get the hang of setting a table  asking guest tea or coffee and bringing out some toast  The waiting staff are not ver efficient at clearing tables either so it can get a bit crowded on your table Breakfast was reasonable not a wide selection    cereals    cheeses    hams  couple of breads  couple of fruit juices  fresh fruit and some yogurts  On the whole it was sufficient but they didn t seem to stock up the trays very regularly either   not a patch on a Raddisson Breakfast Location  The hotel is well located for central London  the DLR is   mins walk  Tower Hill Tube station   mins walk  you have a Weatherspoons pub a couple minutes away  along with an All Bar One Pub  Pizza Express  Pret a Manger and Subway just round the corner as well  If you skip the breakfast option probably weatherspoons all day breakfast or something from pret would be a more cost effective option  I never used the freee WIFI so can t comment but think this is a great option to have All in all the hotel is very good based on cleanliness  location and rooms  I would go back but am aware of the hotels shortcomings so may do it a little different  If they could work on their breakfast I would say it would be better value for money  
P =>  Very nice place and a good location I stayed with my wife in the deluxe room Pros  clean and modern design hotel  great location  nice staffCons  breakfast not worth the price  the cold bar is poor and the fry up  eggs  sausage  etc     takes about    minutes to be prepared  no minibar on the room  not even in the deluxe one   construction site nearby  quite noisy 
P =>  Amazing Experience Wow what a hotel  The room was spotless  the only downside was a lack of teletext on the plasma tv on the wall  however that is just being picky The staff although not the best at English did well once they understood and couldn t do enough for us  Starting at the door the doorman took my suitbags from me and hung them up whilst we attended to the booking in at the reception  We were given  st class service by  st class people We thought breakfast was included although this was not the case  perhaps something others should confirm with reception at check in All in all a  st class stay in a  st class hotel Will definatley return someday  
P =>  Pleasantly surprised I booked one of the value  basement   rooms because of the low cost  and I was expecting one of the small but modern and clean  quot W Hotel quot  rooms  So when I walked in to a room much larger than anticipated  I was thrilled  The room itself is a nice size  plus there is an alcove with a small sectional sofa and a  I believe    quot   plasma television  The room was clean  comfortable and spacious The staff was polite  amp  helpful and the location was fantastic  There are tons of restaurants in the area and the Tower Hill underground station is a   minute walk away  We grabbed take away breakfast at the neighboring Pret every morning then ate on benches in the lovely Trinity park  right next to Tower Hill station   former home of the notorious execution site  There is a memorial there to Thomas More  Bishop John Fisher and the countless others that died there   I also suggest walking to the nearby St  Katherine s Dock   we enjoyed both The Dickens Inn and Mala  a delicious indian restaurant The Apex is primarily a business hotel so we did stand out a bit as tourists  but who cares  Highly recommended  
P =>  A gem of a hotel  I usually HATE staying in London hotels   feel ripped off by the prices for substandard accomodation and lacklustre service  Therefore  after years of searching for a hotel that meets my needs both when in London for business and for leisure  I am delighted to have found a hotel that bucks the trend and has restored my faith The rooms are wonderful   so comfortable and modern and very well finished  The staff are always friendly and helpful and made you feel valued The position of the hotel   so close the the Tower and the Thames   make it accessible for a relaxed walked around the city and offer a wide range of amenities This is the only hotel I would recommend in London  
P =>   Well taken care of    My wife and I booked the Apex in London         in anticipation of our first ever voyage to England from the USA for a   day Rotary Convention in Birmingham  followed by   days in London on our own  I had done extensive research and found terrific reviews consistently in Trip Advisor for this hotel as a   star  Apex is   blks from the Tower Hill tube station and Tower of London  It was very clean and orderly which I cannot over emphasize  our room had a limited view of the London Bridge overlooking a small park and other buildings along with the king sized bed in the Superior King  we also had a sitting room and couch  with desk  all electrical was located here and had a mirror  and TV w Bose Stereo  free     dvd library if you want it   Hotel rooms in GB seem to be smallish vs USA  but we were pleasantly surprised  I was able to unpack and put all my items away in well thought out side closet with drawers  my Radisson hotel did not have drawers so had to have my suitcase out   The amenities for full toiletries and coffee tea with complimentary snacks and bottled water was well done  Again  I took note that they didn t just provide tea or coffee mugs  but cups and saucers  We were also greeted with white Terri Cloth Apex robes and slippers in our room  a journal for your London visit if needed and complimentary newspapers  There was a separate shower and deep tub  where normally you find these combined  Everything was well maintained  nothing appeared worn out  all electrical worked well  We had a fridge to use  if needed  and of course a safe  We had access to the internet and email with a hotel provided system  service was outstanding and concierge service was very helpful for first timers to the city  Restaurant was quite good  burgers are hand prepared and thick   and we were able to package a continental breakfast with each morning of our stay through Travelzoo com  but hotels do not commonly offer such a package anywhere in London that I could find  I really had to hunt  Lastly  the hotel does offer some packages for dinner and theater discounts  etc  but we never took advantage of this as I had already made separate plans  They also had a large exercise room with equipment in the last level which we never accessed either  Very clean  accomodating and friendly service  professional appearance  good food and orderly  There were no surprises or hidden fees as we checked out  If coming from USA  bring   and   pronged electrical adapters   the desk had one   prong for me to use  but the   prong could not be used  We had to plug the   prong into the outlet  and the   prong in this adapter so U S    prong electrical devices could be plugged in  Oddly  GB hotels do not have any electrical in the bathroom by the mirror except for shavers so the hairdryer  hotel provided  and the curling iron for my lovely wife had to be used in the sitting room  At least there was a mirror there  as the other hotel didn t even have that  That aside  and mostly seeming to be a national reality rather than for this specific hotel  we highly recommend Apex City of London   
P =>   Quality good value hotel near the tower of london I have to say that the staff were excellent and couldn t do enough to help us  The room was very spacy with good facilities We ate at the bar and the quality of the food was good  if a little pricey  standard   star hotel prices  The hotel is very close to the tube making it relatively easy to get to the west end  You are also right in the heart of the tourist area for the tower of london  One advatage of the city location is it is quiet at the weekend Would reccomend this to anyone  Very good value at     per night for a room  
P =>   A comfortable clean and modern hotel Booked the Superior King room for      for a Saturday night and got a really nice room with comfy large bed  large bath and walk in shower  Lovely and quiet overlooking a church with the tube station a short walk away  Will use this place again 
P =>   Excellent Hotel    star hotel at bargain prices     My girlfriend and I stayed at this hotel for a  day break in London and I would happily recommend it to anybody looking for somewhere to stay in London  The hotel is located in a business district near Tower Hill tube station and so there is easy access to the centre of london  west end etc  The staff are pleasant  polite  helpful and extremely efficient  The rooms are spacious and well appointed with a large shower and seperate bath  The only downside to this fantastic hotel is the lack of ameneties open late at night  as it is in a business district  all shops close early  This isn t really an issue though  once you know about it you can just stock up earlier in the day      Definitely worth staying in  
P =>   Excellent Hotel with faultless amenities  Highly recomended to anyone booking a hotel in London  This Hotel is superb  amp  within a bus ride of everywhere significant to see or do in London  The staff are very proffessional  The hotel is faultness  
P =>   Almost faultless Stayed here on our way back from holiday  to meet up with friends in London  and we were very happy with the hotel  Quiet  for London   well situated  helpful staff and great rooms The only detraction was breakfast   friends had praised the Apex hotels for their breakfasts but we had a very different experience  It took   requests for a pot of tea  the toast was stone cold  the table wasn t properly laid  the cereal  selection consisted of cornflakes branflakes and muesli  the pastry selection was minimal and the service generally poor  The staff spent too much time clearing and not enough time serving or replenishing  we were not happy The rooms however  are excellent   spacious  well equipped and comfy  if a little warm   the a c wasn t the best  We d stay again  but only for the location and the rooms  
P =>   Fabulous Hotel My husband and I stayed at this hotel last weekend and we would be more than happy to recommend this hotel to anyone  The whole hotel had a modern contemporary feel to it and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful and couldn t do enough for you  The room was clean modern with fabulous facilities  fridge  iron tea coffee and plasma tv  excellent bathroom and luxury products which were complimentary We had breakfast included in our stay and this was great too  Lots of choice and the buffet you could eat as much as you like  
P =>  Superb hotel in a great location and great value too  We stayed in a Deluxe King Room with a view of Tower Bridge  and thought it was very good value  The room was large  comfortable and very clean As well as the advertised perks such as a Bose CD DVD sound system  large wide screen TV  bath robes  amp  slippers  separate bath and shower  good quality toiletries  fridge  safe  free wi fi  free morning paper  etc  there were other little touches which we weren t expecting  such as a free DVD library and a cute rubber ducky in the bath tub If we were being hyper critical  then I guess the only thing we might mention was that the  view of Tower Bridge  was a bit limited   we could see most of the bridge  but only quite small and in the corner of the window All the staff we talked to were very friendly and helpful  and really did make us feel welcome  They checked us in early  helped us with directions  sorted out the stereo system when we couldn t figure out how to work it  took our picture with the hotel s green cow  an interesting artwork in the lobby   and were just generally happy chatty people The full Scottish breakfasts we had  including haggis and black pudding  were very tasty and set us up for the day The hotel is in the business district which means it is very quiet at night if you re after a good night s sleep  but it is only a few hundred yards from Tower Hill tube station so it s easy to get about too All in all we were really pleased that we chose this hotel  and will almost certainly be going back again  
P =>  Will go back again We were offered this hotel when the one we wanted  london Bridge  was fully booked   we were not disappointed  The hotel is a stones throw from the Tower of London and Tower Bridge and just a minute from the Tube at Tower Hill  Being in the heart of the financial district it is busy in the week but nice and quiet at the weekend  We had a standard room but to be fair it was much better than the name suggests  the rooms are very nice with enornmous beds and walk in showers plus bath  and air con  fridge  and safe The continental breakfast is fine with lots of choice and was included in the price but the full english was over priced   you may consider booking room only as there is a Weatherspoons pub just on the corner of the road which does breakfast for        they had quite a bit of our custom over the weekend as the drinks in the hotel are overpriced All things considered we would definitely go back again  
P =>  Huge comfy modern rooms close to the City and Tower of London I stayed here whilst at a conference in Old Billingsgate ket The rooms are great  really big  really comfy  really modern  The bed was really comfortable The bathroom was huge with big walk in shower and bath Plasma TV  coffee making facilities  safe  wifi  ironing board  and all mod cons Location is great for the city and tower  docklands etc Breakfast was fantastic    huge range of delicious foods I loved this hotel and would definitely stay here again on business or pleasure  
P =>  Great hotel in London We stayed   nights in the Apex London hotel and felt very comfortable Clean  big and modern rooms with a nice bathroom  deluxe   Fair rates  Quiet street  Tube and bus station just around the corner as well as Tower Bridge and Tower of London Great hotel for a weekend or business trip We will come back for our next stay in London  
P =>  Excellent value in London Stayed one night in the Budget City Room  It was basically a standard room in the basement  so therefore no window  It was excellent value for a London hotel  The room was very spacious   a large bed  a L shape sofa  coffee table  a desk dressing table  massive TV  walk in shower  large bathtub   However  the breakfast was disappointing  Expensive       for the two of us  and the food was terrible  The coffee was the worst I have ever had  Great location for Tower of London  
P =>  Super Modern Clean Hotel   Stay here   Really super modern hotel and i m picky The room was very clean and modern boutique style  The bathroom was clean and very lavish with a seperate shower room and a very large bath  this was just a standard room   The room has expensive furnishings including a    quot  LCD TV with Sky included I would definately stay here again for the value  this was      whereas a Travelodge would of cost me      I would definately pay the extra every time  I have also stayed at the Apex in Edinburgh which is just as good It is also only literally a few minutes walk Tower Hill tube station  very close to London Bridge area  It has a restaurant bar but if you want a cheaper lunch option then is a pret sandwich place just next door  Also has a All Bar One accross the road so there are alternatives  
P =>   Great Hotel in a great location This hotel is a very clean en modern hotel  It s location is just   streets away from the underground at Tower Bridge  Rooms are spacious en very nice Staff is helpful and they even gave us a room at   o clock in the morning when we arrived  Would stay here again   Not the cheapest  but certainly the price worth it   
P =>   Wonderful Hotel   My fiance and I stayed at this hotel for   nights  The rooms are very modern  spacious  and clean  The bed is extremely comfortable and has a duvet cover  There is a big LCD TV  a fridge  iron and board  and closet  The bathroom is spacious and has both a shower and a tub  The toiletres provided were good quality  shampoo  soap  conditioner  and were in medium sized bottles that lasted us the full   nights  We had chosen the room with no windows to save some money and it didn t make any difference to us that there were no windows because the room itself was so nice and big  The reception desk was very friendly and offered us great suggestions for food   we were looking to try Indian food and were directed to one fine dining resturant Lovage which was wonderful and a cheaper alternative on Brick Lane street which had an abundance of excellent Indian restaurants as well  The location of the hotel is convenient   the tube station is only a   minute walk away and less than    minutes on the tube to get to any of the major attractions  Reception also stored our luggage for free when we checked out because we weren t travelling till later in the day and check out was noon  There is free internet access as well although we didn t use it   I think the hotel provides you a code to enter when you use it  Overall  I had a great stay in this hotel and would defintely return  For the price paid  about     CDN a night  it was well worth it as the rooms felt luxurious to me  
P =>   Stylish clean hotel with excellent service  We took our   year old daughter for a weekend in London  Though ostensibly a double room  the hotel were happy to set up a sofa bed for her  The room was clean and stylish with an excellent bathroom  seperate shower and bath   Service in the restaurant was uniformly excellent  staff being particularly attentive to our little girl which always scores highly with me  An excellent hotel at a very reasonable rate  
P =>   Great hotel in London   great value Superb boutique type hotel a few steps away from Tower Hill tube station  Very nice rooms  friendly staff     worth the stay in London  Best value I have ever had in London  
P =>   Truely exceptional I have been meaning to write my review several times now  I have stayed at The Apex on several occasions for business reasons and we have had multiple room bookings  I find it a great hotel to stay at  Good mannered polite staff  lovely clean building throughout  very nice bedrooms  very clean and very well laid out  can t fault them  Nice bar  it is great the way it is all laid out  open plan rather than being locked into a rooms  Love the idea of the Al A Carte service for Breakfast  means you get a nice hot fresh breakfast  also more importantly the hotel are not wasting money throwing excess food away  More hotels should be learning from this  I would recommend this hotel to anyone  whether you are visiting london on business or for a social event  There customer service is exceptional  So to all the staff and mangement at The Apex hotel keep up the good work  you are delivering a great product  
P =>   Great Location for Business This hotel is a great location for the business I am in  nothing is anymore than   minutes walk away  Service during breakfast is not the best  primarily it is a communication issue  they can t understand me and I can t understand them  Appreciate we all come from different language speaking countries but assuming english is the language of the country I am staying in it gets a little frustrating having to repeat requests   and   times I am not sure why the Apex does not have in room movies  cost I would assume  but this needs looking at as not to many people me including want to walk downstairs to book a dvd out  Think this needs looking at as it is assumed by many   star hotels to be common place Overall though I would stay here again and I also advise my staff to stay here  as although the comments above are  nice to have s  they are minor in the whole scheme of things  
P =>   Will definitely stay again I chose this hotel after reading the review on trip advisor  Room was good  No flatscreen TV though  Bathroom was lovely and the toiletry products were excellent and not stingy size  The decor is modern and discreet  We had two twin beds and would have preferred a King but to fair we never asked to change so don t know if we could have  Liked the layout of the room as It made it feel bigger having a TV with seating area  almost like a mini suite  The room was not a bad size for a London Hotel Staff were very efficient when checking us in and out  Bar staff were also good The location is Ok  good for touristy stuff on South Bank and Tower of London  As it is in the city it is absolutely dead on weekends  We got caught out as there was lots of tube maintainence going on so the nearest lines  circle   district and Metropolitan  were closed  We walked from Bank  no more than    mins  
P =>  We Shall Return My daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed this hotel  We appreciated the ambiance  the cleanliness  spacious room  lovely linens  and special bath products  The service was excellent and the location to the London Tower was exactly what we were looking for  
P =>  weekend in london Excellent location good service helpfull staffBreakfast is disappointing and expensiveRestaurant is overatedoverall a good location from which to explore london 
P =>  Great location staff and rooms  I booked a twin room at this hotel through Xcapewithus  unfortunately  unknown to me they ceased trading the day before my arrival  On arrival when I attempted to check in the girl on reception informed me that the reservation had been cancelled the previous day  she was very helpful and sent my friend and I off to the bar for a complementary drink while she attempted to find out what had happened  On discovering the cause of the problem she was most apologetic that there were no longer any twin rooms available and the only room she could offer us was a budget city room  She suggested that we try the room for one night and if it didn t suit she would see what else was available for us the following day Despite the minimal natural light  these rooms are in the basement  we were very pleased with the room  it was very spacious with a super king bed  sofa  desk  huge TV and a fabulous bathroom  Our only gripe was that the bed was too firm for our tastes but only cos we are both side sleepers All the staff were very pleasent and nothing was too much trouble for them  As for the location of this hotel  it s a  min stroll to Tower Hill tube station and there are plenty of places to eat nearby  The wetherspoons on the corner does a great breakfast for less than     
P =>  Very good hotel with excellent service Very nice  clean and quite hotel in the city  Very friendly and helpfull staff  Good value for money  Will defenitely stay there again 
P =>  Not sure how s it so high I stayed here for one night  I couldn t fault the hotel  Unsure why it s so high on the list  Good value for Money  location good and very clean  Rooms on the small side but then again it is London 
P =>   Great value for London I can recommend this hotel  as it has a perfect  quiet location near the Tower and in the heart of the City of London  The room was very clean and nicely decorated and good sized for a London hotel  The only bad thing was the sound of the air conditioning even when it was turned off  
P =>   great value  Very good    minutes from Tower Hill station  a    minutes walk to the Tower Bridge and the Tower of London  The hotel is modern  clean  quiet  Staff are very helpful  my gf had her wallet stolen in Camden  watch out for pickpockets     and they helped us all the way   Our room was on the small side but it was just as we expected it to be  Bathroom was spotless and had high quality amenities Continental breakfast  included in the rate  was excellent and the staff serving it could match a   star hotel  The bar has a good selection of drinks  the cocktail served are top notch  An excellent hotel  I would go back there in a minute  
P =>   New clean excellent location  Stayed for   night in il  Very clean room  ammenities for new and stylish  and the free wireless was great  Location is close to Tower Hill tube station  Great for short stay in London  
P =>   Amazing for the price I stayed at the Apex for one night while in London to watch the London athon  I stayed in one of the hotel s  quot budget rooms quot   which are rooms in the basement that have no window  For barely GBP    per night  this was quite a steal  as the Apex turns out to have some of the largest and best appointed rooms that I have ever come across in the uk  The basement rooms are great in all respects but for the natural light  and that s probably not such a big deal for many visitors  Spacious  beautifully furnished  great bedding  large bathroom with separate bath and  large  shower and fancy toiletries  Free wifi is unusually fast  And just a stone s throw from the Tower of London  Great deal  
P =>   Enjoyed   delightful nights at the Apex For      incl  continental breakfast we spent   nights from Friday to Monday on this up to date hotel  Although we came at    am  we were checked in quickly and also got a nice room with some  quot view quot   if view includes seeing surrounding buildings and narrow streets   a huge bed  a    quot  flat screen TV and possibly the best designed bathroom I ve encountered in my hotel visiting career  The spacious walk in shower was plainly sexy  and there was also a bath tub in the bathroom as well as some nice complimentary toiletries  The concierge service was friendly and helpful  with everything from hailing a taxi via making reservations at restaurants and carrying our bags  You also get a free wi fi connection during the stay  and that s convenient in the   st century We enjoyed breakfast every morning  and although a continental breakfast isn t my favorite way to start the morning  I enjoyed every crumb of toast and every sweet piece of pineapple and other goodies  The breakfast is also available through room service  but we didn t have breakfast in the room  Nevertheless we ordered   club sandwiches  and although a bit small  they were tasteful and fair value for money  The fries  though  were probably the most ordinary I encountered on my   nights spent at the hotel  The Apex is only a     minutes walk from the Tower Hill underground station and therefore only     minutes of walking from the historic Tower of London and it s iconic neighbour  the Tower Bridge  With the tube you re only    minutes away from Westminster Big Ben  but architectonic masterpieces as the Gherkin and the Lloyd s building is only a     minutes walk away  I would definitely recommend this hotel to every person who is considering a stay in London  and especially during the weekends I predict you will get a very good deal at your stay  
P =>   Couldn t have made a better choice  MrReaves took me on a weekend trip to London for my birthday this past weekend  After reading review after review  it seemed impossible to find a hotel in London that was affordable and not a total dump  How lucky we were to have decided on the Apex We arrived before check in time  and we were almost immediately greeted by the reception staff even though there were several other people in line ahead of us  The check in was exceptionally quick  and our small carry on bags were taken by the concierge for storage while we explored The hotel is located catty cornered around the block from the Tower Hill tube stop    Opt for this one instead of Aldgate if using the Underground to get to the hotel    It is also located very close to the Tower of London and within walking distance to both the Tower Bridge and London Bridge We took our time getting back to the room  and it was awesome except for one minor problem that we didn t find until the morning     but I ll get to that      We had Room      It looked out onto an alley where construction is being done on the building next door  We never heard the first peep from the alley  If this is because we arrived on Friday and the British are too polite to make noise all weekend  then they are my new favorite people  The room had a king bed with   comfy pillows  There was a large flat screen LCD mounted to the wall with several media ports built in to the wall underneath  most notably a USB port  They also provide free internet for    hours  and we had no problems when using out laptop to search for fun stuff to see and do Here s the one problem  but to be fair  we had read about this on some other sites with hotel reviews  The shower is magnificent  plenty of room and heavenly water pressure  BUT the water from the shower decided to detour the drain  and it ran out into the bathroom floor  Not just a little bit   A LOT  There is even a sign on the door telling you to dry your feet before entering the bedroom  The shower door was glass  and it had about a   quot  gap between it and the shower floor  Aesthetics are one thing  but ignoring practicality for the sake of keeping the bathroom looking neat is not good  This is the only reason that I didn t give it  s across the board  I did leave my concerns in the comment forum with the hotel website  and I am waiting for a reply We spent   days in and out of that place  and we were always welcomed very warmly by the staff  Check out was also very efficient  and we had to leave at  am on Sunday   We can t comment on the restaurant at the hotel other than to say that it was always full of folks dining or just having glasses of wine or just hanging out in what I called the Cozy Room  it s lined with couches and throw pillows and nooks and crannies  Overall  I would most definitely stay at this hotel again  and I would suggest that my friends stay there as well  Also  we got the best deal on the room through the hotel s website  so be sure you check there as well as with the discount sites  
P =>   A First Class Base for London very near Tower Gateway on DLR A first class base for London  very near to Tower Gateway on DLR which was ideal for our arrival at London City Airport  We were most impressed with the helpfulness and courtesy of all the staff we encountered  especially Karol the concierge and Paul our Head Waiter at Breakfast  The breakfasts were fabulous  our deluxe room was spotlessly clean and spacious with an excellent walk in shower  The in  room entetainment system was new and very impressive  It was Easter Weekend and the hotel   and London   was fairly quiet but even if busy I am sure the service would be just as good  
P =>   Excellent Location and Value   check if room has window  We have recently stayed in this hotel  I booked on the internet and was amazed at the fantastic rate      excl VAT  for room only  The hotel is very stylish and the room was lovely   bathroom spacious and had everything we needed    except there was no window  The room was located in the basement so whilst it was quiet  I think I d have preferred a room with a window  It was too late to ask for a room change as we had already used a couple of the facilities and didn t check in until very late at night  Location of hotel was super   right near Tower Bridge and the Thames clipper stop  Would recommend and revisit  
P =>   Great hotel good location After reading about all of the hotel rip offs in London I was wary but everything about this place was positive  The decor was very up to date and clean  there were more small amenities than I expected  and the staff were very friendly and helpful  The location was excellent with one small caveat  It is a two minute walk to Tower of London and Charing Cross tube station but  since this is the business district  restaurants are pretty scarce  particularly on the weekend  That said there is a Pret cafe several doors up which was great for a quick snack  closed Saturday  and you can be in Trafalgar in about    minutes by Tube  If you like it quiet it s perfect  Room was not large but was quite comfortable by London standards  
P =>   Great choice Modern  comfy beds and pillows  free internet in your room is a big plus  friendly and helpful staff and everything works  Rooms are nicely furnished with clean lines and excellent modern and roomy bathroom  Location is great   can walk to many tourist attractions and   mins from Tower and Tower Pier so have great access to river Thames and cheap river transport  Safe and quiet and great choice for single female traveller  
P =>   one night at the apex found the apex on booking  com  the hotel was perfectly situated for the sights of the pool of london being a short walk from tower bridge etc The hotel was very modern with a lot of focus on design and lighting which worked very well  the room itself was top notch  very modern with all the mod cons you would expect including flat screen tv and a nice sofa to watch it on  our room had a view of tower bridge I would recommend this hotel especially if you can get a deal on one of the late booking sites  left in the morning feeling like we had been somewhere special  
P =>  Modern Bright and Clean Lovely bright modern hotel Rooms were excellent and the service was very efficient but friendly Tried one of the breakfasts and sorry we did not try more Close to Tower Hill station for access to down town  across the river has excellent new restaurants and pubs as well Robert Duffy 
P =>  Great Location near the River We stayed at this hotel for one night  it is located in a quiet square close to the Tower of London and the River Thames  it also had free wifi  The rooms were lovely  very clean and spacious  In the evening we walked along the embankment at the side of the river  The breakfast was very good with lots of choice and a excellent full english breakfast  All the staff were friendly and helpful  We would stay there again  
P =>  Amazing city stones throw from Tower bridge  One of the best hotels I ve stayed at  pricey but worth it  The staff went out of their way to help you and ensure that your stay is a good one  
P =>  Ideal for a special long weekend in central London but on a budget Staff were ALL really welcoming and attentive and gave good advice  Breakfast  continental  was so good we didn t bother with a cooked one but they looked good and were served quickly  Room was modern  very comfortable  all the usual facilities including big TV and walk in shower  All clean and smelled pleasant  Very convenient for tube  river transport to    and Westminster  Conference facilities looked OK too  A great find   we will be going back soon  
P =>  Ideal hotel Would stay here again  Very pleased with our budget room and the service we received during our two day stay  Hotel location is ideal for sightseeing and very close to the tube station  Planning on staying here again very soon  
P =>   Simply the best I have stayed in many hotels over the last twenty years and the Apex stands out as a beaconof excellence in an otherwise sea of mediocracy  The hotel is located within a very short walking distance of Tower Hill tube station which is well served by the CIrcle and Disrtrict lines  The rooms and public areas of the hotel are the cleanest I have ever seen  and the young staff are a credit  This is the only hotel I have tsayed in where I cannot find fault  This is the only hotel to stay at if in London  
P =>   Great location very comfortable bed quiet great bath very clean good value  I stayed at the Apex City of London hotel for a weekend break sightseeing   th and   th ch     Clio in Reservations had been extremely helpful with my booking  and I found the rest of the staff to be very friendly and helpful also  Bathroom was spotless  with a huge deep bath  which was wonderful  a great shower  and the toiletries were lovely  and plentiful  Bedroom also very clean   the bed was huge and very comfortable   I had a great night s sleep both nights with no outside noise at all  There was a fridge and safe in the room   both of which I was glad to use  I had paid the extra for the full breakfast when I booked  and you could have it in your room if you wanted  which I did the first morning   it came at the requested time and everything was nice and hot  although the fare laid out for the Continental breakfast also looked delicious so I would probably just have that next time  Location is excellent  just   mins walk from Tower Hill tube and lots of buses  and a couple of nice pubs nearby which also serve food  I was out sightseeing every day and it was lovely to come back to such a peaceful room  soak in the bath  and relax with all the extra cushions provided on the bed  I would definitely stay here again  and would recommend the hotel to friends and anyone I know travelling to London  The weekend rates are very good for such a high standard of accommodation  and very good value for London  Rates during the week are higher  though  as being in the City of London which is still largely a business district  it attracts business visitors through Sun to Fri  All in all I could not find fault with anything about this hotel  I really enjoyed my stay there and will definitely book Apex City of London hotel on my next trip to London  
P =>   Probably the best deal in London  You would be hard pressed to find a place in London that has a better location and rates than the Apex  It is located down a quiet lane within very easy walking distance of Tower Bridge and Tower of London  The rooms are quite nice  nothing to complain about  I paid for a deluxe room and got upgraded to a junior suite which was awesome  The only down thing is the food there is crap and finding something as simple as water or a coke can be at best a frustrating task  Overall  it s tough to think of a better location and better price  especially considering it s London where expensive is the norm  
P =>   Another perfect stay at Apex This was our second stay at Apex  and again it was perfect  Booked same Deluxe room  very spacious  clean  full of light  Like the previous time  the airco was a bit too cold but there was an extra heating device in the room this time which provided enough heat  Personnel very kind  bar is nice  we did not try the restaurant though Location is very good  though not as central as Piccadilly or Covent garden  everything is accessible with the tube  a short   min  walk from the hotel  There are also bus lines going to the center of town For the price  booked early on internet at a very interesting rate   we never had a better stay in any other hotel in London  I will definitely go back to Apex every time I go to London  and I always recommend it to all friends and family   
P =>   Efficient business place with a nice decoration The apex is conveniently located and offers a better value than other hotels in the city  the staff is nice  freindly and helpfull and does it best even if the hr policy of the hotel seems to consist of employing non hotels professional which english needs to be polished  Rooms are great  especially the so called luxury which are junior suite at very affordable price for London city  Free Wi fi internet in the room  Great food at the restaurant as well as in room service  
P =>   Excellent Hotel Stayed   nights in ch and loved the hotel  Rooms were spacious and staff were generally friendly  Excellent location and overall good value for money  Will definitely stay again  
P =>   Great hotel  Great hotel  situated opposite to the Tower of London and a couple of minutes walk from Tower Bridge and a tube station  close to a few bars and restaurants which was handy  fairl close to the rail station that brought us from London city airport  Friendly staff  big room  comfy bed and nice interior  
P =>  Feels like our second home I have stayed at the Apex  City of London with various members of my family on at least    occasions  The facilities are excellent   the food is to die for and the staff are the friendliest I have come accross  We ALWAYS get a warm welcome and the service and consideration from the Restaurant manager is second to none  We visit London regularly to visit our family and we wouldn t dream of staying anywhere else   
P =>  class elegant and relaxing stayed in the apex for a weekend and was delighted with everything from the check in to the room service   still top class at     am  to the check out Sad to leave as we were there for a fun weekend in london and the apex helped round of a great weekend will be back soom 
P =>  Superb modern facilities Me and my family stayed in this hotel for a weekend trip  We booked budget rooms  which are advertised as having little or no natural daylight  but were half the normal price  As we planned to be out most of the time  and only in the room at night  we decided to risk it  It was absolutely no problem  and did not detract from the excellent standard of rooms we were in The bedrooms are very modern  spotlessly clean and include a huge LCD tv with good channels  tea and coffee  free wifi  fridge  free water  great bathroom with power shower and fancy toiletries We flew into Stansted and got the Stansted Express to Liverpool Street Station  The hotel is    minute walk away  Although on Saturday and Sunday the immediate area is dead as it is the business area  we walked to Brick Lane in about    minutes  and had a great balti curry  We were all delighted with this hotel  and would definitely stay there again  
P =>  A real  gem  in the heart of London  An outstanding hotel in terms of friendliness  welcome and attentiveness to the customer  It is a hotel that rewards frequent visitors to the Apex City of London  On our recent visit we were offered a  free upgrade  to one of their luxury rooms  In addition  the quality of the food at breakfast is first rate  again with attentive staff on hand My wife and I always look forward to returning to the Apex City of London  where we know we will be guaranteed an excellent stay   immensely good value too  
P =>  Excellent value for money and freindly service Stayed at the Apex City end of  for my birthday   everything was great even to the little duck in the bathroom  a nice touch also was water in your room  also nice toiletries better than most  the room very modern and clean with a comfy bed  all the staff very friendly and obliging  the breakfast not your usual buffet  but everything freshly made which was a nice change and lots and lots of toast of which you usually have to ask for more  in all a very good experience will be back in ust if not before  also the Apex are opening two other hotels nearby in the city J  Naylor 
P =>   Hotel ideally situated near tube business district Situated in a business district and close to the tube  this hotel is an ideally situated Check in was fast and friendly  I arrived way ahead of normal check in time but a room was available so I could get myself installed in the room  superior king room For london standards the room is quite big  There was a king size bed which fills up      of the room  A big tv screen and a small desk fills the rest  Not too much space to walk about  The king size bed is actually made out of two beds  They did a good job hiding it  I only found out during my last night  but I would still prefer a real king size bed Bathroom is pretty spacious with a powerful shhower and a separate bathtub The hotel has excellent gym facilities which are open       Ideal for late night or early morning workouts Internet access via wifi is free  Big advantage I did not have breakfast there as London offers a lot of choice and my experience with business hotel breakfast is below par Check out was again fast  professional and friendly If you can get a decent rate  consider this hotel  
P =>   A hidden gem of a hotel My  rd stay in this hotel  and I can t praise it enough  clean  modern  great service  good value  and great location  very quiet and peaceful  but still remaining close enough to all the sights  I am in London again in ch and have already booked another room  
P =>   Great Room and Staff What a great hotel  Highly recommend booking a superior double room   as some good deals out there  The room was amazing   huge comfy bed  good size sofa and big TV  funky lighting and great photography framed on the walls  The bathroom also has speakers so you can hear the radio in the shower   All staff very polite and friendly  Nearest tube station   mins walk away and you can walk along the Thames and be in Covent Garden in    minutes  Will      be back to this hotel  
P =>   More of a Business Hotel Spend   nights over the weekend in early      It is located within the London financial district and about   mins walk to Tower Hill Tube Station  You can walk to Tower of London within   mins  The room is excellent with nice pictures hanging on the wall  flat screen TV mounted on the walk  free Wireless Internet and local calls  Bathroom is very comfortable with bath tub and shower seperate  The toiletries provided are great however no slippers though  This is more of a business hotel and not many restaurants are opened around the hotel during the weekend  
P =>   Another great stay Our fourth stay at this hotel   and of consistently high standard  Welcomed back   a nice touch  Travelled with elderly parent and requests for nearby rooms followed on each visit  Rooms not large but spotless  tastefully decorated and quiet  Good location near Tower of London and nearby tube  Staff welcoming and helpful  We didn t bother with full English breakfast   the continental breakfast was plentiful and varied  
P =>   Very Family Friendly very welcoming Enjoyed the Stay The service right from the start was excellent  Our daughter enjoyed the friendly attention while checking in  we enjoyed a quiet evening in our room and it was so quiet that we felt very relaxed  The room had everything that we needed  The location was perfect for the Tower of London and the metro system was so close for travelling anywhere  The best thing about the hotel was the service at breakfast  nothing was to much for the staff  There didn t seem to be anything to dislike about the hotel  
P =>   If you can find a better hotel in Central London for the money I ll eat my hat We stayed at the Apex with a couple of friends back in ember  almost entirely based on the TripAdvisor reviews here  We paid just over      a room including VAT for a Superior King  and for that money we weren t expecting anything too amazing  especially considering some of the rooms have been described here as a bit pokey and not too exciting Well  how wrong can you be  We were placed into a newly refurbished block which can t have been open more than a week or two  as I am fairly sure from the state of the room that we were the first people ever to stay in them  There was the very slight smell of fresh paint  and everything was absolutely spotless  it was like the hotel room equivalent of a show house Sure  the room wasn t huge  but the TV certainly was  a big    quot  plasma monster taking up much of your field of vision at the bottom of the bed  The bathroom was also immaculate with the obligatory Apex duck  which my missus has since adopted  although sadly he floats upside down  the poor big headed duck   The location was great  although admittedly you need to go a few tube stops round the Circle line to get anywhere with a good number of bars and restaurants  but you re only a   minute walk from Tower Hill station so that suited us fine The only negative point from our stay is that the bar shut up shop about  am  when the bar was half full   call me old fashioned  but when I stay at a hotel I expect the bar to stay open until the last patron leaves  or at least until some time a bit later than it did  but it s a very slight niggle in an otherwise excellent stay  Staff were excellent and went out of their way to make sure we enjoyed ourselves  Free wifi as mentioned elsewhere is such a small gesture but makes a huge difference to customer satisfaction   I get so used to paying      for    hours in London hotels  when all I really need is    minutes to look something up  So more plus points here The follow up email I received a week or two after staying urging me to come on here and write a review did explain the rather large number of ratings and reviews for this place  but they all seem fairly spot on to me  and the place really is good for the money considering the location  Would definitely stay again PS   I don t really own a hat  so if you do find a better hotel for the money  I won t really be eating it  though I d love to know where that hotel is  
P =>   I won t stay anywhere else in London now    the Apex is unbeatable in every way I am surprised at some of the reviews on here  To be honest most of them are good but the negatives I would say are unfounded if you have done your research    You are not in the centre of London here  you are in the City    this is good   it s quiet and more relaxed    The breakfast we had was gorgeous  we had a full english    the waiter was extremely attentive  Compared to other hotels in London we thought it was cheap    Yes VAT is added on top   isn t that the same with every hotel  I don t understand how people who book online don t know the total cost as it is very clear on the website   The shower was hot    again I don t understand how people cannot work out how to use the shower to get it hot  Basically  we loved it and have booked to stay there again in ch  We have also recommended it to many friends who were also very happy with their stay  For a weekend stay  it is the best value hotel I have ever stayed in for the pure fact it is extremely well furnished  the furniture is modern but looks expensive and bathrooms are stunning   it s very clean  the staff are very friendly and check in and out very efficient  On top of that the free toiletries are HUGE and smell gorgeous  You just don t get that anywhere else in London unless you pay double the price  I really don t think people appreciate how expensive London hotels are The only negative I have is that we had to go out so didnt get to spend more time in the room Again  thank you to the staff   the price went down in between us booking and staying there  which I noticed when looking at the price for my friends that wanted to stay there  The staff straight away moved our booking to the new cheaper rate  We then were given a complimentary upgrade when we arrived Please don t read in to any of the negative comments  you will not be disappointed if you stay here  
P =>   Comfy stylish and big bed This hotel was a great base for seeing the sites like London Bridge and The Tower of London  We stayed in the delux suite which was very spacious  The bed was huuuuge and very comfy  The bathroom was clean and modern with a powerful hot shower  We didnt eat breakfast at the hotel following other comments but popped   mins round the corner to Weatherspoons and had breakfast for     
P =>   Fantastic Stay at Apex city Absolutely top class hotel  cant believe its only   stars  The decor was very stylish and modern  very clean surrounds  just a   min walk from Tower hill tube  Check in was prompt and friendly  We d the stay already paid for and didnt need credit card deposits or anything  The room itself had a lovely wide bed  flat screen tv  dvd player  iron  amp  ironing board  hair dryer  everything you could need really  I agree with fellow reviewers  the bathrooms are excellent  huge walk in shower  huge bath tub  nice big fluffy towels refreshed each day  The breakfasts are served downstairs in a lounge area  just off reception  we had included in our booking price the continental which was all you needed  buffet choice of cereals  apple orange juice  milk  water  fruit  yogurts  ham  cheese  salami  toast  bread rolls  tea coffee  croissants  pastries  muffins  A wide newspaper selection for your morning catch up  Great breakfast  Check out was very quick also very effficient  Would definitely stay here again  great value  
P =>   Solid Foundation Minor Flaws This is a lovely hotel very close to Tower Hill tube stop  Easy walking distance from Bank tube stop too  We stayed for   night on   th ruary       The hotel was easy to locate and in a very quiet street  Upon arrival the staff at reception were nice and helpful  the speed of service was not the fastest I have experienced but nothing to worry about  After we checked in  we stayed in a Delux King   Room      we took the lift to the sixth floor and found our room easily enough  The room itself was a good size  enough room for a sofa  bed  amp  desk  There was also the biggest TV I have ever seen  The bathroom was lovely  with a walk in shower and a deep bath  all very clean and new looking  Our stay at the hotel was excellent  the staff were friendly  the room was spotlessly clean  and the facilities were excellent  We have stayed in lots of high end hotels and this one was in our top     I would highly recommend it  Gay Friendly    Now for the flaws   Although there was not many flaws with the hotel I always think its worth mentioning them however small Firstly the TV picture quality was not good  the TV was hugh but watching it was difficult  The pillow covers didn t fit the pillows correctly  The selection or tea and coffee was a joke  Only English Breakfast and instant non brand coffee  The room was      a night and this was not to standard  There was a crack in the toilet bowl  which just looked unsightly  In the morning one of the other guests was playing music extremely load  it even covered up the building work from outside  Although the sound system in the room is Bose and very clear  its not too good if you on in a neighboring room  Non on the windows were able to open  Obviously a safety feature but if you want some fresh hair its difficult  And thats about it really  Nothing too bad with the hotel  All On all its a nice hotel 
P =>   Free wifi   good for business This is definitely one of my top three hotels when staying in London for business purposes  for the following reasons    FREE WIFI  A lot of other hotels take note   we need this        Excellent bathrooms  toiletries are particularly impressive  as is the plastic duck provided at no extra cost    Excellent in room dining menu I hate being ripped off for Wifi when staying in a hotel and Apex thankfully buck the trend in this area  It doesn t cost much to do but the result is repeat custom from myself in the longer term  
P =>   Stylish hotel with great rooms in City location We were looking for multiple rooms in the City of London in uary      and chose Apex initially due to it s modern and stylish look  The arrival and check in was smooth and sleek and we were welcomed at the door by the assistant general manager himself  The reception staff were extremely courteous and helpful  We were treated to an upgrade in the standard room and once in the rooms we were not dissappointed  Very clean  well laid out rooms with lovely beds and the bathroom was also impressive  The shower however was the most pleasing  a huge walk in shower  very hot  very strong water supply available and plenty of it Pre dinner drinks in the evening were spent in the lovely ambience of the lounge bar among freinds where we enjoyed a wide range of beers and spirits  The location of the hotel also made it easy to choose where to eat with so many restaurants nearby  So many sights of London to see too in this area Breakfast is served just off the lobby and serves an a la carte breakfast menu with fine service in calming surroundings We enjoyed our stay and will definitely book again  We wholly reccommend it  N Ginger 
P =>   Great City Break Hotel We stayed at Apex City of London Hotel when we visited London for my birthday  It was booked as a late deal and was excellent value for money  Located in the centre of London  it is actually just round the corner from the Tower of London  and only    minutes away from the West End by tube where we went to see a show  infact had the weather been good we could have probably walked it  When we arrived we found a well presented hotel  very clean with a modern retro d cor  We were greeted by professional yet very friendly check in staff and whizzed through the check in process  We stayed in a City King room  which was just lovely  Although the room was small it was immaculately clean  the d cor was fantastic and the room contained all the necessary items for a weekend break  I particularly liked the fact that an iron and ironing board were available in room  The bathroom was great with a bath and separate shower and full compliment of toiletries  I need not have packed my shower bag at all  Wi fi internet access was available in room and the first   hrs were free  ideal for anyone who cannot bear to be without an internet connection  My favourite novelty factor of the hotel though was the multicoloured cow in the hotel foyer   genius  Would I stay here again  Most definitely yes  
P =>  so pleased  I decided to book the apex on the back of the great reviews here  so pleased  We arrived on Friday night at  pm and we were tired and cold  The room was so nice that we decided to do something unusual for London tourists    stay in and order room service  It was very good     mussels and chips yum yum   the room and bathroom were spotless  the room was a decent size although the bed and bath were a little on the small side  These would literally be my only criticisms of the place  and even then I m nit picking  We paid for breakfast when we booked  This was continental and there was plenty of choice     fruit  yoghurts  cereal  bread and lots of patisserie  Service both on the desk and at breakfast was superb location was really handy and it felt like a safe  smart and well maintained area  We were there at the weekend however and it was DEAD as it is a business area and probably has a better buzz Monday Friday  We passed about ten restaurants that were all closed on a Saturday night  So you may well have to go further afield for real nightlife eating out    but you re in London so that s no bad thing  i would definitely go back to this hotel  
P =>  Bad This hotel is made for people who are in London for business and who are unlikely have time to enjoy the room  The rooms have a size of prison window  They are dark  No view whatsoever  The bathrooms are below average  I only booked it because I tried their sister in Dundee  which was nothing like this  so certainly would not recommend the London one  
P =>  Nice Hotel Poor Service We booked this hotel on      Hotel and got a great price for two nights B amp B  Then my husband upgraded our room before arrival to a deluxe room for an extra     pounds  The Hotel is right beside the underground station  right hand side of the station  about a two minute walk down a lovely side street  The hotel is very modern and clean  our room was lovely on the third floor looking out the front  it was a large room with a big flat screen TV and couch area  nice bathroom and big shower The breakfast was disappointing though  we thought when we upgraded that we would get a full cooked breakfast but we only got the continental breakfast which was just OK  The service in the restaurant was very slow  and I had to ask for tea and toast three times one morning  The day we were leaving the weather was terrible  very heavy snow and the Airport was closed  We asked for a rate to stay another night and was told they wanted another     pounds for one night in a standard room  well we stayed in another hotel near the Airport for    pounds which was great I did like this hotel  room was lovely but the service was not great  it is very handy for the underground station and to walk along the Thames River  
P =>  My new favourite hotel I stayed in Apex City of London hotel on Friday night and it was by far the best hotel Ive ever stayed in  The staff were lovely  especially the receptionist  I think her name was Kasia  Every staff member was always smiling and very helpful  I got an upgrade to a lovely room  which was spotless  and had an amazing bathroom  with a huge bath and walk in shower  The little rubber duck on the bath was also a lovely addition  even though it didnt float  I ordered a burger and chips from the roomservice menu which was delicious  I cant wait to come back with my boyfriend and stay for a longer trip  Definatley worth a visit  One piece of advise though  if you are getting the underground  I think it says on the website that you can use Aldgate station or Tower Hill  but its much easier by Tower Hill 
P =>   Wonderful Hotel My husband and I stayed at the Apex City of London for one night after a day s Christmas shopping  The room was beautiful and the staff were so helpful  Breakfast was first class and once again all members of staff were so attentive  We cannot wait to stay again Vanda and Clive Jones 
P =>  Cold but good hotel Basically it is a good hotel for the money you pay  about    pounds per night  booked in august       Stayed   nights  in two different rooms  In addition    pound     euro at the moment  extra advantage As the other reviewers were saying the staff is ok  the location is very good  clean spacious rooms and nice gym etc  We didnt take the breakfast because of the high cost  just walk down towards saint pauls cathedral and numerous places can be found to grab a nice sandwich for a few pounds  The hotel has a few flaws  In the bathrooms several items were not properly mounted on the wall  Also no heating in the bathroom  Unfortunately the heating system was broken on the  th floor and our first night was therefore a bit cold  We complained several times at the front desk and got another room  upgrade   which was ok  In conclusion  we had a great time  
P =>  A bit upset I really enjoyed to stay here over the christmas holiday  the staff was kind and mostly very helpful  except when housekeeping took one of our keycards from our room   The linen were really noisy  so you couldn t turn i bed without waking up the person next to you  weird problem  I know   Beds were a bit hard  and the air condition was on the fritz  it was nowhere near    degrees in our room  more like         Nice room  spacious minifridge and bathroom  As usual  we got a view facing an alley    Our room was located very near the elevators  so we could hear the voice coming from there every time the doors opened  Well equipped gym Located very close to the Tower Hill underground station  so you won t find a better hotel at this price anywhere this central The thing that really bothers me  is that they reserved the cost of the stay at my creditcard  without saying they did so  This means that they reserved     pounds on my creditcard  even though I payed in cash the very next day  I payed on december   rd  and I STILL haven t gotten my money back  I am in dire need of that money  but the hotel has totally ignored my e mail about it I can understand that they want to reserve the amount for safety reasons  but they should tell you about it   and inform you that you might not get your reserved money back in a couple of weeks If you re staying   don t pay in cash if you need your money  Other than that  it s a nice hotel  
P =>  Great Hotel This is an excellent hotel which is about a   minute walk from Tower Hill tube station It s a short walk from the tower of london and plenty of bars and restaurants in the near viscinity Room was excellent   large shower and bath  also a large bed with a sofa and flatscreen tv  Bottles of water left in the room each morning and tea making facilities topped up The only reason i ve given it   stars instead of   was due our double bed being   singles joined together and problems with the air con in the room  Apart from those minor problems it was excellent We ate breakfast aroung the corner in the wetherspoons pub as it was     for breakfast in the hotel there is also a gym in the hotel which looked well equipped Other plus points were the dvd player in the room and free rental service of about     dvd s also the staff were very helpful and kept our bags till the afternoon after we had checked out  
P =>  Lovely modern hotel Stayed overnight here as a theatre package for our daughters christmas present and was pleasantly surprised it was a lovely clean modern hotel near to the Tower of london with easy access to the underground  Our rooms were nice and had the most comfortable bed we have ever slept in  No views out of the windows though just buildings and offices but other than that it was great  Staff were very helpful and couldn t fault the breakfast  delicious  
P =>  Lovely hotel My daughter and I booked this hotel onroute to spend time with my family at Christmas i thought it would be rather expensive but was very surprised when i paid an absolute bargain online and got breakfast included The hotel was in a great location as was catching train from Fenchurch Street station just   mins away   plus right on top of Tower bridge so made a nice place for a little walk and visit My daughter was very excited about the hotel when we arrived and even more so the room well i was too   The hotel looked stunning in all its festive lights and trees the staff at the reception were lovely and we was even offered help with our bags to our room very nice We had booked a City room we had a large kingsized bed and large walk in powershower bath all modcons coffee tea etc cute little toilitries and the duck of course We even had a dvd player and you could hire films for a hire charge which would be reimbursed to you when you returned the dvd  The room was rather warm and you couldnt open the windows but there was air conditioning which you could change to suit you Our breakfast was included in the price and there was a great choice continental or full breakfast with pastries fruit etc anything you wanted The staff in the restaurant were very attentive and anything you asked for was got for you Right now i only have a couple of things which i wasnt too happy about although these things wouldnt put me off staying there on another occasion  these were the room at nightime i had asked for the quietest room possible as my daughter and i are light sleepers  but was put in a room at the front of the hotel and was told the traffic wasnt noisy but it was I would have liked to have opened the window but the noise would have been worse so glad i couldnt The other thing was just one thing at breakfast although it was tasty and a fab choice i wouldnt ask for scrambled egg again as it was the oddest i had ever seen or tasted It was orange and sloppy so left that So if you are thinking of staying at the Apex City Hotel London then if you can get a bargain or its just a treat then go ahead you wont be disappointed Hope this helps    
P =>   Great Hotel Lovely hotel  staff great  Loved the decor and the rooms  Found it quite strange you had to ask staff to open the windows for you  but overall  hotel was great  
P =>   Loved the Apex hotel i thought i should write a review about this hotel When we arrived early morning the room was not available but we wee able to leave our luggage in a room and they took my mobile number and text me when the room was available So when we went back to the hotel after the text we were given room     on the third floor i booked a deluxe king room witch is three up from the basic room  it was huge had a massive bed and a sofa area with a huge plasma TV  Room came with bathrobes  toiletries and slippers  as well as a Nespreso maker We were given complimentary drinks voucher each and a box of chocloates too   and of course the rubber duck in teh bathroom the hotel is about   mins from Tower Hill station and about   mins from two pubs although we did not use them Our rate included brwakfast and we were entitled to continental including cerials  jams  bread  pastries  fruit etc and also a full english  very tasty overall this is a truley wonderfull hotel located in a good and convienent location and would i reccommend it to my friends   YOU BET I WOULD  
P =>   Another excellent review I would like to add my own brief contribution to what seems to be a long list of  satisfied customers  following a stay at the Apex City of London for a  birthday break   with my wife      th ember       Your previous reviewers have commented on the high quality of the surroundings  decor etc which we endorse  but for us   the key feature of our stay was the genuine courtesy and high standard of service shown by all staff at all levels  Without being patronising or obsequious the management and staff were clearly committed to looking after the welfare of the guests  Thank you  
P =>   Fab fab fab    The Apex is in a fantastic location for local attractions and transport and is a hotel full of modern chic and luxuries  The room was spacious and clean with all the mod cons and treats you could ask for  we didn t ask for the rubber duck but it went down well anyway    Warm  comfortable and relaxing  this is by far the best hotel we have stayed in for a long time  The staff were generally very helpful  even hailing a taxi for us  something we are definitely not accustomed to   We cannot really grumble about the hotel but lets try   The only real negative was breakfast  The food was lovely  although no beans  well thats not entirely true  you can have beans but you have to ask   The staff were the main problem  It probably wasn t intentional but headless chickens springs to mind    We did expect more in a hotel of this calibre but were sadly let down on this score and had to beg for cutlery  tea  toast  and other such oddities     Luckily this didn t ruin our trip  we would definitely stay in this or another Apex hotel and although you probably can find cheaper accomodation  you won t find better for the money you will pay here  which is pretty reasonable really for all the added extras  On the whole  loved it   
P =>  Nice hotel but small rooms We really like this hotel and got a great weekend deal  It is within walking distance to the Tower of London  Tower Bridge  and Tower tube station  The room was small  but clean  There was a nice bathtub and separate oversized shower  
P =>  Stylish and modern hotel I stayed here in ember       The hotel is on a side street which means it is quiet as it is away from the road traffic  It is ideally placed for tourists  e g  close to Windsor Castle  and for business people  The hotel is very stylish and modern  Check in was a bit slow  The room was a decent size  modern and clean  The bed was very comfortable  The only problem with the room was that the TV was too big for the size of the room  The comfy settee  which could not be moved  was too close to this large TV  You had to watch the TV from the bed otherwise you ran the risk of getting eye strain  The bathroom was impressive with a bath as well as a separate shower  However there was a smell of damp coming from the shower  The restaurant was bright and airy on the ground floor overlooking the street  I only had breakfast in the restaurant which was good with a reasonable selection  However the cooked breakfast was a bit pricey for a modest portion  Overall a decent and comfortable hotel  
P =>   Brilliant would definatley book again Stayed here fri night  hotel really modern in its interior decoration  Room small with no view but tasteful clean and well decorated  fab bathroom with bath and large walk in shower  Ordered our evening meal to our room on arrival and the food was the best i have ever had from room service  My only gripe was that it took us ages to find the hotel in the dark on foot because the name sign is in letters about four inches high  
P =>   Love this hotel  The hotel was beautiful  very modern  The room was nice and comfortable  And the location was great   min from the tower of london  Bus stops near by go straight to all the main tourist attractions in london  The staff were excellent so friendly and helpful  Would definately stay again in a different city  
P =>   A relaxing experience in London From the moment we arrived we were treated exceptionally well The reception staff were friendly  well organised so you felt expected and welcomed  The bedroom was a super size with all ammenities in place a great place to relax after exploring London sights  After a great night s sleep we had one of the best breakfasts we have had in all our trips home and abroad The yoghurt is to die for and the eggs benedict as good as any I ve had in U S A or Canada and all served by friendly attentive staff The hotel is a haven within the bustle of London  
P =>   Great value Stayed just the one Friday night   a last minute decision to spend a day and a bit in London to visit Borough ket and the Tate Modern  The hotel was excellent in almost all respects and good  by London standards  almost phenomenal  value for money It s well situated  my partner s only complaint was that it was surrounded by some atrocious Stalinist bank buildings  and welcoming We had a room which was more than twice the size of rooms I ve been charged twice as much for elsewhere  in London and in other cities   Excellent service from the desk  and clear identification of what cost and what didn t Only slight issue we had was at breakfast   the service wasn t what it should have been  but it was very clear that the reason was training of brand new staff  which we consider excusable  particularly given the standards elsewhere   
P =>   Very disappointed with the Apex I booked this hotel after reading the great reviews in Tripadvisor and was very much looking forward to it  however I was greatly disappointed with the customer service  We booked a king bed for   nights and were given two single mattresses pushed together  I consider this unacceptable for a   star hotel  Both the mattresses were different heights so there was an uncomfortable gap in the middle of the bed and the higher mattress would dig into your back while sleeping  Both of us found it uncomfortable to sleep during the whole stay and had completely restless nights  Our other issue concerned the cleaning service  The Apex is not a cheap hotel and the price did not include breakfast  therefore I would expect at least the rooms to be cleaned properly  When we arrived back after a day sightseeing  we discovered that the bed had not been made  all our towels had been taken and none replaced  all the  nearly full  shampoo  conditioner and shower gels had been taken and again not replaced  The toilet paper and shower cap were taken not replaced  All in all  it appeared as though all they did was change the cups and glasses  We had to ring down for more supplies and were lucky that there was still someone there  When we checked out we nearly missed our reservation for breakfast as it took a very long time  The man at the desk had no idea how to use the credit card machine  or any of the systems  We made a complaint about the above issues and were asked to fill out a complaint form and it would be looked at  We did this but received no answer or acknowledgement  After several days I then went to the hote s website and filled out a feedback form  I gave full details and asked that we be contacted with some response  Again I have not been contacted or acknowledged at all  While this is not the worst thing that could happen in a hotel  I feel that if you book a room and it is not cleaned and you have no rest in it  it seems a complete waste of money  I would have been happy with some response or apology from the hotel  but my biggest gripe is that I have not received a single acknowledgement of my complaint  Customer service is what will bring a customer back time after time  but this hotel is sadly lacking in it  
P =>   Great for business travellers Quick check in  easy to get into room  For a London hotel  in the centre  the room was a good size  The bathroom was huge for the UK  with a large shower and a separate bath  The shower was a power shower   the first in the UK  What bliss   Room nicely decorated but in business neutral style  not the stuff that memories are made of  Comfy bed  Didn t like the pillows  Location a bit empty at the weekend  but easy to get to livelier places and there was an excellent Italian  no pizza  within walking distance Excellent  if I needed to be on that side of London  would book again immediately  
P =>   Well located fair price Well located  close to London Tower  a bit far from tourist center      walking  which in fact is nothing   Staff very very friendly  helping us in any moment The room was confortable and very clear  It s a fair price for quality received  which is not very common in London   
P =>   Excellent Value for London My wife and I stayed at the Apex in ober whilst visiting our daughter  At      per night the hotel was extremely good value by London standards  In a very pleasant location near the Tower of London and St Katharine Dock the hotel is convenient for many of the more interesting London s sights and only a short Tube trip to the West End  Our room was a good size with a very large modern bathroom  a sofa and a good quality TV CD DVD set up  Unusually for London there was very little traffic noise as the hotel is situated in a quiet side street  We would definitely recommend this and we have booked it again for our next visit  
P =>   Very Nice But Over Priced A very nice hotel  great location  nice rooms with loads of rooms  however makesure you get a room with a view  I only stayed for one night and had to make time to see the local attactions of London Bridge and Tower of London  both within   minuets walk  the only let down was the price of  GBP          per night  but you do have to pay for a good hotel in London Will I stay there again  probably not unless I win the lottery  
P =>  Great hotel We were looking for a reasonably priced hotel that was in a good location and we delighted with the Apex  About a   minute walk from Tower Hill tube station we found the Apex  We arrived quite early and were able to check in and leave our bags before heading off exploring for the day  All the staff we encountered during our stay were friendly and efficient  We had previously stayed in the Holiday Inn Express in Southwark and paid much the same price for the Apex but the difference in standards was huge  The hotel is bright and modern with super kingsize beds and fabulous showers  We didn t spend a lot of time at the hotel as we were out and about all the time but the hotel would suit those who want to hang around a bit more as the bar and restaurant areas are very inviting  There is also a gym for those feeling energetic  We had a continental breakfast included in our rate and this was very substantial with cereals  breads  pastries  fresh fruits  meats and cheeses on offer  We had a look at the cooked menu and this was substantial offering everything from Kippers  eggs benedict etc to pancakes  french toast and the full english  We didn t sample the restaurant in the evening but it looks good and has excellent reviews  All in all I d recommend the Apex to anyone looking for a comfortable stay in London  Take time to visit The Hung Drawn and Quartered Pub around the corner  It s pretty quiet around London on Sunday s but we found Wetherspoons down the road to be very welcoming  
P =>  Luvvely To get away from things  we decided on a  quot  love weekend quot  in London  Looking around for good deals  I checked a dozen or so hotels against TripAdvisor and found  quot  The Apex of London quot   Great reviews  one of the best in London  and exceptionally low price      pounds a night  including breakfast  thru their own website  It is a beautifully designed  crisp and trendy hotel with friendly staff  from all over the world  it seems  and brilliant location  Just a block from Tower Hill Underground Station  on the Circle Line  and two blocks or so away from Fenchurch Street Railway Station you can get to anywhere in London fast and easy  get Travelcard in advance or buy an Oyster card when you arrive  briliant system     We flew into London City Airport and we were at the hotel within an hour after touching down  no kidding    using the Docklands Light Rail  changing at Limehouse to Fenchurch Street as Tower Gateway was closed   The room   not too big  of course   was impeccably clean  the bathroom  with seperate bath  luxurious  the tv big enough to placate American guests  free DVD s from reception    and the bed big and firm with several pillows to choose from  Our Superior room came complete with coffee maker  safe  fridge and ironing board The staff is international and although not all of them seem fluent in English  they do their best to make your stay pleasant  The breakfast  both English and Continental  is excellent and although we didn t eat at the hotel s resaturant  it was full on saturday night and I m sure not all were guests of the hotel  The bar   design and lounge music   is laid back and not at all pricey        for a pint    quid for a glass of good red wine  Although the City is a ghost town in the weekend  makes for a quiet stay   the hotel is quite close to Spitalfield ket and Brick Lane which are a must see if you  re into vintage stuff  food from all over the globe  hip people and thousands of stalls selling everything from art and  vintage clothes to bicycles and used batteries  Brilliant place  The Apex is also a five minute walk away from the Tower and the Tower Pier where you can catch a River Bus up and down the Thames  west to Waterloo Bridge and east to Greenwich  for a whole lot less than a river cruise  If you like to walk  it takes about    minutes to walk along the Thames to the London Eye All in all a very affordable stay in a luxury hotel with excellent location  if you know how to move about the city   We  ll be coming back  
P =>  Fab hotel great stay Stayed at the hotel for one night as needed to find a cheap place to stop in London whilst visiting friends and managed to get a great deal which inc continental breakfast for under       Hotel is in the financial area and so its very quiet at the weekend  Lovely room  bit small but would nt complain  nice bathroom  hotel staff helpful and the continental breakfast was great  Really close to Spitalfields market which I d recommend to visit on a sunday  all in all would go there again  
P => a gem in london the staff were simply faultless always helpful  smiling and only to happy to give advice or directions  the hotel was very clean  roomy and well furnished  in short I travel quite a bit reference work and I can say I woun t stay anywhere else in london other than the apex  their bigest asset their STAFF 
P => 	th Birthday surprise  I booked this hotel solely because of the reviews I had read here on TripAdvisor  The occasion was my husband s   th Birthday  and I wanted to make sure everything went smoothly I booked through the hotel website  and added some extras to the stay to add to the weekend Some things weren t in place when we checked in  but sales manager Scott  really couldn t have done any more to ensure that the rest of our stay was perfect  and for that we are very grateful About the rooms  ours was a  deluxe   and very spacious  Climate control quiet and effective  Great bed and pillows  sumptious robes  Quirky little expresso maker in our room was fun and love my Apex duck   Nice touch   The lighting in this hotel is wonderful  and almost forces you into a relaxed state  The decor is chic and understated  Artwork is good  and if you don t like the COW then you are truly sad Restaurant food is reasonably priced  brekkie less so  but worth it   Paul the host is charming and welcoming  My husband was off to see the American Football on the first morning and to get into the theme of the day he tried the pancakes  bacon and syrup   said they were great Any crits  I think maybe some of the reception staff could do with being a little more welcoming  not everyone visiting is a businessman on an expenses account  and a warm greeting makes a lasting impression Oh  nearly neglected to add  great location  quiet street    minutes from Tower Hill tube  Whitechapel and the famous Jack The Ripper walk close by  Petticoat Lane market   mins walk away on a Sunday morning   great  
P =>  Good Location Tiny Rooms Great location for business trip  All hotels in London are small and expensive  The pictures are a good representation of what you will experience  The place is newer with ok but small rooms  Can t see how two people would share a room of ths size  I like the separate stall shower  Not a great deal of hot water in the morning  Good food for London  BK up at the train station for US travelers  I arrived on a Sunday night and no internet through mid morning Monday  The desk tried to blame this on their  quot service quot  and suggested I call them  what BS  A business hotel needs to get the internet working at these rates  even on a Sunday  Good choice overall  
P =>   Great hotel great service handy location Overall  this was a great hotel and I loved the feel of the place  On arrival  at     am  having taken the sleeper train from Scotland  they couldn t allocate me a room  which I half expected  but they were happy to look after my luggage and I used the beautiful and well equipped bathrooms downstairs from reception to get changed  Nice soaps  toiletries  hankies etc Arriving back later in the day  my room was actually upgraded from that which I booked  so I had a superior double room for just me   This was a Saturday night   The room was spacious  had a separate couch TV work area away from the bed  which itself was pretty big  Didn t have the over supply of pillows and accoutrements that so often annoys me in other up market hotels  Room was air conditioned and I wasn t cold at all leaving it on all night  even in ober The bathroom had a walk in  no stepping over  shower and a separate bath  both of which were very clean  There were four full size bottles of toiletries   lemon scrub body wash  tea tree shampoo  moisturiser and something else  didn t use them all   I also liked the nice rubber ducky in the bath Breakfast was served on Sunday between   and    am  I was told when I arrived at the breakfast room  itself very nice  that I was having a continental buffet breakfast  Others seemed to be feasting on individually cooked full English breakfasts so I asked and was told that apparently the rate I booked with my travel agent only included continental  Anyway  the buffet was pretty good  with one highlight being a lovely chef made natural yoghurt with pineapple compote  also a great selection of cheeses  meats  nice  freshly made croissants and pains au chocolat The location was great for me  It s only   minutes  walk to Tower Hill tube station  from where you can get the Circle and District lines all over the city  So  it s not central  but it might as well be  because transport is so conveniently located  
P =>   Hard to fault this hotel Having read other reviews we were confident to pre pay with the hotel and secure rooms at a very competitive price  We had looked for   city view rooms but on booking only one was available  This was rectified on arrival AND we were given a free upgrade for the second room Rooms are clean  beds comfortable and our  quot double quot  was  foot wide  The bathrooms are excellent with great showers and a good quality range of toiletries  Excellent hospitality tray and generous electric sockets  The public rooms are similarly spacious and well maintained The cooked breakfast was  perhaps less inspiring and our friends were disappointed at the lack of vegetarian sausages nor was fish of any sort offered  Many people would be happy with the excellent continental style buffet which is cheaper and includes fresh fruit and good selection of cereals  breads  pastries  meats and cheeses  All good quality The hotel is in a quiet location  valuable in London  and very close to Tower Hill tube station  No   bus route into the West End with a very frequent service and one of the stops for the Open top Sightseeing bus tours  As mentioned by previous reporter they will keep cases for you if you arrive early and or want somewhere to keep them after check out Barry 
P =>   Excellent hotel Very comfortable   excellent breakfast and very well situated   would certainly return and recommend this hotel  
P =>   Fantastic  Stayed at the Apex for one night after a birthday visit to the theatre and it was brilliant We booked a standard double room for      including tax but on check in we were informed that we would be upgraded to a deluxe room free of charge  The room did not disappoint   luxurious and spacious  a massive comfy bed and still room for a sofa and a    quot  flat screen TV Bathroom was excellent with a walk in shower  huge bath and complimentary toiletries The area is very quiet as the hotel is on a side street and we had the best night sleep we ve ever had in a london hotel  We saw a show in the Victoria area and the journey to and from the hotel was quick and easy on the tube If you can get this hotel for      or less then it s an absolute bargain  especially as its close to the action   without the hustle and bustle of most London hotels  
P =>  Ideal Location We travelled down this Autumn for the London River Festival Everything about the hotel was good  its ideal location for visiting all of the festival sites  its very close to Tower hill underground station which was a big help as we came down by train The staff were very helpful and friendly and the rooms comfortable spacious and well equipped  We enjoyed our visit and the great river festival  We look forward to staying again next year  
P =>   Excellent  I ve just spent two days with my wife in this wonderful hotel My room had a view of the Tower Bridge The room was spotless  immaculate with a very comfortable bed The zone is a very quiet one Even with our windows open we couldn t hear any noise form the street  
P =>  Beautiful Hotel    Great Breakfast The Apex City of London Hotel is a beautiful hotel in a great location  The rooms are small  but they make up for it by providing a great atmosphere  We could walk from the hotel down to the Tower of London and the Tower of London Bridge  Here is a website that provides all their information http   www apexhotels co uk hotels city of london    They would mail out your post cards for you and their breakfast is very very good  The hotel is also very clean and made us feel like we paid a ton of money to stay there  which it isn t cheap  but it is worth every penny  We also enjoyed the safe walk or taxi around the corner to the London Underground Tube Station  A general London tip  Get the London pass because it REALLY is a wonderful resource for everything and saves you a little cash too  We really enjoyed eating at lots of places on their list  
P =>  Excellent hotel down a quiet street This is a very comfortable modern hotel a few minutes walk from the Tower of London  tube and bus services  Friendly and helpful reception  lovely clean room with a bit of space and most of what you could ask for including a safe and drinks making facilities  The only complaint would be a lack of daylight in the room   the small window faced a small dark area outside  As well as TV with a good variety of channels you can hire DVDs for a refundable deposit  If you pre book breakfast on the hotel website you get a price reduction   the breakfast is fresh continental or combined full English and is freshly cooked   very yummy  Luggage can be stored safely after your checkout time  We stayed at a weekend which meant disrupted public transport and difficulty getting to the Barbican where we were due to meet our son  If going at a weekend and likely to use public transport check the tfl  transport for london  website for station and line closures  Buses    and RV  from Great Tower Street and opposite Tower Gateway respectively also take you into the City  We would happily use this hotel again  
P =>   Lovely Hotel in a Nice Location We have just returned from a three night stay at the Apex  City of London  and what a lovely hotel it is  Our room was luxurious  to say the least  with one of the most comfortable sleeps I have ever had in a hotel bed  The hotel is located in a good  safe area  with the nearest tube only a matter of minutes walk away  There are some nice pubs nearby  though not too close  the street the hotel is in is lovely and quiet   The service we received was exceptional and I would highly recommend this hotel  
P =>   fab hotel great location we stayed here for two nights for our   th wedding anniversary and i have to say this is a fantastic hotel in a great location when we looked out of our window we had a birds eye view of tower bridge the staff couldnt have been nicer from the minute we checked in which i have to say was the smoothest check in ever nothing is a problem we had the breakfast on the two mornings and i would highly recommend this as you got a great feed and we didnt have to eat all day  the rooms are a great size we had two televisions and two dvd players  plenty of tea and coffe biscuits and complimentary bottled water every day the bed was sooo comfy it was also so quiet at night but at the same time everything was so near the tower hill tube station is just around the corner and the tower of london beside you and there are lovely walks along the river we will definately stay in this hotel again and have recommended it to some of our friends who are going to london 
P =>   Great location and value We stayed here on tember   th and   th to take in the Proms in the Park and the Thames Festival  Good sized room on the second floor with a view of the small adjacent park  The room was very clean with a large bed and good sized bathroom with a bath and separate shower   plenty of hot water at a good pressure  It was the weekend but even so the room was quieter than we expected and the heating cooling worked well although the default setting at   C was rather too warm for us at this time of year Complimentary newspaper  great continental breakfast with a good selection of cheese  meats  toast and fruit as well as the usual continental pastries Location was easy for transport   No    bus a short way away  the Tube even nearer and boats available within ten minutes walk alongside the Tower Good value by booking on the internet and our room was upgraded on arrival We booked this hotel as a result of the Tripadvisor reviews and were not disappointed  
P =>   Great service nice rooms My wife and me stayed from friday to sunday  The Hotel was very nice  we had a Superior King room  which had a nice standard  big bed  nice bathroom with shower room and bathtub  All the employees showed excellent service  We had ordered full breakfast and   course dinner  The hotels restaurant Addendum had also excellent service and great food at affordable prices There is a nice gym in the basement Its situated close to the Tower of London  the subway  circle line   bus    and the Thames with river boats  We got there from Heathrow  it takes about an hour if you first take the fast train to Paddington station  and from there changes to the circle line that stops very close to the hotel Its not  quot downtown quot  london  but its easy to get there with bus and subway  Lots of cosy pubs and dining places just outside  that were full of life friday  but dead on saturday  The Addendum was open though  in case you don t want to go downtown  
P =>   A great place and another great stay Stayed for a weekend at this hotel in      and had no sencond thoughts about going back when London called again this tember Like the location of the hotel  the rooms are stylish and discreet decorated  the amineties are as they are supposed to be The staff is friendly and helpfull Can only say one thing about this hotel  To me it s the only hotel in London  
P =>   Wonderful Great location  hotel  and restaurant  There really isn t anything we didn t like  The hotel is about  min walking distance to Tower hill underground station      min walk to Tower of London and Tower Bridge  Its a safe area to walk at night  The staff was more than kind  helped with every request  Rooms were clean and quite  
P =>   Very good indeed My wife and I booked this hotel having read reviews and are delighted to say it lived up to expectation  We had a lovely room   not much of a view but very clean and comfortable We used room service several times and had good experiences   very quick and good standard for food and drink  Room had ironing board and iron coffee tea facilities  a proper hairdryer and a fridge as well as everything else you would expect  Nicely decorated with a flat panel TV on the wall with a DVD player as well  They have a good selection of DVD s to use if you wish at no cost   only a refundable deposit Breakfast had a great selection choice and we found the staff very helpful  The only slightly negative of the location of the hotel is the fact that none of the surrounding bars restaurants seemed to be open at the weekend  We were given a recommendation from the concierge which turned out to be very poor  La Reuda   seriously don t go there   Apart from that very good experience and would recommend this hotel  
P =>  another stay another    experience Booked a great deal at the weekend  deluxe room       which has pleasing views over Seething Lane    signs of a quality place  they ask for feedback and they use it  Apart from the spaciousness  the minimal yet really comfy styling  the excellent beds and linens and the overall good service they now offer espresso machines in the room  though admittedly I was happy with the normal filter coffee arrangement  and  er  spotted rubber ducks Love the walk in power showers  the fact that it s quiet and the aircon actually works   Even on fairly mild days it can be hot and sticky indoors   The only problem I have is an addiction to staying there  The one flaw   breakfast in the restaurant was surprisingly busy  lots of people staying yet the place seemed empty  and a little slow  Plus I missed out on the tattie scone by ordering the wrong kind of breakfast  the fry up instead of the braveheart   I ll stick to room service instead   quieter and you can order individual items a la carte  Why oh why can t they open more places in London and the rest of the UK   few places seem to get as much right as the Apex does  
P =>   Perfect room delicious breakfast friendly service   I didn t want to leave  I booked this hotel via a booking website and got a very reasonable price of      including continental breakfast  Upon arrival at the hotel we were able to check in an hour early  but when we arrived at the room I soon realised that the seperate walk in shower and the flat screen TV were not present  so I called reception to query the booking details  They reception staff advised that there were a few rooms that did not yet have these facilities  but they immediately offered to find me another room to my liking  I was SO pleased when we arrived in the second room  no         the flat screen TV was great and the room was a really good size  as was the bed    As for the shower   WOW  You could easily fit   people in there and it had a lovely powerful water flow  The colours used in the bedroom included a beautiful orange colour   it was so cosy yet clean and modern too   perfect  I love to stay in hotels and one thing that I always notice is the quality   amp  quantity  of the toiletries  The toiletries at the Apex were lovely   with seperate shampoo and conditioner   good news for long hair like mine  Any plenty of it too  The facilities in the room were excellent  with ample tea  amp  coffee    complementry bottles of water and with an iron and ironing board in the room   which is a nice touch as in some hotels you have to contact reception to have an ironing board delivered to the room  The staff were very friendly and the breakfast staff were accomodating when it came to ordering a vegitarian English breakfast for my other half  We ate so much we had to lie down and the staff kindly let us check out a little later than specified  I could not fault the hotel room or the food and I am already planning to visit the hotel again  Excellent value for money and the location was great with so many beautiful landmarks in the vacinity  I have already recommended this hotel to several friends  
P =>  great hotel Really nice hotel  Convenient location just a few minutes walk from the tube  The room was really clean with a really comfy bed and a great bathroom with seperate bath and shower  Nice and quiet too  No complaints at all  
P =>  Loved It  An oasis in the centre of London Booked this hotel for a long weekend in y and had a fantastic time  The rooms were lovely and well equiped with a fantastic huge bathroom and TV with DVD player  We were booked in for room only but ate from the bar menu the night we arrived and the food was great  The bar has a open fronted terrace looking onto a lovely little square and it is hard to believe you are in the centre of London as it is a lovely place to sit and have some food   a drink after a hard days sightseeing  The hotel itself is situated in the business district of the city and the area is quiet at the weekend but the tower bridge tube station is literally a two minute walk away and will take you straight into the buzz of the city  
P =>  Gem of a hotel Loved this hotel  There are not many hotels in London that will live up to expectations but this one did  The hotel is spotless  the rooms modern and very comfortable  The staff were all friendly and the buffet breakfast was excellent  We appreciated the generous amount of toiletries in the bathroom and the large walk in shower  The hotel is in a great location as it is in a quiet street yet just a short walk to Tower Hill tube station and the Tower of London etc  I would stay in this hotel again  
P =>   Apex experience Really enjoyed our stay Hotel well situated  Near transport Lots of tasteful and imaginative touches Very pleasant and helpful staff Reasonable price  
P =>   Bargain for the weekend Once again we had an excellent stay at this top quality hotel This hotel does very good rates on the weekend   less than      per night   for what is essetially a top quality business hotel during the week Therefore you are getting top notch service  reasonably spacious and elegantly furnished rooms and a superb location near the Tower of London Breakfast is extra  but getting pankcakes  waffles or eggs benedict for a leisurely in room breakfast is the extra indulgence that can make the weekend a real treat I like the location  a few pubs and sites nearby  but to get into town the Tower Hill tube in a few minutes away and taxis to the West End etc are reasonably inexpensive and easy to find    
P =>   Another glowing review for the Apex  I stayed at the Apex in a City King room  just the standard category  just for a stopover en route  and it was everything I d hoped it would be from all the excellent reviews on TripAdvisor I loved the location  just a minute or two from the Tower Hill Tube station in a very business oriented neighbourhood that was both very safe and very quiet at night  and fairly bustling with men and women in smart suits during the day  When I arrived at the hotel  backpack laden and fresh from three months in Africa and southern Europe  and therefore no doubt looking a bit dodgy   I was still treated with extreme politeness and friendliness as I checked in  Every staff member I encountered at the front desk made a real effort to ask me how my trip had been and things like that   I felt very welcome despite my extremely casual clothing and overall state of disrepair My room had no view  as is pretty usual in London  but it was spotlessly clean and compact  with good quality bed linens  a flatscreen television and DVD player  and lovely bathroom with a tub and separate walk in shower  as well as a subtle speaker in the ceiling that could be turned on to play the sound from the TV  DVD  or radio   Bathroom toiletries were all large      ml  and included conditioner  not just shampoo  which I was very pleased with  The hotel s complimentary DVD library is a fantastic bonus too if you re looking for a quiet night in I ordered room service for both dinner and breakfast  too exhausted to leave the hotel     and both times I was served by more incredibly polite staff members  The food itself was well prepared and well presented by the onsite Addenum restaurant  and delivered while very hot and obviously direct from the kitchens  ent wine selection and a varied menu  too   most definitely above average room service dining Overall  I found the Apex to be wonderful value  reasonable rates for central London and a really great property  
P =>   Possibly one of London s Finest We  myself and significant other  stayed here for a weekend in uary to celebrate an anniversary I had been searching high and low to find a decent hotel with a half decent location in London that was affordable since ober  This was a tall order  but the Apex City of London far exceeded our expectations The hotel is in a converted office building  pretty standard for where it s located   and is a stone s throw away from the Tower Hill tube station   getting there is incredibly easy  just don t do what I did and misjudge the distance from the tube to the hotel and walk right past it  Checking in was not a hassle at all  and the reception staff were extremely friendly  we arrived at   PM  and were happy to help with any queries  their concierge service was also spot on To say that the hotel is clean is an understatement  it sparkles   there s a spotless finish to everything  even the rubber duck that they state in the room book that you can keep  I think they know that people would take it anyway    The rooms have a very clean  crisp modern d cor and are rather large in comparison to other London hotels I have stayed in The hotel itself has a prime location for tourists   a   minute walk brings you face to face with Tower bridge and the Tower of London  as well as a dock for the Thames Clipper  
P =>   Modern bright hotel The hotel is right by the Tower of London and a great place to stay  especially if you plan to see this attraction  The nearest tube station is a couple of mintutes walk  amp  as it s on the District line other attractions are never far away  If you want to stretch your legs you are right by the Thames   It takes about       mins to walk by the river to the London Eye   as we discovered one night when the tube line was down  The hotel is lovely   very clean and modern  friendly staff  great rooms  We were upgraded on arrival  which is always a bonus too  I thoroughly recommend it but I cannot comment on the bar or restaurant as we did not use them   but they looked nice The Tower area is very quiet on a weekend  but there are some nice pubs near by  eg  quot The Hung  Drawn and Quartered quot    dont let the name put you off its a very friendly pub   and there are restaurants near by too  It was quiet  but had everything we needed and the tube makes everything else so near anyway in London Eg of a perfect weeekend in London   Arrive Friday  check in to your nice  Apex  Hotel  then head to Covent Garden for dinner and a show  Saturday  do the Tower of London  Make sure you do the Yeoman tour  as they are full of knowledge and jokes   then after go to the pub for a great British footie match and a few pints with the locals  then onwards for a curry  Tempted  I would definately stay here again and think the value for money was excellent  
P =>   Excellent value for money Stayed for just one night in transit at this hotel and was suitably impressed  Rooms are not huge but a good size and incredibly clean and tidy  Staff were friendly and helpful  All in all  a great experience and considering some of the other options in London  this was excellent value for the price  
P =>   Great getaway weekend Booked this hotel for a Theatre weekend for myself and my partner and also for a ruby wedding anniversary present for my parents  We had previuosly stayed at the Apex City Hotel in Edinburgh and on the strength of that stay which was excellent decided to stay here  It didn t disappoint  Room was large and very comfortable and included a sofa in front of the tv which made a change from sitting on the bed to watch TV  Excellent large powerful showers and nice accessories  The Rubber duck is a nice touch  our Edinburgh duck has a little friend now View out of the window wasn t great     overlooked the office block at the back but i wasn t there to gawp out the window so it wasn t a big deal One small criticism         was looking forward to a couple of nice cold pints of lager after coming in from the theatre but they d only gone and ran out    All in all a great stay and thoroughly recommended  
P =>   A perfect stay at this gem of a hotel  A  Service  There is no doubt that the Apex City of London hotel is one of the nicest hotels I have stayed in  It s small enough to feel personal and  boutiquey  but large enough to provide you with all the luxury extras you could hope for  From the moment we checked in   greeted by smiling staff  I knew it was going to be great  We were treated wonderfully by reception staff  even getting upgraded to a lovely deluxe room  The room itself was gorgeous   big  airy and spacious  It had everything you could possibly need for a few nights away  bathrobes  lovely smelling toiletries  mineral water and snacks  CD player DVD TV  squishy sofa with magazines and newspapers and a wonderfully large comfy bed   We had the room service breakfast on our last morning   they had such a wide range of delicious things  it was hard to choose what to have  It arrived exactly when we had specified and was really fresh and tasty  We also had cocktails in the bar one evening  which was lovely   an extensive list and again  friendly helpful bar attender  Being a musical addict  I stay in London quite regularly and have never come across a hotel as good as the Apex   especially at such a good rate  It is worth every penny  As we stayed on a weekend where the underground service was really poor  half the stations closed   we had every reason to be grumpy   but the second we walked through the door of the hotel we were reminded that there was at least one great element to our trip   I will absolutely be staying in this hotel again on my next visit and encourage everyone else to do the same   
P =>   Unexpected surprise combination accommodation quality of service and food I have stayed at this hotel with my son during the weekend of   ust      The reviews were perfect already  This hotel is indeed truly perfect  The combination of the quality of the service  very kind  helpful and service minded staff make it worthwhile to return to this hotel  Very good tube connection   minutes from the hotel  And the quality of the breakfast dinner room service is very good Will definitely stay here again and recommend the hotel to others  
P =>   Style and class at the Apex Check out the Apex  Reasonably priced within a very short distance of Tower Hill tube and Tower Bridge  The hotel is modern and classy and the rooms fantastic  Great thought has been given to customer comfort and the staff are really friendly  Definitely a hit with us and well worth a visit  
P =>   Excellent hotel Stayed here with my wife for a weekend and we were very happy with what we found  i booked based on reviews here and found it to exceed my expectations  My expectations for a hotel are receptive staff  efficiency at reception  and a good nights sleep  All these were met but the room was far better than the price suggests  the service was generally above the level that i would have expected and the location was great I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends or family  I will stay here again if in London  
P =>  Brilliant ExcellentWe first saw this hotel in Edinburgh and heard good things about it  so wanted to try the one in London  Checking in was simple  they looked after our bags until our room was ready  The first room was by the lift which has a loud speaking floor announcer in it  so best to avoid rooms near the lifts We were moved to a better  quieter room with no fuss  We had a back room with no special view but you get the traffic noise if you have one at the front The room was clean and well decorated  and even had a fridge  Very useful in the very hot weather we had that day  The air con was good too  essential in the heat of y in London  There is a separate shower and a bath  There weren t enough hanging rails for the towels tho  The duck is lovely addition and you can take it with you as a souvenir We had an evening meal in the hotel and it was excellent  Good choice of wines and cocktails Breakfast was lovely  had all the continental variety you would expect  For anyone who wanted to have a full breakfast  they had a Scottish  Braveheart  breakfast including haggis Highly recommended for anyone wanting good value and style in the City of London  
P =>  A gem in a sea of mediocrity Finding fault with this hotel is really in the realm of the picky  The bathroom was silly  with the lighting only illuminating half your face  and no towel rails handy for the shower  The window is see through as well   draw the blind unless you really want to entertain the builders and office workers outside  Wardrobe space is tight for two   the ironing board fills up half of it  The phones fall apart when you try to use them  all the usual  quot Philip Stark  eat your heart out quot  stuff that we don t need and will be passe in a year  For the rest  the staff are exceptional  the food is terrific  the location is unmatched  pop in the church next door and say hello to Sam Pepys  and it is spotlessly clean   i e  it pressed all my buttons  Pricey during the week  although you can enjoy eavesdropping on City bankers worrying about their jobs  but a steal at the weekend  In this part of town  it s really a toss up between the Swissotel and the Apex  but the Swissotel is in desperate need of an upgrade so the Apex is a clear winner  despite the Swissotel river views  
P =>   Another great stay  We stayed here for two nights on a weekend package that included continental breakfast  We arrived early to ask if we could store our bags but were told that a room was available for us and that we d been upgraded  We were also given two drinks vouchers for the hotel bar The room was great   very clean  larger than a standard room with a sofa  huge comfy bed  bathrobes and slippers and a lovely bathroom with a deep bath and separate walk in shower  Toiletries are very good quality   they smell nice and are in decent sized bottles Breakfast was good   continental breakfast is a help yourself buffet with cereals  yoghurt  fresh fruit  bread and pastries  meats and cheese so there s plenty to fill you up  Tea  coffee and toast is served at your table and we found the waiting staff to be friendly and helpful There s free wireless Internet in the hotel although the signal was a bit weak in our room  There was a cable for Internet access though  and that worked fine We were able to leave our bags in the hotel s storage area when we checked out  which is really helpful This was the second time we ve stayed at the Apex and both visits have been enjoyable  It s my favourite London hotel by far  
P =>   Excellent value around the corner from the Tower of London The Apex City of London is a find  just a few minutes walk to Tower Bridge tube station  Tower Pier  and the Tower of London  Our rooms were spacious  spotless  and beautifully decorated  Staff were gracious and helpful  Excellent value  
P =>   Great Location   generally good hotel Stayed in the hotel for two nights  The location is excellent  offering greta views of Tower Bridge but also very handy to the Tube  Hotel is clean with modern decoration  Our room was good  although a little on the small side and we were overlooking the back of an offoce block  Shower was massive  although the room was lacking the little extras that make a good hotel a very good hotel  Breakfast was good Overall a good hotel  although I have stayed in better in London for around the same price  
P =>   Excellent Boutique Hotel Excellent Hotel with very friendly and helpful staff  the rooms were excellent  large  modern and extremely cleanwith everything that you could wish for Excellent Location  perfect for strolls down the embankment  try to find the More London address by the mayors office for excellent night time views of Tower Bridge Highly recommended will stay there again and you get a free rubber Duck     
P =>   Faultless Friendly helpful staff  a nice room  excellent breakfast and a very good price   this is a great London hotel Location is a tad out of the way  but excellence of everything else made up for it  Tower Hill tube is a couple of minutes walk away anyway  and maximum half an hour by taxi gets you to the West End Reception staff and concierge were all exceptionally charming and well informed  Room was of reasonable size  bed was huge and very comfortable  Bathroom very nice  decent shower  nice upscale toiletries and liked the free bath duck  or clean and modern Will definitely be back  
P =>   Great Hotel Great hotel  Large room with    quot  flat sceen TV  love seat and a king size bed  Large bathroom with large tub and a shower big enough for a few friends  Room is modern and VERY  VERY clean If you use the provided robe and slippers  you ll get a clean one the next day  The bed linen was replaced every day  The staff is very quick to meet your needs The hotel is near the Tower of London and does require a ride on the Tube or a bus to get to central London but with an all day ticket is no problem  Both the tube and the bus are a short walk from the hotel as is the Fenchurch railway station I would recommend this hotel to everyone except those with small children  
P =>   Lovely hotel in good location This was a lovely hotel located very close to a tube station  It was ideal for visiting the tower of london and there were a few places to eat nearby  It was quiet and peaceful  The toiletries were good and there were free rental DVD s  
P =>   Great hotel for a budget traveler When I booked this hotel  it was    on tripadvisor   not sure why it s dropped to     This hotel is mainly suited for the business traveler which is why it s located in the business district  My husband and I went to London for a weekend getaway  and loved the hotel  We stayed in a basic room for around    pounds per night  The room itself was small  but the bed was a King  and we had room to walk around  There is a flat screen t v  on the wall with a dvd player  but remember it only plays the UK region  We happened to have a U S  movie and it didn t work  The bathroom is HUGE for European standards  What impressed me the most  and I know this is probably insignificant to most readers  is that they had shampoo AND conditioner  All other countries only give you shampoo  which is frustrating when you don t want to pack your own products for weekend trips  The design of the room is incredibly nice for the price and this hotel could probably charge a lot more and still get as many reservations The hotel is also next to the Tower Hill tube stop  This was great for the first day  but the city closed the Circle and District lines for the rest of the weekend  This was very upsetting because we had to walk    minutes to the next station and after walking around the city all weekend  the last thing you want to do is walk    minutes to a tube stop  Of course we were stubborn and did not take a taxi    we were using Dollars  So check with transportation before booking a hotel next to a tube stop if you plan to take the tube most of your stay  Apparently they close several major lines frequently on the weekends for work Summary  If you want to stay in a nice  trendy hotel and not spend over     pounds per night  this is the place for you  
P =>  Very nice but not for families We stayed at the Apex for one night  had a flight out of Gatwick the next morning   This hotel caters to business travelers primarily and is in near a business district  However  you can walk to the Tower of London and London Bridge from the hotel  As it caters to business clientele  the hotel is very well kept  However  I would not recommend the hotel for families on extended stays  As you walk through the hallways  it is eerily quiet and you could imagine the business folks locked in their rooms busy at work  So  we tried to keep our little ones quiet  BUT  the room was immaculate  We had a king sized bed  love seat  bathroom with tub and huge shower stall and a business desk  The room was quite large by European standards and the rate was just over     GBP night  So  for one night  it was a great deal and we thoroughly enjoyed the spaciousness of the room as it was our last night in London and an    hour Transatlantic flight awaited us the next day  Therefore  it was nice to be able to spread out a bit  When staying in hotels  cleanliness is near the top of my list and the APEX did not disappoint  As I said  it is just not suited for families  
P =>  A fantastic stay in the APEX     My partner and I stayed in the Apex in the City hotel for the weekend and very much enjoyed the experience The hotel staff were extremely efficient and professional and we were able to check in quickly and easily  We were lucky enough to have an upgraded room for our stay  the room was extremely spacious with very clean and modern decor  Luxury toilettries were provided in the bathroom   along with the complimentary APEX rubber duck  We were also given a voucher to claim a free cocktail in the hotel bar that evening   a nice welcoming touch The hotel is perfectly located by Tower Bridge and   mins walk from Tower Hill tube station  At night you can walk     mins  to St Katherine s Docks for bars and restaurants  some of which are open for breakfast if it is not included in your rate I will definitely stay at this hotel again and wouldn t hesitate to recommend it  
P =>  great hotel I stayed at the apex hotel for only one night but wished that it had been longer The room was on the  th floor and had a great view taking in landmarks such as the tower of london  tower bridge and the swiss re tower  The room itself was fantastic  immaculate  modern and chic  It consisted of a bathroom  living room area  bedroom and veranda  The rooms were spacious  unlike many other hotel rooms i ve been in  and stocked with everything i needed to enjoy my stay  The staff were great and very helpful  I especially liked the complimentary cocktails on arrival  they were delicious   I have already recommended this hotel to my friends and would definately keep apex in mind for any future trips  
P =>  Loved the Apex City Of London Hotel Booked the Apex City of London Hotel for   nights based on the reviews on Tripadvisor  I was not disappointed  This is the nicest hotel I ve stayed in in London to date  The best points of this hotel are the staff  the rooms and the proximity to the tube station  The staff in this hotel were more than helpfull with all our requests I will be staying here again  
P =>  luv a duck On arriving at the apex city of london at       am on friday   th june thinking we could leave our luggage before the   oclock check in time in the hotel and come back later  we went to the reception  we where greeted with a big smile from the staff and asked our names and was told our room was ready to go in to wow what service  On entering our room on the second floor we gasped at the size of the bed  all the facilities you would need on your stay was in there  nice flat lcd tv on wall dvd player on glass shelf alarm clock radio on entering the bathroom nice power shower and separate bath what i thought was a light dimmer switch on the wall was in fact a volume control for the sound for the tv for whatever channel you where happening to be watching   you are catered for every eventuality in your room  oh yes the duck was in the bathroom  breakfast was excellent nothing too much trouble for the staff on your beck and call for anything you need  well it is exactly what it says on the tin you will not be dissapointed with this hotel we will be back fully recomended to all our friends  short walk for underground tower hill  very quiet over the weekend not a soul about   Mr amp Mrs Oldfield 
P =>   Once again amzing This is our second stay within the year  This time for a special occasion and we bought along    other people with us  aged from mid tenties to lat sixties  Everyone member of our group had a wonderful time and loved the hotel  The location is one of the best  a short walk and you are on the river  in the other direction it s less than five minutes to the tube and a short journey into the centre of town The rooms maybe on the small side  but they are perfectly formed and I still swear they have the best hotel bathrooms ever The staff are all of the highest standard and make you feel like a true guest without fake smiles and non of the fake chit chat that some hotels train their staff to speak I can t wait to stay again and I would recomend this hotel to everyone  
P =>   Reeeealy nice rooms This was the nicest hotel room i ve stayed in for a while  The location is quite decent as well  
P =>   Great hotel in the city My partner and I stayed at the Apex on Saturday   st e for   night  paying      for a superior king room We checked in at     pm and were quickly and efficiently assigned room     on the  th floor  Check in was super efficient and friendly The room itself was extremely nice  with good quality linens  gourmet coffee  big tv and dvd player  fridge  air con etc  The quality of the fixtures fittings were excellent The bathroom was pretty special  A huge  spottlessly clean bath with a complimentary rubber duck was waiting  along with some good quality toiletries which were massive in size  There was also a large seperate walk in shower which was excellent  This hotel really excells in its attention to detail  Surround sound in the bathroom which meant you could listen to the tv  heated mirror which prevented the glass from steaming up etc  really sets this hotel apart from many of the others I have stayed in London  especially in the city area I absolutely loved that local calls were free from your room  as well as a huge selection of dvds from reception which could be borrowed for a small returnable deposit Staff were excellent  efficient and friendly  especially the reception staff Perhaps my only one negative comment would be that we had went downstairs to the bar for a quiet drink but found a football match playing on the tv  I can only assume that since the bar area was quiet  the football match was for the benefit of the bar staff That aside  our stay was fabulous and I am looking forward to staying there again  It would definitely be my number   choice and would recommend to my family and friends in an instant Well done Apex hotel and its staff   
P =>   Very nice Apex Stayed at Apex for   nights in uary       and on the overall  we had a very good stay Location is good though not central  but tube is only   min  walk away and will bring you anywhere you need  Tower of London also   min  away  and the City is worth a visit for both contemporary architecture and old neighbourhood lovers The positives are the staff  always very friendly  Hotel is very contemporary chic  sleek design  although not cold  We had a Deluxe room on the corner of the building with   windows on   walls overlooking the City   th floor      Lovely view at night   Room very spacious  king size bed  sofa  coffee table  big closets  desk area  nice decoration items   bathroom also big  tub  separate walk in shower   Much more space than what you usually get in London for that price  it really had a little  quot my own studio quot  feeling attached to it  All amenities such as kettle  tea  coffee  iron  ironing board  very nice closets with lots of shelves  hangers  drawers  nice toiletries and lovely Apex rubber duck in the bathroom  TV and DVD player  nice selection of DVD s avaialble for free at the reception  The big plus  the small fridge in the room  Not a minibar  a fridge  empty  where you can store your wine and food from M amp S to have it at hand for a cosy aperitif after a long day before hitting the town again  On a less positive note  the cleaning  though OK on the overall  was not perfect  dust on all frames  on the bedside lamps    nothing dirty  but giving it an odd impression for a   star     Also we could hear a lot of noise from water running even in the middle of the night      the airco system was also quite noisy and always blew cold  even if you put it on          Cannot comment on bar  restaurant or room service as we always ate outside or brought everything back with us from M amp S    minutes walk  So all in all  I definitely recommend Apex for the room space  the nice decor  the real  quot chic quot  atmosphere and elegant feeling of it  
P =>   Fantastic Hotel We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the Apex  The rooms were spotless and larger than the average London hotel  Staff were very friendly and the food was delicious  I am already looking forward to returning  
P =>   Loved the Apex This hotel is very modern and stylish  has everything you could want for a luxurious stay The bath is enormous as is the walk in shower and the complimentary toiletries  bathrobes and slippers just topped it all off The beds are very comfortable with crisp white sheets Nothing was too much trouble for the staff and we found everyone to be very helpful On the downside the hotel is not in the best situation for a weekend away as the majority of what is around about it at the weekend closes as it is mostly used by the business men and women during the week However Tower hill tube station is a   minute walk so everything is accessible and the Original Tour bookings are across the road as is the bus stop for it We did have a lovely meal at the tapas restaurant across from the Tower of london which is about a   minute walk from the hotel  would highly recommend Would not reccommend the Wetherspoons  which is right around the corner  for anything other than a drink  
P =>   Smashin hotel great location Stayed here for two nights and it was an absolute pleasure  The hotel is located only   minutes from Tower Hill tube station making it very easy to get around London The rooms were nicely decorated  modern  with a great shower and lovely toiletries  Even had a cute rubber duck The bed was nice and comfy and the air conditioning meant a good nights sleep even though it was really mild Some nice bars and restaurants nearby too Only problem we had was finding something to eat after coming back from the foo fighters gig   everything shut by midnight  
P =>  Couldn t ask for more        Excellent value  at London prices  for a luxury stay  Initially disappointed having failed to barter a full English breakfast into the price of saying but couldn t have been more impressed with the quality  service and above all else  the continental breakfast included in the price  Awesome  
P =>  Great Hotel   We Loved It The Apex City is a good business hotel which we found perfect for a weekend in London  The City is quiet in the weekend  but the hotel is easily accessible by the Underground  The staff was very friendly and the room both comfortable and clean  All in all a very nice stay  and we will surely come to this hotel for our next visit to London  
P =>  Great staff and location Excellent hotel in a quite location beside Tower Hill Tube Station The staff were very pleasant and helpful and in particular the dining room staff  The accomadation was clean  modern and bright  Eating here was a delight  I would recommend this hotel to any tourist visiting London for it s ease of access to London s underground and The Tower of London 
P =>  Clean bright and modern Checking in was great  room ready early  Room very nice and clean with lovely toiletries  although it has to be said that we were much too hot despite using air conditioning  Bed comfortable  nice crisp  white bedding  Staff very helpful and friendly  especially young chap at reception who gave us maps and directions  could not have been more helpful We had choice of cooked and continental breakfast  Good choice of fruits  breads  meats  fish  juices  I am a vegetarian and on first day asked for vegetarian breakfast which when arrived  consisted of tomato  one mushroom    tablespoons baked beans and very small potato cake  This was just normal breakfast without meat but a minute portion  Think they could have given me few more mushrooms and tomatoes and beans to compensate  not very veggie friendly  On second day  waiter got very confused by veggie breakfast and offered us a pancake  which we accepted  Unfortunately when it arrived it was covered with bacon so waiter removed bacon but was unable to remove bacon fat so unable to eat pancake    Very nice hotel with very nice staff  lovely clean and fresh but combined with theatre tickets  was in a package  was very costly and room looked right at a brick wall  Would have expected better view for the money Little bit more difficult to get around from this location than  say  if you were staying at Covent Garden or Oxford Street and this wasnt helped by the fact that there was severe disruption on circle line on the saturday night and on the sunday some stations and lines disrupted because of engineering works  although this was not the fault of the hotel   Just look at map to see if this location suits your needs  
P =>  Lovely Hotel with a few downs  I was really impressed with this hotel when I arrived  Check in was quick and friendly  amp  all the hotel staff are extremely helpful  The rooms were nice   quite spacious and very clean  but they were ridiculously hot  We had two rooms and both of them were unbearably hot  There was air conditioning but it didn t seem to do much The bathrooms were very nice   but beware of the shower heads   they re not very secure and the force of the water pushed mine out of the wall and almost hit me   they re big metal baton like things    On the first day  breakfast was delicious  All sorts of fruit and yoghurt  meats and fish  buns  bread  croissants  pastries  cereal and a cooked breakfast option    of our party are vegetarians so ordering a cooked breakfast with no meat was fine  However on the  nd day  too much of a fuss was made about having breakfast with no meat and the guy offered us pancakes instead because it seemed too much of an effort for him to order us   vegi breakfasts When our pancakes arrived  they were stacked high with bacon  so naturally  I said we don t eat bacon that s why we have pancakes   so  they took the pancakes  scraped the bacon off and returned them to us  covered in bacon fat  The hotel is situated very near to Tower Hill station which is fine  We went to London to see the Lion King and Hairspray and found it OK getting to the theatres  but it was a bit tricky getting back Fantastic London hotel  with just a few mishaps  
P =>   Pefect Hotel staff and rooms The Apex hotel was warm  friendly and modern  This was my first trip to London and the first hotel in my stop  How I wished it was the only one I stayed in  When I arrived  the staff was friendly and helpful  When I went up to my room  it was lovely and clean  Once I figured out how to turn on the lights  use your hotel room key in the slot  my stay was great  The location is prime  Walking distance to the Tower of London  the Tower bridge and St Paul s Cathedral  The staff was always ready to help and VERY giving  The Hotel s restaurant was nice and the staff just as nice  I can not say enough good things about this hotel  It is on the pricey side  but it was worth it  Nice  quiet location and you could access London via The Tower Bridge dock  buses and tube  When I got to my next hotel  I thought I left something at the Apex hotel and emailed straight away  The manger  Yousif Al Wagga  sent me a response promptly and by then I found the item  Do not hesitate to book here  Thank you to the Apex staff for making my stay a very memorable one  
P =>   Great boutique hotel quiet location As a regular visitor to London I ve had the misfortune to stay at the Tower Hotel and the Radisson West End   both depressingly dated  However I had the fortune to stumble upon the Apex hotel and have now stayed here several times in the last year or so It s located in the east of the city  close to Fenchurch Street Station but on a beautiful and quiet square  No through traffic and no noisy pubs  clubs or clientele  Close also to the Tower of London and Tower Hill station Its relatively small  and new  The rooms that I ve stayed in have been very modern with a small lounge area with a desk  tv  and dvd player  Large beds  a second tv and plenty of wardrobe space  Bathrooms are clean  modern and a good size   all have had a bath as well as a shower  There are the usual nice touches     bottles of water each night  bed and room prepared each evening  towels  slippers and dressing gowns left out  I ordered room service twice and both times it was excellent  Breakfast was fine  if a little pricey   then again this is London There is usually a gym  very small  but this has been out of order for a couple of months as its being refurbished   and hopefully made bigger  They do give you complimentary membership of the local Virgin Gym though  which was close by and excellent  The staff appear to be mostly eastern european  whcih can cause a wee problem from time to time   my scottish accent wasn t always understood   However they were  without exception fantastic   friendly and helpful  The only downside is the price       a night  then vat of     on top  made it an expensive stay for   nights  However  it is London  it s a great location and an excellent hotel  Worth paying the extra  
P =>   Great Stay at London Apex Hotel Great Price for Value We stayed at the Apex Hotel during the Pentecost Week End and really enjoyed it   We unfortunately landed in London Luton and it took us  h to get there   we used a very nice taxi company called ladycabs and negotiated the price for both ways   but we arrived safe and sound  The reception was very helpful at checkin and had our luggage stored while we started visiting the surroundings  The room was large and very comfy and had a very nice and large en suite bathroom  We had view on the back so it was really quiet  There is a large buffet at breakfast with differents breads and viennoiseries  delicious fresh fruit  ham  eggs  cheese    I asked for margarine  but apparently they do not have it   the name of margarine in England is called Flora  fyi  We had one dinner at their restaurant  The service is very nice and the food very good   but it s pricey    At the brasserie  they serve more simple food  and for a good price for the quality  Overall  I would recommend the Apex hotel for its great location next to the London Tower and close to the tube  the good price   quality range and the service  However  I will definitely have a close look at my CreditCard Detailed account   see review below      just in case   
P =>   As good as the reviews Perfect location for the Tower of London  although a tube ride to other main attractions if you are seeing the sights Hotel was modern  trendy  clean and spacious  Staff and general service were excellent Continental breakfast was really good quality with lots of choice Lots of nice touches that made this a special stay 
P =>   great all round Stayed one night at hotel and could not fault it at all  All the staff on reception were very courteous and helpful  The room was great with nice facilities and was brilliant to stilll be able to book a smoking room in these health concious days  Would use again def  
P =>   Beware theives I really enjoyed my stay at the hotel  and thought the room and breakfast were excellent  Considering the location  I thought it was good value for money as well  However  there was a problem  On booking in  the receptionist insisted on taking my credit card details  even though everything had already been paid for  When I looked at my next statement  I found that somebody had used these details that very evening to purchase two lots of jewellery on line  As this also required the   digit security number  the only person in a position to do this was the girl on reception  My bank refunded the money  and I wrote to the head of security at the hotel  His response was completely dismissive  simply saying the hotel was not responsible  and that I should take this up with my credit card company  There was no interest in identifying who was responsible  which we could have done easily by checking the rota and ascertaining the delivery address for the jewellery  This would put me off staying there again  
P =>   As good as the reviews We used TripAdvisor to help us find a hotel for one evening  I am pleased to say that the hotel lived up to expectations  The hotel is very conveniently located near to the Tower Hill tube station and is in nice quiet location with some bars and restaurants nearby Customer service was excellent  as was the room itself  Much larger room than other hotels I have stayed at for more money in London  There was a sofa in the room in front of the TV where there was a DVD player with a choice of free DVDs from reception  In room amenities were excellent We also chose to have room service for breakfast which was delivered on time by a helpful member of staff I would thoroughly recommend this hotel and will be staying again on our next trip  
P =>  A  for APEX    We have stayed in some  what are decribed as       star hotels  over the years in London and can honestly say NOT ONE has come anywhere close to the quality of this hotel  Ok the location isn t the best if you are looking for plenty of night life  especially at the weekends  but it is the City after all     Asides that it is PERFECTION     The staff a very friendly  the rooms are loveley  The bathrooms are modern and clean  Personally I am not going to waste my time looking through website after website at different London hotels in the future     I am going to book the Apex time and time again  Trust me      you WILL NOT regret it       Go on book it   you know you want to  
P =>   Fab hotel  My partner and I stayed in this hotel on a Saturday night and it was one of the nicest hotels I have stayed at  We got there at noon and were allowed to check in straight away although we were probably a couple of hours early and we were even upgraded to a superior room which was lovely and unexpected It was tastefully decorated  very clean and contemporary  The bed was extremely comfortable  one of the comfiest beds I have ever slept in  The bathroom was fabulous with a double ended bath and a walk in shower  both of which I would recommend using  There were nice toiletries and a cute little duck in the bath  You also have an iron  ironing board and a hairdryer in the room which is very handy We tried out the hotel bar in the evening  which was great  the staff provided excellent service  I can t comment on the restaurant food as we didn t go but you are given a     discount voucher to eat there when you check in and if the breakfast is anything to go by I m sure the restaurant is great We booked through Travel Republic and got a great deal on the hotel which included continental breakfast  it was simply one of the best breakfasts I have had at a hotel  I can t comment on the cooked breakfast obviously but suffice to say you wouldn t go hungry with the continental one  The staff were very attentive and you could choose from croissants  pain au chocolat  bread  cheese   ham   salami   smoked salmon  fruit  cereal and youghurts  Was delicious When we checked out we were allowed to leave our bags whilst we wandered round London before we had to head back home One thing to note is that it is not right in the hustle and bustle of London so there weren t too many bars open round that area as it s more of a week day trade  but there is a Weatherspoons nearby and the Tower Hill tube stop is   mins walk away and you can easily walk over Tower Bridge to get to the other side and have drinks on the River Thames  I was also very impressed with the contact after our stay  I filled out a feedback card and was sent an email the following day from the Manager thanking me for my feedback and asked whether I had any other comments to make All in all a fabulous stay and my partner has even said he d bring his mum to stay here  We will definitely stay there again if we visit London  
P =>  Apexcellent  My partner and I had one of our best hotel stays ever  anyhwere at this hotel  and we ve stayed in   star in Dubai and Sydney with much less  We booked the room via the hotel website and by the looks of the website  the stay was something to look forward to   and we were not disappointed  Friendly staff  great location  and a wonderful room for such a fantastic price  Added to that  we had the best sleeps we ve ever had in a hotel  perhaps we can get the brand name of the mattress    Despite the hotel being in the City  the quietness of the area at the weekend was a welcome change from the hustle and bustle of Oxford Street and we could walk around to admire some of the great buildings in the area  Getting a bite to eat was not a problem and getting to and from different places couldn t have been easier with Tower Hill and Monument tube stations nearby  Will be telling our friends about this great find and will definitely be looking to book this hotel for our next stay in London  
P => loved this hotel this hotel is a gem in London  great group of staff  who were very friendly and were sincerely attentive to all our needs  the room was clean  sleek and cool modern with great bath and fabulous toiletries  well thought out design to incorporate alot of extras  The location is block off the tube and Tower of London so easy to get around  really a great place to stay  
P => Lovely hotel great value Just home from a   night stay in the Apex   excellent   Well appointed room  with a really comfy bed  amp  pillows  Proper  sensible hangers that you can take out of the wardrobe in their entirety  rather than those daft ones where you leave the metal bit behind  Good shower with plenty of  quot oomph quot   and some lovely toiletries  all in    ml bottles  which were replaced every day  so will keep us supplied for ages    Also a nice big bath  Complimentary paper  Independent  every morning We didn t eat in the hotel  but did have a drink in the bar  which was quiet  but the service was good Slight issue on check in   reception couldn t find our reservation  but they gave us a complimentary drink while they sorted it out  and were very apologetic  so it wasn t a problem Quiet location  but only a couple of minutes walk from Tower Hill underground  Will definitely use the hotel again  and will be recommending it to anyone who ll listen   
P => Amazing Apex Stayed at the Apex for just one night  Was excellent value for money  plus we got upgraded on arrival  Our room was much larger than expected  Very nicely decorated  all very sleek and modern  Lots of nice touches like toiletries  big selection of tea coffee  free dvd rental  rubber duck  Very clean and new looking  The service was brilliant  I can t fault it  Will definitely be going back again soon  
P =>   Great hotel  We stayed here for the London marathon in il  The room and bathroom were great  Only problem was you couldn t see the tv from the bed because it was in a big cabinet facing a little sofa but some people might like this  The or was perhaps a little gloomy  not as bright and airy as the novotel The kids in the other room had a  quot normal quot  arrangement  The TV itself looks a bit dated  a big old flat screen as opposed to the LCD in the otel round the corner       including full breakfast Staff were great  breakfast was really good tower bridge and the tower are a short walk away In a really quiet street  had a really good sleep We loved this hotel  we tried to book again for the next week but it was full  
P =>    nd time even better  My second review of the Apex and I can say that things have probably got even better since my last visit Check in was swift  Sunday night  I found my room was large and clean and everything worked fine In the past I commented on the price of the wireless internet  now it is included in the price of your room rate   excellent news The bar has   draught beer and it couldn t really choose a better one Pilsner Urquell   ahhh I sampled room service on   occasions  both times delivery was swift and food of excellent quality Staff are friendly and helpfull  I was greeted everytime I can through the front doors I cannot fault this hotel at all if you re staying in the City area of London I will certainly stay here again  only wish I could affiord to use it with my other half as a leisure hotel rather than a business expensed trip     
P =>   a good clean hotel Stayed for a weekend  A good hotel and would stay there again  staff were friendly and helpful  and the room was clean  amp  well equiped  and the bed comfortable Situated about two minutes walk from Tower Hill underground station Did not eat in the hotel but had breakfast in weatherspoons just around the corner for a third of the price  
P =>   L  k no more just book here at the Apex City of London      recommended   We stay in London     times a year and have NEVER returned to any hotel  for one reason or another  We will look no more and only stay at the APEX CITY OF LONDON HOTEL now  Value for money   we had a lovely large and very clean room  tastefully decorated  beautiful clean bed  and super shower room   we found the staff very helpful from front of house to cleaners and they were all friendly   the location was great a stones throw from the Tower and tube station   close to good bars and resturants if you did want a change from the hotel   we felt very safe around the area   we cannot think of one thing that could have improved our stay at all  Thank you to all the staff  we can t wait to come back  oh and thank you for the duck I love him  We will recommend to all our family and friends  see you soon Mr  amp  Mrs JacksonCounty Durham 
P => 	stars for the price of   I stayed here for one night  needing a last minute hotel room after a conference  checking in late  I wish I had had more time here and will definitely return during my next visit to London  Room was immaculate and nicely furnished with lots of nice touches like a robe and bottled water  The bathroom was almost as big as the room   the separate tub and shower were great  along with the rubber duck   Hotel itself was very quiet My reservation included breakfast the next morning and the selection was wonderful with great service The Apex easily beat the      a night hotel I also stayed in during my time in London as far as service and extras My two minor complaints   when I checked in  the clerk did not explain that I needed to slip my key card into the slot for the room lights  it took me a few minutes of fumbling   Also I loved the toiletries provided  but they were too big to be included in a carry on bag  over    ml size   
P =>   Superb  Excellent hotel Great location just round the corner from the Tower of London  very close to   very nice bar restaurants and the hotel has a nice bar and restaurant of its own  Tower Hill tube is    m away and a stop for the regular and   hr no    bus service into the bright lights of the West End  via St Pauls  the Palace of Justice  Fleet Street and the Strand  is also just round the corner  Often  the no    will be that London classic  the Routemaster bus with its jump on jump off platform at the back Transport connections for the international travellers are within easy reach  The Circle Line tube for Victoria station  with its rail link to Gatwick Airport   Paddington  for Heathrow   Liverpool St  Stanstead  and St Pancras Eurostar plus the DLR  for London City airport  stops at Tower Hill Hotel itself  Our room was quite small with room for the bed and not much more but it was extremely comfortable and the bathroom is very nice with separate large shower Service is excellent with professional and friendly staff on reception and in the restaurant  One annoying point was the bar charged    service to our bill for two glasses of wine even though we were sat at the bar  Should have questioned it  and would have almost certainly got a refund  but I didn t  It s something for you to watch out for I only usually go to London for the weekend  the city as a whole just seems to get better with every trip    except for the prices   and this is where I ll stay from now on  Well  here or the New Dawn Hotel  Can t decide  Too close to call  
P =>   Apex City   Brilliant Hotel I had only read good reviews about this hotel and we weren t disappointed when we stayed  I was worried it would be too far out but it really isn t that far when travelling by tube but we took advantage of the location and explored Brick Lane on Saturday night and Spitalfields ket on Sunday which were both really interesting The staff at the hotel were very helpful and looked after our bags before we checked in and after we checked out  The room was very comfortable  it had everything we needed  even a proper ironing board and iron and it was stylish  All for     for a Saturday night  including breakfast booked via GTA hotels  I m looking forward to staying there again  
P =>   Great hotel Great hotel  great location  Everything you could possibly want for in your room   proper decent hair dryer  iron and ironing board  well located plug sockets  FREE WIFI  complimentary newspaper  excellent tv channel selection  good amount of towels and bathroom products  complimentary water and above all friendly and efficient staff  Have even just had an email from the manager thanking me for bothering to fill in the satisfaction questionnaire in the room and asking if there was anything that i felt was missing during our stay I stay in a good number of hotels and am pretty hard to impress  i shall be making the Apex my regular London hotel from now on  
P =>   Wonderful stay From the moment we walked into the reception  the staff were very helpful and knowledgable and nothing was too much trouble  We were down for the marathon and everyone went the extra mile to ensure that we were looked after  The location is great for the tube and sightseeing  the rooms are very pleasant and there is a very laid back feel to the hotel There was nothing that I can find to say about the hotel other than the whole stay was absolutely top quality Would definately return  
P =>   Best London Hotel I booked this hotel last tember on the brilliant website Londontown com  We stayed   th ruary for   nights  I travel to London every spring with my cousin and this hotel is the best hotel I ever stayed in  Everything about the hotel was fantastic  every single member of staff where brilliant  We look forward to returning here next spring  
P =>   Clean modern and friendly Spent   nights in The Apex  I had forgotten to check the exact location before I left home   all I knew was the address and that we should alight at Tower Hill  However  after consulting the map at the station  the hotel was really easy to find and only a   minute walk  Arrived on Friday at about      am  Unfortunately  we could not check in yet but were able to leave bags with the concierge  The receptionist was not as friendly as expected  so this was a bit disappointing  The room was average size for a city hotel and was nice and bright  The bed was really big and really comfortable and the decor was modern but cosy  The bathroom had a bath and a separate walk in shower  Excellent toiletries and of course  the rubber duck  There was a full length mirror in the wardrobe and tea and coffee making facilities  There was complimentary sparkling and still water   a nice touch The breakfast was excellent  We did get a cooked breakfast on the first morning  but the continental  which was included  was sufficient  The staff in the restaurant were very professional and very friendly   especially the maitre d   The bar area is very comfortable and relaxing and has a great cocktail menu  We did not dine in the hotel but did get room service which was excellent On check out  the receptionist was much more friendly and so  I would judge the hotel on her rather than the previous one The hotel is in the City  so therefore it does have a business feel and alot of restaurants and bars are closed at the weekend  but you can easily hop on the tube or a bus and go wherever you like and it is not too far to walk to St Paul s Cathedral which has alot of restaurants opposite  Next time I am in London  I will definitely stay in The Apex and would consider her sister hotel whenever I am in Edinburgh as a result of this stay  
P =>   Quiet London   Star It is unusual to find a quiet   star hotel in London  the Apex is an exception  A   minute walk to Tower Hill tube station  buy an Oyster card   it is worth it  or       minutes to Tower Bridge and the Thames walkway  The hotel is a modern converted office building in the City which I suggest is aimed at the businessman but great for a weekend break  The rooms are comfortable with tea coffee making facilities  DVD player  if you really want to stay in your room to watch one   in room safe and other necessities  There is a superb walk in shower as well as bath in the bathroom and lovely toiletries  The few criticisms were that I found the flush for the toilet difficult to push and there was no magnifying mirror in the bathroom or full length mirror  The continental breakfast was excellent  Fresh fruit  ham  cheese  yoghurt  smoked salmon  selection of breads and cereals and nice toast  Even the coffee was good  Another    would have got us a cooked breakfast which looked good but we didn t need  The staff were pleasant and helpful   a broken hairdryer was replaced very quickly  All in all a pleasant place to stay and a good substitute for the Guoman Tower Hotel where we used to stay  
P =>  Exceptional stay We have stayed in this hotel   days for a romantic stay in London Our experience was fantastic  Everything from the lobby to the room was perfect  The receptionist and all the staff are gentle  friendly and professional  The room are calm  warm  comfortable and nicely decorated  The breakfast is tasty and includes fresh foods  fruits  bread      of quality  The hotel is close to transportation  tourist spots and restaurants while a bit off center I would definitely recommend this hotel and would enjoy stay there again  Finally  the price  Internet rates  are very fair  
P =>  Fantastic London Hotel I stayed in the Apex for a weekend and I can t fault the hotel  Given the cost and small rooms in most London hotels  the Apex was a pleasant surprise  The hotel is very modern and had everything you would need  It is located   minutes away from Tower Bridge  The breakfasts were simple and the service was also excellent  The rooms  while small were modern and clean In light of the relatively low cost of the rooms  I would recommend this hotel for weekend visitors  Our only problem was finding the hotel as it is tucked away  That said  it s close to tube stations  bars and restaurants  
P =>  As usual a very pleasant stay  I ve stayed   times now in the Apex City hotel  London and will go back again for sure  no mice at all I got to the hotel at   pm and asked if I could leave my bags to check in later  but the friendly staff member said if a room was available that I could check in straight away  Following morning  went to take a shower and only had   bath towel  so called down to get another  Only when I went to get the hairdryer after  realised there were spare towels in the press    should have checked first Staff are always friendly in this hotel  from check in to check out  room service  bar  concierge  etcLocation is great  Turn left and Fenchurch St station is a few minutes walk  and turn right and you are at  Tower Hill tube  or Tower Gateway DLROh  and for the  st time  I did some proper exploring down around St Katherine s Docks  It s beautiful here  and I highly recommend the tour of Tower Bridge 
P =>  A Great Find I needed to book a number of rooms in central London for family attending my brothers wedding  The location is fabulous  tucked away very close to Tower Bridge and the Tower of London Within walking distance are attractions  restaurants  bars and cafes I booked the weekend so enjoyed very good rates  about one third of the week night price  Hotel was modern  classy design with a funky chic ambience  Room was small  but other members of our group had spacious rooms  This wasn t a problem as we were out quite a lot  Widescreen TV and a fantastic bathroom with both bath and walk in shower  complimentary toiletries were nice as was the rubber duck Perfect for a city weekend break  Breakfast was typical London prices         continental and        for a fry up  so don t bother with that  a short walk and you will find what you need for a fiver I parked about   mins away in an underground carpark  Again weekend rates were good        for sunday  and about       per hour at other times All in all  highly recommended  
P =>  Deserves its ratings This is an excellent hotel and well deserving of the plaudits it has received from other reviewers  The staff were thoroughly professional and helpful  the rooms are well appointed and attractive and the hotel itself is in a good location It is in a business centre but there are plenty of historical sites of interest in the area  Transport to and from other parts of London was straightforward and there is the added bonus of the Thames Clipper which stops at the Tower Pier  just across the main road  
P =>   Apex is a great hotel We stayed at the Apex city of london  for just   night  However it was a great experience  We were allowed to check in two hours early and our room had been upgraded automatically  The room was spacious  clean and the king size bed was huge The staff were friendly and very helpful The hotel is situated very close to the tower of London and tower bridge  It is also   minutes walk from tower hill tube station  so is ideal for exploring central London On a slightly negative note  the surrounding area is very quiet at weekends  and there is a distinct lack of restaurants  although there are two pubs nearby which serve food  or you could take the tube into the west end We would definitely stay here again  
P =>  Thoroughly recommended     Stayed for one night in uary    as we were going to a concert in the O  and were planning to fly into London City Airport  A very quick and easy commute on the DLR from the airport into Tower Hill tube and a   minute walk took us to the Apex City hotel  Our party had   rooms and all were modern  beautiful  a great size and well appointed Was an ideal base for sightseeing as the next day we visited the Tower of London  which was just around the corner  and caught the  Original London Sighteeing Tour  bus to all of London s other major attractions Breakfast was perfect and great value  We also enjoyed very attentive service in reception on the night of the concert when we arrived back hungry and in need of some food  something which not all hotels respond well to at that time of night   A memorable and enjoyable stay and thoroughly recommended to all  Will definitely return  
P =>   Fall in love with Apex    From the moment you are greeted by the polite staff at the door  and at reception  with decor and detail in really good taste  plus a really good location  and a fabulous breakfast  you will simply love this hotel  Being a seasoned worldwide traveller  trust me  this is a gem    
P => 
P => Oasis in the heart of the City We were a bit worried about the comments on the site that the hotel was still a  building site  but these were completely dispelled when we arrived  The hotel was faultless from when we checked in to the moment we checked out We stayed for the weekend and yes the area is quiet in the evening but after staying in other parts of the Capital  this is a BIG plus  The hotel is only   minutes walk from Bank or Moorgate tube station so its easy to get into the west end for food and drink  The rooms are spacious and bathroom is huge with a fantastic shower  The Bose sound system for the iphone ipod was a great touch Interiors are very luxurious and we felt properly pampered  Staff were quick  efficient and friendly and gave us some really good advice on places to go  how to get there etc Definitely come back again  
P => Stunning Hotel excellent service  My Husband and I stayed at this hotel on the weekend for one night  We were very impressed with the Hotel  it was very modern and stunningly decorated  The room was really nice  one of the best weve stayed in  It has a huge bed and lovely chez long at the bottom of the bed  There was a huge flat screen tv on the wall  The bathroom was gorgeous with one of the biggest bath ive seen and a lovely walk in shower  The only down side I could see was there was no dressing gown  which would have been nice to use after having a bath but this is only a small point  There was also only enough coffee for one cup but I rang housekeeping and they brought us a box of extra milk and coffee extremely quickly The hotel is a little far out that we usually stay but it is only a short walk  less than   minutes  to moorgate tube station and we the staff also booked us a taxi for when we asked which was great Superb hotel  with friendly staff  We prefer to stay more central so but like i said it was easy to get to the tube from the hotel  
P => Another wonderful Apex hotel  We stayed at the new Apex just two weeks after its opening  It was fantastic  The room  I think we were upgraded to a superior  was spacious  beautifully decorated  warm  and welcoming  The bathroon was equally impressive  with a walk in shower and a huge bath  The service was also friendly and helpful  The hotel is in a slightly less glamorous location that the one at Tower Hill  set off in a side street near Moorgate  but it is easy to get to and from it  with three tube stations in easy walking distance and plenty of cabs on the main street  We will definitely be back  This chain is simply superb  
P =>   Stunning decor but not run to    level My partner and I visited this hotel for a relaxing weekend away for my Birthday Pros   This Hotel has lovely luxurious d cor and is well set out Rooms are very nice and well acquitted with a fab big bath and walk in shower  The staffs were very pleasant Nice quiet part of London City Cons   Hotel is still under construction which wasn t advertised so I wasn t pleased when I was woken at  am on a Saturday morning with drilling and banging Hotel is a bit out of the way but I didn t see this as a problem as we were happy to use the underground and there is a station along the road  Customer Care standards were not to a    standard Rooms weren t cleaned until the evening which in my opinion is useless as there were no fresh towel for freshening up before going out for our evening meal  While were staying the fire alarm went off early hours of Saturday morning so we got up and stood out on the street in out night clothes where there was no staff to be seen  We then went back in to find staff standing chatting at the reception and didn t bother to tell us what was going on or if we needed to be in or out the hotel  A total disaster and all guests were extremely angry with the way the situation was dealt with  I still have no idea what happened all we got was a letter outside our door saying sorry for any inconvenience  Not the standard of customer care you expect from a    hotel  
P =>   Very nice hotel though a little out of the way Superior King Room Pros  Very clean  modern and tidy rooms  Quiet location  TV with Freeview  Great bathroom with deep free standing bath and walk in shower  Good colleciton of free toiletries  Bar staff very helpful  All staff very friendlyCons  Only   chair to sit on  not counting the chaise lounge  so tricky if eating food in the room  Location is not easy if you use the tube  A bit  quot out of the way quot  for the west end etc  Saturday night  very few local places open near hotel  When booking direct online  watch out for the VAT which is not added until the very end  I thought I was paying one price but not until I clicked the last button did I get the final price with VAT  Is it me  be I am getting old  
P =>   Nice hotel shame about the value for money Stayed on the opening night  sadly we were not aware before hand  otherwise may have moved elsewhere  It wast a  soft  opening which was a shame  as we now had somewhat higher expectations especially for the money being paid Room service menu virtually non existent  phones in room didn t work  lots of dust and rubbish around  rooms numbers falling off walls by lifts didn t leave a good impression Otherwise its a great location  close for the city  although be very aware there are few eating options close by at the weekend  Rooms nice  plug access difficult  Free wi fi very good Reception staff were fab  really trying to make the place work  thanks to them we stayed our second night  
P =>   Beautiful hotel in a nice quiet part of EC London  I stayed here on the hotels opening weekend  nights of   th and   th   It s in extremely close proximity to Moorgate tube train station which is connected to all the most convenient transport lines in London  It s on the Northern line which means it s only    minutes down the line from London Euston and King s Cross St Pancras train stations  Also  Bank is   minutes walk in the opposite direction which is also on the DLR line   easy access to Canary Wharf and further east areas of London Now to the hotel  As you d expect from a brand new hotel  it s extremely well decorated   to a very high standard too Although it was obvious the hotel wasn t      completed  it didn t hinder ourselves or any of the guests we encountered during our stay  Everything was functional and the staff made sure they went out of their to ensure that no disruptions occurred I booked a Deluxe King room  sorry if the rest of the review is now obsolete   which was brilliant  I ve stayed in   star hotels that couldn t even scratch the quality of this room  detailed in the pictures I ve uploaded  In terms of bedroom quality  this hotel is by far the best bedroom I ve had to stay in  this side Dubai  The bed was extremely comfortable and we were provided with an abundance of pillows and cushions to increase our comfort levels further The room had two  yes           quot  flat screen tv s with freeview channels on both  We didn t spend that long in the room over the weekend to make good use of them unfortunately  Unfortunately  the blu ray player wasn t in the room even though the website said it should be there  This wasn t really a problem because as I said  we didn t spend enough time in the room to need it There were so many nice little touches too  Like a  quot Do Not Disturb quot  button  as opposed to the traditional handle sign   which actually worked   contrary to a lot of hotels with this function  The Bose iPod SoundDock was great for listening to music whilst dressing and has suprisingly good quality for such a small product  Your usual hotel amenities are included  such as your iron and board  safe  fridge  tea and coffee and a kettle  By default  the hotel don t stock your minibar  so if you require this service then ensure you tell them during check in Unfortunately I didn t use any of the room service or the bar so I cannot comment on these services  However  any requests I made were promptly dealt with and I left the hotel a happy customer The free complimentary wifi was also brilliant  I ve always had problems getting online with other hotels but the Apex hotel was no problem to access and was always superfast and accessible from my iPhone I ve used TripAdvisor to help me in hotel decision making many times  so I thought it was about time I actually posted a review and some photo s   I hope this has helped you make your decision   PS  Request room     for an excellent room  
P =>   Great location friendly staff Stayed here on its opening weekend    th   th    Fantastic location  and easy to get around  It is literally   minutes walk max  from either Moorgate or Bank tube stations  If you re coming from Kings Cross as I did  it took no more than    minutes to get here by tube and walking  Hotel was fab  room was well kept and clean  considering it was opening weekend and the builders were still adding finishing touches  you had to respect the hotel s valiant attempts to minimise any mess  Beds were amazingly comfortable and complimentary internet was a nice touch   pity more places aren t like this  Breakfast choices were great  but would be nice to see a  full veggie  breakfast option although there were still plenty of choices  Staff very friendly and helpful  Definitely recommend it 
P =>   Comfortable and decorated with taste I stayed in this hotel for   nights in its opening week  Everything was crisp and brand new  The hotel is very tastefully decorated both from the outside and the inside  with nice materials and colours  It is based in a new  concrete building in a quiet street in the City  dead end so no thru traffic   at   mins walking distance from Liverpool Street station  The City of London is the oldest part of the city with beautiful streets and buildings and many shops  bars and restaurants  but beware that most of these are closed during the weekend  For the same reason  rates are probably better during weekends than during weekdays The City King room I stayed in was like the est of the hotel  nice decorations  nice materials  everything clean and in good working order  It is not big though  and the bed takes more than half of the available space  One big suitcase is no problem  but with two of them it will get a bit cramped  Bathroom with bath and walk in shower  The complimentary bath duck is a very nice Apex touch  It s just too bad that for some reason the ducks cannot float upright but always tilt on their side  Another weird thing is that the bath tub doesn t feature a handheld shower  so after you re done bathing you have to make your way to the walk in shower the rinse any remaining soap off your body  Otherwise the bathroom is very nice  spacy and comfortable  The shower had great pressure and temperature Staff was very friendly  and in spite of it being the opening week of this hotel seemed quite experienced  I ordered breakfast in my room  and on both days I received just what I ordered right on time  Complimentary wifi was good  Very large flat screen tv of good quality  
P =>  Worst ever with arrogant unkempt staff DO NOT GO THERE My parents won a weekend stay in London and took the opportunity to visit me for the first time in   years  I should have straight away told them not to bother  When we arrived at the hotel the reception clerk was wearing a stained polo shirt and I mistook him for a member of the maintenance team When we went to the bedroom it was tiny  ok you expect this anyway   the headboard of the bed was leaning against the front of the bed  and the cable of the portable heater was in loops across the floor  The general cleanliness appalling  fluff on the carpet dust on top surfaces and yellow mould in the bathroom  I went back to the reception and asked for an alternative room due to concerns to health and safety  how I phrased it  trying not to offend anybody   Bluntly  the receptionist told me to go to another hotel this room is all they got and nobody can expect more from a   stars hotel  And I am only paying        quit for the room anyway   DerTour will be happy to know their rates are revealed btw  I am aware you get what you pay for  but even if its old and cheap it doesn t mean it must be a this kind of hole and whatever I am paying for I get insulted for free if I want to  
P => Best value for money I ve ever had in London I m a German English teacher and I stayed at the Apollo with a group of    students and I have to say that this is the best budget hotel I ve ever stayed in by far  The rooms are clean  the furniture ist less than five years old  the bathrooms are recently renovated and we paid only GBP    per person night  excellent group rate    Two years ago I stayed at the King s Hotel next door to the Apollo and we paid more for less  The location is great   Bayswater and Queensway tube stations right around the corner  as well as the night bus stop  a quiet street with little traffic and Queensway with its great restaurants and shops just two minutes away   who could ask for more  O k   the staff sometimes is a bit moody but hey   we re all only human aren t we  Don t get me wrong  this is a budget hotel  Anybody who expects the Hilton is definitely in the wrong place there but my school is currently planning another trip to London for about    students next year and it ll definitely be the Apollo we ll be staying in  
P =>   think twice if come back I wish to tell others about the Apollo hotel London Bayswater  lousy service and the contacted taxi service arranged by the hotel staff  This hotel dose not deserved even one star  For there s no service whatsoever  Starting from the checkin  The clerk at the front desk harassed for the price higher than what was quoted at booking time Tha taxi arranged by another staff overcharged us with the help of the hotel staff  In addition we forgot our belongings in the taxi which was returned with extra charge The hotel club should do something about this for the standard of the   star hotel dosen t meet what s expected Thai Tourist 
P => Apologetic Apollo I stayed at the Apollo from e       with my mother  I have never been treated so badly  We requested a wake up call and never got it  Thankfully  we got up with the early summer sun and did not miss our flight  We had a feeling that we would never get the wake up call because he scribbled a note in a paper and turned around to chat with his computer  The morning we departed we mentioned that we had not gotten the call and he smiled and apologized  This receptionist is moody  careless  and rude  In general  this hotel is overpriced for what they offer  I did not feel safe or happy here  
P =>  Small rooms creaky floors Our group stayed at this hotel  The rooms were small if it was only for two  but large for four or more  The desk clerk cut off our phone after we called the desk a few times  He did not want to be bothered while he was chatting on the Internet or sleeping on the couch after     The stairs and floors are very creaky and make alot of noise anytime someone walks down the hall or up and down the stairs  The only thing this hotel had going for it was the location which was basically across the street from Kensington Park and very close to shopping and the Tube  
P => Ten times better than expected  Having booked the Apollo as a cheap hotel for a night away with my wife in London  and having read some of the previous reviews  I was almost dreading the whole experience  Needless to say we were pleasantly surprised at the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff  so what that they are not English       the cleanliness of the bedroom  albeit it not the biggest we d stayed in  we opened our cases on the bed instead of the floor  and it worked for us  and the more than adequate continental breakfast where coffee and toast was served at the table  even an Ibis doesn t do that   The elevator worked fine and even told it s passengers what floor they were on  the corridors were well lit and the main staircase wide and safe  We even took our room key out with us and no one demanded we leave it in the hotel  For us  it more than served the purpose for the money we paid  had we wanted a big room and luxury showergel then we d have paid twice as much somewhere else  but this was just fine for our weekend away and meant we had more to spend on some local excellent English cuisine  
P =>  At least it is cheap We arrived to find no elevator  a walk up    stairs to our room with our bags  four beds  two doubles and two twins  in a room for two  soapscum on the soap dish in the shower  but no soap  a dusty tea service with very old creamers  and a bland breakfast  Thank goodness it is cheap and near tube stops  
P => Hotel Staffs are rude and Be aware Checkout is   am    After checking in  my husband and I were directed to a room next to the breakfast room which is located at basement floor  The staff didn t even tell us there is a lift and he just took us with many heavy luggages in our hands walking down the narrow staircases  We were shocked when he opened the door because the room smelled badly and was so dark    We were so unhappy with the room  but the staff said irresponsibly it was a very good room with air conditioning and furthermore it is next to breakfast room   Please imagine how noisy it will be in the morning    We asked to change a room and again with all our luggages carried back to front desk at ground floor  Then we were relocated to  rd floor for a better room    Please be aware you will be charged GBP   per luggage and there is no negotiation at all and even check out time is at   am  The male staff bull       all hotels around operating in the same way and it is a regulation in London  This comment truly spoils the image of London  He was just bull       because many budget hotels around do allow check out at   pm and free keeping of luggages service  The male staff got offended when I talked to him about the checkout time around Bayswater  His reply was really bad behaved  On the last day  my husband and I went for a walk at Hyde Park and came back at about     am  the same staff returned room key to us and reminded us again sarcasticly  quot  Check Out Time is   am   quot   At around      am  we received a call again to remind us  quot CHECK OUT TIME IS   AM     quot  All the staffs speak broken English and don t look English at all   We are not sure where they come from but it is not a big deal   The main concern we do have is the male staff around late   s has a very bad attitude   
P =>  Cheap and simple I stayed in the Apollo  which is located in Bayswater for two nights  The best thing about this hotel is its price  The breakfast doesn t taste average  the elevator got stuck two times  the public toillet is dirty and hard to find  the rooms are tiny  and you can hear the telephone ring one floor below  
P => Don t stay here  
P => Good for the price

P =>   It does exactly what it says on the tin For a hotel which is located so central in London and so cheap it was great value for money  I found the staff friendly breakfast was tea coffee and toast which was lovley  If you close your window the tube trains sounds like a strong breeze outside  I had a    month baby and she slept all night  so noise was never a problem  I was very happy for the money i spent  
P =>   Nothing wrong with this hotel For     a night in central London I think that this is a real bargain  It is basic  certainly  but it is clean  warm and very well situated  The breakfast too was basic   tea  toast and orange  squash   but I have no complaints and will certainly be going back in the future  I have also stayed it its sister hotel in Chiswick and my comments are the same  
P =>  Worst Hotel I have Ever Been In This place is a disgrace  I stayed ther one night as it was near the Cromwell hospital the location is the only thing going for it  The room was minute and filthy  Wasn t sure what the stain on the wall was and didn t want to ask  The previous guest had left things in the fridge and I had to get the porter to move them needless to say one of them was a banana so the fridge stunk  On suite was tiny and the hand basin is by the bed  My advise  go somewhere else  any where else    
P =>   Basic price basic room basically okay This is not a luxury hotel and that is adequatelly reflected in the budget prices  Along with the central location the price is the biggest attraction for this hotel We stayed in a basic double room which had a small double bed  a closet  fridge  tv and washbasin  Bathroom was outside the room and shared with other guests The rooms are nothing fancy but they are clean  comfortable enough and cheap as chips for London  Tea  instant coffee  toast and jam are included for breakfast This is definately a cheap but cheerful place which will not be suitable for all travellers  If you want something a bit newer  more homely and still central  you ll need to pay alot more for it in London  Consider the price and your length of stay  we found it okay for our two nights but I know others who would have found it unbearable  Best for hardened travellers and backpackers  
P =>   Srtay away    This is not a hotel   no way   it is a dump and a disaster waiting to happen  No mention of the flights of stairs  no lift   and no help from the front desk  Rooms are filthy  mold in the shower   fire extinguishers used a door stop  This place should be condemned and shut down  Please for your own safety and health do not stay there   the pictures are not what they seem  it is a fire trap and it could mean your life    
P =>  Horrible Horrible room We stayed here for one night  never again  The twin room was horrible  very small  amp  dark   old  dirty  shabby  no tea  amp  coffee making facilities  There was a big damp patch on the wall  amp  the carpet was grotty  The en suite was even worse  amp  the shower leaked leaving the floor wet all the time  The room smelt of smoke and the bed felt like the springs were poking through the matress  We were kept awake by the constant noise of the tube which seemed to run under the hotel or very close by  The continental breakfast consisted of dilute orange cordial  tea or coffee and a plate of toast  nothing else  Horrible  
P =>   Cheap and Cheerful  When our coach stopped in front of the Aquarius  it looked good  just like the website  A nice converted Victorian house  I was led to believe  Well  the price was incredibly cheap  and since we were a group of guys who just wanted a place to sleep  it suited us well The sheets were always clean  and the continental breakfast  coffee  tea   quot orange juice quot   toast and a selection of jams and butter  was abundant enough  but the breakfast room  in the basement with no outside window  does little to whet your apetite  Overall the place is shabby  staff indifferent and businesslike and the rooms are cramped  Railway enthusiasts should have a field day over here however  as the underground passes right behind the hotel  and some rooms have windows overlooking the track  Earl s Court is a busy station  and just staying in the bathrom  yuou will be subjected to the constand sounds of trains going about On the positive side  it is very centrally located  with a two minutes walk to the Tube station  It is incredibly cheap  so highly recommended for backpackers and people who want a holiday in London on the cheap

P => Still good value My second time here for a one night stay  I think it is excellent value for London and I like the location  You can walk from Kings Cross or Euston or get the number    bus  The local Goodge Street tube is handy for the Northern Line which takes you to Embankment and the heart of the city  Goodge Street also has many eating places to choose from and the inevitable Tescos and other mini supermarkets Free wifi was appreciated  having paid a small fortune at the previous hotel for just one hour   The room was small but comfy and you get all you need  use of space is great  attention to detail is evident too  Yes  there is road noise  not a problem in the winter as you have the window closed  I think it could be in the summer though when windows remain open  I also find the staff welcoming and friendly and I think the inclusive breakkfast is brilliant value   the day before I was in another London hotel who wanted     for a cooked breakfast    The link to John Everett Millais is intriguing for me as my business is in the visual arts  
P => Excellent all round would definitely stay again  This hotel was just perfect for me  it was in a great location   just a few minutes  walk down the road was the nearest Tube station and handy for travelling to and from Euston Railway Station  The staff were friendly and helpful and the room was well appointed and comfortable with a nice rear outlook  Breakfast was also included in the price so it was great all round value for money  Would definitely stay again on my next London trip  
P =>   excellent value for money in great location and very helpful staff Had a lovely stay at the Arosfa  The staff owners were really friendly and especially so when at late notice i asked for an extra bed to be put into our room  The hotel is lovely and clean and the breakfasts were very good with both hot and cold food on offer  The only downside was the size of the bathroom in our room  It was tiny and you did struggle to close the door and use the toilet  But everything was very good and i would recommend it to anyone as its in easy reach of the tube and walking of places like Oxford St  
P =>   Great price location and staff   very CLEAN  My husband and I and two of our friends recently stayed at the Arosfa Hotel for five days  We stayed in the upstairs apartment  two bed rooms with double beds  a small kitchen  and a shared bathroom   The room was very spacious  comfortable  and clean  The staff was very friendly and as we arrived early on our first day  they stored our luggage for us while we explored the city  The breakfast was perfect and included in the price of the room  The location of the hotel is great   very close to many tube lines  Since reading the other reviews and looking into the other rooms while they were being cleaned  I think we got the best rooms in the place as a few of the others did look a bit small  Also be warned that there is no elevator and if you book the small apartment there are three flights of stairs to climb  Not an issue for us  but as soon as we checked out the staff was showing our rooms to potential guests and the gentleman had quite the time climbing the stairs  All in all  this place is a jewel and we will definitely be back  
P =>   Very friendly and clean but look our for some tiny rooms We had last room available and this must account for the smallest possible twin room  Two different sized beds and a radiator as a head board took things a bit too far  The shower room is incredibly small with no room at all between the WC and the shower  Also closing the door when using the WC has just about enough room for your knees  Great difficulty getting the hot tap on the tiny sink to turn off and no plug supplied As indicated in other reviews though the staff are mostly very friendly and the hotel is kept nice and clean  Nice guest lounge  although very overpowering lilies  if they are not your thing   and free internet access was good I guess we would have been happy if we had paid less than      for two nights for such a very small basic space  Still recommending it though as the other rooms can not be as small  just check with them first  
P =>  Ever reliable value This was my  nd stay at the Arosfa and everything I said back in  this year still stands  In one of the most expensive cities in the world for accommodation  the Arosfa is an amazing bargain in a wonderfully central but peaceful location  Yes  the rooms ARE small and yes  there are a lot of stairs  especially if you re in the triple on the top floor  but you don t visit London to sit in your room all day and after the enormous breakfast they serve  the stairs help to keep you fit  All of the staff are unfailingly helpful and friendly  you can safely store your luggage there if you have a late plane or train  And you simply cannot beat the location    good bus and Tube connections and you don t have to be a fitness freak to be able to walk to Soho  West End shopping  theatres etc  while closer by are the British Museum  Tottenham Court Rd shops  Kings Cross  amp  St Pancras Stations and some great pubs and restaurants around the Southampton Row area  including Ricky Gervais  favourite Indian place in the area  Hason Raja  which my husband and I would heartily recommend   If your London budget won t stretch to the Connaught or Claridges  then avoid the overpricing and shabbyness of so many of London s middle range hotels and book in for the bargain that is the Arosfa  
P =>   Warm Welcome Small Rooms Great Breakfasts  The Arosfa is a small gem of a hotel  B amp B  located in vibrant Bloomsbury  a short walk from the British Museum  Upon arrival  at about      am  we were greeted warmly  found a place to store our luggage until our room would be ready and headed to spend a couple of hours at the British Museum  As promised  our room was ready at noon  Though small by U S  standards  everything was clean and fresh  The room reminded me of a cabin aboard ship  everything needed to be in its proper place  As it turned out  with so much to do and see in London  the room size really didn t matter much  The staff was unfailingly helpful and very friendly  They patiently answered questions and made helpful suggestions  For its price  and with the fantastic breakfasts  the Arosfa turned out to to be a great value indeed A great place to eat  and drink  right around the corner  is a pub named the  quot lborough Arms quot   It s filled with university students and the pub menu is quite good  The food is reasonably priced  The bar selections  wine and beer  are good  too  
P =>   A fabulous little gem of a hotel  I stayed with   friends for   nights when we had a weekend reunion  A great location  so close to a lot of London s attractions and tube stations  We stayed in the apartment at the top of the hotel which had two big rooms and a large bathroom to share  even a little kitchen which came in very handy  The beds were very comfortable and the rooms were very clean  Overall the hotel was very well decorated and had lots of character  The staff couldn t do enough for us and were very friendly  Breakfast was delicious and there was lots of it too  hot and cold  The price was great too  It enabled us to spend more money on enjoying ourselves  Considering a large chunk of money goes on hotel costs I would definately recomended it and plan on staying there again  Thanks to all the staff for a great stay  
P =>  Great Hotel for the Price but be aware of the traffic noise My sister in law and I stayed here for   nights at end of tember  Twin bed room was incredibly small  but adequate for our purposes  Location was excellent for getting around  close to tube stations  walk to British Museum  Great price  including hot and or cold breakfast items  My one complaint is that our room faced Gower Street and the noise out the window from the traffic below was terrible   and it went on all night  Our solution was to shut the window completely and run the fan at full speed to generate some  white noise   But that did not entirely block it out  be a room on the other side of the hotel would have been better  
P =>  tiny rooms affordable price excellent location very friendly staff This hotel is really good if you re travelling alone   the price per night in London city centre is unbeatable  If you re travelling with someone you might want to look for a double room somewhere else and share the price The single rooms are tiny with tiny beds  but you have everything you need price includes full english breakfastthe location is excellent  the staff is very friendlyIt has free internet  both wireless and a PC for guestsCareful   reception closes at        so make sure you manage to get there before that time  That applies only to the  st night  since you get your own key and you can arrive as late as you want 
P =>  Great location and reasonable price  It worked for us  My husband and I just got home from London and a   night stay at Hotel Arosfa  The location was just what we were looking for   walking distance to British Museum  bus stops right across the street  tube station just a couple of blocks  The rooms were very clean though the first room  a twin I had reserved online  was so small that I had claustrophobia and knew we couldn t do   nights there  The owner was sympathetic and offered us a larger room for the same price  We found the second room  I think it was a triple  satisfactory and had a very good time in London One area which could use improvement was in the service of breakfast  The person who is the server in the dining room has a very brusque and unwelcoming personality  He never introduced himself or made any chit chat  Though the service was efficient the atmosphere in the dining room was uncomfortably reserved  If you asked for anything outside the regular English breakfast   egg  poached   bacon  beans  sausage  broiled tomato and toast  he made us feel like we were being fussy and irritating  As a result the visiting and socializing that we have often enjoyed in bed and breakfast establishments was missing Also  we were lucky to have great weather and as a result had the windows open  You should be aware there is a lot of street noise on Gower St   We used ear plugs each night to block some of the noise and that made it tolerable for us  
P =>   Great location friendly and helpful staff Reserved a single room  facing garden for seven nights  Not a lot of room to move around but pleasantly surprised with the high ceilings and abundant light from three large windows  Small ensuite bathroom shower sink installation    but very well designed  Very quiet for such a central location  Three underground stations within a      minute walk and lots of handy buses heading into central London on Gower Street  Great breakfasts  served with a smile  This may be a family run enterprise  and they take pride in helping their guests  I was having difficulty with a long distance phone card and one of the employees found a solution Flat screen TV worked well  Wireless  wifi  internet did not work in my room  but the hotel provides a desk top in the reception area for the use of guests  
P =>   lovely hosts great location very comfortable I stayed here for   nights and I would definitely stay here again  The location is great  near train and tube stations and only a few blocks fromthe British Museum  The service was excellent  My hosts were very friendlyand helpful with advice and I felt valued as a guest  Yes  the room wassmall  this is London  after all   but it was worth it having an en suite room The hotel is very clean  I especially appreciated the free use for theinternet so I could keep in touch with family  since I was on my own   
P =>   Magnificent We stayed together with a friend for   nights in Arosfa  We really had a good time  The staff were really helpful and nice   The room very cozy and very clean   We woke up with the good smell of the freshly preapred breakfast   The hotel is located only a walking distance from Oxfrod Street  British Museum and all amenities    We highly recommend this hotel and will be booking it again on our next trip to London   
P =>   Fabulous find Stayed at the Arosfa on the   th tember for a conference the following day  Having previously stayed in large  anonymous and usually overpriced hotels what a fabulous find the Arosfa was  It delivered everying that it promised  We stayed in an apartment at the top of the hotel with a shared bathroom  The rooms were good sized and the beds were really comfortable  The staff were really friendly and helpful during our stay and we would definitely stay again  As a bunch of midwives we are quite hard to please when it comes to good clean accommodation but the Arosfa would definitely pass any matron s inspection  Many thanks to Jacqueline and all the team  
P =>   Gem of a hotel This hotel is excellent it is conveniently situated for getting around looking at stuff Comfortable room with good facilities and en suite Everything very clean not run down like some London hotels the staf are lovely and very helpful I will definitely be using this place next time I travel to london they even let you use a free PC  
P =>  Just Perfect Eight of our family stayed in   rooms for the graduation of our daughter at UCL the following day  The location is perfect  Goodge Street tube station is a short walk away on Tottenham Court Road as are regular bus services to all parts of London  The staff couldn t have been more welcome and accommodating  nothing was too much trouble  We will return   
P =>  We had a ball   My three sisters and I stayed for    nights off and on over a three week period  we had a family room which was lovely  very comfy we did have a giggle at the size of our bathroom but it added to the experience   The staff felt like family by the time we left they were so friendly and helpful  the location is fab with a bus stop just up the road  as I have two daughters living in London  I cant wait to come stay again  thanks Arosfa and staff   from the four aussies xxxx 
P =>   Great Location amazing hotel in the centre of london Great staff also very friendly  Rooms was very clean and good for relaxingI would recommend this hotel to any one  also free internet coffe and tea in the rooms what suited me well  
P =>   Good Value Small but Clean We stayed here the first three nights of our two week England trip and it was a very decent hotel  We were prepared for small rooms bathrooms so weren t surprised  Although we were located in a room street side  the noise was not terrible and did not keep us awake  The breakfast was good  the room was clean  and although the door of the bathroom hit our knees each time we were on the loo  it was manageable  The community use computer and free internet access were very helpful  and the location was great for our needs  namely  visiting the British Museum just a short walk away  The tube is close as are various restaurants and groceries  as it is a college community  We recommend the lborough Arms  just around the corner for good food and beers  No elevator  Overall  would stay again  and would recommend to a friend  Nice location for a quiet stay  
P =>   A Pleasant Experience Economical and Friendly Staff is anxious to please  very helpful  A generous complimentary full breakfast compliments the reasonable cost  Room was quaint and furnishings adequate  We expected bath to be small and were not disappointed  Location is distant from town center  Big Ben  Palace  Theaters  etc  and metro  underground  was   blocks away  but don t let that discourage  we found navigating the metro an easy task  
P =>   Very good familiar hotel The hotel was very enjoyable  with free internet facilities  nice breakfast and friendly staff  The location is wonderful for having trips in and around London  The only remark we make is related with the size of the familiar room  which was a little small for a family with   adults and   adolescent    
P =>   Excellent value good service I stayed twice at the Arosfa in y  This hotel continues to provide excellent value for visitors to London  It is a short walk from the hotel to the British Museum  the British Library and other attractions  The owner and the managers try very hard to please their guests  
P =>   Just what I needed I enjoyed a fantastic   nights in this excellent B amp B hotel  I had a single room  which was tiny  but very well laid out so that I had everything I needed  Exceptionally clean and well run with a good breakfast every morning to set me up for a full day out in London  The location was ideal as you can easily walk from the hotel to many of the main sites or use the Tube  What made it really special was the helpfulness and concern of the staff   I really felt well taken care of at all times  One word of caution  though  Some of the walls are quite thin partitions and late one night I could hear every word of a discussion in the next room as   guests complained bitterly about the friends they were on holiday with and who were also staying in the hotel  
P =>  Excellent choice  Our stay in the family room  for the   of us    adults  amp    early teens  was excellent  The location is just a short walk to tube station and many restaurant choices  Staff were very helpful for our few requests  The rooms  and stairs  were small   but adequate for us  We don t need a large suite    double  amp    twin beds filled up most of the room  But fine for us  Tiny but fine toilet sing shower  no bath   but then  how often do folks take baths    Standard breakfast  Excellent for us  
P =>   Truly better than expected and very happy we chose Arosfa for our stay in London  From the moment we were greeted at the door on arrival  the hospitality was endless  Always cheerful staff and always on hand to help  Our family room was larger than expected and plenty of room for    couple and a     amp     year old   The extras like coffee  tea  kettle  hair dryer  fan  television  toiletries are as one would get in any hotel in Canada or U S   Not entirely expected when we booked the hotel in London  as we were totally expecting small  The layout of the hotel is spacious and beautiful  Nice  comforting colours and decor  in both our room and in the guest room downstairs  The breakfast room is ample room for all guests and breakfast each morning is more than adequate  full English or cereal  yogurt  buns  and plenty of toast  tea  coffee and juices  All staff are friendly and courteous  We would definitely recommend this beautiful hotel to all of our friends when they choose to visit London  The hotel is close enough to Euston or King s Cross and minutes away from Oxford Street  We walked everywhere and had no problem getting around and the hotel is in the vicinity of many restaurants and conveniences on the streets over  The beds and entire room was clean and neat  always  No chipped paint anywhere  Carpeting is new and clean throughout  The bathroom is ample for a London hotel and even more than we expected it to be  The shower had perfect pressure  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and for the price we paid  very exceptional value  Best choice we could have made  Arosfa  keep up the good work  You are a gem in London  
P =>   Fabulous value The staff went above and beyond to make us feel welcome  They were unfailingly pleasant  They carried our luggage  arranged for taxis  stored luggage on the last day and offered very helpful suggestions Yes  the rooms are tiny and it was hot  London was in the middle of a e heat wave  but with the fan on and the windows open we were fine   Earplugs do help for sleeping as Gower St  is rather noisy   Our rooms were spotless and included all the amenities  We appreciated the apples  water  cookies and coffee tea making facilities  There were a flat screen tv and reading lamps over the beds  The full English breakfast was prompt and good  It was handy to have Internet access  We were amazed at how well the tiny bathrooms functioned I d definitely recommend the Arosfa Hotel to others and plan on visiting again  
P =>   Clean close friendly and affordable  Five of us stayed at the Arosfa for five nights in early y and not only was the weather excellent  the staff and conditions of this superb central London b  amp  b were wonderful  This is my second time staying at the Arosfa in as many years  and I d stay there again without question  as would the other four I travelled with  Richard and Jackie are excellent hosts and Kyle was most helpful and generous  too  Thanks for making the London leg of our trip such a success  Brad and Rose Morley  Owen Sound  Canada  
P =>   Boutique hotel in Bloomsbury close to everything We stayed at the Arosfa for a week in e  and had a really good experience  Our room was great  bed and pillows were comfortable  there was tea coffee hot chocolate making facilities  wardrobe  hairdryer  alarm clock and most importantly a fan  It was very hot while we were there  The bathroom  although small  was more than adequate  Although the windows opened out onto Gower Street  once closed you could barely hear a sound  Downstairs is a guest lounge with a computer and internet access that you can use  very very handy   and out the back is a garden Breakfast was included in the price  and was served quickly without fuss  Choice of cereals  yoghurt  toast  cooked English  tea coffee  Good way to start the day The staff were more than helpful  and really added to our experience at the hotel  Nothing seemed to be too much trouble The Arosfa is close to everything  there are   tube stops close by  Goodge  Euston Square and Warren Street  and Kings Cross St Pancras is not far away either  The British Museum is a   minute walk down the street  and another few minutes to New Oxford Street  Good pubs  restaurants  take aways and a Tesco is nearby in the Goodge St area  which makes it very convenient We really enjoyed our stay at the Arosfa  it was very good value and would recommend it to one and all  
P =>  Loved the Arosfa Amazing combination of good price  good service  clean and confortable rooms  and great location  All you need for a short stay in London  
P =>  Great place to stay   Very nice place  perfectly located  plenty of buses  restaurants  amp  take aways around The Arosfa is run by a nice couple  eager to oblige and very considerate  The rooms are small but nicely decorated and the whole place has a sophistication that I ve never seen in any other  quot budget quot  hotel I thoroughly recommend the Arosfa  
P =>  Great location great price great service just ask for a room in the back  We had a good stay here  I just wish I had known a few things going in  First the good  The location is great  close to the Goodge Street Tube stop  very close to Regent Park  Staff was very friendly and eager to help  They pointed out some great spots for lunch and dinner  booked a taxi  helped us with our bags  we always returned to a clean room and the breakfast  while not great  certainly kept you from needing to go elsewhere and kept you full easily until lunchtime  They always refused a tip whenever I felt they went above the normal duties of a host as well  Just great service  For what you re paying for  you really get a great stay Now for what you need to request  As is it a walk up and the stairs are narrow  request a room on one of the lower floors  I m not sure if there is air conditioning on the lower floors  but we had a room on the fourth floor in e it was quite hot  The ceiling fan helped a bit but not enough  Again  request a room on one of the lower floors if staying in the summer  Since it was so hot  we had to keep the window open the entire time  This would not have been a problem had we been in the back  away from the street traffic  Unfortunately  we were in the front of the building and heard everything all night  I just put my iPod on and played some Miles Davis  but other might not be so lucky  Again  just request a room on the lower floors and in the back of the hotel  you ll be just fine  The room itself and bathroom is quite small  Remember  you are in London what you re paying  For me it wasn t a problem  however  it may be a bit of a shock for some folks expecting a Holiday Inn type room  In sum  great service  great location and the price is right  Just don t expect a big luxurious room  
P =>  Fantastic Service This is a family run business and it shows  They take pride in their service  which is excellent  If you need a lot of space in a hotel room and if you have trouble with stairs  this is not for you  but if you are looking for a convenient  inexpensive  clean place to stay in London this is worth checking out  Rooms and loos are small  but the amenities are nice  breakfast options are good  and overall this is a place I would recommend  
P =>  Very Very Nice I visited london for two nights  My stay at Arosfa Hotel was very pleasant  The staff is very nice and friendly  The rooms are very very clean and very well designed  I was impressed by the high standard and excellent choice of furniture  which distinguish Arosfa from other hotels of its class The location s central and easily accessible to all London s attractions I would stay there again and I would recommend it to friends  
P =>  Excellent Value Hotel Most of the reviews about the Arosfa are quite fair  It is extremely clean  superb location and friendly helpful staff and owners    mins walk to the nearest tube station and a leisurely       minute stroll into the west end We had room nr   which was a good size with plenty of room to store everything we had  Tea coffee making facilities  fresh fruit  alarm clock  flat screen tv and hairdryer all provided  Excellent breakfast provided which sets you up for the day It must be said that the ensuite was very small  which I have found in other hotels here  and although not a problem for us it may be for  quot larger quot  people  Lovely garden at the rear and very nice sitting room with internet access and tea coffee etc I have stayed in   or   other hotels in Gower Street over the years because it is such a great area and I must say that the Arosfa is by far the best   With this hotel you re getting more than you pay for  I will be back  
P =>  Phenomenal experience  My trip to London was a family affair  we all stayed at the Arofsa Hotel on Gower Street in Bloomsbury  I cannot say enough about the personal attention received from both the staff and owner of this establishment  The friendly and accommodating nature of both the exemplary staff and the proprietor added immeasurably to the enjoyment of what was unarguably a short visit    days   nights   The afternoon I arrived I found to my horror that my bank at home had failed to  remember  I was abroad and refused all attempts to withdraw funds from my account  erroneously believing that my debit card was in fraudulent hands  These wonderful people accommodated me by allowing me a full day to straighten it out   I m still mad at the bank  but the attitude of those at the Arosfa did much to relieve my anxiety at the time I m a  senior   age      and this was not my first trip to the UK   I have stayed often in London  although never in the Russell Square Bloomsbury area  This establishment is a conversion from a private residence to a hotel and as such  has little peculiarities that are shared in common with the plethora of similar establishments that populate London  The reference to small rooms  in other posts here on TripAdvisor  is true  they are dinky by comparison to larger chain Hotels or those found in the States   but you re paying a dinky price   by comparison for a first rate place in a terrific area  close walking distance to the British Museum  the University  and phenomenal restaurants pubs caf s  The area is diverse and when you stay with the Arosfa  you re in the MIDDLE of it all with easy Tube access  both Goodge and Russell Square     size aside  the room itself contains all the necessities for a comfortable stay   a modular shower toilet wash basin right there in your room  good flat screen TV  wall mounted   wardrobe  hair dryer  reading light over the headboard of the bed  coffee tea making facilities  even   beautiful apples in a bowl  The Hotel itself is  in my experience  exceptionally clean and my room   rd floor  had a beautiful rear view of the Arosfa s garden and street  There is no lift  but in my case the assistance of the staff s son schlepping my luggage up to my room was a pleasant surprise   this kind of service has NOT been my experience in the past  The Lounge is VERY attractive with an up to date wireless computer for guest s use  and when I visited the hotel was full     of the time   the computer often had someone using it  but sensitive to my waiting to use it  the equipment was free within a few minutes   I returned the favor by not lingering there myself Breakfast was wonderful and offered the option of a full English breakfast in addition to access to a table that had yogurt  juice  cereal  etc   along with coffee tea  I accepted the poached egg each morning rather than change it to some other form  but my understanding is that you can request scrambled  etc  A big rack of toast is also provided  Generally this meal lasted us until      pm or so when anxious for a glass of wine  we stopped for lunch In the end  however  I have to say that the Staff and the Owner made the difference in terms of pure enjoyment of being in London again  Do yourself a favor and try this wonderful Hotel on your next trip   BEWARE  it fills up fast  be sure to book early  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did  
P =>   Great stay  If you can live with the compact space  then this is a formidable place to stay in London considering the price and location  If you are travelling on a budget  I highly recommend this hotel as an alternative to all the touristy and messy hotels in Bayswater  The rooms are as mentioned small  extremley so  just check out the bathroom  It was a blast  Imagine airplane bathrooms with a shower  and voil     but they are clean  Also  the lobby   lounge area is very nice  Add friendly staff and a manager who takes care to help you with anything   plus the lovely surrounding area of Bloomsbury   and you have a very nice place to stay in bustling London  Thumbs up  
P =>   Very nice and friendly The hotel was small but very clean  The staff was very friendly  It was affordable and it is well worth the money  The location was good  just two stations from Camden Town and a    min walk to beautiful Regents Park  The breakfast was included and you could choose full english breakfast  The room was small but nice with a flat screen TV  The bathroom was very small but clean and fresh  
P =>   A Gracious stay The Arosfa comes up trumps on many counts  Perfect location  excellent price and value for money but more importantly it is a pleasure to be there  Nicholas is a wonderfully welcoming and gracious host  helpful  accommodating and generous He has paid tribute to the Arosfa s history  once having been the house of the painter Sir John Everett Millais  and seeing reproductions of the work hung in the hotel gives a link to its cultural past The rooms are tasteful  beds very comfortable and the hearty breakfast offers a good variety of fare  This is a hidden gem   having stayed prior to finding the Arosfa at two other hotels in Gower St  they were not a patch on this and more expensive  Look no further  
P =>  Great B As previous reviews have mentioned  there are many positive aspects about the Arosfa  It is ideally located   Bloomsbury is a very pleasant area and Goodge Street tube station on the Northern Line is just around the corner  the Tottenham Court Road end of Oxford Street is just   stop away and Leicester Square   stops away  Our room was nicely furnished and decorated and was equipped with a flat screen TV and tea  amp  coffee making facilities  As some clients have mentioned  the bathroom was  compact  but it perfectly served its purpose and like the room it was impeccable The value was very good too I frequently visit London and was ready to call the Arosfa my  home away from home  but an incident put me off One day I didn t have the key and had to ring the bell    people in our party were ill and had returned to the B amp B earlier to take a rest   The landlord let me in but made it clear I was disturbing him The following morning we were SIX minutes late for breakfast   It was new year s eve  we d had a latish night and as I said    of us didn t feel too well  We were stopped on our way down the stairs by a blunt  quot Breakfast is over  quot   so much for the holiday spirit    Hopefully  the landlady showed some sympathy and though it was too late for a cooked breakfast  she kindly offered to make a cup of tea and some toasts  We sat down feeling rather uncomfortable and the landlord kept on whisking everything away from the table  juice  butter and jam  to show his total disapproval   I agree that clients should respect the house rules  but I also think that better manners wouldn t hurt    
P =>   Great London Bargain Only stayed for one night but was impresed by the cleanliness of the room and shower  absolutely spotless  The room was tiny  however  and some may not like that aspect  For my part I need a decent bed  good  clean working shower and little else  There was a selection of in room hot drinks  some biscuits and even a couple of apples  I paid     for the night and this was the best place I have stayed in London for that sort of money  When I come to stay in London again this will be my first choice  My only critism is the bed was only     quot  wide and was a tad narrow  The following morning enjoyed a good breakfast which was included in the price  
P =>   Fair Hotel small rooms excellent position I stayed during the Holy Week  Arosfa has an excellent localization  just beside the British Museum     minutes walking from Oxford st  The surrounding area is very quiet and nice  furthermore  along Gower St   where the Hotel is  there are lots of B amp B  Tube stations at    minutes walking  Euston square  Tottenham Court Rd    The best  position  the price  the very friendly staff  free internet connection in the guest lounge  the big selection of maps and guides of London at the entrance Ok  the breakfast  The rooms are small but cleaned  enough just after a day of tourism across the city   fair selection of tea and infusions  teapot  hair dryer  iron in a common area  TFT TV The worst  the bathroom  It is absolutely small  even for expert camping people  I believe this is not a particular problem  but I d like to remark that it was quite difficult for me to use it I will probably book again at Arosfa  especially for the quality price relation  but only for a short trip  no more than   days   
P =>   Convienent Location near Univ of London with good value We booked the  quot apartment quot  for   days and were very satisfied  The  quot apartment quot  is actually   rooms      and       Each room has a double and a single bed  The rooms are very small by American standards but larger than many you can get in this area of London  A single bathroom serves both rooms and is located in the hall outside the rooms  One of the rooms has a small but complete kitchen  We under utilized this feature  but it could save you money by  quot eating in quot   My daughter was doing a term at the U  of London which is right across Gower street from the hotel  Our group consisted of my wife and myself  our    yr old son  and   adult offspring  No real complaints from anyone  Breakfast was nothing special  but they will cook your eggs to order is you ask  Breakfast is over at   AM  a bit inconvenient for sleepy heads The hotel is very near the Goodge Street tube station  A couple other tube stations are also nearby  The   day oyster card is good to have if you plan on zipping all over London as we did  The    year old traveled for   pound a day  Many eating establishments are a short walk away  many are on Goodge street   Food in London is very pricey but there is good value at the many small sandwich shops  I liked the Sandwicheria on Goodge street  The Spagetti House has good moderately priced Italian food  I did not care for Zizis  another Italian place   Pub food abounds in the area  The British museum is very close and was my favorite Unfortunately we did not have much interaction with the staff  we were tooooo busy   but they seemed good So  location great for us  very good value  clean and safe  we would definitely choose to return to Arosfa whenever we return to London  
P =>   Clean and familiar Great cleanliness with simpathy Everyone wants to keep you satisfied  specially the Brazillian couple Cairo and Aline  Just Ask If you count with tiny bedrooms with tiny  tiny bathrooms you won t have anything to regret Good location  good service and great simpathy  They care about you  
P =>   Great location lovely staff great budget hotel We stayed at Arosfa   times from   rd ember      to early ruary       It was our hub as we travelled about  We stayed in   different rooms  The room on the second floor is quite small but typical London size  We also stayed in room   on the ground floor which is a more spacious room but a smaller pre fabricated bathroom The hotel has lovely helpful staff  full English breakfast and free internet acccess  Rooms are cleaned and serviced every day including bathroom products like soaps  shampoo  conditioner  There is tea  amp  coffee facilities in the room and a hair dryer  The rooms have flat screen TVs too  Whilst we were there they spruced the rooms up with new linen  bed throws  cushions and new carpet  There is a communal lounge sitting area with a big TV  lounges  books  free coffee tea hot chocolate and the internet  It s an easy    minute walk to the start of Oxford Street  Tottenham Court Rd end  for all your shopping needs    There are at least   tube stops in the vicintiy too  and of course many local pubs for a drink or dinner  Walk the other way up Gower Street and you are at Covent Garden  not more than    minutes  Also close to SoHo  Regent Street and or the British Museum Just a    minute ride in a cab  with all your luggage   to Paddington to catch the Heathrow Express We loved the spot  It was so convenient to everything  You can even walk to the West End and other major attractions  
P =>   Liked the location I stayed at the Arosfa Hotel for   nights  The first night in a twin room  and the other two in a single  The rooms are tiny  but I was expecting that and it didn t really bother me  The bathrooms have been installed into the rooms  so they are very compact as well  My host was very attentive  The hotel is in a good location   very close to tube stations and to the British Museum  on a picturesque street  There is a strip of restaurants food outlets outside the British Museum  The hotel offers free internet access in the guest lounge which was wonderful   it is very busy in the morning but I found in the evening was the best time to get online  
P =>   Excellent location close to a variety of tube lines  I stayed at the Arosfa Hotel for two nights at the beginning of ch  The hotel is located just a few blocks away from the British Museum and also very close to quite a few tube lines which makes getting around London quite easy  My single room was quite small however I didnt spend much time in the room  The room was spotless as was the rest of the property  The full English breakfast was a real treat each morning as was the Internet service in the communal lounge  The staff was friendly and helpful  I would definitely stay here again  
P =>   Friendly clean and convenient The Arosfa is family owned  clean and convenient  Although the rooms are small  the one that we had was just fine for our family of five  They had an excellent breakfast every morning and the staff is extremely friendly  It is conveniently located to the tube stop and in a great area for some shopping and restaurants  It is within walking distance of the British museum which is a plus  I would definitely stay there again  
P =>   Cozy hotel in London s intellectual center I spent ten days at the Arosfa hotel in ember      while researching at the Wellcome Library  I could not have asked for a better experience  The location  service and value were excellent  The location of the hotel is ideal if you are looking to go to the British museum  or want to work in the the Wellcome or British libraries  If simply staying in London for leisure the Arosfa is ideal in that it is within walking distance to Oxford Street  Covent Garden  Piccadily Circus  Leister Sq and most anywhere a visitor would want to go while at the same time being tucked away from the tourist scene  The hotel location provides you with the option of going into the excitement of central London or shopping eating at local eateries less frequented by tourists  I really appreciated this The hotel itself is quaint  clean and modern  During my stay I was able to stay in   different rooms and was comfortable in each one  The largest  though still small  was the one on the ground floor next to the lounge        I enjoyed my  quot english breakfast quot  every morning complete with toast  eggs  baked beans  bacon  tea  and OJ  The service was friendly without being overbearing  I especially appreciated the email correspondence I had with Jacqueline to set up my trip  The owner was very mindful of keeping his guests happy  While I can agree that the rooms were small and the bathrooms probably not equipped for heavier people or those in wheelchairs  the rooms were spotless with modern decor  flat screen TVs and free internet access  This was my third time in London but first at the Arosfa  and I surely intend to return to this hotel  
P =>  Stayed At Arosfa For Zeppelin Trip To London This was a great place  It is a small hotel basically  run by a couple  whose names escape me   This mom and pop operation puts you just blocks from the heart of London  P  Circus  SoHo  the whole deal  Super close to the Goodge Street T stop  Clean  no frills  good people who actually care  and do a terrific job Our small two bedroom was on the top floor   th I think  Small window but decent view with a Univ  building across the street  and such amazing  inspiring architecture  The beds were small but adequate  The showers and bathroom in the room are clean and modern but small  Super small  but they are private  If you had the room to yourself or are with a gf bf  you are large and in charge  Sharing w anyone less intimate  and you are too close for one of these small rooms  But the built in included breakfast in the basement was dope  very good selection  all you can eat w eggs  toast  cereal  sausage ham bacon  beans  fruit  and coffee tea  They are such warm hosts  You listen to the BBC w news and classic music from the kitchen as you eat  It s awesome  I miss it all the time  Small tvs in the room have very little  but you re in the heart of London  so close to all the action  Literally  five minutes walk in every direction is stuff to see and do  in a nice part of town where a university is  and just blocks from top attractions  smoking places to eat  if you love Greek Mid East Med   you are going to gorge   shops  theatre     You can walk to a ton of places  and then get a t pass that is unlimited for most zones to catch the tube around to further out destinations  As I noted  use the map feature on this tripadvisor page to note the googe street t station  and see how awesome the Arosfa proximity is to everything  Low price  great service  fantastic warm people  free coffee and internet in the welcoming front room area  all you can eat breakfast with great music ambience  reliable help getting advice or travel arrangement plans  just all around  a     out of     at least  Love this place and hope to visit again  London is an incredible place  and I fell in love with it  Much aloha to everyone we met there who treated us so well  So many great meals  so much killer Indian food  and a great place where this guy was Lebanese Italian  and in one place had pizza  hummus  babaganoosh  bagels  falafel  and tabouli    The type of great guy who ran this place we need more of in the world  Their menu was so awesome  Wish I had the name handy    Sorry  But that kind of food and vibe is what I found in London  and certainly staying at the Arosfa was something that placed me in the center of it  I am fortunate to have met these lovely people  and hope you enjoy their place  
P =>  Incredibly small rooms We chose this hotel mainly because of the positive reviews Somebody should have mentioned that the rooms are terribly small  Two beds won t fit side by side in the rooms  The showers   toilets are jammed into the space of a closet   literally The hotel staff may be friendly and the location is good  but unless you intend to spend your time in London in your hotel  there must be better offers Note  there are about a dozen hotels in a row next to Arosfa that must suffer from the same problems  so we would advise against any hotel on Gower Street if you feel room size matters  
P =>  Great hotel great people  It s not only a very clean  friendly and well located hotel  It has great people When I got back in Brasil  I realized that I ve forgotten my battery charger  I contacted them by e mail and they found it and sent it back to me in a week Recommend it  
P =>  Excellent location and value My husband and I stayed at the Arosfa Hotel for three nights in ember  We were very pleased with the accomodations and enjoyed the English breakfast every morning The hotel is centrally located near many tube stations  The British Museum is very close by as is Covent Gardens We did have a slight issue with the size of the bed   it was very small for two people  It was probably the smallest we have had on all our travels throughout Europe  The bathrooms were also quite small   but accessible Even with these  quot small quot  issues we would definitely stay at the Arosfa Hotel again  The price and location can t be beat  
P =>   Clean Comfortable and Fantastic Location I stayed in a single room for   nights   my room was very clean and comfortable  and I loved the little touches like fresh fruit and a coffee maker  with hot chocolate and biscuits  in the room  The complimentary full English breakfast was delicious  and the friendly staff didn t have a problem with accomodating special requests  Having free access to the internet was also a plus  And the location  The hotel is less than a   minute walk to the British museum  and only about a       minute walk to Covent Garden and the theatre district  There are lots of great restaurants and shops in the area  my favorites being all the secondhand bookstores   and it s also very close to several tube stations  making it a breeze to get anywhere in London and beyond  I was more than pleased with my stay there  and look forward to visiting the Arosfa again  
P =>   Very pleasant stay in Arosfa Hotel Date  ember         Traveler  Couple from San Diego  USAWe stayed in this lovely boutique hotel for   nights  We were on the business trip   and the location was just perfect  Very close to several tube stations  a lot od small cafes and Deli close by The room was super clean with nice TV  coffee maker and there were even fresh apples waiting for us  The bereakfast was superb  made at the request  The hotel provides the internet in a very chic lounge room The best about this hotel is extremely pleasant and helpfull staff  Before returning to US we had to go on another visit inside Europe  and we had to leave one luggage behind due to airlines restriction  We were allowed to store it in their place  which was extremely helpful  We are hoping to visit London again and we will try to get a room in Arosfa  
P =>   Great location nice little hotel I spent three nights at the Arosfa last e and it s been my best stay in London so far  The room was tiny  a single one   but excellently decorated and very clean  There s no lift but that was no problem for me  I didn t have breakfast  I got up either too early or too late every day but that was my choice  The area is fantastic  it s a short walk to the British museum  the closest underground station is one block away  at Tottenham Court Road  Oxford street is just ten minutes away or even less  I actually used the underground just to get here from Liverpool Street st  and back  but I walked everywhere else If you re looking for a cheap but clean and nice place in the best area in London  this is the place for you  I would definitely repeat  
P =>  A Cosy Place I got back last Friday from London after a ten day stay at the Arosfa Hotel  This was my first experience at a B amp B and a totally positve experience at that   The purpose for my visit was two fold  to visit my daughter who is spending the fall semester studying abroad in London  and to take in the sights and sounds of London itself which I was unable to do in detail during a previous three day visit several years ago Well my stay at the Arosfa enable me to do both in plenty of comfort and safety  The full English breakfast came in handy and kept me going way into the late afternoon or evening  The room was more than adequate for my purpose  I stayed at a room with twin beds which provided a bed for my daughter whenever she chose to stay with me instead of her dorm room  The beds were made everyday and the room left meticulously clean  The cleaners would also leave in the room packets of tea  coffee  sugar  and cookies  to avail myself after a long day of sightseeing  These would always come in handy  The staff in general was excellent and had a pleasant quality about themselves  I would certainly return to this B amp B if I should ever return to London  
P =>   Great Value For Money  Stayed for four nights in tember  This hotel is incredible value for money  The staff were friendly  the facilities are clean  the location couldn t be better and the breakfast is good  The double room and the en suite were small but we were only using the place as a base for sightseeing so we didn t spend a huge amount of time there anyway and we were never uncomfortable  We were at the front of the hotel and the traffic was noisy but it never ruined a good night s sleep  I wouldn t recommend this hotel for people who like to stay in luxurious places  but it s clean  friendly and situated in a really fantastic location  I would definitely stay here again  no questions  
P =>  vellous little hotel This is a compact  clean and very reasonably priced hotel in a great part of London  It is in close proximity to numerous historic sites and museums as well as not being far from the Brunswick Centre close to Russell Square tube  The staff are very friendly  and have good local knowledge  The choice of breakfast included a wide range of cereals  juices and fruit as well as the option of a  full English   I can t speak highly enough of my stay  
P =>  Keeps getting better I last stayed at the Arosfa in ember      when it was owned by a very hospitable couple who ran it excellently  Always clean  always tidy  very good service  Only     for a central London location  free wi fi etc  and it couldn t be beaten However since then it has been taken over by a younger couple who run it just as well  but who are slowly doing it up to a more modern style  For example all the rooms now have a flat screen TV    and the lounge is pretty funky I look forward to going back there again in another   months to see the transformation completed I think there are quite a few B amp Bs like this in London  well run  cheap and clean  but the reason I keep going back to the Arosfa is because unlike many it has an online booking facility so I don t have to ring up of wait for them to reply to an email  
P =>  Best cheap hotel in London Tried the Arosfa based on other good reviews here  It was for a one night business trip and The Arosfa had all the ingredients  it s very close to Euston Station and in walking distance of many of Camden and surrounds  amenities including my two meeting venues at Birkbeck College London  It was cheap  It was recently taken over by a nice couple who have decorated it beautifully  It has everything you would want  cooked or continental breakfast  tea  amp  coffee in room  with hot chocolate sachet  yum    toiletries in bathroom  decent hairdryer  moveable flatscreen tv with all the FreeView digital channels  comfy beds  a fan in the room for hot weather  free wifi in room  free internet in the lovely lounge downstairs  a nice garden out the back  double glazed windows to help reduce London traffic noise  very friendly staff Tiny downsides  The en suite is a tiny pod with the shower virtually on top of the toilet so a big person might find that a bit cramped  but it works fine and is clean  It s on Gower Street  so road facing rooms have some traffic noise  although double glazing helps with this   Oh  and their wifi is set up to not allow SMTP email out  which is always a slight irritant and a bit risk averse in my opinion  My room was tiny  as often in London   it was a twin room but was more like a single room with an extra bed squeezed in  but I ve stayed in smaller and it was cozy  didn t mind one bit  
P =>   Very good location and great service I had one night in London on my way to Dublin and wanted to stay in the Soho Bloomsbury area because I love the Museums and bars in this part of London  I picked the Arosfa based on the past reviews on here and I am in complete agreement with the other reviewers  The location is great  close to multiple tube stations  close to the British Museum  close to Soho  close to Oxford Street  The price is definitely right  My en suite room  with a nice TV and bed  was only    O Canadian and it included a full English breakfast in the morning  Finally  the service was great  The woman who works the desk was super friendly  I will be making the Arosfa my new hotel in London  
P =>   Very Clean Safe Hotel I recently stayed at the Arosfa  and it was a perfect hotel for me  I am a female traveling alone and I must have a clean and safe place to stay  The room is small  and the bathroom even smaller  but it was comfortable and clean  I was in room    on the top floor facing the garden  I slept with the window open  and it was nice and quiet Although the room is small  it had everything I needed  It had a nice TV  a desk  a closet  a nice mirror with shelf underneath to do my makeup in the morning  and nice toiletries in the bathroom  It also had a coffee tea maker The breakfast was delicious  Typical English breakfast with toast  eggs  tomato  beans  and meat  You could also get cereal  rolls  etc  if you wanted The location is excellent  right in the middle of everything  The neighborhood also felt safe  Also  there is a computer in the lobby for guests to use for free  which I really appreciated The important thing is that I would stay there again  It is a great value  I highly recommend it  especially for a single traveler  
P =>   Imaculate friendly affordable Upon arrival we were greeted by the owner and his lovely wife  They made sure we checked in very quickly and settled us into  quot our quot  room  Coffee and tea were offered The hotel is squeaky clean  the beds are very comfortable and the rooms are super quiet The Goodge underground station is within two blocks of the hotel and Euston Rail Station about   blks away  The British Museum is a short walk away as is Oxford Street  There are several coffee sandwich shops close by and several good cafes I have stayed at this hotel several times in the past and it is consistienly clean  affordable and you are made to feel at home The  quot full English quot  breakfast was of top quailty and seconds are offered  A piece of fruit can be taken for a mid morning snack Don t miss a visit to the book store directly across the street  
P =>   Very nice for the price My direct AA flight to London is now landing at Heathrow instead of Gatwick  so I stayed in Bloomsbury  so I could take the Piccadilly line from Russell Square to Heathrow  instead of near Victoria  Great move  Staying in Bloomsbury got me a much nicer B amp B than the Victoria area  for almost the same price  While my single at the Arosfa was no bigger than the horrible room at my last Victoria hotel  and had the same style of prefab bathroom cubicle  the bathroom was a little bigger  the carpet was clean  the TV was a new  flat screen model  and  best of all  the window opened onto trees and a back garden  And breakfast was cooked instead of continental The owners were friendly  and took a phone message for me  The sitting room was comfortable  and I really appreciated the Internet access  This is a great find for the price  
P =>  A nice place in a great location This place was nice   not fantastic  but still nice  The location is fabulous   in the heart of Bloomsbury  in easy walking distance to the British Museum and the Welcome collection  I enjoyed my stay here  but would happily try somewhere else next time  The breakfast was pretty good  internet access great  bathroom very small  but clean    I liked it  
P =>   Great Choice Stay was         to        What a great find  I booked this on reviews and suggestions from the Trip Advisor and the Trip Advisor London Forum  First  yes  the place is cleaned meticulously  That was our first view of the place upon arrival  staff outside cleaning and painting on the inside  Cleanliness was so important to me and was what made me book in the first place  We had room    which is on the ground floor and faces the private garden  It was such a cute room  It was also next to the lounge which was nice because it felt like an extension of our room  It was very convenient to use the computer in the lounge  The room was small but I have been in smaller  It was very efficiently set up  Looked remodeled recently  There was a flat screen television mounted on the wall in the corner  I would say about    quot  or so   a desk directly beneath with a tea hot water warmer  tea bags and instant coffee and a couple of cookies every day  There was also a very nice blow dryer in the room  The television got in about    or    channels very clearly  It had enough on for when we wanted to watch news in the a m  when getting ready or relax and watch a little before bed in the evening  There was an iron and ironing board in what would be the basement level  where the breakfast room is   It is in a hallway and anyone can use it which is very convenient The bathroom was small  It is like a prefabricated  quot pod quot  that has everything in it  I liked it  though  It was very cute and spotless  Everything worked fine and got the job done  My husband and I are not petite people by any means and had no problems moving around in there  I am not sure what people were saying about the amenities in the bathroom unless they changed what they stocked by the time we were there  They had a small bar soap but that was for hand washing in the sink  Then  they had a shower gel  shampoo  conditioner  lotion and shower cap  So  everything was there  I have a skin condition so I brought my own stuff but it was there if you needed it  Someone told me that they did not stock washcloths so I brought my own and this was true  no washcloths  but no biggy  There was no dresser if you are staying for a long stay  we stayed for   days  but there is a wardrobe with lots of hangers so we were able to unpack pretty much everything and hang it and then use the shelf in the wardrobe for our undergarments etc  The bed was about what the equivalent of a full size bed would be in the U S  It was ok  I have a really comfy bed at home so it would be hard to beat it but this was fine enough  And  by the end of the day  we would be so exhausted I could have slept on the floor and would not have cared  They had really nice sheets and duvet cover on the bed  All in white  I liked the fact that they were not scratchy sheets  Like when you stay at some hotels and the sheets seem really stiff and scratchy from the laundry soap and low thread count  These were nice and soft  Breakfast  we overslept the first day and were very screwed up with the time and went to breakfast late unbeknownst to us  But  the staff caught us and told us to come on down anyway since we were not that far over and they would at least get us toast  coffee tea  juice and cereal  Very nice  I made it to breakfast one other time  I am not really a early morning person or morning eater so what I had was good and plenty when I did make it the one time  Eggs  beans  ham  sausage  cereal  toast  fresh fruit and some bakery  All you could really need in a breakfast  In correspondence with Jacqueline from the hotel before the stay  I mentioned that it was our honeymoon trip  When we arrived they had in the room a bottle of champagne on ice  a bowl of fruit and a card congratulating us  How nice was that     Also  they loaned me a voltage converter so that was nice that I didn t have to purchase one as I am not a big traveler and would probably have not needed used one in a few years There is a Tesco Grocery store very close  about      minute walk  There is a Boots pharmacy about   minutes away on Goodge St  The Goodge St Station is about   minutes as well and we were able to get everywhere from there without a problem  There were plenty of restaurants nearby and food options  The room did not have a refrigerator which we knew so we brought a small cooler as one of our checked bags  Normally I would not do this but we were there for   days so it was nice to have some snacks and beverages in the room for that length of time My only one con  and it is very small  is that the room did not have an alarm clock or radio  It would have been nice to have a clock and radio to listen to music or set an alarm if needed  Neighborhood  Bloomsbury  Very nice  Younger college crowd  Felt very safe  Pubs in the area only open until       p m  All and all  loved it  Would stay here again and recommend to all Paid     ish pounds for   nights  that was total with all fees  taxes and VAT   Very good price  
P =>   Small but Powerful  The Arosfa House is one of the most affordable places to stay in London  I have personlly stayed there four times  The rooms and bathrooms are very small but also very clean  My bed was a little uncomfortable but reasonable  There is no elevator and there are   floors  Our room was on the  th floor in the back because the rooms are much quieter there  The proprietor will carry your luggage up the stairs for you so that is a great help The breakfast is amazing  They will make you a full English breakfast  if you choose  but if you re a vegetarian they will fix you a breakfast that fits your lifestyle  The staff is excessively friendly and willing to help at all times and fix you whatever you want for breakfast In the common room there is a TV and books to read  kind of take and leave books  plus a computer with Internet access that guests may use  A tea and coffee machine is available at all hours in this room as well The B amp B is located near the Goodge Street tube stop and is just a two block walk down the road  Along the way there is a little convenience store where you can get tube bus passes and other goodies  Along the road of the Goodge Street stop  is some nice restaurants and shopping  Lester Square is a         minute walk down this road  In the end the Arosfa House is economical  has a great location and terrific proprietors  I d stay there anytime  
P =>   Tourist in London  This is the place to stay  I spent six nights in the Arosfa together with my grandma and sister and we all liked this little hotel in the centre of London  near the British Museum  We had a clean small room on the top floor  the breakfast was good  English  and the people very friendly  Also  the Arosfa is conviniently located  easy access from Heathrow with Picadilly line  Mme Tussauds  Soho  Covent Garden in walking distance  two tube stations close by   And all for budget prices  Anything to criticize  Well  I should mention that there is no elevator and for older people  or those who carry bricks in their suitcases     steps to the top floor are quite a lot  Plus we could only open the window a crack  safety reasons   so the nights with three people in one room were pretty warm  But overall   a great place  
P =>  Great little hotel We stayed at the Arosfa Hotel in London in il       based on what we had read on this website The hotel did not disappoint  It is a great location  immaculately clean  seemingly soundproofed rooms  small bathroom but clean and everything you need  coffee and tea in the room  great sitting room downstairs with free computer   internet  lovely staff and great big breakfast I would recommend this hotel for anyone except maybe the   star traveller types  only because they would be used to a larger facility with room service  etc  
P =>  Great small b I was attending a conference at UCL and just needed a quiet  close  budget place to sleep  I knew I would be getting a very small room  so that didn t surprise me  What did surprise me was how immaculately clean it was  The staff were friendly and accommodating  and breakfast   although not huge   was always prompt  hot  and made to order Others have commented on the noise   with the window open I found it a bit loud over the weekend  but no more loud than one would expect in that area of town  Others have also commented on the size of the bathrooms   they ARE tiny  but they are yours  and sparklingly clean  I would much rather an ensuite  shower pod  than a communal loo  There are steep stairs and no lift  but the staff insist on bringing the bags to the room for you  even my great heavy one   I also appreciated the free wireless  and free access to a computer in the communal lounge I ve stayed at other b amp bs in the general area for other meetings but from now on the Arosfa will be my first choice  
P =>  what a great experience   I started out a hotel in the Southbank area of London and found it to be a very contemporary  high tech  unfriendly  and sterile environment  After one night I cancelled the rest of my reservation and found the Arosfa in my guide book   I should have read my guide book first instead of waiting until I got there   My guide book was correct in saying it is impeccably clean with reasonable rates but what it didn t say was how warm and welcoming the staff is  Jacqueline and Richard welcomed me and made me feel right at home  They even brought me tea in the lounge during an afternoon break from sight seeing  The lounge is exposed to a lot of natural light and even has a high definition television and a computer with free internet access  The hotel is located right on the very charming Gower Street and is within a couple of blocks from three tube stations  Sure  the rooms are small and the bathrooms are the even smaller but hey  who goes to London to spend the entire time in the bathroom  Breakfast includes a full English breakfast which is delicious  I had such a great experience at the Arosfa Hotel I even hated to leave  I highly recommend the Asrofa Hotel to everyone and I hope your experience is as great as mine was  
P =>   Wonderful Bed  First things first   be very cautious when reading negative reviews of this hotel when the reviewer s benchmark is a swanky  ultra expensive city hotel  Arosfa is a charming  spotless  convenient bed and breakfast providing excellent  you guessed it   beds and breakfasts  My family of four was overjoyed by the accomodations offered  even better than we had hoped for  The room was immaculate with high ceilings  a new digital widescreen television and a gleaming bathroom with all new fixtures  The water was always hot and plentiful  and the soap and shampoo samples were terrific  Yes  the bathrooms are a bit small compared to the high end London hotels costing   times as much per night  but how can you honestly compare the two  Back to the beds and breakfasts  The beds were very comfortable with down comforters and plenty of big  thick pillows  The breakfasts were piping hot  made to order offering your choice of eggs  bacon  beans      different cereals  tea  coffee  juices  toast   you get the picture  Food is outrageously expensive in London  and this hearty breakfast will save a family of four     to     per day in meal expenses  Oh  and you will love the in room kettle and stock of tea and coffee  The staff at Arosfa is top drawer  as well  Richard and Jackie are honest  friendly people who always offer to help with bags  advice  or whatever else one might need  Their newly remodelled sitting room is exceptional with a huge digital television  high speed internet access and plenty of comfortable furniture  The building itself is a marvellous piece of architecture located in the beautful Bloomsbury section of London  We could not have imagined a safer  cleaner neighbourhood in which to stay  There are several tube stations close to the hotel  and there is a bus stop right across the street going anywhere one could want to go in London  We loved listening to the hustle and bustle of London from our room which is always fun for a visitor wanting to blend into the culture  Sure  some folks like boxy  sterile  soundproof  cookie cutter hotel rooms  but not the true lover of British life  Arosfa offers the chance to blend in comfortably without the wall erected by the modern hotel between the visitor and the city  London is like a good friend   treat it well and it will return the favour ten fold  We could easily go on and on about this treasure of a place  but I think we have made our point  Choose a place full of character  value and friendly faces  Do yourself a huge favour and reward yourself with a stay at the Arosfa  The Schulz Family  USA 
P =>  Be Ready for a Shock  Following my commitment to say   good things before I say   bad I want to commend them for their welcome  for carrying my heavy bag upstairs  no lift elevator   for a spotless hotel  great lounge and good breakfast  The real shocker was the appalling room  It was a twin  but was so thin that the beds were placed head to head in a straight line  It measured about  ft X   ft  The  bathroom  was a capsule in a cupboard  ft X  ft and had a very dangerous high ledge to get into it  It was very similar to a BA loo in economy  The decor of the room was very shabby and the home made cupboards were unfinished and scruffy  The noise from the road is terrible if you open the window  but the tiny room is airless otherwise  I had claustrophobia  and when my wife enquired about changing the room they said they were full and in any case all their rooms were similar  
P =>   Great place to stay  I was here last week and I can t say enough nice things  Yes  my room was small and so was the bathroom  I had a lovely view of the garden  The owners were so helpful and kind  I was traveling alone for the first time and they really made it easy for me The place was spotless and the breakfast good and filling  Asosfa is centrally located in a nice neighborhood near several Tube entrances  There is also a good pub around the corner that served good food and frequented by students from the local university  I will definitely stay here again  
P =>   Small but clean and convenient Just returned from a trip to London where I stayed two nights in a triple room with my husband and a friend of ours  The triple room had a full size bed for us and a twin for our friend  The staff were friendly although they interacted very minimally  We were able to check in right away once we arrived at around noon  Our room was on the top floor facing the front street  It was quite a hike up the stairs with our bags  but the man that showed us to our room helped me with mine  The room was very clean but very small for three people  Forget any sort of privacy because these are some close quarters  Showering and dressing were a challenge because the bathroom is really too small to dress in  and often challenging to turn around in  But for us it worked out ok because it was mostly a place to just crash at the end of the day  Noise was not a problem even with the window open The breakfast that is included was standard but nice if you re willing to get up at   am for it  The living room on the ground floor seemed to be always available  offering a computer for internet access  a large tv with a couch and chairs  and coffee and tea  We were able to leave our bags for a few hours upon check out  We paid    pounds per night for our triple  The location was very good I thought  within easy walking distance  about    minutes  to the wonderful British Museum  And there were many good pubs in the area for meals and drinks  We used the Goodge Street tube station often for sight seeing which was probably only about   minutes walk over to the lively Tottenham Court Road  As long as your luggage is on wheels the walk from the Warren Street tube station is not too bad at about    minutes  I would definately return to this little B amp B  although not in the triple room  Three people in that size room made me claustrophobic  
P =>   Will Definitely Return I stayed in the Arosfa for four nights from   to    uary       and absolutely loved it I stayed in a single room on the top floor and the gentleman who owns the place was kind enough to carry my bag right up to the door   something which is quite unheard of in London My room was spotless  yes the bathroom was small  but as I m only  ft  in it wasn t a problem The location was great  easy access to bus and tube Next time in London I will definitely stay in the Arosfa again  
P =>   Basic but good I just came back from staying at the Arosfa from the  th of ch to the  th  I stayed in a single room room nr     facing the back of the building for which I payed     night  And yes everything that has been said on this site is true  the room was is  very small and the bathroom even smaller so if you are a big person or you like having some space to move around in   dont stay here but if you like me arent going to be there so much it was ok  The room was very clean  the bed was better than average and the English breakfast was good  And as others have stated before the staff is very pleasant and accommadating  they made you feel welcome  The location of the hotel is good  about a   min walk to Goodge Str Underground Station   min walk to Euston Sq St and    min to Russel Sq St and if you are up for it        min walk to Picadilly Circus There were two things I didnt appreciate so much  the reception on the TV was lousy and it got a bit cold during the night probably due to the big windows in the room Other than that I was pleased with my stay and I would go back 
P =>   A great place to stay    While our hosts at the Arosfa were outstanding  the location of our room determined the quality of our experience  We spent a total of four nights over the course of   weeks  Our first night there we stayed in Room    which is located at the front of the hotel  overlooking Gower Street  The room was clean and the small en suite bathroom  spotless  While the bed was comfortable hard pillows   we were aware of the sounds of traffic most of the night  We can only imagine what it would have been like without the benefit of the storm windows which  happily  muffled  but did not mute  the rumble of lorries and cars Our travels took us away from London a week  but we booked a room for our return  Management kindly allowed us to leave some of our luggage in their care  We returned to the Arosfa        and were placed in the room next to the lounge  which was getting a fresh coat of paint and new furniture  including a flat screened T V     which faces the back yard  What a difference  No traffic sounds disturbed our sleep this time  and the pillows  Perfect    This room was also spotless  the housekeeping staff is outstanding  we got heart shaped soap with our fresh towels on Valentine s Day    There were samples of Gilchrist  amp  Soames bath gel  shampoo  and lotion in the bath The Arosfa serves a full English Breakfast  Jackie and Richard take good care of their guests  we felt quite pampered  We would stay here again on the strength of the staff  
P =>   Great Value in London My husband and I were very pleased with our stay at the Arosfa  The hotel is in a good location  just a few minutes walk from the Euston Square tube stop  and the price of    pounds night for an ensuite double room is a great value for London  Our room and bathroom were small  but that s to be expected in London  If you don t plan to spend much time in your room as we didn t  the size is not an issue  The breakfast was great and really set us up for a day full of sightseeing  The staff were extremely courteous and helpful  I had blisters on my feet after walking around the city all day  and when I inquired about band aids they promptly found some for me  They were also happy to let us leave our luggage at the hotel after checkout since we had a late evening flight  All in all  we were very happy with our stay and would definitely return to the Arosfa  
P =>   Disappointing After reading previous reviews  it was hard to believe we were staying at the same hotel  The room was incredibly small   even though we d booked a double room  the bed was smaller than a standard double bed  i e  less than     quot   and pushed up against a wall   if I pay for a double room  I expect a double bed  The pillows felt like pillowcases filled with bricks  On the topic of noise   oh  dear  Avoid the front of the hotel  as it s on a busy junction  which doesn t provide a steady flow of traffic  but instead has the noise of rapidly accelerating traffic away from the traffic lights   Having to jam windows shut with toiurist guides wasn t great either   The walls are paper thin  with you able to hear everything from the next rooms  both in this hotel and the one next door  Beware being a minute late for breafast   the door to the breakfast room will be locked On the plus side  the bathroom was small but was very clean  and the location is good  but that s about it  
P =>  A little gem What a great find  A beautifully kept small hotel in a great location everybody very friendly and helpful  I know the bathroom in our room was very very tiny but everything else made up for that  It was so clean it sparkled  It was great not to have people running up and down corridors  I really enjoyed my stay here lovely breakfast 
P =>   Safety issues Although there is much to be commended about this hotel  there are also safety issues  In particular  the shower and WC facilities in Room   are entirely unsuitable for those who are elderly  in any way immobile  or simply rather large  The single room itself was tiny  amp  quite basic  but clean and also quiet  However  the problems of accessing the shower and the W C  by means of an extremely high step were deeply offputting  The owner told me that this is the only room with such extreme problems  but the ensuite shower  amp  bathroom facilities in all rooms must also be extremely cramped  Potential visitors shouldn t be misled by the many positive reviews of this hotel into expecting anything more than is on offer  
P =>  Perfect  The Arosfa was the perfect hotel for us in London  The room and bathroom were simple and small  but very clean  A nice garden view and a large lounge more than make up for the small room  The best thing about the Arosfa is the value  The free Wi Fi and guest computer saved us a lot of time and trouble  The free breakfast also saved us a fortune  Each day we had freshly made eggs  bacon or sausage  cereal  grilled tomato  toast and coffee and juice  We were always stuffed when we left which saved us a lot of money since we rarely had to eat much for lunch  We also loved the Bloomsbury area  we always felt safe  and its proximity to the British museum and   different tube lines made it very convenient  We will definetly stay there again when we return to London  
P =>  Excellent London is a very expensive city  It is hard to find a decent room with bathroom inside without spending much money  The Arosfa could be the answer My evaluation Location  Excellent      meters from the tub Room  OK  Very clean but very small  The bathroom is really small Price  Good  for London standards     pounds night  full bathroom  Staff  Excellent  Mr  Hipolito and Mrs  Elza did everything they could to make our stay perfect Breakfast  Excellent  Very above average General opinion  I recommend it  
P => great This hotel was just what I needed after five sleepless nights in france  The room was spare but cozy and the staff were very friendly  There s a nice common room downstairs and a computer so you can check your email  The hotel is very central and you can walk to the west end  Great for a single traveler  
P =>   Get more than you expect    I stayed at Arosfa hotel from     till          and it was really good experience   exellent location  great price  tidy room  very good breakfast and cheerful owners  I ve got some experience with staying in London budget hotels and I should say I would definitely stay at Arosfa again  
P =>   Loved the Arosfa My wife and I booked this hotel directly from their website and received prompt replies to our inquiries from the owners Mr  and Mrs  Dorta  Upon our      AM arrival we were promptly shown to our room which was Room    on the main floor  The room was immaculately clean and looked out onto anstne fenced garden area  The room was adjacent to the hotel s lounge which was equipped with free internet access  a travel center loaded with brochures  and very comfortable sofas and loveseats to relax on  It was almost like having our own suite with the lounge right outside our room door  Yes  the bathroom was small and compact  but sparkling clean and efficient  The room contained individually controlled heating units which was to our liking as we like it on the cool side at night for sleeping  The full English Breakfast that was served each morning by Mrs  Dorta began with our choice of cereals  orange juice  and coffee  then was followed by eggs  bacon  sausage  baked beans  tomatoes  toast and jellies   all that you wanted  It was superb  Both Mr  and Mrs  Dorta made us feel welcome and were most accomodating to our every need  The hotel is located in the Bloomsbury Area and is filled with history all around  It s a short walk to the British Library  British Museum  and the many antiquarian bookstores in the area  There are some fine pubs with good deals for dinner close by  We felt very safe walking around the area after dark  We stayed here for our first three nights in London and would very highly recommend this B and B to anyone traveling to London  An  quot A   quot  
P =>   A lovely hotel It is a lovely hotel  The location is great   just a block away from an underground station    min walk from the British museum  easy to find quick bite around  nice neighborhood  The owners are friendly  The room and common areas are well maintained  very clean  very comfortable  We asked for an extra pillow and a hair dryer  they were already in our room when we arrived  Breakfast is excellent  much better than what we would expect  The room is a little bit small  especially the bathroom  But it is still manageable  with some skills  just pack accordingly   take travelling size   By the way  according to the European standard  the room is probably not THAT small  We have been to similar size room in Paris  but no where as clean as this one  We will definitely come back to this one if we visit London again    Highly recommended  
P =>   Wonderful place to stay  Arosfa is an all around great place to stay  I spent   nights there  along with a few members of my family  The rooms are clean and well cared for  the breakfast each morning was more than I expected  I thought it would just be rolls and orange juice  but it was a full breakfast with choice of eggs and bacon  cereal and toast   and the staff was wonderful  The owner helped me arrange for an early morning cab to the airport  and when I went downstairs at   am to meet my cab  the owner was there  He waited with me to ensure that I made it off safely  The location was also great  It is a   minute walk to the nearest Underground station  It is also just a       minute walk to Euston train station  and about       minutes walk from Kings Cross station  I would stay here again in a heartbeat  and I know my family members felt the same way  
P =>  Little gem in central London The reviews are right   this hotel was a wonderful find  I paid    pounds for a slightly larger single room  and had an absolutely quiet room on the top floor at the back  The hotel is immaculately clean  and the owners very friendly and helpful  Though the bathrooms are small  as pointed out  the low price  for London   the good situation  the friendliness  and cleanliness much more than make up for it  Great breakfast included  though it stops at   am   The hotel was right by University College London  important for me   Certainly highly recommended  
P =>  for a great hotel try the arosfa We recently returned from    nights accomodation at the Arosfa  whilst on holiday in London  Thoroughly recommended  owners are so friendly and helpful  A cheerful place to stay  Rooms were small and ensuites small  but when all one needs is somewhere to sleep and shower  one cannot go past this hotel  Appearance is neat and tidy  inside and out  Very quiet and a strict no smoking policy  We were very impressed  and would stay here again when our travels lead us london way  Other travellers from all over europe and the states  Breakfast in a central dining room a cheerful atmosphere and plenty to eat  would highly recommend  k and Dianne Richards  Australia  
P =>  Recommended  I agree with what the other reviews have said  great location  homey and welcoming  and the breakfast is a nice touch  The Arosfa was one of the few affordable places my family could find with a room that held four people AND had an ensuite bathroom  it was the size of a closet  but hey  it was ensuite    The free Internet in the sitting room was very helpful  and the owners were very accommodating when they let us store our luggage after we checked out since we had almost a full day before we needed to get to our next destination  Also  we could tell they took great pride in the place  as they had staff constantly cleaning   the front steps  railing  doorstep and windowsills literally sparkled  
P =>   Highly recommended   I stayed at the Arosfa with my nine year old daughter  for three nights  The hotel is excellent value for money and every area is cleaned to a high standard  The owners and staff are friendly and made us feel welcome Our room was compact and comfortable  overlooking the walled garden at the rear of the property  The garden was a real bonus  somewhere to sit and enjoy the complimentary coffee  Breakfast is served in the basement dining room  All the food served had been carefully selected for quality and the cooked breakfast was perfect I ve recommended the Arosfa to friends who will be visiting London and will certainly stay there again  
P =>  Great location very clean The Arosfa is in a great location across the street from University College London and a   minute walk to both the Goodge street and Euston tube stops and the British Museum  The room was average size for London  One bonus was that we had an extra twin bed in our room that we were able to store our luggage on  Breakfast was typical English breakfast and was quite good  The only negative was that the bathroom was truly miniscule  However  like everything else  it was completely spotless and a small inconvenience given all the other pluses  I would stay at the Arosfa again and highly recommend it  
P =>   Really Happy With Choice I chose Arosfa Hotel based on the reviews posted on TripAdvisor  Looking at Arosfa s website I was nervous about my choice but remembering all the positive reviews I stuck with it and I m very glad I did I stayed in a single room that overlooked the garden  it s not a pretty garden but given the hotel is on a busy street requesting a room on that side should ensure a quite nights sleep  The room was small but very comfortable  As you can imagine the bathroom was incredibly tiny  but I wasn t bothered by it  When you shower you have to close the door otherwise the steam will set off the alarm but again that s not a real inconvenience The room has a colour tv  telephone and heater but it s not air conditioned  I did spot a very small desk fan sitting on top of the cupboard available for use  Everyday the room was cleaned  bed was made and fresh towels were provided  In the sitting room there is a tea and coffee facility  free Internet and lots of brochures for things to do and see whilst visiting London  The hotel doesn t make any bookings for you to go see a show or do a tour  it s all up to you to organise for yourself Breakfast is a bit of an event  just sit down and be served  It s the same menu everyday but there s lots of it and your looked after quite well  The staff are very prompt at clearing your table and will continue to offer you endless servings of food until you say no more The hotel is situated in a great area  being a woman traveling on my own I felt quite safe wandering back late at night  It s just a two minute walk from Goodge St Station  about five minutes to the British Museum     minutes to Convent Garden and some great West End Productions  Buses also run down Gower St  I never caught one but they re easily available  There are lots of restaurants  ATM s  chemists  supermarkets and if you ask the staff they ll point you to the nearest laundromat about    minutes away  All staff were very friendly  the owners were quite welcoming  I didn t feel like I was staying in a hotel  I felt like I was a guest in someone s home  this is definantly a place I will use again  The strict no smoking policy is also an incentive  nothing worse than a stinky room and pillow reeking of smoke I paid    pound a night  very reasonable for a very expensive city  Hope my notes have helped  Enjoy your holiday    
P =>  Value for money Spent   nights at the Arosfa in        This small family run hotel is simple  clean and safe and offers real value for money at    pounds per night  including a hot breakfast  The rooms are tiny  and the ensuite bathrooms are also tiny  Ensuite bathrooms are like a caravan bathroom that have been dropped into the corner of the hotel room   there is a step of perhaps one foot up to enter the bathroom  Hotel does not have a lift  One odd thing about this little hotel is that it does not allow guests to have visitors in the rooms  If you want a base to sleep and breakfast at while you explore London then this is a good hotel  If you want your friends to call you will need to find somewhere else  
P =>  Don t really want to stay there again We stayed three nights in Arosfa in  e       room   on first floor   The temperature outside was very pleasant  around    degrees  The room  however  was a furnace  I can t imagine how the poor people who visit London in a heat wave manage to survive in Arosfa  I think I would have had a heart attack if I had stayed in that room in really hot weather  Opening the window wasn t an option either  because of the loud traffic noise outside on Gower Street The room and the en suite bathroom were very clean  though seriously tiny  The double bed was against the wall     not the most comfortable of arrangements  I think the proprietors have just put a double bed in a room which was meant to be a single  The bathroom was so small that when I bent down at the tiny sink to wash my face  my bottom would be right against the door Another problem was the high step leading to the bathroom  There was one step where there should have been two  When you were coming out of the bathroom into the room  you had to remind yourself that the bathroom floor was quite a bit higher than the room floor  so that you wouldn t stumble headlong into the room There was no hairdryer  but you could borrow one and return it when you left Now the real problem  there was no hospitality tray in the room  I like drinking coffee first thing in the morning  before I shower and start the day  No chance of that  you either had to go down to the basement for breakfast or down to the ground floor guest lounge where there was an instant coffee machine and paper cups  We paid     per night for our tiny teeny double room  Surely that would entitle us to a few coffee or tea bags and a kettle On top of this  they locked the lounge at       pm  So when you came back late at night and wanted to relax in the lounge with a tea or coffee  instead of returning to your hot cubby hole upstairs  you couldn t do that  Why on earth do they lock the guest lounge  especially when they don t provide hospitality trays in the rooms The best thing about Arosfa is that the couple running the place are polite and pleasant  When we arrived  they helped us carry our luggage upstairs  instead of handing us the keys and telling us where to go  as is the custom at this price range hotel in London  
P =>   A touch of home in busy London This hotel is not for those who need the conceirge expreience when traveling  The Dortas do provide the comforts of home  safe environment and value My stay was for   nights and then a return for   nights  Had different rooms in the stays  Of course  you want to stay in the rear if you are a light sleeper due to traffic  The biggest blessing for me was no lifts  If you are unfortunate to get a room near the lifts make it horrible to sleep  Dito on no ice machine to make that nights sleep even worse Tea and coffee are available in a lovely lounge with free WIFI or use of a PC  The lounge is closed from       p m  until      a m  So no noise for those in lower level rooms The Dortas know each of the guests and greet them warmly over a lovely English breakfast in the morning Loved the hotel but agree that the ensuite bathrooms are tiny and will not suit everyone  Smallish beds and you will have to bring your own toiletries  Small details to stay in a lovely guest house with charming owners  
P =>   Home Away From Home What a great place to stay  We are a family of four who stayed here for a week  The owners  the Dortas  were kind and wonderful  They made us feel very welcome  It s also a great location   easy to get to everything by bus  train or foot  Would go again in a heartbeat  
P =>   Outstanding Value There are three of us adults staying at this hotel  We told them thatwe would be arriving early and that we would appreciate extra pillowsand a hairdrier  We arrived at      am and our room was ready  The people that had our room earlier had left early that morning to catcha plane  and the owners cleaned our room to make it ready for us whenwe arrived  Sure enough  there were extra pillows and the hairdrier in our room  Everyone talks about the small bathrooms   and they are very  very small  I am   foot and weight about     Lbs and the bathroom was tight for me  but not so much for my wife and daughter Enough said  A full English breakfast is included each morning and it is very good   toast  eggs  coffee  tea  bacon  sausage  English beans  tomato  and cereal  They always ask if you want more  The location is excellent and in a very good section of London  near Regents park  Goodge Street station is two blocks away  This hotel isprobably the most clean hotel I have ever stayed in  and I have stayed in riotts  Hiltons  Hyatt  Conrad Hilton  etc  This hotel is unbeatable in price for London and in a great location  Around the corner  you can buy tube tickets  oyster cards  and the ATM is two blocks away  and good pubs within two blocks  The owners are extremely friendly and helpful  I have pictures that I will upload when I return to the States  If you are looking for a safe  clean Hotel with an outstanding VALUE  look no further  
P =>   Great Hotel  We stayed at this hotel for   days while visiting London and loved it  The owners were both so friendly and helpful and made the hotel feel like our home during our stay  The hotel is in a great location not far from several tube stops and the British Museum  The rooms are small but cozy and are the cleanest rooms I have ever seen in a hotel  We will definitely be staying at the Arosfa next time we visit London  
P =>  Lovely place  We stayed in Arosfa for a week in ust         It s such a lovely b amp b and the owners are absolutely friendly and kind We had a wonderful english breakfast every morning  with milk  cereals  eggs  bacon  toasts and so on   Rooms are a bit small but so clean and with all facilities  The location is good for the sightseeing with underground station nearby Absolutely we recommend it  Surely will stay again here  
P =>   A Great Base in London We spent four days in this hotel from ober   th until   th  The room was spotlessly clean and tidy and had adequate space for our group of three  The bathroom was very small but very clean  Mr and Mrs Dorta and their staff were very friendly and helpful  They gave us advice about facilities such as laundromats nearby and the best way to catch the tube to Heathrow  On our first day  we arrived early and our room was ready so we had use of it from   oclock in the morning  This was greatly appreciated as we had had a long night of travelling I would certainly stay here again when visiting London  The breakfasts were great too  
P =>   Just what I expected  I have stayed at the Arosfa twice now and the only reason I would stay elsewhere in London  well there are two reasons  If I ever win the lottery I intend to book in at Clarridge s  But  since I don t play the lottery  the only other reason I would book elsewhere is to do self catering Yes  the rooms are tiny  Yes  the bathrooms are hilarious  I had my elbow in the sink when sitting on the toilet  but at least I had my own toilet   Yes  there is no elevator  And yes  you may have to share a table at breakfast if it is a busy time  But if you do your research and know better than to expect an American style hotel experience  you will enjoy the Arosfa  Or  you can pay many times the price and get an American style hotel room elsewhere  But who goes to London to spend time in their hotel room anyway The Arosfa is in a good neighborhood  just a few minutes walk to a tube station  It is about halway in between and easy walking distance to either the British Library or the British museum  The only problem with the location is the Waterstone s directly across the street  This proved to be a problem as the first time I stayed there  when I checked in at the airport  I had to take books out of my suitcase because it was over the weight limit The rooms are tiny but otherwise pleasant and clean  Each room has its own tiny bathroom and there is a television in your room if you need to check the weather  etc  The breakfast is simple  but filling  with a choice of several cold cereals  plus toast  juice  tea  eggs and meat  There is also a pub around the corner that serves decent hot meals  And the cabbies can t believe you re getting that location at that price  
P =>   Loved it   highly recommended  I spent seven nights at the Arosfa Hotel last week  I found the hotel on Trip Advisor and the reviews posted here were accurate  thank goodness  I had a wonderful experience with the hotel and definitely plan to stay there again The Arosfa is extremely clean   I challenge anyone to find even a speck of dust  I stayed in a single room for     a night  I requested and received a room overlooking the garden  Gower is a rather busy street and the rooms facing the back are definitely quieter  The travel pillow I brought along was unnecessary as their pillow was of good quality and comfortable  I m not used to sleeping in a single bed  but that was fine after the first night The entire hotel is strictly non smoking and this is enforced  Big selling point for me  actually  The owners and two staff were very friendly and accommodating  For breakfast  I was offered the choice of four cereals  eggs  bacon  sausage  toast  tea  coffee and orange juice  I don t eat meat and Mrs  Dorta immediately offered fresh tomato  I was quite surprised to see TWO tomatoes were served in wedges along with my eggs as I expected a couple of slices  Twice during my visit  grilled tomatoes were prepared for everyone  The coffee was very good  unlike the coffee served in most British establishments  It appears the helpings are unlimited as I saw people start off with cereal then have a full breakfast of eggs  bacon and sausage  Mrs  Dorta offered to get more toast etc  On my last morning there before heading to the airport  Mrs  Dorta served me a bigger breakfast than my usual order for the previous week and said   quot you have a big day ahead and will need it quot   It s the small personal touches like this that will bring me back and ensure I recommend the hotel to friends and strangers alike The launderette is a     minute walk from the hotel and there are several tube stations within walking distance  The theatre district  major museums and other attractions are all within walking distance  There are major bus routes on Gower and the number    will take you directly to Trafalgar Square  I got into the habit of just boarding a bus to see where it would take me  I had purchased a week long Oyster travel card for        for unlimited travel  One tip   if you need to do a laundry while there  do not eat at the cafe across the street  same side of chmount as Laundromat   It has a lovely little patio along two sides of the building  but the peroxide blonde owner  German or Swiss  couldn t tell  is the most miserable person I encountered during my entire time in London  Barely suppressed contempt when taking my order and she fully unleashed her angry  miserable personality on her poor staff  If I hadn t already paid and the coffee prepared  I would have walked out  I asked the one poor chap who bore the brunt of her humiliating abuse if it was an off day or if she was always like this and he said that she was always like that  He was looking for another job When travelling via the tube to the hotel from the airport  Goodge is the closest station  but the Warren station  a few more blocks away  is more convenient as it is one line from Victoria station  One has to change lines to get to Goodge from Victoria  It is easier to walk three blocks extra with luggage than to change lines and deal with stairs The Sainsbury  pubs and restaurants all shut down by     ish in the immediate vicinity of the hotel  but if you walk on Tottenham Rd  towards Warren station  you will find a Sainsbury s open until midnight  Again  the Arosfa is very clean and has an excellent location  I feel confident in recommending this hotel to anyone travelling on a budget as it is good value for the money in London  
P =>   Lovely Little Hotel We stayed at the Arosfa for two nights in ch       Yes  rooms are small  but very clean  How much time do you spend in a hotel room when in London  The Arosfa ticks all my boxes  clean  excellent location and a hearty cooked breakfast  can t do better at the price  
P =>   Highly Recommend Arosfa We stayed at Arosfa for   nights in  and were very pleased  Our room and the whole hotel were very clean and the location was excellent  We especially liked the easy access to the British Museum  The breakfast was excellent as well  The only concern  as mentioned in previous reviews  was the small bathroom  Ours was about the size of an airplane bathroom  This did not bother us  but it may be a problem for larger than average size people  If you can  ask for the double room on the ground floor facing the garden  it is absolutely peaceful and relaxing  
P =>  excellent facilities at the arosfa We stayed for   nights in        The staff was very friendly and the rooms were spotlessly clean  You can tell that the owners take great pride in their facility  It is in a great location close to public transit  The next time we are in London we will stay here  
P => Wonderful Resting Place  We spent five days at the Arosfa in early   We were impressed with the cleanliness of our room and the friendliness of the staff  Being close to several tube stations and within walking distance of the British Museum and several London theatres made this an ideal location  The English breakfast was tasty and served with a smile  When we return to London  the Arosfa will be our hotel  
P => I would certainly recommend the Arosfa Hotel  
P =>  A very warm welcome  
P =>  Fifth time and would go back again  
P =>  Great value for money

P =>   Cheap Accommodation close to Kings Cross I selected this because it is walking distance from Kings Cross Railway and Tube Station  At night time you can hop onto the tube and Leicester Square is only   stops away Hotel is budget accommodation with small rooms  but i did find it clean  I paid     for a twin room with breakfast  Good value Breakfast is basic continental  but fills a hole I think if i was coming again i would look elsewhere  but would not be too disappointed if i ended up back here  
P =>   Don t stay here unless desperate or broke It s a filthy hotel  The staff have no attitude for hospitality and appear to have no idea about London  which was a real problem for us  As a result of the Arriva Hotel s incompetence  we had a transfer booked to  Stansted  Airport  instead of Heathrow Airport  This resulted in us missing our flight and having to pay a lot of money for new tickets and overnight accommodation to fly out the following day  The guy on reception didn t know how to book this transfer  The rooms aren t clean and the beds aren t comfortable  But if you re on a budget  or desperate  then stay here at your own risk  Just don t trust the staff to do anything for you or give you the right directions  or disinfect the toilet etc etc  You will need to do all of that yourself  And  I wouldn t eat the breakfast either as I m sure they leave it out overnight without covering it  
P =>  An excellent hotel for your stay The hotel is located at a   to    min walk from Euston and King s Cross Tube stations  The Hotel is Pretty good and the front desk people arr soo good in solving all of my problems what i had in my stay of   days  I had been from India to this hotel and found very worthy for my money  The hotel got many attractions around as it is located in central London  All the areas like Oxford circus  piccalilly circus  soho  camedon town and lots London attractions are very near   The hotel has    hrs front desk where a man is continuously seated for the safety of guests  The main advantage of this hotel is it got many pubs and bars near it and more over food restaurants and grocery shops around it  
P =>   Good stay in a good location We stayed here for   nights  the hotel is located in a good location just   minutes walk from King s Cross  sant Pancras tube station and this allows the hotel to recover point Breakfast was continental  but in good quantity  Probable the cantine is a bit small for the hotel but we always found a table to seat Check in desk was fine but the guys did t give us so many information I love London and I think this is a good place to stay  
P =>   Arriva Hotel for location and value  Positives Great location     minutes from Kings Cross St Pancras tube and railway stations  Newly installed security cameras  Overall  I found the staff responsive to my needs  The room was medium small in size  but heaps bigger then some of the places I looked at  The was a remote controlled television  fridge  phone  hairdryer and tea coffee facilities in the room  The bathroom looked like it had been newly renovated  Soap and shampoo provided  The room was cleaned each day with fresh towels provided  Breakfast was included in the price  This consisted of cereal  toast with jams cold meat cheese  juice  and tea coffee  The breakfast room gets quite busy towards the end of service  so I suggest get down there earlier  I did not see any mice Negatives Although the sheets were clean  the hotel doesn t use mattress or pillow protectors  Although convenient  the bar fridge makes an intermittent droning noise that wakes you up in the middle of the night  The walls are paper thin  Could hear doors creaking  which could use some WD    Occasionally a kind of sewerage smell came out of the vent in the bathroom  The lock on the window appeared to have been broken previously  but still worked  Having to hand my room key in every time I went out  
P =>   Good quality budget hotel I booked into this hotel for   nights  It was the first time I d stayed in the King s Cross area and I arrived with a little trepidation My fears were unfounded though  I was given a quite spacious  for London  clean room at the front  with a nice  clean modern bathroom and shower The double bed was firm and comfortable  how I like  em   and my stay was fine Though continental breakfast was included in the rate  I only dined once  and it was ok My only negative is that the walls are quite thin and it seemed I was put next to someone who was hard of hearing because I could hear their tv above my own  
P =>   Excellent Location An unpretentious  but geat value  for London  hotel  located very conveniently close to the St Pancreas international terminal and Kings Cross Metro station Tea and coffee masking facilities in the room a real bonus Only negative was the ever bored looking front desk person and the very stale croissants served up each morning  
P =>  Good value The location is convenient  the room was small but clean and the refridgerator was an added bonus  Breakfast was not fabulous  but had all the basics including cereal  toast  juice  coffee  canned fruit  cold cuts and cheese  We were in the back  so noise was not an issue but  being on the groundfloor  we noticed that the window is accessible from the ground and was not locked until we noticed it late in our first day  Had it been warm out  it would have been foolhardy to leave the window open at night  but closing it wasn t a problem during our autumn stay  The only other concern was that  like most European hotels  keys are left at the front desk when you leave for the day  When you return  you simply give them your room number and they hand over your keys without checking in any way that it is actually your room  The keys are clearly visible and a thief could easily spot what room keys are available and claim to be in that room  
P =>   Very basic but handy location This is the very definition of budget accommodation It s rated two star because it s cheap and basic  The place was clean and quiet for central London but does have very small rooms that seem s little run down  It is  however  VERY close to Kings Cross St Pancras and not a million miles from Euston for that matter If you re looking for somewhere to crash before an early Eurostar  or a very simple base you intend to spend little time in apart from sleeping and showering  this is well worth a shot  The price difference between this and a chain hotel per night is well worth considering if you re on a budget Didn t try breakfast  as we left at the crack of dawn to try to check in for Eurostar the day after the tunnel fire  Wifi was very slow  but only a fiver Could do worse  but don t expect a palace  
P =>   It sucks  My partner and I stayed at the Hotel Arriva just for the weekend and found it incredibly disheartening  The men at the front desk  and it was always men  were unhelpful  angry  and had an air of resentment that they should have to help any of their guests  They certainly seemed like they did not like their jobs  Our room was no more than a box  which was to be expected for such a price in London  but the room itself was simply trashy  It looked like a boy s dorm room from a US university  The furniture was cheap  worn  broken  you name it  light fixtures and other decorations were put up by amateur s  and overall  we had a sense of it being dirty     The bathroom was the only clean area in the whole room  although it was so small it was no real escape from the room The breakfast was ridiculous  They have too small a room for all their guests  so if you come while everyone else is there  you have to wait in the hall  And NO ONE in the hotel is kind or helpful  Even the women helping with breakfast were angry and resentful to help Finally  although the road where Hotel Arriva sits looks like a quaint small road  it is a major thoroughfare  and if you have the unlucky experience of having a room on the street  you ll hear traffic all day    and all night  The walls and windows allow the noise in as if you were sitting right on the pavement below Overall  this was a very uncomfortable and unhappy choice for us  but we ll never make the mistake again  We will not return to Hotel Arriva  under any circumstances  
P =>  About as good as you ll get for a budget hotel in London The best thing about this hotel is that it s about a   minute walk from King s Cross and St  Pancras Station   crucial if you re taking the subway tube around London or the train to from London  The rooms are pretty small  but decent and pretty clean  The only real beef my mother and I had with this hotel was the plumbing   the toilet did not flush very well and no matter how many times we asked someone to fix it  it never got fixed properly  The breakfast here was decent  considering it was included  Overall the place was nice for the price when compared to other hotels that were MUCH more expensive  I do not think I would go back  but it was a good hotel for tourists and not bad if all you really intend on doing is sleeping here  
P =>   Small Rooms Well located The Arriva Hotel is well located  in the Kings Cross area    min walk from the Station  with metro  bus and train  The building is tipically in English vitorian style  Rooms seemed modernly refurbished  small thou   even smaller than expected  only   person fits between the bed and the wall  bathroom doesn t allow much movements with tiny washbasin   However  they were clean and unfortunately the regular for London s extremely high prices My room had window to the back  so it was quiet  Don t expect to much from the breakfast and room  
P =>   cheap  I knew this hotel is only a    and i was only staying there for   night  the outside looked alright but when you get into the rooms you think twice  should i be staying here    the fridge made sooo much noise  the tv had really bad signal and might as well been in the roof  the bathroom was clean but the shower was rubbish  threre was sticky marks on the sides in the room  over all not that clean  the man on the front desk was helpfull  it is somewhere cheap and close to kings cross station that is the only good thing i can say about this hotel 
P =>   Good budget hotel Small  cosy  clean hotel  For approx     night in central london it was worth it  Good location  down from kings cross  Room really hot  so wouldnt too too good when weather is warm  Breakfast was a cheap continental  no brown bread   I read the reviews about it and it was quite true  Dont expect the best  just somewhere cheap  clean and good location  
P =>  A Great value for money  A small and cosy hotel in a very good location few minutes walk from King s Cross station  There is a couple of nice pubs around the corner and plenty of shops to buy food and drinks  Room size is quite good  and the in room amenities include tea  amp  coffee maker and a fridge  I was also surprised to learn that such a small hotel has a wireless Wi Fi    But unfortunately it does not cover the rear part of the hotel  so make sure you check with them before you bring your laptop The receptionists were very friendly and helpful  especially John who would go out of his way to make sure you are enjoying your stay  upon my arrival  the window in my room would not open  I called the reception and in a few minutes he was there trying to open it for me  and when he couldn t  he changed my room promptly without me needing to ask The drawbacks were the non stopping loud bangs from doors slamming shut  and the relatively small breakfast room  Otherwise it certainly is a nice  clean place and a good value for     
P =>   Exactly was it says on the tin My wife and I stayed at the Arriva for   nights in y We were looking for a budget hotel  and thats exactly what we got Thats not to say there was any thing wrong with the hotel The room was small but comfy  The on suite toilet and shower room was imaculate  it actually looked brand new  The rooms were made every day and fresh towels were always left There is a fridge in the room which was a little bit big but a good idea The reception staff were very friendly and the the reception is maned    hours   good for a late return from a night on the town The only disapointing thing was the breakfast  advertised as Continental Breakfast  but was really only Toast and tea coffee Also the noise from the traffic at night and early morning is quite loud if you are a light sleeper The location is good  a few mins walk to Kings Cross and if your feeling energetic the walk to covent garden is about    mins So if you are looking for a cheap  quot base  ie place just to sleep quot  for a few nights in London the Arriva is Ideal  if you re the type of person who spends a lot of time in your hotel room I would think again  There is no Bar in the hotel  But Swintons next door is a great place  friendly staff and great food  
P =>   Budget accommodation   nights in central London does not come cheap but a room at Arriva fits the budget traveller  Very good showers  clean beds  compact rooms   but then one is not going to London to be in a bedroom for long  Handy fridge  Breakfast is worth missing as the room is too small  the tables tight and the food is useful only as fuel for the action packed day ahead  Ideal location and the traffic is an issue but then   it s a city centre  Excellent having    hour manned reception  Would I stay again  Yes  
P =>   Great for budget  Myself and my partner were visting london for the first tme on our own  we were going to see a theatre show  the hotel was great the location was easily found from kings cross station  The room itself was satisfactory however it was clean and tidy  our room faced onto the main road and we expected loud noises from trafic but there wasnt we had a peceful stay  The staff at the hotel were genrly helpful however a bit misrable  We are returing to london again in feburary and are planing to stay at the arriva hotel again  i would advise young people i e  students or families looking for a cheap break in central london  
P =>   Very Poor I paid over     for a single room  The room overlooked a main road and the noise from the all night traffic was awful The bed was jammed into the corner between the window and a fridge kitchen sink    The fridge proceeded to hum and whir at various intervals during the night  The floor on the window side of the bed appeared not to have been swept since garet Thatcher was in power and the metal bed end clanged against the wall every time I moved on the bed  At least the provided Bible did the job as a temporary wedge to keep it off the wall And also  unfortunately  as well as the traffic noise to contend with  the walls are so thin that every door bang in the hotel is heard  and if someone breaks wind five rooms down  you re going to hear it and probably smell it as well Finally the  luggage room  was a box room with no security lock or anything to stop some other guest helping themself to your belongings Avoid like the plague  
P =>   decent value for short stay I needed a cheap place to stay   nights while attending a weekend of concerts  the hotel was listed on the website of one of the venues   My single room was quite small  but I didnt plan to spend much time there anyway  The room was clean and decently maintained  The pillow was pretty lumpy  but I ve had that at much more expensive places too  The room had a working fridge  sink   amp  water boiler  and there was a fresh supply of instant coffee  amp  tea delivered every day  I missed the breakfast  as it was only served until  am  I stocked the fridge instead with pastries  amp  fruit from a nearby grocery store  The TV was small  but worked  no cable  I had no problem with running hot water  and the desk clerk even got me into my room an hour early  due to my plane arriving ahead of schedule The location is very convenient  being that all the tube lines pass into King s Cross station  I would stay here again  under similar circumstance  I wouldnt use a room this small for a long stay   but that goes for all hotels  not just this one  
P =>  They Know Nothing I ve stayed in worse places and the location was excellent    convenient to City Centre and to Heathrow  via Pickadilly Underground   The housecleaning staff work hard and my room was cleaned daily  The breakfast was okay but basically toast and coffee or tea  The negatives  a lumpy  uncomfortable bed and even lumpier pillow  and a room that was only a bed and small table  with a tiny TV located remotely in the upper corner  The walls were paper thin and the finish was poor  the renovations were performed by people without any training or skill  Anybody could have done a better job Fair enough  it is a budget hotel  What is UNFORGIVEABLE is the ignorance of the desk staff  They receive business due to their location and it is therefore inexcusable that they know next to nothing about the operation of the trains going to Heathrow  The clerk was also blissfully unaware that the neighbourhood laundramat had closed apparently several weeks before my stay  I wasted time finding this out on my own  but fortunately I didn t trust them with travel information Similarly there is no excuse for not knowing how to operate their own telephone system  don t expect a wake up call from this place  although my next door neighbours were probably thrilled when the call meant for me woke THEM up at      a m  Well  for once the paper thin walls worked to my advantage   When I pointed the error out to the clerk  he said it was  quot bizarre quot  but I replied that it was really the result of his mistake  Such an attitude but it is London after all  People who avoid taking responsibility  it must be the mission statement of the Arriva Hotel  
P =>   Location location location  And very clean  This is a fine hotel  Especially when you are on business with a low budget then this is perfect  Clean  easy to reach  not expensive I stayed for two nights  paid    pounds per night  I got a sparkling new bathroom and a clean room facing the back   South  As a result it was quiet  A big plus is the location  it is very close to Kings Cross station  not even worth taking a cab  but in a quiet street Another plus is the room window  it can open up in full  Exceptional given that many hotels constrain the windows to prevent suicides  Arriva is confident that its guests doin t get derpessed too quickly    Breakfast was okay  sufficient to get you going and sufficiently obesity aware Staff is friendly There is no AC  however AC in London is not the norm  most of the time it is rather cool  Open the window and a breeze will cool you down One thing though  please replace the flat iron  I tried to iron shirts  but a previous user dirtied the iron  so I could not really use it  
P =>  Not worth it London is a very expensive city and it is known that you get no five star hotel for a deal  so I did not expect much of the Arriva for the price we paid  But it was even worse  We spent two nights at the hotel  We were four people and had two rooms booked  Only one room was ready and the  somewhat nice  clerk at the day shift promised us that the other room will be on the same floor  When we got back in the evening the  really not nice  clerk did just not care and gave us a room on another floor  The room on the ground level was horrible    run down and no space to move  The one on the first floor was better  clean bathroom but it took half an hour to take a shower because the water pressure was zero  The door that leads to the floor would slam shut and from early morning on every minute you heard a BANG  The breakfast is typically british    toast and jam  Some cereal  The only good thing about this place was the location  Close to Kings Cross  Very convinient  But overall I would not stay at this hotel again  
P =>  good deal A good comfortable small hotel    good price as well  Upon my arrival  I received an amicable welcome from the employees there and a suitable room  The breakfast is excellent and rooms are equally clean  Word of caution however  if you receive one of the rooms in the level below ground level  ask to change    the traffic will wake you rather early  Otherwise    good place and good price  
P =>  I guess you get what you pay for  My wife and I stayed at the Arriva for five nights  and really didn t know what to expect  The reception clerk  evening shift  was certainly not friendly or helpful  he just couldn t be bothered with such an exorbitant request as for an extra pillow  I decided to stay out of his face for our entire stay  The room and bathroom were tiny for anyone over five feet tall  dishevelled and tattered  with only one ceiling light  so forget about reading in bed  I wouldn t want to stay at this hotel on warm days  since turning off the radiator came up short with burning hot uncovered and uninsulated pipes leading up to it  My wife had problems with crackling and dripping sounds from pipes and refrigerator and had to take light sleeping pills  I would ve slept through the blitz  so I was not bothered  We requested to change rooms from our evening shift friend       but were told that every room was just the same  a blatant lie  since we sneaked a peak at one of the other rooms on our floor  Everything was mostly clean though  clean sheets and towels  changed daily  Breakfast was fine  with friendly smiling staff  The location of the hotel is fine  close to King s Cross tube station and many restaurants  cafes  pubs and shops around  But why on earth would the Swintons pub be closed on saturday and sunday  My recommendation to the hotel owners would be to hire friendlier reception staff  women maybe  like the breakfast room staff    
P => Bella esperienza My friends and I spent about two months at the Arriva in      because of our research at the British Library  Our budget was not much  we knew we would spent most of our money in libraries and bookshops  so we chose the Arriva for   good reasons at least    very near the Library  that is saving of time and money    ensuit bathroom  for    Italian  girls this was fundamental    cheap  breakfast included    fridge and sink in the room  so we got organized and saved much money  went to the supermarket and prepared soups  salads  sandwiches  We were not mistaken  the building and the room were not fantastic  but the staff was very kind  especially the young man on nightshift     The area is well served  by bus  tube or train you can go almost everywhere  In the surroundings you can find many stores  restaurants and fast food so you can buy and eat whatever you want  We missed Italian coffee very much  but if you have an electric moka or cooker you can stay wonderfully Unfortunately  when we had to book for our next research the Arriva was fully booked  so we stayed in a different hotel  and it WAS different    
P =>  No Problems  My fiancee and I just returned from London where we stayed   nights at the Arriva Hotel  I must say  after reading some of the reviews on here  I was a little nervous  But we had no problems with the hotel  We arrived early and even though check in was not for another     hours  they went ahead and put us in a room  The people at reception were friendly enough  This is a very basic hotel  The room and bathroom were small  but both were very clean  They were doing some painting while we were there  so all the walls looked really nice  The Arriva has a good location  about   min walking from King s Cross Station  This is not the best area of London  but if you are smart about your traveling  you will have no problems  I believe every Tube line except the District Line stops at King s Cross  which makes travel from there very convenient  Also  being in a busy area of town  there are plenty of places to eat  many of which are open late  All in all  I would definately recommend this hotel to budget travelers  If you are looking for something nice  this is not your hotel  But if you just want a clean place to sleep  the Arriva should work for you   
P =>   Average King s Cross budget This is about average for a budget hotel in London  Excellent location  just around the corner from King s Cross  although the small entrance is easy to miss Reception guy was polite enough  Room was OK  a decent enough size  neither sparkling clean or absolutely filthy  bed was OK  only gripe was the rather dim lighting in the room which made it feel a bit grim  I stayed one night  arriving late and leaving early  so it was perfect for my needs  I wouldn t recommend it as a base for a longer stay  but for a cheap place to crash for the night it s ideal The area around King s Cross is not the nicest  but there are plenty of people around and you ll be fine if you don t take unnecessary risks  
P =>  A very satisfied customer I was pleased with my choice when visiting London recently for a conference  I only wanted a clean  comfortable and safe place to stay  so I could spend my money on books instead of hotel bills  and that is what I got  Brilliant value  excellent location  very quiet for central London  The breakfast was more than adequate and the bed very comfortable  Only complaint   no curtain on window  but I improvised and used the towels   Would stay there again without any hesitation  
P =>  You get what you pay for but clean warm and comfortable  I stayed at this hotel and after reading the reviews think it was better than i expected  It was cheap so you don t get a lot but the the room was clean and comfortable and the staff was cooperative although a few smiles would have made it friendlier  Not a real nice area but convenient base to visit london  Breakfast was OK  just cereal and toast but again you get what you pay for  I would have no hesitation in staying here again although I think the front rooms may suffer from a bit of traffic noise 
P =>  Excellent for the Budget Minded Just spent   nights in London at the Arriva Hotel  Located in very convenient Kings Cross  tube and national rail  this hotel is not very expensive   so don t expect too much but a bed  your own shower bathroom  a very basic light breakfast  Do make sure you ask for a room in the back  not on Swinton Street  as the street noise is a bit much  The manager  John Girglis is very professional and was a pleasure to meet after emailing over the past few weeks  The pub Swinton s is literally next door and the food is inexpensive and a very local flavor  This will be a very basic tourist orientated hotel   don t expect bellmen and the such   you will get what you pay for  Why spend a bloody fortune in London on a place to stay where you are just going to lay your head down  Visiting London as a tourist is just that  seeing the sights  not the hotel  Enjoy  
P =>  Just what you need My girlfriend and I took a chance with the Arriva and we are glad we did  Originally attracted to it s location close to Kings Cross  a major transportation hub  and it s private bathroom in every room  we were then pleased to find out that the rooms were very clean and a decent size  Friends of ours that stayed on the second floor actually had a room larger than my NYC apartment  They provided a free breakfast  cereal  toast  OJ   which was fine  Sometimes the dining room gets crowded  so if you are planning on packing the most into your day make sure you eat early  A quick note about the area  Kings Cross reminds me a lot of Penn Station in NYC  Most of the city s tube and bus lines have a stop at Kings Cross so you can get to any part of the city with relative ease  and within    minutes of catching a train or bus   This is a good thing  because Kings Cross has little to offer on it s own  
P =>   Affordable budget hotel not the best not the worst  I knew that this was not a   star hotel when I went there  If you are budget minded and adventurous  the Arriva is a great place  The rooms are comfortable and basic  close to the trains and subways and has fairly decent food and convenience stores within a block or two  Breakfast was basic but filling  plenty of giant English toast  butter  jam  milk  cereal  juice  coffee and tea  The King s Cross area is not a scary area  we walked around late at night with no problem  The night staff spoke fairly good English and the manager was always helpful  I would go back if I wanted to save money and enjoy other things in London rather than spending a fortune on a hotel One word of caution  beware of making calls from the hotel  go to a pay phone or get a toll free long distance card  I learned a valuable lesson about British phone rates at check out  
P => Best deal in London I don t know what all the griping is about this hotel  It is the least expensive hotel in London central  The rooms are clean  typically small by American standards  but on a par with most European hotels The rooms all are ensuit  have sinks  tv  fridges and a TELEPHONE in each room  rare at even some of the better hotels in London  It is ideally located near King s Cross and St  Pancras Tube stations and the Thames Link  direct service to Gatwick Forget the breakfast  however  cereal and toast is it  Go around the corner to McDonald s  Also there is an internet cafe within about     mile of the hotel and very cheap   p per hour I go to London often and was a little leery after reading the reviews  Sure glad I took a chance and stayed there  John the manager is very accommodating and efficient I ll be back  
P =>  Arriva Hotel and Kings Cross Just came back from a trip to London         and hadan enjoyable time  However  the basic costs were very high when compared to a major city in the states  We stayed at the Arriva Hotel at Kings Cross  I havestayed there before and the costs are very reasonablefor London  The hotel is very basic but is very clean Ask for a first floor  backside room for a more quietexperience  There are fridges in each room as well asa sink  All rooms are ensuite  Kings Cross is a majortransportation terminal for the tube and trains  A great location  I would recommend the Arriva Hotel if you are interested in keeping costs down  Continental breakfastis offered  Many restraurants in the area  Easy links toall airports  Remember a dollar equals about     pound  
P =>  Beware   dodgy dealings Arriva is a rip off establishment  Be particularly wary if single  It charges a single supplement on a single room  note a supplement should only be applied if a single person occupies a double or twin room  not on a room meant for singles anyway Had a rude welcome by the man at reception who eyed me up and down suspiciously  and then found I had a room that smelt rank  Note it says a lot when a hotel advertises opening windows as a feature   The website advertises bathrooms in all rooms  not so  Also there is no satelite TV  They adverstise fridges in all rooms  except mine it seemed  It was so noisy  being on a main road  that I hardly slept even with ear plugs  The bed was wonky  leaning at an acute angle Breakfast was a chore as there is a tiny basement room to cater for the entire hotel  and I had to return twice in an hour before I was eventually placed on someone else s table Please avoid this place  there are lots of better hotels  just ask around 
P =>  arriva hotel we arrived at arriva hotel on sept   th we booked a Quad room   adults when we arrived at the room we saw   double bed and   sofa bed for children  so when asked the staff for an another bed or room but if we wanted a different room we had to pay    pounds each night  the sofa bed was so small just for   adult on the internet page the room looks big with   beds and without a wall in the middle on the room and each morning we had to wait at least    minutes before we could have breakfast cos the breakfast room is very small we won t stay there again 
P =>  BAD hotel don t go to this hotel people  We order a quad room for   adults and we only got a sofabed and a double  The sofabed  a thin one  was broken and it wasn t for   adults for   person only  We couldn t get another double bed  We only could get another room but for    pounds p  night     BAD SERVICE  there were enough do The breakfast was simple and  we had to wait   min  for a table  AND THE TOWELS STINK  BLEEEH  No ventilation at the bathroom and the door of the bathroom wasn t a door  you couldn t lock it  very BAD    curtain was broken and because of that there was alot of light in the room at nightBAD BAD HOTEL  people don t go to the ARRIVA HOTEL     PLZ don t go  
P =>  they lie to us We booked a quad room for   adulds when we arrive at our quad room there stood a double bed and a sofa bed the sofabed was too small for   adulds when we ask about it the man at reception said the room we booked was a family room I showed my revesation that we booked a quad room for   adulds  The hotel would n give us a second room for free only if we pay    english pond each night And the room we had has   curtain hanged for the window  And the breakfast room was too small we have to waid for    minutes every morning for a table  
P =>  You get what you pay for  INTRODUCTIONMy family and I had reserved two rooms for three nights commencing on y         because the  quot discounted quot  price was inexpensive  the location was convenient  and I anticipated being able to cook a pot of Kraft macaroni and cheese for my twelve year old son  who eats little else   My mother and two teenaged daughters shared a  quot triple quot  room  My son and I shared a twin room  Both were ensuite  THE GOOD    The location was moderately convenient to King s Cross train and underground  The facilities adjacent to the train station include restaurants  a pharmacy  chemist   two internet cafes  various fast food joints  and a self serve laundramat     The breakfast was palatable  albeit not varied or filling     Having an elevator was convenient     The size of the rooms and of the bathrooms was adequate  As for those persons who complain about the size of their rooms  bear in mind that you are paying very low rates at a hotel in a block of converted row houses in the most expensive city in the world  You get what you pay for  If you think inexpensive London hotel rooms are small  don t ever go on a cruise  where they can cram two twin beds  a bathroom shower  closets a sitting area  a television set and life jackets into as little as     square feet      The rooms were moderately clean  although the grout in the bathrooms could have used some mildew remover     The staff were very courteous     The National Alamo car rental location is just a ten minute walk away  THE BAD    Parking in the area is almost non existent and you are right next to the London Congestion Zone  Don t make any wrong turns  Personally  having visited in ch and having spent a fortune on taxis crawling about the city  I think that it is foolish to rent a car in London  I had a car reserved for a week  but wound up canceling the first three days and picking it up only on the morning when we were actually leaving London     Argyle Street is fairly noisy and gets a lot of commuter traffic starting very early in the morning  We had our windows open because of the heat of the city  but had to close them to escape the noise     The vaunted  quot kitchenettes quot  in each room were not what we anticipated  There were no cooking facilities  just a small refrigerater freezer  with enough room for an ice tray  and another sink  They were convenient for keeping sodas and beer cold  but served little other purpose  THE UGLYThe beds were in terrible condition  The springs provided no support  I commandeered the better bed in my room and I still sagged into the middle  The  quot triple quot  room consisted of a double bed and a sofabed  The mattress in the double bed sagged so much that the girls rolled into each other  One of them spent the night in the bathtub  On the sofabed  my mother would have sagged down to the floor  but for the fact that her body dropped down into the frame  The experience left her feeling like she had been sleeping on a a rack of prison bars   The ladies were offered another room with three twin beds  but did not even enter it because it reeked of cigarette smoke   CONCLUSIONI was not expecting much  Then again  I did not ask for much  I wanted only a place where I could drop off my suitcases  sleep at night  and take a shower in the morning  I was disappointed  I suspect that the  quot discounted quot  rate we received was a marketing ploy  We left after one night and stayed at the Montana Excel in Argyle Square  While that place had its shortcomings as well  it was more comfortable  more convenient to King s Cross  much more quiet  and provided a full English breakfast for an equivalent price  
P =>  Not very professional We have booked a double room the  st of  for a   nights stay from y   th  When we arrived  we were told there was a problem with the room and we were sent to another hotel    minutes walk  for getting a so called similar room  The room we got was in no way similar to the pictures we can see on the Internet site or on the leaflet of the Arriva Hotel The room  number     is in the European Hotel        Argyle Square  It s the tiniest double room you can imagine  The bed is pushed in the corner against the wall  one third of the length against the window  Next to the bed  a path of about    centimeters   At the bottom of the bed  against the window   a small chest of drawers with a TV on it  Not any space  neither between the bed and the piece of furniture nor between the piece of furniture and the wall  The only light comes from a bulb hanging from the ceiling  and you have to get off the bed to turn the light  Imagine when you re sleepling against the wall     The ensuite bathroom is cast in the same mould   
P =>  Room without a view My rating actually lies in between  quot Terrible quot  and  quot Okay quot      there were  quot terrible quot  things as no window in our room as well as  quot okay quot  things  like the price and the location Upon arrival the triple room we had booked weeks ago wasn t available and we had to split up into a double room with ensuite bathroom  shower s drain was blocked  and a twin room with the bathroom accross the floor  through two doors and four steps down  which wasn t overly clean The next day we were moved to our triple room that was located in the basement with no windows at all Breakfast was rather bleak  some cornflakes and toast  eight pieces of toast for three people  and either tea or coffee  The dishes weren t overly clean either and the table cloth badly stained Next time I ll visit London  I ll definitely chose another hotel  
P =>  Great Hotel Bargin Just returned from   nights in London at the Arriva Hotel and was very happy with the accommodations  I have paid more at other hotels and gotten much less  Convenient to Kings Cross tube station  Several good restaurants by the station  Walking distance to British Library and British Museum  Room clean with private bath  Some street noise so you might want to ask for a room at the back  Lifts to all floors  Basic breakfast  cereal toast  but all you can eat  I would stay there again  
P =>  Good value for budget travellers The Arriva is a   minute walk from King s Cross station  It s on a busy road  so there will be some traffic noise  the rooms do have secondary double glazing so when the windows are closed  noise is somewhat reduced  The reception is open    hours and gives a nice impression  there is a lift  The rooms have been refurbished to some degree   however  the tiling in the shower cubicle needs re doing  shower curtains need replacing  The bed and bedding were clean  the carpets needed replacing  or a steam clean   Tea and coffe making facilities are in the room  as is a fridge The breakfast  continental  is good as it s included free Considering the location  good value Recommended only to those on a budget who need to stay in the King s Cross area  It s not a nice area to stay   vice is prevalent

P => Quite Acceptable Choice Have been staying at The Millennium fair in the past but after several very disappointing visits decided to make a change within the same area  The Ascott was recommended by friends and although I only stayed for two days I felt the level of accommodation  service and price were  all by London standards  quite fair  Location is good near Berkely Square and a brisk walk to Picadilly The rooms are showing wear and tear in a  quot mayfair way  quot  Certainly not an elegant property but functional  TV sets are of another generation  Unfortunately the biggest problem was the erratic  quot free quot  internet service which failed on more than on occassion  Complimentary breakfast is good  Staff was polite and helpful  At     pounds for a one bedroom with kitchen it seemed fair value and my Millennium days are over  
P =>   Convenient classy gem with great staff My wife and I stayed at this hotel for four nights while touring London  We ate breakfast there each morning The hotel is in a great part of town  fair  which has some fine shopping   food  sight seeing  and parks  even gambling if you are into that   It is also reasonably convenient to the Tube  either by foot or cab   It is not a large hotel by any means  part of its charm  but provides a comfortable experience with very good service The lobby is small but opens into an enclosed courtyard  with garden  and attached breakfast room  The room  the one we had was a suite  was very comfortable with a small kitchenette and even a clothes washer dryer  There was free internet  The small TV was attached to a DVD player which was handy to watch during downtimes  The HVAC system worked well  If possible  you may want to take a room on the top  seventh  floor  The view  breeze  and noise levels were better there  other family members were on lower floors  All in all we left feeling well taken care of and refreshed by our visit there  
P =>   Loved the place It was an amazing stay  The rooms are lovely with a kitchen  Got complimentary breakfast and maid service  Internet connection is also free thats an added value  although can be a bit slow sometimes but there is wireless as well  I needed to arrange a party for my birthday and staff were very helpful and they arranged everything for me    It was a wonderful birthday and they even gave me a bottle of champagne    Nothing better in the heart of mayfair  Definetly going back there soon  
P => cheated by their cheap  We were fooled into staying at this premise by the reputation of the Ascott group  located in fair and managed under the name of Ascott Group I would expect the real cozy but luxury accommodation but it tunred out that the picture in the website is far more alluring than the truth  The room is old  breakfast is lousy and the towels they provide in the room is the worst quality must be made from pure syntatic cause it won t abosrb any water from you  if I pay to stay in   stars hotel that will be understandable   but the worst part yet to come is   we stay in the double room but they provide only   bathrobe and   slipper when requested for   more set I was told that it will be additional charge  And when requested for extra blanket becuase it was cold  was told again that it will be another addiotional charge  I felt I was cheated and Ascott fair has no respect for their loyal customers  It will not be a repeat experience for me  
P =>  Loved the ambience and friendliness We stayed in a deluxe   bedroom apartment for a week from   th il    nd   After much research and trepidation  I decided to take the chance   simply by the name of the Ascott as they represent luxurious living Our apartment was spacious with a decent size bedroom and living room    TV s and a DVD player alongwith a library of movies to chose from  The kitchen was adequate with a   burner gas hob  kettle  washing machine etc  What was a nice touch was that they had stocked the kitchen with a starter pack   Coco Pops  Milk  Butter  Jam and biscuits  I thought that was very thoughtful as we arrived quite late and were starving   so we atleast had something to eat   The bathroom was small  but convenient  Shower was good and strong  toiletries were L Occitaine    Maid service was excellent The best part about the Ascott was the quiet little lobby  in fact  it was wonderful as they have an honesty bar  well stocked   where we had many meetings with our customers  who were pleasantly surprised at the lush surroundings Tucked into a little street in the heart of fair  it is a little paradise in very busy and expensive city   with a touch of home Broadband and breakfast is free   what more can anyone ask for  I shall certainly stay there on my return      stars to the Acott  The only minus point was the attitude of the receptionist George   who is capable of being downright rude and discourteous Small price to pay for such a fantastic overall experience  
P =>   good location value for money what can i stay about the ascott   everything you expect when you stay in a service apartment you get it  good location   min in a cab your in oxford street  piccadilly     min soho tottenham court victoria and harrods    nice staffs ready to help when needed    building is quite old will with referblishment   good continental breakfast and self service bar    
P =>   Comfortable in London fair Lovely helpful staff  pleasant reception area with bowls of red apples and an honesty bar  Booked   bedroom apartment   for up to   people   bedroom and a bed settee in sitting room  Funtional kitchenette   well equipped  Dining area with beautiful orchid on table Large comfortable bed lovely towels and waffle robe  Continental buffet breakfast plus can boil eggs Situated round the corner from the Dorchester Hotel  Only criticism is that the bathroom while adequate  is in my opinion  due for a refurbishment  Shower difficult to control  
P =>   Best Kept Secret in London This is by far the best kept secret in London  We stayed for a month at this amazing apartment style hotel in fair London and cried when we had to leave  The staff is lovely  the hotel is relaxing and the location can not be better Our suite was well appointed with everything you would ever need     we could live in this place Give it a try  we found that the rates were very good  worth every penny  
P =>  Plenty of room great price Spent   nights at the Ascott fair with mother and sister  Great apartment with great view  Very quiet neighborhood and residence  Felt very safe even walking the streets at night  Apartment had large kitchen dining area with refrigerator  cooktop  oven microwave and combo washer and dryer  Plenty of dishes  silverware and glasses  Washer and dryer hard to figure out and took hours to dry clothes  but was a really nice convenience  Spacious living area with sofabed  desk and   chairs  TV with plenty of channels  If you are traveling with children  remember that nothing is censored on the TV  Entryway had very large closet  Bedroom contained a KING size bed  large closet  dresser    nightstands  safe and TV  As mentioned by others  the bed is firm  but I was so tired at night it really didn t matter  Sofa bed was acceptable  ble bathroom had large tub shower  towel warmer and plenty of space to move around and for storage  Water pressure and temperature were variable  but after the first shower you kind of figured out when the water was going to change temperatures so you could get out of the way  Apartment cleaned daily  Initially maid was kind of stingy with the towels  but after a small tip  we had more towels than we needed  The room was very clean  The hotel itself was very comfortable  clean and pretty  Breakfast was included which was good enough to get you going in the morning  There was a selection of cereals  fruit  yogurt  assorted breads and muffins  juice  tea  coffee and you could make a soft poached egg  Very interesting place to sit and visit with people from other parts of the world  No problem getting a table  Honor bar and snacks available in the lobby at night  High speed wireless connectivity was not available in the room  but readily available in the lobby areas or business center after obtaining an access code  There is an ethernet connection in the room  but I had no luck with it  My only complaint about the residence itself is that the front desk staff wasn t very friendly or overly helpful and really was not able to answer questions about where things were located in the area  Not a big deal  We had also asked for a car to pick us up at Heathrow  The residence arranged it and we were charged    pounds  We arranged for a car ourselves to take us to the airport for our flight home and it was    pounds There were not many restaurants in the immediate area  but   food stores were within a couple of blocks  Short walk to the tube and easy walks to Buckingham Palace  Big Ben  Westminster Abbey  Trafalgar Square and Picadilly Circus  Ascott is also very close to Hyde Park and if you want a beautiful but lengthy walk  you can cross Hyde Park to Kensington Palace  The neighborhood itself was very upscale and very quiet  Cabs were readily accessible just by walking out the front door  Once you figure out how to get to Picadilly which is about a    minute walk  you can find anything you need or getting anywhere you need to go I would definitely stay at the Ascott fair again  It was much better than expected and fairly priced  
P =>  Reasonable Pros  Location  kitchen facilities  room sizes  clean ish  free internet  privacy  quiet Cons  Very hard beds  a little worn  poor aircon  no hotel switchboardIf you insist on staying in fair and you don t mind foregoing full service luxuries  the hotel bar  doorman to hail a cab  in room breakfast  messaging etc then the Ascott is a reasonable choice  Good value  some full service hotels in the area can offer similar prices  before the extras  such as internet  room service etc  but the Ascott rooms   even the smallest   are usually a tad larger  Having a kitchenette to make a cup of tea without calling room service  is a big plus  Bathrooms are small but work well  showers are fine with good pressure  The breakfast area is small and overcrowded  the breakfast itself is marginal  no cooked items i e  scrambled eggs  soggy croissants etc   Meeting facilities minimal A little out of the way and takes a while to get to know your way around the area  Best for non business travel  longer stays without too many expectations  
P =>  A  at the Ascott  My family of   stayed at the Ascott fair emer        We had a   bedroom    bath flat and were thrilled with how well it was appointed and how clean it was  The staff was very friendly and helpful  All requests were handled immediately  Victor ran the breakfast room and was very friendly and helpful with suggestions on places to go and the easiest way to get there  We didn t get a fabulous rate  GBP           VAT  but I don t regret paying that much for the quality of our room  location  amp  staff  The only thing I would have improved upon was the beds  a bit too hard  but it sure didn t keep me from sleeping well  We slept with the windows open and the area is so quiet nothing ever woke us up  Even in the mornings when people were going to work  There were no horns or loud trucks  It is a quiet residential  amp  office area  Our teenagers really enjoyed the room too  Also  I AM a picky person and like to stay in luxury hotels when I travel  be there are some rooms that aren t as nice as ours    but     was great   
P =>  Fantastic Home Away From Home  Being a avid traveller I have been in many hotels around the world  I find that Ascott fair to be a wondeful  well located apart Hotel I found the staff to be friendly and welcoming and for what they offer great value for money I stayed in a lovely two bedroom apartment which had two bathrooms Continental breakfast and broadband usage is complimentary I definately would suggest the Ascott to my familly and friends and say  quot Well done quot  to the team there  
P =>  Poorly run and overpriced I am very surprised at the other positive reviews for this hotel as our experience was negative  Whilst the location is good  the public areas well presented and the buffet breakfast quite good  at      for a studio room this hotel was very poor value in tember  This is not a hotel for the discerning business traveller  On arrival the check in was very slow     minutes  and disorganised  none of the staff seemed to have any idea of what they were doing  The first room we were given       was a small studio with an undersize    foot  bed folding down from the wall  no space for the coffee table once the bed was folded down  only one armchair for   people and a distinct smell of vomit near the bathroom  The bed mechanism didn t work  so there was a dirty  dusty   foot gap between the wall and the head of the bed  with an electric socket half falling out of the wall  The light fitting above the bed was also falling out  In size it was completely unacceptable for   people We complained and after having to threaten to cancel our booking we were begrudgingly told that we were  lucky and would get an upgrade   I can t say we felt lucky   more insulted by this attitude  The second room was a good sized one bedroom apartment  room       However  there was a thick brown sludge in the kitchen sink  and toilet  that we had to ask to have cleaned  In addition  the main TV was not working as all the leads had been disconnected  Although the second room was acceptable  some of the furnishings were well worn  torn arms on the armchair  and the old cream carpet dirty at the edges  The advertised tea and coffee making facilities amounted to   teabag  several sugar sachets and   small coffee sachets  In fairness  the staff service improved once they realised our complaints were valid  but the initial attitude left a bad taste I would not recommend this hotel unless you get a very cheap deal and aren t fussy about where you stay  
P =>   Worth a visit A real find  Found an exceptional deal on Lastminute    for weekend break  The Ascott is really well situated on Hill St and is very well appointed  Struggled a bit with the putdown bed but reasonably comfortable  En suite kitchen excellent as is breakfast area  Recommended  especially at price we paid 
P =>  Great Find Stayed in London many times  but this has been the best accomodation we have used It s a bit like having your own home in the middle of London  You come home to a quiet neighbourhood  and feel like you re walking into your own living room Staff are efficient and friendly  The room was clean and kept that way Great complimentary continental breakfast  Free wireless internet in each room Our room       needed new carpet  but apart from that was in good condition We had a studio which included a fold down murphy bed This made the room a little crammed for our   suitcase and in retrospect  we probably should have had a one bedroom apartment  However  we were more than pleased and would stay here again  
P => Outstanding Property Recently stayed for    nights with wife and two boys and had a great experience    bdr superior   Beautiful fully serviced large apartment with kitchen  washer dryer  living room  cont  breakfast  nice lobby     hour concierge  small gym and computer room  Really not sure what a hotel would add  Building is in great condition and staff is very friendly and accomodating  Location is perfect only    minute walk to Green Park tube or Hyde Park  Walking distance to many central London attractions  fair neighborhood is very quiet and safe with excellent restaurants in Shephards ket nearby  Noura  Lebanese restaurant on Curzon St is exceptional  
P =>  Much better than Hotels We  as a couple with a son  stayed at two bedroom superior for two nights  Our reservation was made for one bedroom but they kindly upgraded on the arrival  The suite has a spacious living room and fully equiped kitchen  even with a laundry machine   High speed internet which you can use in the living is free of charge  The room rate was GBP    per night including tax  I cannot imagine we can stay in such a spacious suite at the price level in the very expensive city  especially in fair area which is walking distance from Bond St   Piccadilly or Oxford Circus  Highly recommended  
P => excellent stay at Ascott fair My husband and I stayed at the Ascott fair for one night in        We managed to get a special deal         and it was incredible value   we had a small apartment with a sitting room  kitchen  bedroom and bathroom  elegantly decorated  in a brilliant part of town    televisions  a DVD and everything you could want  A good buffet breakfast and friendly staff as well  I d definitely stay there again

P =>   A delightful stay My husband was attending a conference dinner and we booked this hotel for an overnight stay afterwards  The hotel was well recommended by other reviews on Tripadvisor  Use the hotel s own website to book as it has a  best rate for the day  button  We booked a Queen room with breakfast for        an incredibly cheap rate for London  When we arrived  we were very courteously greeted and advised that we had been upgraded to a deluxe room at the front of the hotel  The room was beautifully and comfortably furnished   all the usual bits and pieces extremely well done  Two bottles of mineral water were provided  If I have any criticism it is that the room was very warm during the night and that the shower screen wasn t quite big enough to prevent splashing  But they are very  very tiny niggles because we spent an extremely comfortable night  The lounge bar is small but beautifully furnished with squashy velvet sofas and very comfortable chairs and tables  A particularly pleasing touch is the courtesy glass of wine in the evening   and very pleasant wine too  Whilst we didn t eat in the hotel  the food looked very good and was surprisingly cheap  There are  however  many restaurants in the vicinity   albeit not particularly cheap ones  Breakfast  served in a very pleasant downstairs room  was continental and perfectly adequate  But for those who want a cooked meal  there is plenty of choice   again very  very reasonably priced  remember  this is London   The staff were completely charming and very efficient and we were extremely well looked after  We would certainly stay again  As a note  the hotel is within easy walking distance of the famous museums and the Knightsbridge shops and is very close to the tube  Thoroughly recommend this hotel  
P =>  The best choice for London stays   great position  just   minutes away from Gloucester Road station   circle  district and picadilly line  great atmosphere  personell very kind and ready to satisfy any requests rooms very comfortable and clean   not that usual in London  unfortunately    We have also been upgraded upon arrival  so our superior room turned to be an executive one  with   huge windows on cromwell road   no complains about the noise  however      flat tvs  sitting area and enough room to store everything and to comfortably live in it breakfast buffet is not an extensive one  by the way you can find the basics needed to start the day  i ll definetively go to stay again at this hotel during my trips to london  as a former londoner  i could say with no doubts that this is a great choice for london stays  
P =>   Excellent all round value Very convenient for sites and restaurants and tube  Safe walking in the surrounding area  Very friendly and helpful reception staff  Well decorated and very clean rooms  Not expensive for this area of London  
P =>  Great stay at a great hotel Excellent hotel that lived up to all the reviews  Very convenient to central London with the tube just   minutes away Syle  the concierge was helpful with every request we asked  The breakfast was great and never did have a problem finding a table Would stay there again when we visit London again  
P =>  Lovely Boutique Hotel  Can t wait to go back  My husband and I LOVED this boutique hotel  The rooms were beautiful   especially the bathroom  And very  very clean  which is the most important factor to me  The outside of the hotel is gorgeous  and the staff is very helpful and friendly  Upon arrival  the concierge helped us book our tickets for different sites and told us how to get there  The continental breakfast  which was included with the room  was small  but adequate  We drank tea and read the paper every morning at breakfast   great service  The hotel provides a great hair dryer too  Great location   very near the underground  We highly recommend this hotel  
P =>  Lovely boutique hotel in London Located in quiet Kensington neighborhood  Just steps from the Underground station  Very convenient  Small  comfortable hotel  Only    rooms  Rooms nicely appointed with full bathroom including bath tub  vanity with storage  bathrobes  slippers  Staff were very responsive  Reasonably priced  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay  
P =>   Fab location close to tube very helpful concierge    for London great value This was a fantastic base in London  very close to good tube  museums and nice restaurants  Also very quiet  and some fab staff     they were very helpful with directions and guidance on the tube  Free glass of champagne a nice touch and breakfast good in general too  Only downers     room stiflingly hot  one day breakfast was chaotic   no food  tables all dirty and toaster swtiched off  
P =>   We loved this hotel This hotel has a great location  Just a few minutes from the nearest tube stop  The staff were very friendly and helpful  Our room was comfortable  clean and a fairly good size  Wonderful breakfast included each morning  Great way to start the day  We would stay there the next time we visit  Loved it     
P =>  Very nice room great location would stay again  We felt the location was outstanding  A five minute walk to Gloucester Rd  tube station  on the Circle Line  District and Picadilly lines   If you want to buy groceries  there is a nice store in route to the tube station  This shopping area includes many different stores including some places to eat  Across Cromwell Road  directly opposite the Ashburn  is a good Italian Restaurant  It is a short tube ride to Kensington Palace Gardens The room  not huge  but adequate  and bath were very nice with everything we needed including coffee tea maker and supplies  slippers and robes  new LCD T V  and bottled water each day  Our price included a continental breakfast  large variety of cereals  bread and pastries  cheeses  cold meats  fresh fruit  fruit juices  coffee and tea  We were generally in the breakfast room at opening time      am   You could also order from a menu for a larger breakfast  The staff was helpful  even loaning us a converter when ours didn t work  We did not see a  quot business center quot  per se  but were able to use the office computer  amp  printer to print our airline boarding passes  They were pleased to help us with that  Our room did not face Cromwell Rd  and noise was not an issue  The lounge and bar area of the hotel looked very nice  but we never had time to enjoy it  We would definitely stay at the Ashburn again  
P =>  At last a decent hotel in London After having stayed in many accommodation establishments  I decided to pay just a little bit more and I was certainly not disappointed  The rooms were not large  as is typical in London  but they were clean and very comfortably furnished  The hotel is within a short two blocks of Gloucester Rd  Tube Station and there are many fine eateries just a stroll away  Staff were helpful and the continental breakfast  served in the below street level dining room provided a good selection  Would highly recommend and will definitely stay again  
P =>   One outstanding hotel choice in London My wife and I  along with her sister and husband  stayed at the Ashburn for   nights beginning t   th  In short  it is an excellent hotel  Our twin room was nicely sized twin beds pushed together affords a king size but each with separate bedding  which is a plus  with a very useful wardrobe  great flat screen TV and the robes and slippers were a welcome touch  The bath was also excellent with a large stall shower  unless you just have to have a soak  go for the shower stall as the tubs are very cumbersome to deal with   the  quot    quot  rooms have stall showers  and very adequate vanity space  The Kensington location is  in my opinion  ideal  Very lovely indeed  my wife bumped into Yoko Ono on the street   convenient to the Gloucester Road station and Hyde Park  just beautiful   The breakfast offering was very good I thought  although the room  while nicely outfitted  was somewhat cramped  If you take time to engage them  the staff are terrific   quot Syle quot   the concierge  although I preferred  quot Sly quot     quot Miklos quot   the bar lounge attendant and  quot Anita quot   the receptionist were as helpful and nice as they could be  We did find two of the local restaurants   quot Green Door quot   English  and  quot Ask quot   Italian  to be undistinguished  However   quot Il Borgo quot   Italian Cafe  on Gloucester Road was sufficiently good that we went back a second time  All in all  the Ashburn is an outstanding choice for a stay in London and I would recommend it unhesitatingly  
P =>  Charming room good location accomodating staff ided on Ashburn Hotel after a confusing and exhaustive search on Trip Advisor  Lovely small hotel  neighborhood feel  The concierge  Stephen  was extremely helpful in getting our train tickets to York before we had arrived  Friendly  helpful  and loved the complimentary champagne in the evening  Would definitely recommend to others  
P =>   Great hotel This is a lovely hotel  I picked after reading the good reviews on Tripadvisor  A regular traveller to London I usually choose this area for ease of travelling from to Heathrow and getting into the center of London with ease  Upon arrival I was greeted by a very friendly and helpful receptionist  I arrived at around     pm  check in is usually from  pm  but she was very helpful and just had to check the room was ready  It was  and I was checked in very easily  My room had been upgraded  it was very comfortable  airconditioned  quiet and clean  The only thing I was disappointed with was the breakfast staff  it took them quite a while to offer me tea coffee and I asked twice for brown sugar with no luck and I eventually had to hunt the other tables for it  and you have to make my own toast  had to wait on the toaster heating up  then someone else took my toast  But that was the only negative thing about my stay  
P =>  The Ashburn was the epitome of a London boutique hotel  set in the lovely borough of S  Kensington  While planning our first visit to London  I searched for a boutique hotel with the character of the surrounding Kensington borough  I also wanted a romantic  quiet place for us to relax and re connect after a two month separation due to his work overseas  Our room was perfectly adorned  from the scrumptious bed linens  to the wonderful spa like bath  The room was smaller than those found at international chains  but not at all cramped  We chose the full English breakfast served each day in the sunny dinig room  especially enjoyed the French press coffee and the lovely assortment of breads  Steven  our concierge  was most helpful in booking our tour of Buckingham Palace and the Cabinet War rooms  The complimentary champagne each evening was a nice touch  as well  All the staff was courteous and efficient We strolled daily from the Gloucester Tube station  through the Waitrose ket for snacks and bottled water  as well as several wonderful restaurants  including Pierino s Pasta and Pizza a few blocks away  I would definitely book the Ashburn for a future London adventure  
P =>  Great Location central for exploring Good location with Gloucester Tube station within walking distance  the hotel staff were very friendly  amp  the Concierge is a mindful of information  The rooms were compact but very clean  The room service was excellent and very competitively priced  Thoroughly enjoyed my stay and hope to return soon  
P =>   Great little hotel in a great location My wife and I stayed at the Ashburn with another couple from ust    to ust           We were extremely pleased with all aspects of the Ashburn  Like most European hotels  the bedrooms were smaller  but our bathroom was very nice and larger than expected  We were provided a complimentary gift and bottled water daily  The rooms were clean and well kept It is just a short walk from the hotel to the Gloucester Road tube stop and a block or two from Hyde Park  an all around excellent location  Although located just off of Cromwell Road  the hotel did not present any problems as to stree noise  The front desk was very helpful in getting dinner reservations and giving directions as well Without reservation  I can say that we would stay there again  
P =>   A great find At last we have found a hotel in London to stay that is not a chain  is reasonable in cost and comfortable  The hotel is not far from Gloucester Road station and is very convenient for the museums  shopping etc with lots of restaurants nearby  We found the staff helpful and friendly  included breakfast sufficient  choice of cooked if wanted at not huge extra cost   room clean and a reasonable size  with nice toiletries  bath robes  comfy bed and flat screen TV on wall  We shall certainly go back when next staying in London  
P =>   Good choice for Sightseeing We spent just one night here and would recommend it as a good base if you re exploring London  The hotel is very well placed for travelling to the major sights and is a short walk from Gloucester Road tube  Our room was on the second floor and although very comfortable  clean and well presented  didn t have air conditioning which worked  as another reviewer found  who incidentally was on the same floor  Although there was a fan  it only had a maximum of     minutes on the timer  amp  as the room looked on the main road  having the window open wasn t an option  Breakfast was more than adequate and the staff were extremely helpful and friendly  We d certainly choose it again   we had an internet deal of      and think this was a fair price  Worth looking to see if you can get this directly through the hotel  
P =>   Not quite a London   Stars The location of the hotel is perfect  very close to the underground and best shopping areas The appearance of the building is nice and the indoor public areapleasant except for the basement breakfast room  very small and whose chairs cotton covers are stained The staff welcoming us for our   nights stay was not warm nor very professional  only one of the gentleman working in the breakfast room every morning was polite and dedicated to guests  The front desk staff was bearly greeting people in the morning  did not ask how was our stay when checking out The room was spacious  nicely decorated  linen and bedding comfortable AC was working fine  But the bathroom had a major drawback  although featuring a window  this latest was opening on a staircase and on the street  so very little privacy to be expected Plus  there was not really space to put your bath accessories and make ip vanity and product if you are a couple Courtesy items every day in the room were a great plusThe internet access on TV which is another reason for which we booked this hotel did not work Be aware that this hotel has   room just behind the front desk at ground level and   rooms in the basement  perhaps might have they try to fulfill my request for a room on upper floor  might I have been more positive about my experience at the Ashburn 
P =>   Disappointment  We booked this hotel as it had so many positive reviews on trip advisor and it seemed an ideal location for our planned visit to the V and A and Harrods  The rooms were lovely and the little extras such as a bath fizz and a free newspaper were great  The service was dire with the exception of the lady who checked us out  The man who we booked in with looked bored out of his mind and vaguely waved us in the direction of our room  No attempt to help us with our heavy cases or tell us about the hotel or breakfast times etc  He didn t even look up from the desk when we came in after being for a walk later that evening  Breakfast service was poor too  We had paid for the buffet but there were menus for english breakfast too which we were prepared to pay for nobody was really about or showing any interest in what we might wish to order so we just didn t bother  We had to ask for milk for the tea  there was no cutlery at one of the places  It was just poor and disappointing We certainly won t rush back especially as they charged us a   pound deposit on arriving as a guarantee and won t refund it until   days later  That s a nonsense  
P =>  Cosy little London gem of a home away from home Spent around    days in total at different intervals at the Ashburn and just loved it  Our rooms  we stayed in   different ones  were all lovely and comfortable with pretty decor  comfortable beds  fluffy down duvets and crisp white linen  There were lots of other little thoughtful touches like the morning newspaper delivered outside the door daily  soft slippers just right for tired feet  snuggly robes  spa style toiletries  bottled water  coffee tea making facilities  room safe  and daily turndowm spa style gifts The staff are delightful  service was courteous and friendly at all times A simple but sufficient continental breakfast was included in the price in the downstairs breakfast room which was pretty and welcoming  The only improvement suggestion I would make is for the continental meun to be vaired a little  Location was brilliant  Zone   with the Gloucester Road tube just a short walk away   and there was a good variety of restaurants  pubs and food stores  including the famous Bombay Brasserie  in the immediate vicinity   we ate out every night  Perhpas the only word of caution is the air conditioning issue   which is still unresolved and was not in proper working order in any of our   rooms for the full duration of our stay  This could spell disaster during warm  or cold weather  as the rooms heat up rapidly  In our instance the airconditioner was set at too low a temperature and we were unable to adjust it   resulting in chilly conditions particularly at night  Be that as it may   we will most definitley return to this little gem in South Kensington  
P =>   What a little gem of a hotel I stayed at the Ashburn for two nights recently as a special treat for my husband s   th birthday  I decided to book after reading the good reviews on here and so I had quite high expectations  I am very happy to say that I was not disappointed  our room was absolutely gorgeous I had booked a King Deluxe and that would describe the room very well  We had a lovely seating area with its own flat screen TV and there was another TV opposite the large and extremely comfortable bed  The bathroom was very well appointed and the shower worked very well once we had figured out what leavers did what I also liked the little added extras like the bathrobes  slippers  bottled water in the fridge and the lovely little  turn down  gifts a different one each night The staff were exemplarary nothing was too much trouble for them and the concierge was very knowledge about restuarants  sights to see etc I would also recommend the Black and Blue Steakhouse  not far from the hotel where we had a delicious meal on my husband s birthday at a very reasonable cost The hotel is also extremely accessible being only a few minutes walk from Gloucester Road Tube station  The continental breakfast was very substantial and we also sampled the  English  breakfast as at very reasonable extra cost which was also very nice If when I return to stay in London  after discovering this little gem I wouldn t consider staying anywhere else  
P =>   A great way to have a great stay  This is a great hotel all round  My husband and I arrived in London after a long    hr flight from Australia  This hotel has an amazing location   only metres away from the Gloucester Road tube station that is accessed by three tube lines including one directly from Heathrow  This made travelling around London very easy for two novice UK travellers  It is close to many eateries  a laundramat and there is an internet cafe just across the street  It is also within walking distance to local attractions such as Royal Albert Hall  Kensington Place  Harrods and the V and A Museum Our room was ready for us early so we really appreciated the early check in after such a long flight  It was beautifully decorated and very clean  as was the whole hotel    perhaps a little small  but I was not expecting a larger space in a London hotel The staff were brilliant  and the concierges were very helpful and knowledgeable about how to get around London  A good continental breakfast was included with the room  and a hot breakfast menu was available for an extra charge I would not hesitate in recommending this hotel and would love to return some day  
P =>  Great Stay Awesome Location Would Stay Here Again in Heartbeat The Ashburn kicked off our European honeymoon adventure  and we could not have been more satisfied with our hotel choice  With so many options  it was hard to narrow it down but we could not have been more happy with our choice to stay here The room was nice  very clean  very comfortable bed  LCD tv  fridge  nice shower  and the lounge downstairs was cool  not that we spent much time in the lounge   The free breakfast was fine  not great but not terrible  who really stays at a hotel because of the breakfast    Cereal  toast  small muffins  meats  cheese  coffee  juice  It saved us from spending money on breakfast every day The location is outstanding  as others have mentioned  because the gloucester tube station is about a block and a half away  We also really like the neighborhood in which this hotel is located  its cute  my wife said   It feels a bit upscale  A grocery store is also a block away  and so is a Starbucks  In addition  its about   mile away from Hyde park so you can get in a nice run in the morning  After spending all day walking around London  it was great to come back to our hotel and sleep in our comfortable room  We were traveling for    days and I still think some of the best sleep we had was in the Ashburn  we slept in until   am one day   The staff was friendly and helpful whenever we needed assistance but they also left us alone for the most part which was nice too  
P => 	  perfect for our needs   Excellent Hotel We   my wife and I  Stayed in the Ashburn for   nights e   th   y  st       We loved the location      metres from Gloucester Road tube station  where you can also get the Big Bus tour Blue line The hotel is perfect  lovely bar and lounge area  Well air conditioned for the London heat wave  Our room was a good size and very well appointed  Overall this is the perfect location for a trip to London   Highly recommended 
P =>  Perfect Hotel I don t call many things perfect but this hotel definitely was  My sister and I stayed at the Ashburn for   nights in e  I think we had one of the smallest rooms in the hotel but it was comfortable and nicely decorated  We had a queen size bed that was very comfortable as was the duvet on the bed  I loved the big bay windows that over looked the street  The hotel staff was wonderful  one of the best things about the hotel  Every question was answered and there staff were very welcoming after a long day of site seeing  The location could not be better  about a   minute walk from the tube station to the hotel  Every day housekeeping would leave a small gift in the room for you which is a nice touch  We looked forward to seeing what we they left every day  The mini fridge was a huge plus for me  We bought juice and water from the grocery store  there is a Waitrose  Tesco  and Sainsbury all within walking distance  and left it in the fridge  There are so many small details like this that make The Ashburn stand out from the rest If I had to say something negative about the hotel I would say that at night you can sometimes here the underground but not enough to wake you up  I could only hear it if I was already up  Also I got really sick of the breakfast after about four days  I can only eat bread and cheese for so long  but this is being really picky  I would absolutely stay here again and recommend it to everyone I know  
P =>  at least   stars with staff worthy of any   star hotel Spent a couple of days here for business  been here before  The location is very convenient  close to the Gloucester Road Tube station  rooms are tidy and very comfortable  a good breakfast and free WiFi included  Every encounter with staff of the hotel  reception   concierge   cleaning etc  was extremely pleasant  they would be gems in every   star property  I had a last minute meeting cancellation and   hours to kill before my late evening flight  Although I had already checked out in the morning and only came back to retrieve my luggage  I was able to spend a few hours in the very comfortable sitting room  with food drinks  free internet and an occasional nice chat with the concierge  I got more work done in a quiet and comfy environment then I would have otherwise  just fabulous  Look forward to coming back  it feels like a home away form home  the staff could not be any nicer    
P =>  Great time at the Ashburn     We stayed at the Ashburn for   nights in a deluxe king room  We arrived at the hotel around     am after    hours of travel and our room was not ready yet  nor did we expect it to be  It was ready around    pm The room was very nice  we recommend a higher floor room as it higher up from the street  we stayed on the top floor and had no problems with sound at all  Big king size bed  firm mattress  LCD tv on the wall  Our room was quite large for Euro standards  so that was nice  Room even had A C as well The bathroom was also large  good water pressure  plenty of hot water  There was a coffee tea maker with an assortment of teas  hot chocolate and coffee  we also got a newspaper each morning Included in our rate was breakfast  which was a decent continental breakfast downstairs  There were meats  cheeses  pastries  breads  juices  cereal  fruit  yogurt  coffee  etc  The menu never changes  but in all fairness it filled us up and we are not that picky  You can purchase hot food down there as well Location was pretty nice  about a   min walk from the Gloucester tube  which you can pretty much get anywhere in London from  The area is safe  a few restaurants  bars etc around the area as well  Free wireless access as well   Overall  we enjoyed our stay  thought this was a good hotel and would stay there again  
P =>   Very enjoyable stay  This was our first time staying here and we were very happy with the hotel  We used to work in London for about   months of the year  for many years  so we have stayed in a lot of hotels  The staff was EXCELLENT and the rooms  albeit a little smaller than some comparable boutique hotels in the area  were spotless  The bathroom was also immaculate  A note  The tub could be tricky to get in and out of for anyone with mobility or balance problems  WIFI is a necessity for us  and the service here was reliable  fast and included in the price  We will plan to stay there again on our next trip  We only had the breakfast a few mornings but the little dining room is very pleasant and the buffet has a good selection  I only have one criticism   they offer a free glass of champagne each evening in the lounge  which we took advantage of for   nights of our stay  One night we had   friends meet us at the hotel before dinner  We ordered them a glass of  chargeable  champagne as well  Each glass was NINE pounds  For us  that is about    American dollars a glass  That seems excessive for one glass of champagne and left a rather sour taste in our mouth  I did later look at a menu  and it DID indicate that was the price  so if i had looked i would have seen it  But if you have someone visit you at the hotel  there are not too many other options  it is not as if there is a cheaper one to select and several other drink options a friend asked about were not available for one reason or another  Not a huge problem i know  but i still think OUCH for    dollars for   medium glasses of bubbly  EVEN for London  
P =>  Perfect for a short stay in London I took my mother to London for   days to go to the Chelsea Flower show  Staying at this lovely hotel made a great trip even better  The staff were lovely and very helpful  they couldn t do enough for us  The room couldn t be faulted and was cleaned to a very high standard daily  The breakfast was a continental buffet but an English breakfast could be purchased at an additional cost  however we didn t feel the need as the buffet was more than adequate  The whole hotel had a lovely  almost boutique feel  It s location is ideal as it is     minutes from Gloucester Rd tube station which makes everything so easy to access as the picadilly line runs through here with covent garden  knightsbridge and leicester square all on the one line Would highly recommend this hotel   
P =>   Perfect place to relax after a long day in the city Arrived at the hotel mid afternoon and met by friendly receptionist  The Hotel is cosy and welcoming   beautifully decorated and furnished with period furnishings   delightful room with plenty of space for two people   large wardrobe space and double shower cubicle   Breakfast was very comprehensive and well prepared and i couldnt recommend this hotel enough 
P =>   Location is Key Great Location   Easy to Find  Booked a Smoking Room   in A No Smoking Hotel    Would definitely stay here again  
P => The reviews don t lie Ashburn Hotel is a gem of a place  My mom and I stayed at the Ashburn Hotel il      th  Although most of our time was spent outside of the hotel  it was a welcome refuge after long days sightseeing  We arrived a couple of hours early  and were allowed to check in as our room was ready  The room was comfortable in size for two women with large suitcases  The decor was elegant and everything looked so clean  The large windows kept the room bright  The bathroom was immaculate and maintained well  Having free internet in our room was such an extravagance  All hotels I have ever stayed at before  always charged for this ammenity  This allowed me to keep in touch with family and friends back home  Why don t all hotels make this free Breakfast was included in our stay and was good  Fresh fruit  varied meats  and cheeses  and breads  Convenient to have it ready for us at the hotel  as opposed to hotels that don t offer breakfast or charge extra for it One of the best features of the hotel was its location  one block from Gloucester Road  From there  London is at your disposal  Oyster Card was the best value as it allows for unlimited travel between Zones   and    This area is where most London sights are located Most of our interactions regarding staff were with Stephen  the concierge  He was extremely helpful with straight forward advice   better to hire a car for the ride back to the airport rather then the underground express  cheaper and more convenient  He directed us to a local church and mapped it our for us  he got us tickets to a play for the same night at a discounted rate  and made arrangements for a car to he airport on our last day  Stephen was very helpful and put our mind at ease Overall my first trip to London definitely made better with my stay at Ashburn Hotel  Definitely will stay there again  As opposed to larger chain hotels in the Kennsington area  ie  Holiday Inn    Ashburn Hotel gave our trip that extra something that made us feel like we were in London and not in any other Holiday Inn anywhere in the world  
P =>  Great Hotel All Around We stayed here for   nights in late il and could not have been more pleased The hotel itself was excellent  We had booked an upgraded room due to the length of our stay  and the room was as advertised  It had a small sitting area with a separate television and a nice sized closet that gave us the extra space we desired  The free Wifi and television internet made it easy to plan our activities for the day The staff was also extremely helpful in recommending restaurants and answering any questions we had The breakfast was very nice and the charge for the additional prepared items was more than reasonable  as was the room service charges The location was also great  within   minutes walk of the the Gloucester Road tube station Overall  we will definitely stay at the Ashburn again  
P =>   Lovely Hotel Superb Location  We stayed at The Ashburn Hotel in early il  We had done a lot of research and because of the great reviews on Trip Advisor  we booked two nights there  Steve  the concierge  prearranged a driver to pick us up at Heathrow airport  He was there waiting for us when we arrived  We arrived at the hotel and I had some trouble setting up my global phone line so they let me make the long distance call to the states from the front desk  Steve was very helpful and offered suggestions on a great Indian restaurant in the neighborhood for dinner that night  The location is a block away from the Gloucester tube line  We also picked up the hop on hop off Double k  quot Big Bus quot  tour at the stop as well   This is a great thing to do on your first day because it is a    hour ticket with hop on off privileges and you get a really good lay of the land  Free walking tours and river cruise are also included in the bus ticket  Once you learn how to navigate the underground  getting around the city is a breeze  We purchased a Visitor s  quot Oyster quot  card ahead of time  which was great because it allows visitors to max out each day at a certain cost so after     rides  your travels are free with the card for the rest of that day  The hotel room was very clean  the linens were delightful and the free gifts  bath salts  beads  left in the room every night were a treat  They upgraded our room so we had a nice bright room with a lovely side street view  We did not partake in the free breakfast since we were up and about really early every morning  We thought it would be fun to experience another part of London so we had booked another hotel for our last   nights near Westminster Abbey  What a mistake  that hotel was no where near the quality of The Ashburn  It was about      cheaper per night but not worth the extra savings at all  I would highly recommend this hotel for it s excellent location  great service and clean and efficient rooms  I look forward to staying there again when I can get back to London  
P =>   Quaint and Clean  This was a small hotel  pictures by guests are true to likeness  Rooms are clean and hotel staff are very friendly  Located just short walk from the tube  there is a great steak house near by  called The Steakhouse    and some chain eateries   ok   to eat at if your in a pinch and want a short walk  You can pick up the hop on hop off bus tour just in front of the train station  again in walking distance  you can take public transit to ble Arches  Oxford street and Buckingham Palace etc  THe hotel has a small lounge  fitting furniture and offer a free glass of champagne each night  Pizza and beer until around   i think   but no restaraunt on the premises  there is a lovely breakfast in the a m i would stay here again  
P =>   Cosy hotel in great location The rooms are a bit small but otherwise excellent  There is some traffic and underground railway noise but it is not significant  The Ashburn is well deserving of it s   stars  The service was very good as was the continental breakfast  cooked breakfast is available for an extra cost   Room Service   The Pizza with beer special was excellent value  The location is very convenient being a few minutes walk to Gloucester Road station where there is a choice of   underground lines  Also there are many restaurants within walking distance If you want to see a show or visit places such as Madam Tussards  see the Concierge who is able to get discounts to many locations Overall highly recommended  
P =>   Great staff  very helpful The hotel had comfortable beds  a good breakfast   a convenient location  The best feature however was the staff  they were very nice  amp  helpful in every way  
P =>   Class comfort and convenient  A great place to stay  Just returned from a pleasant   day stay at the Ashburn and we couldn t have been more happier with the choice we made to stay here  From the time we arrived to the time we left we were always greeted with a smile and a welcoming  quot hello quot  and  quot how was your day  quot  at the end of our sightseeing day  Greetings not often heard from from most hotels  Our room was very clean  tastefully decorated in a beige scheme which was inviting at the end of a long day sightseeing  Our bed was very comfortable which provided a restful sleep throughout the night  The bath only had a shower which really wasn t an issue for us and was up to date and spotlessly cleaned each day  A powerful hair dryer was provided as well as a safe  free wifi  and a coffee maker  Their complimentary breakfast got us off and going each morning  It included a variety of cold cereals  breads and jams  meats and cheeses  juices  coffee and tea  but you could order eggs in a variety of ways  Each evening a daily complimentary bath gratuity was left in the room to take home  Anytime we needed help the front desk or the concierge were always ready with their recommendations and guidance  The Ashburn is located within Kensington with the Gloucester underground only a block away  The surrounding neighborhood is inviting with many restaurants within a block or two away  Two recommended restaurants near the underground are The Green Door and Olives our favorite   A meal at Olives with a bottle of wine  dessert  appetizers and of course your main meal cost about    pds  service included Would I go again when I return and recommend the Ashburn to others  Absolutely  Staying at the Ashburn topped off our days and was the icing on the cake  so to speak  at the end of each day and to our vacation  
P =>  Very nice stay would stay again  What a great little hotel  I stayed this ch for three nights  and would stay again  Breakfast is included  all kinds of bread  some meat  yorgurt  fruit  toast  etc    Could pay a bit more for a cooked breakfast but can fill up with what is included  Don t stay here if you want to stay out late  as the underground stops running around  amish   But a tube stop is   min walk and to get around London and back takes no time at all  Would stay again  clean hotel  very nice staff  and helpful concerge  
P =>   Excellent stay in London We have just returned from our trip to London in a   day stay at the Ashburn  that is spectacular The hotel  Is relatively new with excellent d cor The room  Very comfortable king size bed  LCD TV  good size  amp  excellent bathroomsAmenities  basic but delicius breakfast and your evening glass of champagne after a long day walking   is priceless  also has free internet Staff  One of the best thigs in the hotel is the people working on it  thanks Syle  you were an excellent host always friendly and suggesting place to visit  restaurants  etc     Location  Terrific  Gloucester station is   minute walking  nice pubs  restaurants and groceries stores next to the hotelWithout a doubt we will book this hotel next time and recommend it       
P =>   Charming Hotel at the right price I had the pleasure of staying in this absolutely charming hotel on my recent   night stay in London  It was an enormous pleasure to come back to every night after a busy day sight seeing  The breakfast provided in the morning was a perfect start to the day and provided a wonderful assortment of cereals  croissants  yogurt  cut up fruit salad  several juices  tea  amp  coffee  You could also order off the menu which was very reasonable  We ordered room service one night and it was delicous and very reasonable The staff are very pleasant and helpful  The rooms are super comfortable  clean  beautifully decorated  We also enjoyed the free bottles of water left in our refrigerator and the tea and coffee we could enjoy in our room  The location was perfect  Just down the block from the tube station and a short walk to Natural History Museum  Museum of Victoria and Albert  Hyde Park  Kensington Palace  I cannot say enough about this hotel  I would recommend it to my friends and family and would definitely stay there again  
P =>   Better than expected  Will stay here again  My wife and I stayed   nights at the Ashburn Hotel  It s a   minute walk to the Glocester rd  Tube stop  so it s convenient to travel  We read all of the reviews on this site and we armed ourselves with knowledge of both good and bad experiences other travelers had  Overall  I can t say anything negative about this hotel  The hotel lobby and sitting bar area was very charming and Sile our concierge was amazing with directions  restaurant recommendations  banking information  tipping policies  getting tickets for events  etc  In fact  the entire staff were one of the best parts of the hotel  Very warm and very accommodating and knowledgeable  We booked a Queen room and that s what we got  We had a few special requests at time of booking they saw to it that we received those request  top floor and away from elevators   everthing is non smoking   No noise from other guests much at all  A newspaper at your front door each morning and our rate included continental breakfast each morning  the food and service was great and plenty to get us energized for long days of sightseeing  Our last night at the hotel  we were upgraded to a King bed in a larger room on the  rd floor facing a side street  This room was bright with large windows  very clean and the best part of both rooms was the heated marble bathroom floor  Wow   that was a nice touch  The glass shower doors are somewhat odd shaped   only appearing to be a half door and water can spray out of the back of the tub  Not a big deal and didn t get that much water on the floor  It took us a while to figure out there was a child safety feature on the shower handle that prevented the temperature to get too hot  Once we figured that out  Thanks Sile   we were able to take hot showers  The linens and toiletries were nice touches  Robes  slippers  that sort of thing  Complementary bottled water in the in room fridge and it came with an upgraded hair drayer  not the old school thing attached to the wall in the bath    but a real high powered hair dryer and also an in room safe for valuables  Plenty of restaurants and pubs within walking distance  Fulham road where a lot of the pubs are  is only a    minute walk but there are a couple nice pubs even closer  
P =>   Great hotel   good location We stayed at the Ashburn for   nights for a London break  and I cannot fault this hotel at all  We booked through Hotels com and got a queen room for      a night including continential breakfast  which compared to other hotels we looked at was a very reasonable price  The hotel is in a great location  just a     minute walk from Glouester Road tube station and about a    minute walk to Earls court tube also  Lovely area  and handy for shops like Waitrose and Sainsburys close by  We arrived   hours earlier than check in but the staff were great and we were able to check in and go to our room immediately  Very happy with room  Room       lovely decor  nice bathroom and plasma TV  Breakfast was great too   continental breakfast was lovely with good choice and great serving staff   cooked breakfasts also available at a small cost  All staff we came into contact with were very helpful and friendly  Little touches like complimentay champagne for all guests served in bar at  pm and complimentary newspaper each morning were great also  We were also able to leave our bags for   hours after check out before we left  A great find   I would book this hotel again and recommend to a friend  
P =>   Fantastic hotel We booked for a Thursday and Friday night in ember and cannot fault anything about this hotel We were pleasantly surprised by how close the hotel is to Gloucester Road tube station  Having turned left out of the station we were at the front door in   minutes When we arrived we were greeted by a efficient and polite receptionist who told us that due to over demand we d been upgraded to a queen size room from the standard double that we d booked   excellent  Room was fantastic  room       Spotlessly clean with good furnishings  There was a tv in the sleeping area and one facing the sofa in the louge area  both large flat screen   not that we watched much tv  There was a good sized bathroom with large bath   only minor gripe was working the shower was a little complicated but we managed in the end Breakfast was good  Only had continental but the choice was excellent and the breakfast room was really nicely done out The hotel offers all guests a complemetary glass of champagne every evening in the bar area which was a really nice touch and in keeping with the atmosphere of nothing being too much trouble for the staff  The prices at the bar were also pretty reasonable for London  wine from about     a bottle  Overall this is a really good hotel and when I return to London I wouldn t think twice about staying here again  
P =>   The cosiest hotel in London   I have booked my room directly from the Hotel website  special rates   and got all the comforts expected in a Luxury Hotel  The staff is really attentive and professional  Moreover I was nicely surprised by the the welcome drink and the turndown gift be the cosiest hotel I have ever stayed in London  Very charming boutique hotel and very keen on details  
P =>   Perfect Three of us stayed in the Ashburn last ober  taking two rooms  The hotel was ideally sited to our minds as the area is quiet  the museums are just up the road and the tube station is around the corner  The Italian restaurant across the road is great and full of atmosphere  We worried about traffic noise on the busy Cromwell Road but the rooms are quiet and well insulated One room  an uprated suite  was strangely located in the basement and so was gloomy with very little natural light  The room had a a smell of cigarette smoke too   despite us asking for no smoking  We reported the smell and efforts were made to remove it  After four nights  we loved this room and would ask for it again  The beds were superb  the little touches very comforting   we loved the edible  crystallised violet petals everywhere  the complementry glass of champagne every evening and the turndown gift each night Staff were very helpful  breakfast completely adequate although you may have to wait on a table if you mistime your entry  Lounge had a lot of character but was a bit chilly in the evenings   we hoped they d light the fire there but they didn t Loved it all in summary and are looking forward to returning soon  Well done to all concerned  
P =>   overrated this hotel seems to be built over the underground and you can feel the dull thunder as trains go by  the rooms are small  and for that price  it is definitley not the best hotel to stay in  try dolphin house or something similar  way bigger rooms and much better facilities  this place needs an upgrade and the breakfast room was PACKED and hard to sit in on  in short  hunt around  not the best for london  
P =>   All that one could ask for  After taking the Eurostar from Paris to London  we hopped on the Tube and made our way into South Kensington where the Ashburn is located  It s less than two blocks away from the Gloucester Road station  so it s very convenient to the hotel  Check in was quick and easy  and we were placed on the  th floor in a front facing room Very small  no surprise there   but very clean and nicely furnished  it was a queen bed with two side tables  a closet with mini fridge and electric kettle  and the bathroom which was a single sink  toilet  and shower tub One nice touch is that they leave you a little  quot present quot  each day of your stay   bath salts  candy  stuff like that One thing I noticed upon our arrival is that one of the little decorative mirrors that adorn the sink cabinet was missing  but it was replaced by the next day without our mentioning it to anyone  That showed me that they were on top of thing   even the little things Here s a tip about the shower that we didn t figure out until our next to last day there   it seemed that the water temperature was never hot and just got warm  but then I noticed a little button that can be pushed in so that the temperature handle can be rotated more to allow access to hotter water  Very much hotter water  in fact  I can see why that s there as a safety thing  be that s common in Europe  but it was the first time I ve ever seen such a shower mechanism  and I wish I d known about it beforehand Our toilet was a little temperamental in that the handle needed to be held down for a while for it to flush properly  but I found that happening all over London  so maybe that s just the way they re made The breakfasts were nothing fancy  but they were free and filling  The regular continental spread was cereals  croissants  cheeses  meats  toast  yogurt  fruit  coffee  tea  and juices  Then you could order hot breakfast dishes like sausages and eggs for an additional cost if you wished  The attendants were very friendly  and overall it was a nice set up for being included in the cost of the room I d definitely stay here again  
P =>   A nest in London We spent   days at Ashburn Hotel  and we think to have found a real nest in London The location is perfect      meters from a Tube Station  Gloucester Road  with three lines  not far from parks and museums  in a quiet enviroment  the hotel is in Cromwell Road  the rooms look on a quiet road and are silent   with a lot of excellent restaurants all around  see Squaremeal  a good guide on line  The hotel is cosy  with only    rooms on   floors  new         rooms are confortable and well furnished  breakfast  included  al last  very good  We have found an excellent help in booking tickets for visit  and a simpathetical feeling If you don t like giant  barracks like hotels and you don t need gym  swimming pool and meeting Madonna  I think this is your hotel  
P =>  Perfect Hotel and Location     My daughter and I stayed for twelve days at the Ashburn Hotel  The hotel is small but very clean and nice  The hotel staff is absolutely wonderful     Sly  the concierge  was so helpful  He even did the on line check in for our departure via British Airways  The hotel provides a continental breakfast  the same every day  However  beginning at  am  you can also order hot items for an extra cost  There are other places in the area that serve breakfast  One is on the main street across from the Gloucester Tube station  which is only two blocks away  Also  the Holiday Inn across from the Ashburn offers a wonderful breakfast buffet  The hotel is perfectly located  There is a drugstore  grocery store  laundromat all within two blocks of the hotel  We did lots of excursions outside London  Do not use Golden Tours for these excursions  They are very unorganized  Buy an Oyster Card prior to your departure for London  I went to VisitBritain com and ordered mine  We made a two day trip via the Eurostar to Paris  again through Golden Tours  Save your time and money  See some shows while in London  Wicked and the Lion King are tremendous     Go on a Beatles walk  The Jack the Ripper walk was really good  Have Sly book you a chaffeur to take you back to the airport  Don t do the Victoria Station Tube especially if you have heavy luggage  
P =>   Just back  great stay  I stayed at the Ashburn for   nights with my son     just back yesterday  As written here before  the location is great the hotel and staff very friendly and caring  Steve  the concierge was More than helpful  do let him write your tickets for the Tower of London  etc  it saved us tons of wait time in the long lines  the price was the same  I can t thank Steve enough  we had tons of questions  and he never faltered with a friendly  informative manner Our room was Very clean  the carpet did have a few small stains  but it was clean as well  We were gone all day  and the maids did a great job  in our absence  Our room was      and though smaller  still very good sized  by European standards  the beds were great  the sheets were soft   and down comforters perfect  as the a c worked well The beds were two very ample twins pushed together  which worked very well for us  my son is     quot   and he was comfortable   I did write to ask for a larger room  ask for        but they were almost full as I booked rather late  but they Did reply to all of my emails very promptly  Remember that the floors go  backwards quot   so floor   is the Top of the hotel  so ask for a room on the Upper floors  Ours was non smoking as requested  and we could open the windows at night  very refreshing  We heard NO noise from the lobby or desk  as they have a door that closes  between the rooms on level    and the reception area  Traffic noise was also never a problem as Cromwell road is only busy at about  pm as people leave work The neighborhood is nice  grocery stores nearby  but not many restaurants or pubs  Yet  the Gloucester Road tube stop is     a block away  and we got anywhere and everyhwhere on the tube  we got   day pass cards  the way to go for our   day trip   The area was very safe  If you are looking for nightlife  head to the Oxford Road tube stop  and you ll find clubs  restuarants  and lots of people out for fun  You will also walk from there to Chinatown  and just wondering around  we found a nice pub  good souvenier shopping  and a good Italian meal  for about     USD  The menus are outside the restaurants  so just stop  read and decide Also  by Harrod s  across the street  we recommend The Richoux tea room for lunch  after your shopping trip  There is a small eating area upstairs  a few tables outside  and a large eating area downstairs  so you can choose  We had an Excellent shepherd s pie  chips and croque m seiur  sp sorry    grilled cheese and ham  French style  all very good  They serve a resonable tea  as well  with sandwiches  cakes  etc   less than      USD each   which is reasonable  trust me I booked the Ashburn on Hotels com   got a     rebate  and a lower price than stated elsewhere I would definitely recommend the Ashburn hotel  the staff  location and comfort make it a big plus for your trip to London   
P => Superb value for standards of comfort room facilities  Lovely clean and well furnished room with big plasma screen and keyboard to access free internet  Air conditioniing  free room safe  mini fridge  comfortable bed  bathroom well equipped though a little cramped  toilet behind the door etc  shower cubicle with   showers  Convenient location close to Gloucester Road tube and buses durect into central London  yet well insulated windows ensured it wasnt noisy  Continental breakfast included in room rate of        compared to standard Premier Inn     no breakfast   which consideriing is was a luxury room in a convenient location was excellent value for money Seen a few criticisms like dining room small  yeh buts its a small hotel  and they are making the maximum use of what premium space they do have but as as breakfast is between   to     you find your spot  Cooked breakfast offered at additional cost eg omelette      Free glass of champagne offered between   and   pm  didnt rush back for it but nice touch if you feel so inclined Overall best value hotel in London I have stayed in by far  yeh slightly bigger rooms would be nicer  but for the standards delivered you could easily pay double  so am well satisfied and with definitely stay here again  
P =>  It was very good My husband and I have just returned from a   night stay in the Ashburn  We really enjoyed our stay for a number of reasons   Firstly the rooms were immaculately clean and first rate for comfort   Upon check in we were met by a very friendly receptionist who was most efficient in all our subsequent dealings with her   Our room       was at the top of the building  We found the room quiet with no noise or disturbance whatsoever  Each morning a copy of the newspaper was left at the door which was a nice touch as was the offer of a drink upon arrival  The bedroom was cleaned and restocked with beautiful toileteries each day   The tube station was within a two to three minute walk of the hotel  This tube station offers a direct line to Heathrow and also a direct line to Liverpool St where Stansted Express departs   Location of hotel to tube was very handy when we were dragging suitcases on arrival and departure   The Kensington area is a lovely place to stay with good options for eating out  There were two very nice pubs close by serving food plus an organic pizza place across the road from the tube which was particularly excellent   Continental breakfast was good in the Ashburn  I would concur with the previous reviewer who stated that the bread rolls could be fresher  That would be my only criticism of the otherwise plentiful breakfast   We stayed in the Ashburn during extremely warm weather  the air conditioning system was highly effective Overall to conclude very very comfortable rooms  so comfortable you might feel like staying in bed for the day    very good location and good access to all the tourist attractions London has to offer via the tube station which is within very close proximity to the hotel  Would recommend to all friends and family travelling to London  
P =>   Boutique gem in Kensington The Ashburn in Kensington is a rare treat in London  This boutique hotel more than lived up to expectations with large comfortable bedrooms and luxurious bathrooms  The staff were friendly and welcoming throughout our stay even bringing a complimentary glass of champagne to our room on arrival  The buffet breakfast  included in the room rate  was a perfect start to the day  Location wise it s hard to beat the Ashburn with Gloucester Road tube station literally around the corner and a wide selection of good restaurants and bars within easy reach  The Natural History Museum  V amp A and Harrods are all a short walk from the hotel I d definitely recommend this lovely hotel and hope to return in the near future  
P =>  Okay Hotel but not the Best The hotel itself is a lovely property  and our room was nice  with a comfortable bed  and nice closet space  I liked the free water in the fridge and the gifts of the bath salts  etc  However  I agree with a previous reviewer that the room does show signs of wear and tear carpet a bit frayed around the edges  and you could see signs of water damage on the walls in the bathroom  In fact  a small corner of black mold was hidden behind the bathroom trash can  We only had the continental breakfast once  rolls were stale  and we ended up just walking down the street to a patisserie the remainder of a stay instead  Also  the offer of free champagne is nice and was one of the reasons I wanted to stay there  but it is only offered between   and   p m   at which time we  and I imagine most people  were out to dinner  The hotel is conveniently located to the Tube station  and if you want to be out of the main areas of the city  this is a great location for you  However  we found ourselves wishing we had stayed in Notting Hill or Covent Garden as we would have liked to had more pubs nearby that we could have gone to for dinner or drinks and walked back to the hotel instead of having to take the Tube  All that being said  the staff was very friendly and welcoming  and we always felt they were happy to accomodate any request  
P =>   Just gotta love it   HelloMe and my partner stayed in the Ashburn Hotel for   weeks        th of i   and I must say that it was a nice experience Before we arrived here we was not realy sure what to expect due to some bad reviews by some people in here  but we found them not to be true after we got to know the Hotel and its staff Our room was located on the  th floor and was the  nd biggest room the Hotel had to offer  it was quite spacious it had a walk in closet with a small safe and full size mirror a bright and very nice toilette with a bathtub and a large sleeping   living area with a twin size queen bed  a small office desk with a chair  a desk with a mini bar inside   with complementary water    water boiler with a bag of different teas  cocoas and and cofee  a    inch flat screen tv from which you could access  tv channels  buy movies   also erotic   or surf the net  there was also a small table with a chair in the room Every day there was maids doing the rooms  unless noted not to do so by a hanger by the door  if you was late getting up they could do your room at the latest  pm  they started carefully tapping at un notefied doors at   ish am  they did not utter  quot roomservice quot  like in so many other hotels and that was nice in the morning Also included is  Comfy bathrobes and slippersEach day would bring us another turn down gift when the maids was done with our room  Bath salt  bath caviar  bath fizz  rose water face spray and violet candy Unlike the big Hotel across the street from the hotell with its     rooms  the Ashburn is a small and intimate   if you want it to be   hotel with it s    rooms  with so few rooms it makes it very easy to get to know the staff  and that can be quite helpfull as they can take the time to really help you with questions about London and whatnot The Ashburn might seem abit away from the city centre if you look at its location on a map  but i assure you  it is not It s located in a very nice area a few blocks down from Hyde park  the area in which the Ashburn is located is a safe and nice place and you do not need to stress around to find restaurants or shopping centres as they are not far away Just across the street  behind the large Holiday inn Hotell   you can see a place called Waitrose  that is the closest shopping mall  it has a pharmacy    restaurants   Garfunkels and ASK  they can also be acc essed from the outside   money exchange  barber and more   I do suggest you buy a   pack of Waitrose s canned Lemonade  Just behind Waitrose is the main street   Gloucester Road   in this area  it s   blocks from the Ashburn and it has alot of restaurants  cafees  a Burger King  a KFC  a Tesco low price food store  the post office   in the X road    video rental  a beauty store and connected to the Waitrose is also the Tube station  it will take you     min to walk here  so its not far at all When it comes to restaurants in the area I do suggest  Garfunkels or the Green door steak house  there is also an Italian restaurant just beside the Ashburn across the street   to the left when you leave the Hotel   it has good food but the service can be abit odd A place I do not suggest you eat at is the Italian restaurant just down the street from this one   the one that has lot of salmon  sole  lobster and so on on their outside adverts   as they do not take their restaurant serious at all  the waiter was picking his nose and the food was neither good nor very well prepared Just down the road from this silly restaurant is a LARGE      food Mall called  Sainsbury s  it is quite large and very well stocked  I do suggest a visit Further down the road   I suggest you use the tube if you dont like to walk alot   is Earl s court  its a street filled with almost everything of small shops  restaurants and bars  it s well worth a visit and I do recommend you visit the bakery there To any visitor to London I would suggest that you buy a   week tube card   called an Oyster card  and can be bought at the tube station    As it s a very good thing to have   and cheaper then just buying tickets   when one is traveling all over the different tube lines to get around London So to sum things up  the Ashburn is located in a nice part of town and its easy to find your way around after a day or    do not be afraid to talk to the Ashburn s staff as they are all very friendly and helpful The Hotel even offers a good night sleep as it has double glazed windows   which can be opened   and air condition  the only thing I found abit on the the dreary side was the breakfast room  as it only has   tables with room for   people each  that might sometimes cause some queing but then again this is a converted old townhouse  The continental breakfast was  white or brown toast  marmelade  honey  butter    different slices of meat    different slices of cheese  cereals  dried fruits  small danish pasteries  youghurt and Actimel  Apple juice  Orange juice and milk The waitress would get your order for coffee  tea or if you wanted and full english breakfast   sausages  eggs  bacon  hash browns  bakes beans  grilled tomato and mushromms It was and good english breakfast  but it s cheaper over at Garfunkel s or any other close by Bar or cafee I would like to take the time to thank several people at the Ashburn To Steve for helping us with questions and ticket orders around in London To Syle for helping us with the misplaced Theatre ticket to SpamAplot To Andy Sheik to chatting with us for hours at end in the bar To Miklos for mixing up the good drinks To kus   the swede   for beeing a funny scandinavian This is most surely a Hotel we will return to in the near future   Thank you for an excellent and comfortable stay    
P =>   The Perfect Place to Stay My wife and I just returned from a week long vacation in London  and totally enjoyed our stay at the Ashburn Hotel  Our room was on the small side  but adequate  since we did not spend very much time there   quiet  we were not on the street side   comfortable  the queen sized bed was fantastic and the linens were way above average  and was kept beautifully by the staff  The bathroom was nice and the shower was great I guess I need to add that the air conditioning   which we rarely needed   and heat worked well  As an added bonus  there is free internet  accessible from your large  flat screen TV The continental breakfast  which was included in our package  was very nicely displayed  with a nice variety  from cereals  toast  rolls and croissants  cold cuts  fresh fruit  three juices  coffee  and milk delivered individually  The waitresses were attentive  courteous  and quickly learned our likes  We always left for the day well sustained  full of energy  and ready to take on London The concierges were friendly and very helpful  the receptionist was always smiling and ready for light conversation and the manager was very accommodating  The thing is  you got to know the staff and they you The Ashburn s location is ideal  out of the hustle and bustle of the City  but with a Tube stop two short blocks away  all parts of London were easily and quickly accessible  We used the Tube extensively and went in many directions  We never waited more than three minutes for a train to arrive and felt safe at all hours Some of our favorite attractions are very close by as well  The Natural History museum  the Victoria  amp  Albert  the Royal Albert Hall  Kennsington Palace and high tea at the Orangery are very convenient We thoroughly enjoyed our trip in large part to the Ashburn hotel s location  staff  and creature comforts  Stay here  We plan to again and again  
P => Loved the Ashburn The Ashburn is a lovely and elegant hotel  The rooms have gorgeous furnishings and they are spacious  Within walking distance to museums and harrods and   min walk from Gloucester Road Tube Station  I would certainly stay there again  Well done Ashburn  
P =>  the best hotel in london Before I have been in several other hotels in London  spending a lot of money just for their name  but with a bad service  dirty rooms and excessive internet fares  Finally I found out this nice hotel in Kensington and I have been guest here for nine months    So I guess I can say with all the rights that this is the best hotel in London   The staff was always cordial  kind and helpful  They took care of me even when I fallen ill  They serve a plentiful buffet breakfast  and if you re a little bit in delay  they don t lock you out of the dinner room    The rooms were all wonderful too  I tried almost all of them   You ll have a very nice bathroom  clean towels  bathrobe and carpet slippers  Every room has a flat    quot  TV  some room have   of them too  And internet is free  both wireless and on the ethernet plug in the wall  You ll have every day complimentary water in your fridge  a selection of several theas  chocolate and a likeable gift will wait for you on you bedside table every evening  Looking out of your bow windows  you can see the Natural History Museum and the Victoria  amp  Albert Museum  they re very close to the hotel  you have just to walk for    minutes along Cromwell Road  and in    minutes you can reach Harrods   If you need public transport  the    bus stop is just in front of the building  it takes you at Hammersmith and Piccadilly   otherwise the Gloucester Road underground station is behind the corner    minutes walk   Someone says that it is not very cheap  but I can assure you that you ll feel like at home  
P =>   Very good head concierge  I booked this hotel because of all the good reviews on this site The hotel arrange our transport from and to the airport Good private cars  when we arrived in the hotel there was a very nice staff waiting for us We booked a de Luxe room  this gives you just a little more space and a bathtube Room was very clean and the white linnen bed was good quality and crispy clean You can pick up your glass champagne everyday in the bar  a bottle of water everyday in your room  and yes that little present in your room  they do a very good job to give they re guests a little extra            it makes you feel welcome  And that is what this business is about  the only tip that I would like to give to other guests is  order your breakfast in your room with roomservice in advance  the diningroom is very small But you can hang this little card on your door before   am  and you will have a lovely breakfast  with everything on it also little details as actimel etc And in the bar area put down the lights a little bit and put on the candles when they are there  it would make the place more nicer And put on a cd and no radio  it s to easy Next time when we go to Londen  I will book this hotel again And Stephen is a very nice head concierge  a man that takes care of the guests  
P =>   One to avoid When I booked this hotel it was number    in the Tripadvisor top hotels  Today    th e  it s number    and no wonder  There is no staff organisation  There are some very good staff but the management seem to think they are running Fawlty Towers  The reviewer of   st  was correct in everything he said  For the rates they charge there are better options elsewhere  The breakfast room is a total disgrace  Again no organisation  During our first morning we had breakfast in the bar and on the second we gave up and walked out as the staff only dealt with guests who shouted loudest   Okay the rooms are clean and in good condition but that s only because the hotel is fairly new  When we confronted the general manager he told us they were recruiting staff and it was a transitional period  If that s the case please don t waste your money  go elsewhere  I for one won t return  
P =>  Loved this boutique hotel Booked through Late Rooms we stayed here for a romantic weekend when seeking Cirque de Solei at the Royal Albert Hall in uaryI loved the style of this hotel  the bar area with its comfy sofas and champagne before dinner was great Had a few champagne cocktails as they were the same price as most of the spirits with a mixer or glass of wine  So why not  The room was a good size and at the front of the hotel  but not traffic noise  Bathroom was stylish and practical  Huge bed with crisp clean sheets  although I found the bed a bit hard Not impressed with small dining room for breakfast or the       for full english  We found it cheaper to go down the road to Garfunkels I loved staying here  the staff were very friendly and atmosphere was relaxed Easy access to tube station and walking distrance to lots of good places to eat around  BUT DO NOT EAT AT THE PIZZA PLACE JUST OVER THE ROAD  its like faulty towers service  although the steak was to die for Excuse the pics  they are from a little mobile phone  
P => Lovely Boutique Hotel in a Lovely location My wife and I stayed in the hotel for two nights  We find the hotel very nice and extremely clean  We were warmly welcomed  Her staff made us feel home  They were very pleasant and friendly  The hotel is close to so many nice bars and restaurant with an easy access to public transports  The area is safe and within walking distance to Harrods store  We would recommend it to you  surely you would enjoy your stay there and most certainly you will get value for your money as we did  
P =>  Adored the Ashburn We have just returned from a    day stay at The Ashburn   We can t say enough lovely things about this small boutique hotel   it is warm and welcoming and well situated  Trust the website  All of the advertised amenities and conveniences are delivered graciously and with warmth by the staff  The room we had was a lovely King  the mattress and bedding were new  clean  and very comfortable  The bathroom was terrific   with plenty of hot water  good water pressure  giant bath towels  wash cloths  and plentiful Gilcrest  amp  Soames bath products Amenities included  safe  blowdryer  slippers  bathrobe  evening  quot gift quot   evening champagne  free wi fi  a large flat screen tv in the room  cold breakfast with fabulous fresh pressed coffee made on the spot  water stocked in the fridge in the room  morning newspaper delivered to the door  Couldn t have asked for or wanted more  We had one light dinner in the bar lounge area and the food was accessibly priced and very good  Other guests took advantage of the assistance of the concierges far more than we did  but we overheard rave reviews and many thanks being exchanged for the advice and arrangements being made The rooms are indeed on the smaller side  as is the way in London  and some folks had issue with the AC in their rooms  but the windows open  the nights were cool  and we wouldn t have noticed except for a sign posted in the elevators  Things that are not exactly like  quot home quot  elsewhere in the world do always seem to be about plumbing and HVAC   We traveled to see London  see friends  rest and experience something different and it was all wonderful  The value for the money is exceptional   and with the exchange rate being what it is   we wouldn t say that lightly The hotel is in a fabulous location   literally around the corner from the Gloucester Road tube station in the Kensington South Kensington area  There are terrific amenities in the area for visitors including a bustling post office  great bakeries  a Starbucks  all night convenience store  take away fish and chips shop  and a nice pub  The hotel is across the street from a very large Holiday Inn  The HI is    stories   it is not off putting at all and actually came in very handy  The first night we took a stroll   without a map   and wound up navigating back to the Ashburn by way of the Holiday Inn which we could thankfully see in the distance   the area is bustling and safe around the clock  Double hung windows contribute to the quiet in the room From the hotel you can easily walk to the Museum of Science  V amp A  Kensington Palace  Kensington Gardens  and Kensington High Street and the South Kensington Tube station   another area full of cafes and restaurants Originally  we came upon this hotel on the Epoque Hotel site   an interesting collection of boutique hotels throughout the world  Reviews on TripAdvisor were very helpful as well  
P =>  Warning   New Owners   Avoid Ashburn   Not The Same Anymore It is unfortunate to have to write such a review about the hotel that I have stayed at along with my colleagues for countless times before but I hope to have others avoid the experience of the new Ashburn ownership This hotel used to be our favorite in London  I personally have stayed at the hotel over     nights and my Company has put up over    employees from the US in the hotel  The Ashburn used to be the best place in London with an amazing staff  Unfortunately  during our month long stay in  the hotel was sold to a new Company  The new General Manager is downright abusive and is letting the hotel literally fall apart  All I can tell you is avoid staying here now  It is no longer anything close to what it was under the old team  Some specifics    the aircondition constantly breaks and the rooms get so hot they are literally unbearable  We waited over    days for them to fix the aircondition as of this date  when I and my team are leaving the hotel  the aircondition is still broken  The new general manager  the previous one was outstanding but she is no longer with the hotel  basically told us to deal with it or leave the hotel  It is literally unbearable and for the money is downright unacceptable    The hotel is falling apart in many areas since the new GM has arrived  I personally had to move rooms four times during this stay due to the AC and water leaks from the ceiling    Most alarmingly  there seems to be a cockroach problem emerging as they are seen more and more around the hotel  It is really sad to see such a great hotel fall apart but I guess management is what makes a great hotel great    The only redeeming thing left at the hotel is the marvelous staff from the previous GM but they are all fed up with the lack of service of the new owner and manager as well  When I complained about the aircondition and water leaks going unresolved week after week we were told to stop complaining     It is so sad to see this all happening but we have now moved our folks to another beautiful hotel  for less money by the way  down the street and could not be happier  To all the amazing staff at the Ashburn  I am most sorry  They worked so hard to make the hotel wonderful for its guests but unfortunately it has now become a place I would never stay at again    Finally  beware that the breakfast  though advertised a full breakfast  is not in fact one now    also beware that if you book anything now through the hotel  car service  etc   the owner takes a commission for himself but does not tell you  we figured it out from the car service by calling them direct If you do stay at the hotel  the other danger beyond everything above are the steps out front  when it rains  it becomes very slipperly and you can fall and really hurt yourself  Hopefully by posting this  the new GM will listen to the comlaints on this one and put some rubber treading on the steps  It is just amazing to me how much lack of customer service or general hotel adherence to safety is being allowed in the hotel Enjoy London and if you stay at the Ashburn  make sure you are prepared for the things above  I will never stay there again  
P =>   Wonderful Place to Stay After reading the reviews of this hotel  my wife and I stayed for   nights and found it to be every bit as nice and comfortable as described  Completely renovated a year ago and the place is maintained sparkling clean  Room well laid out  bed and linens very comfortable  bath really clean  A C worked well as we were there during a hot spell  Flat panel TV well placed  Live orchid on the table  Welcoming  plunger pots  of coffee and all of the staff could not have been more helpful and cordial  In room amenities of tea kettle  terry cloth robes and slippers  thick clean carpeting  wi fi all appreciated  The double glazed windows    for our room  make for marvellous quietness in spite of being adjacent to Cromwell Road  Good restaurants nearby  especially Il Falconiere for Italian  With American tourism down taxis are everywhere  Kensington location a plus  We would have no hesitency in returning  
P =>  Really good hotel great position Ashburn Hotel is a small hotel in Cromwell road  in a great central position to reach all the principal places and monuments of the city  also thanks to the proximity of the Gloucester station of the underground  which also travels directly to Heathrow airport   The staff is very helpful and kind  and this also contributes to the perception of a very welcoming environment here  We appreciated the offering of the coups of champagne during the evenings  from   to   pm  The only defect we have to remark is the  small  dimension of the dining room in the basement level of the building  which particularly during the morning turns out to be inadequate to accomodate even half of the guests at the same time  
P =>   Pleasant but not a bargain Some of the other posts mention the hotel was a bargain  but our booking was definitely not cheap  We booked because it offered many nice extras like breakfast  glass of champagne in the evening  complementary welcome drink  non alcoholic   tea and coffee in the room plus free use of internet  All of these definitely add up at a normal hotel  Hotel is located     blocks from Gloucester tube stop which is very convenient  Definitely one of the more notable boutique hotels I have visited  I recommend this to anyone who values the extra touches  
P =>  Good quality and price I have stayed here twice in the last month and found this great gem  Hotel prices in London are out of this world but this one is in a different league  I was actually concerned about only paying      including breakfast Compared to my experiences in other London   star hotels this one compares very favourably  The rooms are of an OK size  The beds are excellent It is one block away from the Gloucester underground station which is on the Piccadilly line  It means ou can get there directly from the airport One word of warning  The first time I was given room     which is not on the  th floor but in the basement  Although the windows are of a good size and there is pelnty of light  they actually call it the ground floor   it is too noisy there  You are right next to the kitchen and small dining room  Also all the hotel workers keep passing in front of your room  After a couple of days I asked for a room change and they obliged as they were not full  The concierge is helpful as well  
P =>  Something special A smaller  boutique hotel  the Ashburn faces a very large Holiday Inn  and is located on a pretty busy road with wide pavements in a nicer London borough  The surrounding areas feel as safe as one can expect in london  There are plenty of shops   including a large Sainsbury s   and restaurants within walking distance and it is close to Gloucester Road tube station  The staff at the Ashburn were faultlessly welcoming and friendly  Included in the price  the cold breakfast was tasty and pleasant  A small gift is placed in each room at turn down time before bed  and there is a complimentary free glass of champagne during the evening which adds to the feeling of luxury  The hotel bedrooms themselves are quite small  as expected in London  but the whole hotel seems well decorated  clean and comfortable  The bed itself was comfy  Altogether  I am glad we chose this hotel  It is small enough to feel homely and welcoming while the staff are attentive and helpful  So many hotels in London could follow this example  We really enjoyed our stay  
P =>  Great hotel nice little touches My husband and I had a nice stay at the Ashburn   It s a small little hotel with lovely clean rooms just a block from the Gloucester Rd  station  It was a terrific base for exploring London  Breakfast every morning was basic and a good start to the day  Little gifts on the pillow each night and the champagne in the lobby are pleasant touches  Don t go expecting the concierge services of a huge hotel  but for the price we were paying that should be understood  We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay again if we returned to London  
P => I want to go back  We stayed at the Ashburn Hotel for four nights and were not disappointed  I booked the stay based on TripAdvisor comments and have to agree with all the positives others have posted  The rooms are lovely  the view magnificent  and the service delightful  Everyone was helpful and went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed  For example  I reserved two rooms and requested they be near each other if possible  We were pleasantly surprised to have the rooms right next to each other with a private external door which effectively made our two rooms a suite if we wanted to leave the internal doors open  It was quite nice  One room was what you d expect of an American hotel bed  desk  bathroom  etc   but the other was huge  It had a sitting area with a couch and t v  in addition to the bedroom area and bathroom  After all my research I d expected the rooms to be tiny  Breakfast was delicious meats  cheeses  bread  french pressed coffee  fruit  cereal  Can you tell I want to go back  The best part was the convenient location  Only one block from the tube station and many restaurants and grocery stores in the immediate vicinity  I highly recommend the Ashburn Hotel  
P =>  Bye bye Bailey Loved the Ashburn  I have stayed at the Bailey  which is on the other side of the Gloucester Rd tube station  this time I chose the Ashburn based on TA reviews The only thing the Bailey has over the Ashburn is that the Bailey s door is literally across the street from the tube station where the Ashburn is a block away  But other than that     The Ashburn s rooms are new and nice  Bedding is awesome  Amenities are great  Bathrooms are new and CLEAN  hard to find in London   They are also well lit  They are small  but what isn t in central London The Ashburn has free wireless internet  A big plus in a country where    pounds day is not unusual   ridiculous  but not unusual  The Ashburn has a decent free breakfast  It s continental  but the prices on the optional hot food are very reasonable  Coffee is french press The Ashburn has turndown service and leaves little goodies on your bed at night     I got a fizzy bath ball and some bath beads  Not a necessary thing  but a really nice touch  and the bathtub was clean enough to use  The staff was extremely friendly  The bellhop even offered to go to the Waitrose and buy me a stamp   The price is right  I paid     pounds  inclusive of VAT  I expect it to go up  one can only hope the exchange rate gets better  but that s one of the best prices I could find for the area If you re looking for a place in Kensington or a hotel that s convenient to the tube  the Ashburn is a great choice   
P =>   Finally a place in London worthy of a good review I m in London quite often for business and have yet to really find a place in the Kensington area worth going back to  see previous reviews   Anyhow  I stayed at the Ashburn Hotel last month and was quite impressed  The location is great  the staff is friendly  and the rooms are comfortable  Its not going to be the biggest room you ve ever seen  so be sure to ask for room facing the north  I believe those are bigger  the beds are vey comfortable and if you can figure out how to use the air controls you ll got the tools for a great night of sleep  the front desk attendant wasnt so sure how to work the codes with the free wireless so that was a little bit frustrating  To his credit  I think he was a new hire  Either way  I think this is a great place to stay for a night or a week  the flat screen tvs and the complimentary champagne int he evening are nice touches  
P =>   Fantastic hotel   what more can I say  I first stayed at the Ashburn in      while on my first trip ever to London   back then it was cheap  and maybe not so cheerful      years on and while looking for suitable accommodation for a business trip from Australia  I was intrigued to find it had been completely revamped and reopened only a few months ago  I booked my   nights online  and checked in after a long    hour flight on the   th ember  The staff really made me feel welcome Overall  the staff are very friendly   from the concierge and front desk through to the girls who look after you at breakfast each morning  The room was fantastic  comfortable bed  clean  and attention to detail and comfort  They even provide a complimentary glass of champagne each night  to entice you out of your room and to explore what London has to offer   and a turn down service with a gift of either chocolates  sweets  or bath products every night when you get back To be honest  I have now found my  quot home away from home quot  when in London on business  It s very good value for the quality and location  and the staff are just great I would thoroughly recommend the Ashburn for anyone visiting London for business or pleasure  
P =>  Great stay again  Came back again to this hotel  visited the first time in  and it is still fantastic  great staff  great location and i even got upgraded this time  The concierge remembered me since my last visit   which is very unusal in busy hotels  and even asked how our summer had been  The free internet access and the great breakfast that is included is a big plus  i will return again in the near future  
P =>   Great rooms  We stayed at this hotel for two nights in ober  I had read lots of reviews before going and have to say  that I agree with the positives people have said  It is a very charming hotel in a very good location  It is clean and the decor is fantastic  Our room was great  We had a superior king and it was an L shape room with a sofa on one side and the large bed on the other  There were two large screen tv s in the room and some beautiful boutique style pieces of furniture  We also thought that having the television sound in the bathroom was a nice quirky feature  The turn down gifts were a lovely touch and the idea of the champagne was really nice  although I think the timing with that could be better  as it is between   and   and as we watched shows in the West End both nights  we had left the hotel before   and so did not get to take advantage of this  We also never got a drink on arrival  The first morning we ate our breakfast in the dining room and were very happy with the selection  However  as the second morning was my birthday we ordered room service and we were disappointed with that  The porridge was cold  and there was no friut or yoghurt  as in description   Overall  I would say that this is a good hotel in a good location and I would possibly stay there again as the pros definately outweigh the cons  
P =>   Great but with a few drawbacks for the business traveler I really liked this hotel for its charm  convenience  and value  It s very close to the Gloucester Rd station  Staff are friendly  and I liked the nice touches  such as the daily gift  bath salts  chocolates   the glass of champagne in the lobby every evening  and the supply of umbrellas by the door for London s famous weather  The continental breakfast spread is very nice as well  And I appreciated the free internet access  which is not to be taken for granted when some hotels charge an additional GBP    a day However  there were little things which weren t so perfect  Many of the rooms are right on Cromwell Road and the soundproofing isn t perfect   though it didn t bother me in the least  and the soundproofing is decent  light sleepers should take note  Wakeup calls didn t always come through  and the staff  while friendly  weren t as polished and professional as you would find at a more upscale hotel The biggest problem for me was that I was here on business and it is not ideally set up for that  There is no place to meet people other than a small lobby  where everyone can hear everyone else s conversations  so we kept having to duck out to Gloucester Road to find somewhere to meet  There are also no business facilities  such as printers  so i had to email documents to my hotmail account and print them at the front desk    as long as there was nobody checking in or out at the time  The breakfast room was a small room below ground level  so that was also not a good place to meet with clients or partners  Also  I booked on travelocity  and travelocity was no help in changing the reservation when i needed to  the hotel did it without a problem when i called directly but I went back and forth between the two of them  and it took a while to get a confirmation back from the hotel I would definitely stay here again  amp  recommend it  but not if I had the same business needs as i did on my most recent stay  
P =>  Practically perfect  hotel in Kensington This is our third visit to London and we re so happy we will never have to look for another hotel in London again after spending    nights at the  quot practically perfect quot  Ashburn Hotel in Kensington   Okay      we saw y Poppins while in London    From the gracious and friendly staff we encountered in all capacities in the hotel  well appointed rooms  spotless facilities  excellent breakfasts  hot and cold  and coffee  free wifi  evening champagne  and perfect location a   minute walk from the District  Circle and Piccadilly tube lines at Gloucester Rd       we simply loved our stay at the Ashburn We stayed one night in a Queen room on the  rd floor which was lovely  though compact with the closet wardrobe offering shelves for storage and the mini fridge and kettle housed in the other half  An armchair with bed side tables and lamps were the other furniture in the room  We did have a little difficulty with the wifi in that room but did not try the tv internet service  which would likely have been fine The rest of our time was spent in a king room on the  th floor with a very spacious layout  desk for our laptop  guidebooks and such  arm chair  walk in closet with safe and bench  cupboard housing the fridge with open space in one half for storage  It might have had a slightly larger bathroom too though the vanity and amenties were the same as in the Queen room  We appreciated the larger room since our daughter lived nearby and it gave us more space to relax with her at different times during the day Not only will we return to the Ashburn  but I would recommend this hotel to friends with no hesitation  We got a very good rate through the hotel website with breakfast included  And emails were answered promptly and politely when I did have an inquiry I hate to even mention this  but the only hesitation for a recommendation would be for an older couple or someone who might have some mobility problems  While the shower bath system with the handheld and fixed shower is very good  you do need to be able to lift your leg at least    quot  or so to enter the deep bathtub  There are grab bars in the bathtub itself though The Waitrose grocery  Boots drugstore and ASK pizza pasta restaurant are in the nearby mall  We really enjoyed our pizza salads there    do not bother with the neighborhood Italian spot across the street from the hotel  Just a    minute walk north off Gloucester was a terrific little Polish restaurant   Wodka  Great menu if you like Eastern European food  Olives in the Bailey Hotel on Gloucester was also very enjoyable  and for pastries or sandwiches  there were several good choices also on Gloucester Rd near the tube station The Ashburn Hotel and the Kensington area are a great choice  As you can see from the photos  the Natural History and Science Museums and the Victoria and Albert Museum  are only a    minute walk from the hotel  We left our luggage in the hotel storage area before our flight  and still felt like we had a full day visiting museums with time for coffee and cookies in the lounge before we had to leave for the airport at     pm  Perfect  
P =>  Lived up to the great reviews  Like some others  we made this reservation based on one great review and we were not disappointed  The location is fabulous in that it s safe  for a city   close to the Gloucester Road tube stop  and a reasonably short walk to many restaurants  You do need to take the tube for most attractions with the exception of a couple museums Hotel itself was very clean and beautifully done  Great staff who were helpful when needed  Free champagne each night was a nice treat  Rooms and baths are large by city standards with nice amenities  Breakfast was more than ample enough to get you on your way  meats  cheeses  cereals  breads  hard boiled eggs  yogurt  juices  coffee  tea  etc  and the dining room was very comfortable  although I agree the chairs are a bit cumbersome   One night I had dinner off of the bar menu and it was fabulous  Butternut squash risotto with creamy stilton bleau cheese and some dressed greens on top  Wow  A good sized serving too  Cost of   pounds  I think My only complaints  which were minor  was that the pillows were so big that it was a little hard to sleep on them  Also  there weren t any instructions on how to use the  free  internet access   done through the flat screen TV  There were instructions for other things like the heat air and the in room safe  but not the TV Overall  we loved it and would definitely stay again  It s very pricey  but what isn t in London  
P =>   Great location comfortable and spotless We stayed at the Ashburn for a week based on Tripadvisor reviews  and we were not disappointed  The hotel is in a great location in South Kensington and literally   blocks from the Gloucester tube station and a few blocks from Kensington park palace  It was simple to get to any of the major sites  we just picked up a   day oyster card to ride the tube for the week  The    room hotel is brand new and has everything you d need  There s a safe  mini fridge  and a great flat screen tv that will get you free internet access without a laptop  You can even program the tv to get your wake up call for the nice continental breakfast every morning  Hot breakfasts can be ordered  but we had plenty with the selection of pastries  cereal  yogurt  muesli  meats  and cheeses  There s complimentary champagne each night and a yummy menu for a light lunch or dinner if you chose to eat in  The beds were pretty comfortable for European standards and the bath included a tub and shower  which you don t always get at other hotels  The room was also very quiet and good sized for Europe  We were in     on the top floor and had a remote view of the London Eye  Everything was spotless  and the staff even left a little surprise  e g   chocolates  bath salts  each night with the turndown service  The decor was tasteful and included beautiful  live orchids  Location next door to a Waitrose grocery  pharmacy  and post office was also convenient Although English was not the first language of several staff members  communication was not a problem  Everyone was very nice and responsive to requests  The only problem we had was the lack of hot water on two mornings  However  this was promptly fixed  and we were offered a shower in another room when I was running late for a business meeting  We re pretty picky about hotels  and this met all our expectations  We only wish the US dollar was doing better compared to the pound  London gets pricey now  The nice thing is that most museums are free  and there are plenty of reasonable restaurants in the area  We tried several good Indian places off Old Brompton  just a few blocks south  and were very happy  All in all  a terrific find for a boutique hotel in London

P =>  Tr s bonne adresse

P =>   Bellissimo albergo  
P => 
P =>   well located very small and expensive Clerks speak very poor English  Irakians  Bulgarians  HongKong   Rooms are tiny  barely the size of the bed  Shared bathroom  no elevator  very narrow  and steep   staircase Very expensive considerring the conditions Please avoid  
P =>  Ok for the money   just We had two rooms booked   mine was fine though deep down in the basement  reasonably modern furnishings  my collegues was very jaded and dirty  staff not overly interested Breakfast was OK  The location is very handy and quiet 
P =>  Well its British    Move this hotel to most other European cities   it would be crap  But  This is London  and for London its quite good  Location    block from Paddington tube Heathrow Express  McDonalds a few Delis around the corner  Its on a very quiet street  so no noise at night at all Reception  super friendly and helpful receptionists  They still see visitors as guests and welcome you  This alone justifies   stars  Again  This is London  check out other hotels and they wont even look at you   Rooms  Ok  there are   sets of rooms  The cheap room without ensuite shared bathroom outside  and the ones with own bathroom  If you take the non bathroom rooms I wld recommend room      There are a few other ones I looked at      is def the best single room Prices  Gv them a call to book  do not book online  If you call they are more flexible with the rates    also  if you stay close to a week  ask for a discount  You should get the no bathroom room for GBP    For that location   you wont beat that Overall  Its an old  british hotel  they didnt invest in the past   yrs or so  BUT  They kept everything clean  staff is very friendly  its location is great for tourists  and  its cheap  
P =>   Adequate for my needs Stayed here for one night last weekend  and am booked to stay again this weekend on my way back through London  Overall  no complaints  The single room was tiny but clean  and the shared bathroom was also clean  The room was quiet  even with the window open at night  Breakfast was great  I thought the selection was fine  and the staff were all friendly  I was impressed that when I checked in  the receptionist  noticing my huge suitcase suggested that I leave it in the baggage room rather than carrying it up to my room  which I gladly did  I am staying here again in a couple of days  and with the convenient location right around the corner from Paddington station  I will most likely use it again in the future  
P =>   Great Hotel for family on a budget A great location  just a few blocks from Paddington Station  Very friendly reception staff and good breakfast included in the reasonable rate  Perhaps the only hotel in London with a room that will sleep a family of five  We look forward to returning  
P =>   Cheap and great location I stayed here in room    for   nights in y  The room was small  twin room with single beds next to each other    should really be a single room  The en suite was again small but was cleanish  The biggest draw back for me was the heat   it was like a sauna   therefore it was difficult to sleep  There was a fan which made very little impact  If you are looking for somewhere cheap  quiet  with excellent location then this is the place  
P =>  Excellent apart from Breakfast I stayed for two nights my only complaint about my room was it was on the  th floor and there is no lift  It certainly keeps you fit climbing all those stairs  Apart from that it was very good  comfortable bed  quiet location and excellent value for money  Breakfast was a disapointment   Cooked breakfast consisted of Egg  Bacon and the worst sausage I have ever tasted   very thin  no taste and almost uneatable  Also you have to help yourself to hot drinks and fruit juices in the next room  I went to get a second cup of tea mid way through my breakfast and being on my own  by the time I got back to the table the waitress had cleared the table I would certainly stay in this hotel again when in London   but would hope for a room not on the  th floor  Also I will know not to ask for a sausage for breakfast  
P =>   Not bad at all The location is great     minutes from Paddington tube and station   excellent  I d booked a single room with bath  which turned out to be a small room on the landing with a strange two part entrance  through the door up a very narrow little staircase to the actual room   The bathroom was a tiny plastic cubicle in the corner and the shower part of the cubicle would not fit a grown man neither in height nor width but I managed  The room was cleaned every day and I can t say really anything bad about it  London is expensive and you don t get more than you pay for Service at reception was fine  the English breakfast was fine except it finished at  am already  A bit early  if you re on holiday  which I would presume most of their clients are  Also  on the first morning  they d run out of eggs  How can a hotel run out of eggs  But if that s the only bad thing I have to say about it    I d come back  
P =>   decent value burt some problems i agree with what most others have said  the location near paddington train underground station is very convenient  the price on expedia was reasonable  the hotel is generally very clean  the best thing about the palce was the large breakfast  but terrible sausages that noone ate  and themn excellent dining room staff  they were consistently very nice and efficient  the cleaning staff were also very good workers  the desk staff were another story  there was an asian woman who was very helpful but there was another male day stafperson who was totally disinterested in customer service  he was cold and not helpful  the rooms were clean but VERY tiny  the hotel was quiet the   weeks that i stayed there  but sometimes noisy outside on w e nights  i d probably stay there again if the price was discounted  
P =>   good price nice bedroom Great location  next to Paddington station   in front of a nice and quiet square  with restaurants near it  including McDonalds and BurguerKing  The personel is not always friendly  but they are efficient  The breakfast is ok  with eggs  bacon and saussages  not my favorite dish   The bedroom is clean and good size  but has carpet all over it  and the floor screetches with every step you take  The bathroom is also clean  but has stains on the walls and is very  very small  A tall big man does not feet confortably in there  And the worst thing  there is no lift  Try to carry heavy bags on narrow stairs    
P =>   Cheap somewhere to rest I stayed here for   nights in   It was very cheap for london so wasnt expecting a great hotel  The area is great lots of places to eat  right next to a tube station so perfect for a stay in london  The rooms where small and need up dating and the  en suite  was a shoe box the toilet was basically in the shower  Other than that the rooms where clean and warm so perfect just to rest in if spending your day out of the hotel  The staff where ok  breakfast staff where really pleasant  i only paid for continental and they kept try to give me full english every morning  Which i only turnt down as was in london doing a personal training course so im always careful with what i eat and dont see that as a great breakfast to go excise on  
P =>   Smashing Time This is a budget hotel so any other expectations re accommodation are a little trite  If you are a skinflint like me you will be attracted by a great price  excellent location including breakfast  We paid about      for   nights for   people   The rooms are small  en suite is shoebox size  a little musty as well however you pay for what you get  We were pleased with our general stay  the staff were courteous and friendly apart from the receptionist who appeared a little cold and un interested at times  It was a quiet setting with tube about   minutes away with a great selection of cafes near by  London on a budget was fine  museums inc Tate Modern were fun  You don t have to spend a fortune in London if you just plan the visits carefully  We enjoyed Covent Gardens at night  We would stay at the Ashley again unless we won the lottery of course then we would stay at the Ritz  
P =>   Great Value for Money for London We went to London on a shopping  sightseeing and cultural trip  in that order   So we wanted to stay somewhere central  close to all the top destinations but wanted to save our pennies to have more for shopping  Hence our choice of Ashley Hotel I have read all my fellow travellers reviews of this hotel  and they are very mixed and quite harsh sometimes  which in my opinion is totally unjustified The hotel location is superb  just off Paddington station  e g  Heathrow Express   very handy  and you are literally minutes away  by bus  from Oxford Street  the British Museum  Madame Tussauds etc  Now there is a Hilton around the corner but if  like us  you prefer to spend your money on shopping  then Ashley is a very good choice OK  the rooms are small  not handy if you have a lot of luggage  and the bathroom is the size of a shoebox  I have never seen one so small  actually  BUT  Everything is clean  safe  the breakfast is ok and there is a lovely park just outside the hotel  And there is wi fi thoroughout the hotel You just have to be realistic about your expectations  London is one of the most expensive cities in the world and large hotel rooms come with a hefty price tag  Ashley Hotel has fantastic location  and anyway  there is more to do in London than stay in your  large  hotel room  so Ashley gets my vote  
P =>   Things are going downhill at the Ashley  I have stayed at the Ashley Hotel on about   occasions per year for the past    years or more  I have found the hotel to be fine  It s basic but clean and I have never had any complaints until now However  things have changed radically in recent months following a change of ownership  The first complaint I had was that they insisted I pay for my stay immediately upon arrival  I refused on the grounds that I was a regular customer and that I would pay on departure as i do in all other hotels and as I have always done in the Ashley  They finally relented and agreed I could pay on departure My second complaint concerned the breakfast  As a Bed and Breakfast establishment they really only have to get   things right i e  the bed and the breakfast  The Ashley advertises a full English breakfast  The most important feature of the English breakfast is a large pot of tea   or coffee if you re that way inclined   Imagine my surprise  therefore to find that the breakfast table had been set with no cups   just the saucers  When I enquired about the apparent oversight I was told that the cups were available at the buffet bar and that I had to make my own tea from a boiler located outside the breakfast room  If I needed a second or third cup of tea  I would have to go through the same ritual  That  to my mind is not a breakfast  much less an English breakfast  I ll be looking elsewhere for accommodation in London for my future trips  
P => basic hotel with small roms This is a basic hotel  rooms are clean but small  Also there is no elevator and the hotel has   floors  I paid GBP    per night for a room with shared facilities  basic English breakfast included  Booked with hotel website www ashleyhotellondon com   I recommend this hotel for people on a budget  but I would not stay at this hotel for more than   night because of the size of rooms The Paddington area is nice and quite with a few restaurants and bars  the hotel is about   minutes walk from Paddington tube station  
P =>   Comfortable and Clean I stayed here for a week and my only complaint is that there was no elevator  so I had to navigate    steps up and down each day and evening  Once I finally got my luggage upstairs it wasn t so bad  but that first trip was a challenge  The room and en suite bathroom was immaculate  always my biggest concern  Good shower  plenty of hot water  The bed was very comfortable  also important to me because I have some back issues  VERY convenient to the Paddington tube stop    only about a two minute walk  and there are lots of pubs  restaurants  markets and the train station nearby  The room was cleaned everyday and fresh towels  coffee  tea and soap were left  There is no A C  and at first the room was stuffy  but opening the window solved the problem  For the most part  the front desk staff were helpful and pleasant  although I think one of them really hates his job  If you just want a comfy  clean and affordable place to crash at night  it s perfect  Not luxurious  not romantic  but a good value all the same  I would stay there again  
P =>   Good location but    This hotel is conveniently located about   mins walk from Paddington station but the room that we stayed in for   nights left a lot wanting  The  toilet shower  was the size of a tiny closet  just about the same size as one of those portable toilets on the street  Breakfast was nice but was only up til  am  The  quiet  square was actually quite noisy as we stayed on the ground floor  facing into the square  and just next to the reception desk  There was no privacy at all as the beds were just a stone s throw away from passer bys on the street  
P =>  Basic reasonably comfortable good value I stay in this hotel from time to time as Paddington is my  point of entry  to London and it s convenient  the beds are generally comfortable and the hotel is in a fairly quiet square  It s also clean and good value by London standards  The rooms are mostly small and many of them have tiny  wet cubicles  for showering  Rooms at the back lack a view unless on the top floor  but can be quieter  Ground floor can be quite noisy depending on when people are leaving  I think this is a good B amp B hotel for a     night stay if you don t want to spend much time in your room  There s a discount for top floor rooms  no lift  and for singles without shower in the room  Occasionally I ve had problems with getting enough water to the shower  but this seems to have been resolved in my last couple of stays  
P => Don t book room Nr   First thing to say is that the ownership has changed three months ago and the new web page is http   www ashleyhotellondon com  It wasn t my first stay in this hotel  but it was the first stay in room Nr   ground floor  with window facing the window of a room in front of  don t know the number of that room   and in the night  of course  you can hear every guest entering the entrance door  Latest guests come around  am and first guests leave approximately at the same time My advise  don t book ground floor Otherwise I can only confirm  it s clean  I was there only for one night this time  so it didn t make much difference for me where I slept  but I wanted to be in a clean place  and this hotel offers this  
P =>   Okay for One Night After traveling around England I came back to London for   night  If getting a train to Heathrow from Paddington  this is a good location  It s   block from the station and they hold your suitcase in a locked room after checkout free  Plus it s cheap  only      for a single  including breakfast But what a sad little room  Mine looked into another window across a narrow shaft  Could NOT open the curtain  The shower and toilet are in a small closet that a larger person might find impossible to use  The sink was IN the desk  see photo   Everything was clean  but the bed was old and covered with an odd variety of blankets  No suitcase rack  A tiny bar of soap and a tiny TV that got   channels  those were odd too   perched high on the wall were the only  quot amenities quot   Although a notice said to ask for an iron or hairdryer at the front desk  I could NOT spend more than ONE night in a room like this  
P =>   Clean quiet hotel I d stayed at this hotel a few years ago but between booking and arriving the hotel website disappeared from the internet and from the booking site which made me a little nervous  Apparently the hotel management has been taken over but it made no difference to my stay  I had a single room on the first floor  overlooking Norfolk square  The room was as I expected  small but adequate with a small but adequate bathroom  The room was kept meticulously clean and the staff  whether in the dining room or the cleaners or the desk staff  were always helpful  I stayed for    days and found the location    minutes from Paddington tube  excellent  There are restaurants  amp  pubs  amp  internet cafes etc in the area  The area is usually quiet though there was noise in the square one night after an important football match  important to some  not me    There is no airs conditioning and no lift so if you were on an upper floor or it was very hot it might be awkward  Although I had only one case the receptionist was willing to carry it up for me  not necessary for me bu tif you were elderly it would be helpful I had a very pleasant stay and enjoyed the full breakfast and quiet surroundings  
P =>   Great Family Hotel We stayed for a week  and were very happy with the hotel  We were in a family room   small  but workable  The bunk bed was perfect for our kids   boy      and girl       Close to the tube  Paddington Station   and direct access to from Heathrow     minute walk to Hyde Park  Breakfast was good for us and the kids   even our picky eater  Staff was very  very helpful  Best value we could find by far  and we would definitely go back  
P =>  Overcharged for Phone calls The hotel is fine   can be noisy  Big downer at the end   they charged me     for a phone call I didn t make  The manager would not budge  Refused to believe I hadn t made the call  and was really rude to me  
P =>   A friendly base in Paddington   London We stayed for two nights at the Ashley Hotel  It provided reasonably priced clean accommodation in an ideal location to explore London  It is situated on south side of Norfolk Square in Paddington  London and is a short walk from Paddington Underground Station  Likewise  Hyde Park is very close There are numerous restaurants in the area within easy walking distance The reception staff were very friendly and helpful  We asked the receptionist to suggest a Restaurant late in the evening when we arrived that was within walking distance  We were directed to ASK  an Italian Restaurant on Spring Street which served Pizza Pasta Salads at a reasonable price  It was just around the block and was an excellent recommendation  We dined there on two occassions Our room was located on the third floor and contained a small seperate ensuite formed in the corner of the bedroom in which the shower and WC were to be found  The associated wash hand basin was located in the bedroom itself  Simple accommodation  some would say basic  but most importantly clean  There was plenty of hot water at all times  The Hotel is a labyrinth of staircases leading up four floors and it looks as though it was originally three town houses which are now joined together  A kettle was provided with tea coffee etc  There was also a small TV in the bedroom with remote control Breakfast was served from     am to     am in the basement dining room  This is not as grim a location as it initially sounds as the Ashley Hotel is a Victorian Townhouse and its basement  whilst below street level  receives natural daylight light from it basement windows set back from the street Breakfast consisted of help yourself fruit juice and cereals  followed by an  English Breakfast  of two slices of Bacon  a fried Egg and a Sausage and was quickly served by the waitress  The Bacon was particularly of good quality   No white stuff   Several customersasked for scrambled eggs instead of the fried egg and this again was no problem  A rack of Hot toast  white and wholemeal  was served at the table together with a pot of Tea  Cafetiere of Coffee etc  When we asked for a refill  this was again quickly served  A good basic filling breakfast  Check out time was      am  As we had a late afternoon train  we asked if we could leave our bags  Again no problem and we were directed to a storage room which was unlocked by the receptionist To conclude  the Ashley Hotel is a simple no frills hotel  But then again that s what your paying for  It does its job very well  
P =>   Charming good value hotel in London We stayed at The Ashley Hotel for   nights  We walked in off the street inquiring about rooms after our originial hotel was not fit to sleep in  The Ashley put us up in a family room until other rooms became available  This hotel is very close to Paddington and Hyde Park  The staff was very helpful  especially Billy  The breakfast was what I expected for a budget hotel  cereal  juice and a cooked breakfast with eggs  bacon  and toast  The rooms are clean and yes  the bathrooms are very small  but adequate  If I ever go back to London  I would stay at this hotel  Overall  a pleasant experience  
P =>  Great value and clean what more could you want on a budget  After a horrrible experience earlier in the month at The Spring Park Hotel  Finsbury see my review  I took more care this time and read the Trip advisor revierws carefully  My only real desire was that the hotel be clean  on a     budget this is not always possible in London I paid     per night on a   night stay  the hotel is located   min walk from Paddington station with numerous stores  supermarkets and fast food oulets right on it s doorstep along with several Internet cafes  it is convenient  All the buildings in Norfolk Square seem to be hotels  some look cleaner than others             The lobby is small but clean  no lift  my room was on the  nd floor you would not want to have a room on the  th if you are forgetful  the room was clean  it didn t smell  I nearly fell over with relief after the Spring Park experience  It was a little faded but had the basics  a little TV  kettle  several drawers and a good sized wardrobe  My toilet shower was not en suite but across the landing  no great problem but it was one of those kit built pods and very small The breakfast is served in the basement  another reason not to have  th floor room   the room is large  clean with lots of space for everyone and a good selection of cereals and fruit juices  Toast and English breakfast is included also and was fine  Plenty of friendly staff so service is quick The only downside for me was that you are given keys so that you have      access  I hate this sytem as I always lose the keys  I d prefer a keypad entry but now I am nitpicking  For     it is a bargain  
P =>  Good value great location  Stayed at the Ashley Hotel for   days beginning Saturday        The location is excellent  Literally a   minute walk to both Paddington Underground Station and Paddington Rail Station  Therefore  transportation is a snap  The staff was very friendly  including the folks in the breakfast area in the morning  The breakfast is good  too  You get a cooked egg  bacon  and sausage  plus you choose from a group of cereals  juices  etc   In addition to my room key I got a separate key which got me into the building  Access to the building from the street was very easy  There are lots of small convenience stores and small eateries within quick walking distance  which again makes the location ideal  Here were my only concerns    My shower did not have water that was very hot  just warm  This was not a one time deal  since this occurred each morning and once in the evening  when I tested the temperature     The window of my room  which faced the street  did not close all the way  Therefore  the noise outside  of which there seemed to be quite a bit  was loud and awakened me on several occasions  I did not understand the abundance of noise  and it just wasn t Saturday night  There are lots of hotels in Sussex Gardens  so I think hotel stayers enjoy carousing at night  If I stayed here again  I would request a room that does not face the street  Other than that  I recommend this hotel  
P =>  Great time at the Ashley    Booked this hotel as a present for a friends birthday     We couldn t understand the receptionist on the phone when we asked for directions so got a taxi from Paddington tube station guessing that it was close  taxi man went on a little round about trip that cost   pound when the tube station is about a   minute walk from the hotel   Not the hotels fault but not impressed       Reception area    where   Small desk in a small corridor     Given keys to our room  when we went in the sheets were on the foor     we put our bags down and sat down for a minute to have a housekeeper come in and give out to us and tell us to come back later      So we went exploring the hotel  Our room was up at least   flights of stairs  Then the breakfast room was down in the basement     At this stage me and my friends      year old girls  were very creeped out by this hotel  felt like the only people in the hotel so we proceeded downstairs to the    quot tea room quot  ie a kettle where u make ur own tea and put money in a jar   A chair is covered in teddybears and I popped my head in through some beads hanging down from a door where a selection of knifes where sat on a counter    We didn t mind treking up and down the stairs but when I forgot something and had to go back up it gets a bit annoying     Bathroom is TINY    I have worked in ahotel with small bathrooms but this is a cubby hole  Also the sink is in the bedroom  shows how small the bathroom was    Beds where tiny  I ended up on top bunk where I was so close to the ceiling I was afraid to sit up      Also if you want a bath  baths are located in random rooms along the floors  Don t think I would like wandering back up to my room in a towel   Very strange     Other than that we had an amazing time in London  met the nicest man doing the BigBus tour just outside the hotel  Gas man from Cork    Don t expect nightlife in Paddington  we decided one night just to go to a pub back in Paddington and they wer all closed  at midnight on a Saturday night  so we stayed in the hotel with a few bottles of wine  D I wouldn t reccommend this hotel for the old unless they request a room on the first floor  Only the fit and healthy should stay here and if your planning on getting drunk those stairs are impossible to climb     
P =>  great place to stay The good   great central london location    min walk from Paddington station  Great breakfast  good service  comfortable room  quiet inner city streetThe bad   bathroom was fairly small  even allowing for the fact I know how tiny some B amp B rooms and bathrooms can be in London   this bathroom was tiny Generally you dont come to London to stay in your room all day  With that in mind the small room is not such a hassle and in fact is what most tourists will find unless you want to pay mega bucks at a big name hotel for the luxury of walking through a grand lobby before your get to your tiny room  The service was excellent and the staff very keen to please  The location is great especially if you come into London on the Heathrow express or want to get on the Euro star at Waterloo  paddington is on the same line  
P =>   Ashley Hotel is a charming and cheap place to stay My wife     year old daughter and I stayed here for two nights in e       We loved this charming little hotel  It was inexpensive  in an excellent location  and provided a filling breakfast in the basement dining room  tea  toast  eggs  English bacon  cereal   Our room was small but clean and had its own bathroom with a shower  The room was everything we wanted and needed at a very affordable price The staff was courteous and helpful  The hotel is a very short and easy walk from Paddington Station  and the Heathrow Express   The hotel is located on Norfolk Square in Hyde Park  The surrounding neighborhood is vibrant  with small restaurants and green grocers  The night we arrived  we had a nice dinner in an Indian restuarant just a few steps from the hotel The next morning we walked from the hotel to Hyde Park and the Natural History Museum in about    minutes  Bustling Edgeware Road  with its excellent selection of Lebanese restaurants  is just a few blocks away  You can take a bus on Edgeware Road to the sightseeing districts of London along the Thames Overall  our stay in this hotel was positive in all respects  I highly recommend it to the budget traveller  Reviewers who gave low ratings to his hotel were  in my opinion  being quite naive  If you paid a low price for a small hotel in a charming neighborhood you shouldn t have expected it to be the Waldorf Astoria  Admittedly  the room we stayed in at the Aashley Hotel was small  But it was clean  safe  quiet  and cheap  
P =>   This hotel is like an old friend I first stayed in this hotel in      and enjoyed it greatly  Years later  after staying in a lot of London hotels that cost a lot more  I decided to look it up again  I found it was still operated by the same family and had improved considerably  Most of the rooms had been refurbished  Since the late    s I have tried to make it my place to stay when in London  The rooms are clean  the staff is friendly and professional  the location is great  
P =>  Comfortable home from home I last stayed at the Ashley in ust        On my first morning  I found that my travel alarm wasn t working  so for the remainder of the visit  I especially appreciated the automated wake up call system  I recall noticing on a visit several years ago that they had installed it  but I had never really needed it before  All I had to do was let the receptionist know sometime between      AM and       PM what time I needed a call  and he or she programmed the system  It worked perfectly reliably every day The staff and management are friendly and helpful  The Managing Director is in the breakfast room each morning to offer touring advice to guests who ask  or to ask guests what they re planning for that day  If the plans are for something that he isn t familiar with  the next day he ll ask how it was so he ll know whether or not to recommend it to others On the rare occasions when I ve discovered a problem in my room  it has been taken care of promptly  thoroughly and with a smile  For example  on one of my recent stays  can t remember if it was in ust or earlier last year   I discovered upon arrival that I couldn t open the window  I phoned the desk and a few minutes later the handyman appeared at the door  He had the window open and easily operable in no time flat I ve stayed at the Ashley for a week or longer each year since       and will return twice this year  It has become my  quot home from home quot  in London  Wouldn t even consider staying anywhere else  
P =>  A Great Hotel with a Few Flaws I stayed at this hotel from ober    to the     The staff was very friendly and helpful  They assisted in recommending some restaurants and tourist spots  The entire hotel and my room was very clean  Their are no elevators therefore you should request a room on the first floor if you have plenty of luggage  The beds and pillows were firm and soft  The staff will fulfill your requests for extra sheets  towels  and pillows when needed  My room was facing the street where I heard plenty of noise throughout the night  Be aware that their is no receptionist between    PM and   AM  Therefore if you need an early wake up call you must bring your own battery operated alarm clock since the room I stayed in had no alarm clock and no electrical outlet  The location of this hotel was excellent  Paddington station is only   blocks to the left of the hotel  From there you can catch a    minute express train to the Heathrow airport  The area is also filled with restaurants  internet cafes  shops  and grocery strores for any late nite bites  The breakfast is was small but filling  It included one fried egg  bacon and sausage along with unlimited toast  juice  cereals  and coffee  I did nt like that they served breakfast until   AM  being that you must be up early in order to have the free breakfast  Most hotels I stayed at served breakfast until    AM  Some suggestions  When travelling in London  avoid the cabs as they are extremelly expensive  Take the train from the Paddington station  Their are bus stops around the corner from the hotel as well  Also check out the brochures in the lower level of the hotel where you can find discounts on sightseeing tours  
P =>  An excellent value for money in London  The Ashley Hotel is a charming little hotel on a quiet square that is very conveniently located one block away from Paddington Station  giving guests easy access to Heathrow airport in    minutes  as well as access to the Underground and multiple bus lines  I stayed at this hotel from      tember  I had booked a single room and upon my arrival  they put me in a larger double room as I had a large amount of luggage and they said the single room would be too small for me and my bags  They put me in a double room for the same price as I had reserved for the single room  This impressed me right from the start  The room was on the small side for a double  but more than adequate for one person  It was nicely furnished and had all the amenities a budget traveler could possibly need  TV  electric kettle with plenty of coffee and tea supplies  a small but perfectly functional bathroom with shower ensuite  and a small desk  If you need a hair dryer or an iron and ironing board they will loan them to you for the remainder of your stay  The mattress was soft and comfortable  They have a large delicious breakfast included in the price which includes plenty of juice and cereal  coffee and tea  sausage  bacon  eggs  and toast  At all times  the staff was extremely helpful and friendly  Closeby there are many restaurants  pubs  convenience stores  currency exchange   and a laundrette  and Paddington Station has many shops and supermarkets  I give this hotel   out of   because the hotel does not have an elevator and the stairs are narrow and steep  as in most buildings from this era  Still  they give discounts for rooms on the top floors if you are willing to get some exercise  Also  the water in the showers only got adequately hot in the mornings  the rest of the day if you wanted to take a shower the water only got lukewarm but still adequate for bathing  and the water temp did tend to fluctuate at times while showering  Overall however  the Ashley hotel is an excellent budget hotel and a great bargain for central London  
P =>  A very cozy and warm b b   Before our trip to the UK  I spent two weeks looking for a perfect and affordable accomodation in London for our   night stay in ust and I found the beautiful Ashley Hotel  Everyone there was exceptionally friendly and helpful  Our room was warm and inviting  The location was fantastic for those who travel from outside the UK  Many shops and eating establishments are within a few steps  The free English breakfast was more than enough and was delicious  The beautiful Norfolk Square is right outside the door  The hotel was quiet although my traveling companion could hear some train noises but I could not  If I ever get a chance to travel to London again  I would most postively stay at the Ashley Hotel  One thing I thought was funny was I never once saw another visitor in the halls but I did see them at breakfast  
P =>  Great for families Our family thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Ashley Hotel  We arrived at Paddington Station directly from Heathrow and walked the   blocks to the hotel  The hotel is located right on a small park where we often spent time reading to escape the heat   Our room on the top floor was complete with a double bed and  quot Murphy Bunk Beds quot   Albeit small  the room  complete with ensuite shower and toilet  was clean and very adequate  Our room overlooked the park below  Breakfast was abundant with choices of juice  cereal  and hot English breakfast of ham  sausage  eggs  and toast  all of which were quite good   The staff was helpful at all times offering restaurant suggestions and directions  Everyone was very friendly   We will definitely return to the Ashley Hotel and recommend it to friends and family as well  
P =>  Very warm welcome After reading some of the reviews  I was not sure what to expect  We booked a double room  alpine room  which was situated on the top floor  I think we may have had a bigger room than normal  as we had a room with a double and single bed  Everything was there that was needed  including plenty of hot water  clean towels and it was generally clean and tidy The staff where very friendly  helpful and polite  and made us feel very welcome  The inclusive breakfast was also very good  egg  bacon  and sausages  Plus a selection of cereals  fruit juice  toast plus coffee or tea  All served up quickly The location is literally just few minutes walk from Paddington main rail station  and even closer to the tube  Several restaurants and shops nearby plus takeaways  and a cashpoint  The bus tour of the city picks up within a minutes walk from the hotel  To sum up  its an excellent budget hotel  close to the main transport links  but in a quiet location  I wouldn t hesitate to stay here again  
P =>  Nice clean and comfortable place great breakfast Very close to tube  quiet location with pubs  restaurant and also internet caf  just around the corner  nice and quiet victorian palace with a pleasant decor  very kind and warm staff  relaxing view on the square with a garden  we staied in the double ensuite room n     st floor and it was very clean  comfortable and large  no problems with our luggage  also had a little cupboard and a lot of drawers  bathroom with tiles was clean and not smelly such as most of others hotels have  shower also clean and large enough  Definitely above the average of London Hotels  don t compare with American style  but it s excellent to relax and to have a really tasty cooked english breakfast I really recommend it  
P =>  So disappointing Our stay at the Ashley Hotel was sooo disappointing  I booked the room for myself and two friends visiting from the States based on some good reviews I read here and other places  Were we in the same hotel   I now know the dull and depressing review is the correct one  The room was way too small  I know to expect small rooms in London at this price  but this was ridiculous  The entire room was so shabby and the shower barely worked  We had to carry our lugguage up four huge flights of stairs with no help  When we immediately discovered no toilet paper  we were told one of us would have to come back down  and back up again  to fetch it  This hotel took away from our trip and was a huge let down  Try the Barry House Hotel down the road for a low cost B amp B that is really family run and close to Paddington Station  
P =>  Ick    ICK   My first  single  room faced the front of the hotel  The window leaked lots of cold air and lots of street noise all night  The bed was very short and very worn out The  quot closet quot  was a place for a couple of hangers under the TV shelf  hidden by a raglike drape The bathroom was typical of many retrofitted London rooms and was the fiberglass  quot capsule bathroom quot   But the worst problem was that the room s plumbing had a powerful leak of SEWAGE STENCH   I actually stayed in this room since it was a late checkin and I had no choice I switched rooms for the second night and requested an upper room on the back side  for quietness   I got this request granted  But the new room had a broken shower head  cracked blistered falling plaster  and a deafening TV from the next room Both rooms had no place for my    inch rollaboard bag so I had to unpack pack with it on the floor in front of the nasty bed This room required a    stair jaunt to or from the breakfast room in the basement The breakfast was the worst English Breakfast that I was ever served  The sausage tasted like cardboard When I asked to store my bag for a pickup after checkout  I was told to leave it in the basement breakfast room  Fortunately  when I returned for it later  I found it ungaurded along with others still in the breakfast room I since switched to the Sidney Hotel near Victoria Station Pimlico where I have returned to   times  
P =>  Really liked this place Stayed here in late y       Walked out of the St  David s across the Square and found this place  This place is very clean  mostly bright and friendly  There s a good breakfast served every morning and the staff is accomodating and friendly  The hotel was full all nights I was there  They also let you keep your room keys and it felt very safe to me  compared to others  There is no AC  so be sure to get your request for a fan in early  Convenient to Paddington and shops in the area  Can t understand other reviews that call this little hotel dirty    I d stay there again  
P =>  clean friendly and welcoming I read some of the reviews on here before i stayed at the ashley hotel and i was so worried about doing there cos there was some really nasty ones But when i arrived all of those worries went right out of the window The hotel is a gorgeous tall old victorian townhouse  its clean outside and very welcoming  It is in a great location  about a     min walk to the nearest tube station  train station and bus routes to all of the sites  there are lots of local shops and places to eat  and if u like walking the walk to oxford street is pleasent and takes about    mins in the reception u are greated by a very friendly person  there always seems to be someone around     there are   old houses joint together and the receptionist will direct you to your room etc and tell you what building you are in we had a twin room on the fourth floor   not reccomended for the disabled  old or unfit  the walk up the   flights of stairs is hard and steep  but being right up the top is very quiet and the rooms are much cheaper up there  there are also rooms on the lower floors and more expensive the room is an average size  the beds were comfortable with clean sheets  you are provided with a radio  tv  dressing table  mirror  tea and coffee making facilities and a large wardrobewe had a en suite  which addmidetly is VERY small  and is the only bad thing about this hotel  but it had a great shower  it was clean and had everything we needed in the morning you go down to breakfast where are u greeted by the hotel owner and waitresses who are VERY efficent and friendly  you can help yourself to as much cereal and juice as you can fit in  you are provided with tea  coffee  and toast  and get the option of a cooked breakfast which consists of sausage  bacon and fried egg  but they will scramble it if u ask   please try not to listen to the bad reviews on here  some people are just hard to please  this hotel is in a perfect loaction to see london and is a home from home hotel i will definately be returning    
P =>  Wonderful stay I have stayed at the Ashley Hotel many times since the early     s  It is a clean and cozy b amp b  Very nice and friendly staff  Great location  Would certainly stay there again  
P =>  Dull dirty and depressing accommodation Yuk  This hotel is typical of many of the B amp B joints around Paddington station   dull  dirty and depressing  The rooms of small and the  furnishings  resemble cast offs from a charity shop  Whereas the carpets would be rejected by Oxfam  And the breakfast   the service is woeful and the  food  is inedible  I wonder what overseas visitors to the Ashley must think of Great Britain  Shame on this hotel and all of the other over priced and simply sub standard establishments in the Paddington Sussex Gardens area  They must be nominees for the worst value for money in the world and are a scab on the name of London  Please pass ther Prozac  
P =>  Got what ya paid for Another Portland reviewer  This hotel was OK  it was cheap and location was good  The room was very small and the bathroom was doll house size  The breakfast is Ok and you can get the greasy fried eggs scrambled if you ask  Much better  The staff was very pleasant  You get what you pay for  We didn t pay much and got what we expected  There are at least   dozen other small hotels on this street  which is a great location  I d check out the establishments but they all looked modest  
P => Avoid this one A rather seedy hotel  I m not sure the sheets were clean  the bed was all springs  The shower had mold and mildew  the shower curtain had a layer of grunge along the bottom and a filthy toilet brush was stored in a corner of the teeny  tiny bathroom  The staff were pleasant enough  but you can do better in this location  Paddington  and this price range

P =>   Clean and well located apartments in Paddington The Aspen Suites provide me with a lot of what I need on a business trip  a great location for public transport within London or trains to other cities  an apartment with cooking facilities and a washer dryer  a free internet connection  though remember to bring a connector cable from your laptop to the wall socket   and a very high standard of cleanliness  Granted  some of the furniture is getting a bit tired  and the breakfast is monotonous  though plentiful   but this is Central London and you can do a lot  lot worse  In my experience  the staff are friendly when treated with respect and courtesy  Most important of all for me is the high standard of room cleaning  
P =>   Clean accomodation good price great location I stayed there this week for   nights  with my wife and   kids          We had a two bedroom apartment  It was very clean  small  tidy  but sufficient sized bedrooms  and a good sized sofa bed in addition   The living room was nice  The home from home convenience provided by apartment as opposed to hotel room living  was great  The TV  DVD was handy to have especially when you have young kids  reception has a list of DVD s you can rent for free  and overall the apartment was great  and in comparison to trying to get a family room or two rooms in a hotel it was much better and good value  too The breakfast was fine   your get basically orange juice  cornflakes  ham  amp  cheese toast and tea  what more than you can expect at these prices  and it does fill you up for the day ahead  The reception staff I found friendly and nice  Of course with all the places in Sussex Gardens you are getting first and foremost a handy location in terms of closeness to the city tourist sites  The noise from the traffic was constant and little shielded by the single glazed windows  but not too loud and certainly not enough to stop   very tired tourists sleeping soundly through it every night  I would really recommend this place to any one with young kids in the   to    age bracket  One small gripe the internal doors in the apartment were very heavy  and needed a good push to open  and swung shut automatically so would not recommend to younger kids as they literally would struggle to be able to open the doors and would definitely get the fingers stuck at some point   We never really used the clean kitchen apart from light snacks as you are surrounded by restaurants nearby  The place was cleaned every day and was spotless overall  We would definitely recommend and would come back  With a place like this you have an idea what you are booking in the first place   not the Savoy or the Ritz   and those expectations were well surpassed   we had a great time  
P =>   Great Location very clean  Stayed at the Aspen as a family of five in a two bedroomed apartment  Yes I agree it was small  but if you want   star rooms  pay for them Shower was powerful  bathroom was rather small but adequate  Kitchen very clean  fridge  washer dryer  Microwave plus all utensils  more than adequate  Breakfast was complementary  cereal  toast  meat  amp  cheese  you could pay    for full English  Vey basic breakfast   but it is free Less than   minutes walk to Paddington Underground  some nice Restaurants  Chinese  Indian  Italian plus the usual Steak Houses  all within    minutes walk around Paddington  One problem  it is very noisy  the traffic outside is constant  amp  the windows not all double glazed  if you are a light sleeper it will be a problem  We found reception more than helpful  amp  very nice with the children  Yes it is     for the remote  but you do get it back Black Cabs run constantly along the road outside the Aspen  very easy  amp  quick to flag one down The Aspen can be difficult to locate   the Hotel is actually listed as Abbeywood so it would be best to let your cab driver know that   we found it very easily Overall  a great stay  reasonably priced  amp  a great location   would we stay again   Most definately  
P =>   Wouldn t recommend I stay in London quite frequently and have perhaps become a bit fussy as to what I expect  but found this hotel fell short on several matters Heating was not working  I queried this with three different staff and got three different responses    quot It doesn t come on till later quot   quot It s in a short    hour  shut down phase quot   quot We ll send up maintenace but that won t be till tomorrow quot   Eventually  at gone  pm  a free standing heater was obtained  amp  brought to the room There were no curtains at the windows  just a VERY flimsy slatted blind that blocked out almost no light  in the bedroom only   I have been unwell recently and often need a day time snooze   I d have liked to have done so in the dark The shower IS pathetic and fixed head only   When will hotels learn these make it almost impossible for us ladies to keep our hair dry   TV reception was bad and the channels very limited  No radio either  There s even a     deposit for the remote   the only other place I ve ever been asked for this was in a budget     quid a night  Etap hotel The kitchen is basic but workable  however it lacks those extra welcoming touches  No cleaning stuff  non existent instructions for washer and cooker and most importantly   NO TEAPOT  When I requested one  I was told no one had access to the kitchen until the following morning at     am  Not surprised those who sampled the breakfast were disappointed     since they start serving at     am they can hardly put much care into its preparation The website doesn t inform you  amp  nor do the staff that it s      am check out  threats of an additional whole days charge should this be contravened   This info is only on the room card and on a notice in the room  along with a list of other  quot dos  amp  don ts quot    very boarding house Comments about the staff were pretty accurate   a couple of requests were either ignored forgotten  or done too late  By the time my extra loo roll arrived  I d gone out  amp  bought some myself    The above are perhaps  minor  quibbles  but taken as a whole it means I certainly won t be staying here ever again 
P =>   Modern small cheap and noisy  I m currently staying at the Hyde Park Suites in Bayswater  London  W  I booked a room on their website after lots of email communication with some of their staff regarding the suitability of the room for my purposes  business   After being reassured that the room would be big enough for two business people to work in  I booked a triple suite  Unfortunately I was informed that this was no longer available  but they provided me with a two person flat at a discount  which I was happy with When I arrived at the main reception desk  I was informed that I had to give them a copy of my passport  why    and had to pay     upfront for a key deposit  I was only given ONE key between myself and my partner  and when I asked if another was available  I was told that there wasn t  I also found out that the wireless internet was payable PER COMPUTER as they use a log on system which is computer specific We were placed in a room down the road at their new accommodation on the fourth floor  with a broken lift  which wasn t great when we had two huge suitcases with us The room itself was nicely decorated  Ikea   all clean  but very small  although I was expecting this   It had a small modern bathroom  a small kitchen lounge and a bedroom The bathroom was very clean and looked great  however the shower was rather puny   it was like standing under a tap The room had cable TV and a flat screen TV  but didn t actually have any English channels except BBC World  I rang up the desk and requested that we had some English ones  to which I was told that it would be sorted the next day  which it was The kitchen was good  and there were enough utensils to cook decent food I have stayed   nights and have had my towels changed  but nobody has been to change my bin  which I had to put outside the room in the hallway because it was smelling   or clean the rooms  It s a good thing I bought some loo roll with me  Lol Another irritation was that being on the fourth floor  and only having one key  it would have been useful to have had a buzzer system which worked  It obviously hasn t been wired in properly These were all pretty minor concerns though  The one thing which did bother me though was the noise  be because I am not used to staying in London it bothered me more than it might bother others  but when laying in bed  it sounded like the windows were wide open and there was a lot of street noise  The first night I didn t sleep until  am  The people above me were also very noisy at night  and you can hear people moving around all the time All in all  it is good value for money if you are happy to make a few minor concessions  The location is great and it is literally   minutes from the tube  
P =>   Really nice place We stayed here for    nights in y       For a family of   this proved to be an excellent choice of accomodation  Two separate bedrooms  living room  fully equipped kitchen and   piece bathroom  Very comfortable  The hotel itself is probably      years old but the interior has been totally rebuilt and modernized  The desk staff were quite helpful and exceptionally polite  There is a dining room downstairs serving breakfast but we preferred to make use of our kitchen for light meals and snacking  Paddington Railway Station   with its Underground Station   is a mere   minute walk away  There is grocery store at the station as well which we found quite useful  A good range of restaurants  pubs and shops are all located nearby  A very safe neighbourhood    we were out quite late many nights and never felt or encountered any threat to personal safety  The only real negative is that Sussex Gardens is a much busier and noisier thoroughfare than anticipated   traffic was pretty intense   even until quite late at night  The Brits make fairly liberal use of the car horn which can be annoying  On the whole though I d gladly stay here again  
P =>   Good value and service  Stayed here with family members for a few nights when the accommodation we had booked on line turned out to be dismal  We walked a little further down the road and found these self catering flats  Although they were fully booked  they had one flat that had not yet been renovated and allowed us to take a look to see if it was suitable  We jumped at the opportunity and gladly accepted  We heard the newly refurbished rooms were great  but there was nothing wrong with our older room  It had a small kitchen area  which was most convenient  tiny bathroom  sleeper couch for me  and   single beds upstairs in the small attic area  Perfectly adequate  especially for such late notice  The area is safe and most convenient for the subway  Plenty of restaurants and a grocery shop or two to keep expenses down  Service was excellent in general  A bargain at    Pounds a night for the room  
P => 
P =>   Aston s Apartments are good value in an expensive city  Aston s is very well located in a quiet street in Sth Kensington with a short walk to to the Glocester Rd Tube station  We took the Executive Apartment which is bigger than the standard one and has a good bathroom  Well worth the extra cost  Self catering with good supermarkets close by makes an easy alternaive to eating out all the time if staying for more than a couple of days  
P =>   Great Place To Stay In London These apartments are in a great location with Gloucester Road tube station a few minutes walk away  Very clean rooms and friendly staff  Apartments are fully equiped with everything you need  Would definitely stay there again  
P =>   Great location close to museums shopping and on Piccadilly Line  I ve stayed at Astons on a number of occasions now  I keep coming back because of its central location  It is close to museums  shopping   restaurants  etc and it s on the Piccadilly line near Gloucester St station I also find it is clean and staff are friendly and helpful  You have to pay for WiFi but the connection is great which is useful if you are in London for work  The kitchenettes also mean you can cook and eat in  It would be great if the rooms bathrooms were a little larger with space set aside for suitcases in the rooms but these criticisms are minor  
P =>  Drab and dreary   but the place has its redeeming features too When we arrived at Astons  ragged with jetlag and exhaustion  I couldn t believe my eyes  Our  quot triple apartment quot  was a single room  Drab walls  Drab carpet  Hideous curtains  Three narrow beds with white linens  An all in one bathroom with a weird shower arrangement  The strangest  quot kitchen in a cabinet quot  I d ever seen  No proper mirror  only half a closet  no alarm clock  a small television perched precariously on a stand  an inaccessible table crammed in the corner  our extended family spread between locked buildings with no way to enter the other buildings     I honestly thought there was no way I could stay in this hotel for a week  But we went to bed  resolved to figure something out when we were less tired  And with a little more rest to clear my head  it seemed workable  Over the week  we came to love the location  close to a tube stop and essential businesses   The place is clean  and in a nice residential area  We didn t spend that much time in the room anyway  Be advised that some of the rooms are a long walk up numerous flights  and those facing the streets can be noisy  If you have multiple rooms  you may not end up in the same building and will have to call to let each other in the front door  But the price is reasonable and the location really is great  Lower your expectations and you ll be just fine  With that caveat  and for a budget traveller  I would recommend Aston s  
P =>  Great location helpful staff clean private rooms  I stayed at Aston while on a recent trip to London  on a recommendation from a friend  The location is great  the room was clean and private  and it was very quiet  which usually can be the most challenging aspect of staying at a hotel b amp b  The rooms are located in apartment buildings so it feels homier than just being crammed into a big building full of rooms  I would recommend a double as I heard that the singles are TINY  There is no breakfast included  and I wish they had their Internet available at all times instead of just in the evening   but otherwise it s a great place to stay at reasonable rates for London  
P =>   Tiny  I checked in with my husband and young son  We were shown to our  triplet  room by a very helpful attendant  but were soon dismayed with the size  Tiny and I mean tiny   say around   m  Anyway  I had arranged a travel cot  which I quickly returned because it was full of dust and looked like it had been sitting in a garage for years  At least they tried The double bed is two singles pushed together and the mattress was so small  that we couldn t put the baby on because he d slip  So we moved a mattress from the spare bed onto the floor  then the dining table onto the spare bed in order to create some room  We all ended up sleeping on the floor The other thing is that the bathroom is also tiny   like  m   We may have gotten used to all of that  except that the cleaning was not up to standard  When we moved in mu sinuses immediately went crazy and I ended up spending some time dusting the room because there was so much dust everywhere and I had to complain on one occasion for the room to be cleaned because they had done such a sloppy job I wouldn t necessarily recommend this place  
P =>   A home away from home I thought the office staff were kind and considerate  Very helpful with directions restaurants  or anything that you needed  I ended up staying an entire week there b c I felt very comfortable and the prices were decent for great location  I felt safe at night in the neighborhood and the place gives you a feel of walking into your own apartment  I wanted to experience of what it would be like to live in London and felt that my time at Astons was perfect for me  There are not many frills to the place but the little kitchenette allowed me to keep some food and water to lessen the cost of eating out  I stayed near the front door initially and the constant slamming of the door was annoying to me  However  I moved to a room on the  rd floor and the door was no longer an issue  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting a less touristy type of experience in London  
P =>   I love this place I ve stayed before and I will definitely stay again  This place is clean  friendly  comfortable  great location  and an all around great bargain I really like the idea of a room with a kitchen so that I can use it for breakfasts and a few dinners  I also like having the ice in the room which is not something you see much in the UK in a place that is not on the level of the Ritz  The location is very central and the Astons is five minutes from a tube station and Glouster Road is a straight shot to Heathrow  
P =>   In the heart of London it s a great place small rooms but well equipped It s a residence  not really an hotel but in a perfect position  very calm and well equipped  The price is good  
P =>   Do not stay here I am fairly low key traveller   i need the basics  cleanliness  a proper bathroom  room to breathe and functioning equipment  basics really  I booked tow weeks here thinking it would be convenient location to Gloucester tube  which it is  and provide me with a bit of savings for the two weeks  I walked in  took a look at the room  the toilet seat that was hanging on hinges  the huge cracks in the walls and chips of pain  the tiny TV and the overall smell and literally walked right out  I lost my deposit of course  but i would rather pay NOT to stay here  I could not have been more depressed  Really   
P =>  absolutly worth the money   great location Before booking this trip I watched hudreds of reviews  because I needed a central location but I was scared to finish into a rat shoe box in central London  Me and my boy were looking for a job for him  so we would have been around all day and we needed a cheap but clean place with a wam shower and a bed  Reading the previous review I automatically booked an  quot executive quot  room in advance  and the price wasn t very different  Don t expect anything executive as you maybe mean  but in overall my vacation went very good and the Astons made it easier We arrived very late  we found the place easily  get down in Gloucester road metro stop  walk with the starbuks on your left hand and turn on your right when you see a gate around a garden  the second on your left is Rosary Garden  in total     mins walk  but the door was closed  we rang and there was out envelope with the keys ready  apartment number    was next door  and to be honest when I entered I had a bit of let down    very far from the pics I saw  so different that I thought that they made a mistake giving me the famous small rooms with smaller shower  I thought to find a room plus a kitchenette plus a bathroom  but    the room is not an apartment  is a room with a bathroom  that s it  spacious  very clean  with a large table  hairdrier and iron  the problem is that in the website the kitchenette looks to be in a different room  that is not true  the  quot kitchen quot  is INSIDE a place that maybe once was a wardrobe     doing the kitchenette into this place  there s almost no wardrobe    being this kitchenette   meter far from your bed and being almost no ventilation inside  every smell will remain with you all the time  once we  quot half burned quot  a toast and the fire alarm rang almost immediatly We were too tired to call in order to know whether there was a bigger room or whether we were in the right one for what we paid  so we went the day after to reception  Ross told us that our WAS the executive apartment  I don t know how regular ones are  but I m happy I was there    But honestly  after this first doubts and in spite of little picky things   shower not perfectly cleaned  bed done sometimes roughly   I have to say that Astons were the best solution I found  and the reason for which I give  stars are    the location is excellent for metro  buses and you can easily walk in town  getting to Harrods in       minutes walk  for London distances is nothing   if you feel lazy you can also remain in Gloucester area as you ll find fast foods  tesco  internet cafes  KFC and coffee place  hairdressers and a small mall  this saves you lots of money and time in movements   staff is extremely helpful and professional  both man and woman we met  internet is free from  pm to  pm  more or less   we forgot to print a resume and there was no problem  reception opens daytime and they help you out in all ways they can  showing you other rooms if you need and giving recomendations for where to eat and visit  They also explained us that underneath the bed there were some drawers to help up capacity of that small wardrobe   if you do not plan to do a serious spaghetti with ragu alla bolognese  the kitchen is honestly a good idea in a city expensive like London  you can buy at Tesco the necessary for your breakfasts and save a lot a lot and a lot of money  the kitchenette has a microwave  a fridge  a toaster  a coffee maker  cups  etc etc   after all I heard about London central hotels with less than   stars  I m happy I was thereBasically a good experience and I d be back  
P =>  Great Value  The Aston s Apartments are made up of   townhouses  My    year old son and I were put into      Room     Room    looks exactly like the picture on their website of the twin bed regular unit  We were thrilled to get the balcony we wanted and even though we were in London in ruary we did use it  The   quot kitchen unit quot  is wonderful  It consists of all the plates  pans  cutlery  corkscrew  tea pot  mugs etc that a person would need  We did not use the burners  but we did use the microwave  kettle and fridge  I discovered that if I didn t have time to do my breakfast dishes before heading out for the day the cleaning staff took care of that for me  I didn t expect that  We saved money on meals by purchasing our food at the nearby Tesco  everything you need is there including alcohol  and at the Borough market  a great outdoor market    be warned  it is extremely busy and lineups can be frustrating   Our beds were extremely comfortable and came with lovely duvets and clean sheets  Good pillows  too  There are drawers under each bed that we only realized were there after a few days   good for storage  We also had a nice dining area  TV and phone  We never had any problem with noise from other guests or outside noise  Downside  The bathroom is really small  I mean the toilet is practically in the shower and the only thing separating the toilet from shower is a shower curtain which actually touches the toilet  It did get a little musty smelling in there toward the end of the week  If you really must have a luxury bathroom don t go for this unit  I think the executive units are more posh  I have to say that the bathroom size didn t bother me a bit  I d definitely stay there again  We loved the quiet well to do neighbourhood and we were just a few minutes walk from the Gloucester Rd tube station and a couple of blocks from the internet cafe  really nice people there  that we used every night  We felt extremely safe and left our balcony doors open each night for fresh air  The staff were pleasant  but we had little dealings with them other than check in and check out  We did have trouble with our shower at first  our own fault  we couldn t figure out how to get hot water at first  and they offered to move us immediately  We liked our room so much though  that instead we took a key for another room that we were told we could use for our showers  The only thing that disappointed me was that we asked for a cab to be called for us when we left and one came immediatley  but it wasn t a real London cab  It was a Mercedez Benz and it cost us    pounds to go to Paddington Station  We were ripped off  I wish they had called us a real cab  We were in walking distance of The Natural History Museum  Victoria and Albert Museum and Harrod s  Harrod s was about a    minute walk   We like to walk and so didn t find it too far to walk to Hyde Park  Royal Albert Hall  Harvey Nichols although those are of a greater distance  There is a movie theatre about a         minute walk  We used the underground everyday and felt comfortable going all over the city  
P =>  I think I know why the reviews are mixed    I think I know why the reviews are so mixed   I stayed in Aston Apartments on an overnight business trip to London  I booked a single  but at the last minute my boyfriend tagged along  We figured  what the heck  we ll squish up in a single Well  when I walked in the room I almost cried  In fact  I think I did  The bed looked like it had been rescued from a charity shop  all the fittings and fixtures were raggedy and worn out  and the  quot bathroom quot  was a kind of all in one plastic perhaps meant to be on a boat or train wet room While I was out at my meeting  my darling boyfriend did the best thing ever  and upgraded to a double   and I think maybe even an  quot executive quot  or something  What a difference  A beautiful  big room  lovely bed  clean  new  big bathroom  and so on The reason I m giving them a low score is because I originally booked in the single room which they expected me to be happy to climb about    flights of stairs to get to  and which was  frankly  crap  
P =>  Excellent value The rooms are very clean and well tended by staff  All rooms have kitchenettes  which are particularly useful to the traveler  The higher priced designer rooms are quite beautiful  the more inexpensive rooms are plain and simple  but comfortable and very functional  The management was very responsive and prompt when asked to address problems  Very good value is given for the price charged  
P =>   High priced shoe box The location was fine  and I suppose it is an expensive area  However  the triple studio was very small  with en ensuite about the same size as in a caravan All together  not a comfortable stay for   people  
P =>   Astons Apartments beautifully located efficient and quiet My mother      and I spent a week in London to visit my son who is working there and travelling  everywhere    I chose the Astons Apartments based on location and kitchenette facilities  Both are important when travelling with my mother since she needs time to get ready in the morning and it also saves us time and money  The kitchenette was fully equipped with a microwave  stove elements  kettle  toaster  dishes and cutlery plus sink to clean up  A nice sized table and   chairs provided eat in space  We asked for    which as twin beds and a balcony   we enjoyed sunny and warm weather when we stayed so the balcony was a real plus  The beds were very comfortable and housekeeping was done daily  As in many European countries  facecloths are not provided   so bring your own if you require  I bought tablet type ones     at the dollar store in Ottawa  which expanded when water was added  and they worked fine  The bathroom in    is a single pre cast plastic unit and a bit small but worked just fine for us   very efficient The staff were all very polite  friendly and helpful and checked the web for directions and made reservations for us  The office has a computer for use by guests  Behind the office is a beautiful garden for all the nearby residents  Ask the staff to unlock the garden gate for you and wander around  I took lots of photos of the flowers and enjoyed the quiet and solitude Astons Apartments     Rosary Gardens in South Kensington is well located   less than a   minute walk to the Gloucester Road underground station and has nearby grocery stores   the large Waitrose  with lots of wine as well  and the Tesco which is open later  Royal Albert Hall is within       minutes walking distance   we attended the Peace One Day Gala on t      Also  the Original Hop On Hop Off bus stops right in front of Rydges Hotel on Gloucester and their competitor the Big Bus stops near the underground station  For car lovers   there is a Ferrari dealship right at the end of the block and a Maserati parks in the area  I had to have my photo taken standing beside it   There are great restaurants near Astons which you can walk to in less than   minutes   several Indian ones and a nice pub but make a reservation especially if you are eating after   pm  We ate at Kare Kare on Old Brompton Road which had great seafood prepared Indian style  The Cafe Forum on Gloucester Rd  has good coffee and croissants and the Fish  amp  Chip place across the street has    delicious fish and chips  We also picked up prepared food   fresh and frozen at Waitrose and Australian and NZ white wine  cheaper than in Ontario    to eat in I would definitely stay at Astons Apartments again Karen MacLaurinOttawa  ON Canada 
P =>   Great We stayed in room    it was roomy the beds were great plenty of room all around  Great location also  
P =>  Loved the Manager but not Aston Apartments Hi there  we stayed    adults one child   one night at Astons recently   and I am glad it was only one night  We were booked to stay at  Base stay  just a few blocks away in a lovely little residential neigbhourhood but they couldn t accommodate us for one night  Saturday  There are no lifts at Astons   so if you have heavy cases   you may have to lift them up many flights of stairs  like we did  depending on where you stay in the complex    although we had lots of offers from the staff to help   The apartments are old and tired and in need of a new renovation in my opinion  Ours which was in the main building was     a triple  and although clean and tidy   the bathroom was sooooo musty that I couldn t even stand it long enough to take a shower in it so I washed my hair in the kitchen sink   I ll try to post pictures of the bathroom so you can see how small it is and yes the shower is only separated from the toilet by a curtain as you will see  The kitchenette is quite adequate and we made good use of it   The beds were a little worn out and I felt like I was listing to one side but my daughter was comfortable in hers apparently    We were also next to the main door so it was noisy when people were coming in late as the door would slam each time   Bring earplugs   I recommend them if you are a light sleeper  We were shown   rooms before we found one suitable   and only charged a small fee for the upgrade from a double to a triple      Astons has a quaint little courtyard that all can use but you need to contact management to get access as you can t access with your key Rick Patterson the Manager at Astons couldn t do enough for us though   he is such a gentleman    I hope someone steals him for an upscale hotel somewhere and pay him appropriately for his exellent service and people skills        Check in was fast and efficient as was checkout   Keep in mind you will have to pay a    pd  damage deposit which is not charged to your visa but an impression of it is taken of your card and the amount is filled in should there be any damage I guess     You get the copies returned to you when you leave  We also requested a hair dryer  iron and ironing board which we rec d promptly  A word of caution    watch the rooms in the front upper floors with the balcony as you may share it with another room as we saw we might have    the bloak next door on the  rd floor of another building  possible resident   was a chain smoker and we saw a pile of cigerettes on his terrace that you could fill a   litre ice cream container     no exaggeration   it was so gross   we imagined ourselves not being able to leave our windows open at night  there is no air conditioning at Astons      If you are on a tight budget  then these apartments are adequate but because of the must and carpeted areas   if you are sensitive to smells   noise  or have allergies   I don t recommend Astons  You will love this area of London though as you are a short walk to two grocery stores  Sainsbury s and Tesco  and lots of little shops and excellent restaurants  The tube is a   minute walk as well to Earl s court  I recommend this area for a stay in London  
P =>   Avoid Astons Apartments I would avoid this place  Although London apartments can be expensive this is not good value for money  The rooms are poky and its really fun carrying your luggage up   flights of stairs  The walls are paper thin so you hear all the noise from other rooms  There are many better places in a similar area in London  
P =>  Solid Service Perfect Location Very Clean i m not really sure what the people are complaining about  It seems that sometimes we Americans are a bit picky or depressive when it comes to accomodations in  old europe   the UK is not the US  I have been staying at the Astons Apartments since      or       I have never been disappointed  The studios are small  If you stay in a single in a hotel the room would be even smaller  Since I am a petite person  the set up was perfectly fine for me  There was a flat screen  space saving  television and I like that items in the kitchen are on a timer to conserve energy  and my room was clean and the room was serviced daily  it is one of the best locations in the city for getting a feel for both how a resident lives while simultaneously being within walking distance or a short tube ride where ever you would like to go my particular apartment this time around had a nice balcony  i really enjoyed my stay  but perhaps it is not for everyone  
P =>  Unbelievable Value  n Central London   The Astons Apartments Unbelievable value in central London   The Astons ApartmentsHaving spent a delightful week at the Aston s Apartments last summer I had no problem in making the choice to stay there a second time  this time for over a month in uary and ruary        The most compelling reasons for such an easy choice of place to stay in London are     the Aston s extremely considerate staff    the location and   the compact  self contained  well organized  economical accommodation     The staff  including the efficient  knowledgeable and courteous manager  the three diligent  considerate and enthusiastic duty managers and the very accommodating maid service  added to the quality of my stay in London  Any enquiry or need covering any aspect of my stay in London was appropriately addressed with speed and alacrity  and always  with a genuine warmth   The location  Aston s Apartments is comprised of a few terraced houses set in a superb central  very safe location in cosmopolitan South Kensington  nestled amidst private schools  museums  parks  restaurants and fashionable shops  After just a few minutes walk one arrives at Gloucester Road tube station with its three lines   Piccadilly  District and Central   delivering one to any point in London with speed  The West End   home to many theatres and varied attractions   is just a few stops away on the tube Also at Gloucester Road tube station there is a Waitrose grocery store  a    hour Tesco grocery store and many  many varieties of restaurants  shops and pubs nearby offering choice galore  Just a few minutes walk further along on the Cromwell Road is a large Sainsbury s grocery store  These British grocery stores carry a tremendous variety of foods  many of them specializing in foods for the discerning palette  as well as the intolerant intestine  Kensington High Street        or so minutes walk away  offers entrance to Kensington Palace Gardens  Lady Di interests   the Rooftop Gardens open to the public  call ahead   The Royal Albert Hall presenting a variety of spectacles  along with the many more very fine attractions  Hyde Park has an entrance off Kensington High Street and close by Kensington Church Street has many fine antiques  The Victoria  amp  Albert museum  along with the British History Museum  is just a short walk away  and the world renowned Harrods of Knightsbridge is about       minutes walk away  There are many buses traveling along all of these routes  as well as the underground  not to mention an abundance of highly efficient  reasonably priced taxis  Also within walking distance   about       minutes   is the famous Notting Hill antique market at Portobello Road on Saturday mornings   not to be missed  And  of course  many  many more exciting attractions  too numerous to list     the accommodation    the concealed kitchen houses a microwave  kettle  stovetop  sink  drainage area doubling as countertop  a selection of pots  cutlery  glassware and crockery  a garbage area underneath the sink  alongside an ample sized fridge underneath the countertop  and an exhaust system to carry away any cooking fumes  The doors can be closed on any mess  instantly removing it from sight and the maid service will clean it all up  The compact bathroom  in the room with an efficient exhaust system  allows for privacy in this economic situation Bearing in mind that this is a most desirable area of central London  with ease of access to all points of interest  one would be most prudent in staying at the Astons on a London visit where own shopping and cooking allows for a most unique economic central London experience  Although the office is open only from     am till     pm daily  there is always a duty manager available      One could be forgiven for questioning the existence of such unbelievable value  To get all of this for a stint away from home in central London   along with a balcony if one is on the  st floor at the front   is a great deal indeed  For all   reasons mentioned  I will hope for vacancies at the Astons on my future visits to London  and I will definitely recommend it to my family and friends  
P =>  Happy to have stayed in Rosary Gardens Just back from a stay at Astons   not the first time I ve done so   and once again very pleased with my time there  The studios  flats and common areas are kept very clean  and staff were pleasant and helpful  The studios for one are small  very small  in fact  almost disconcertingly so  But with wonderful high ceilings for lots of light and all of London on one s doorstep  the small rooms can be forgiven The washrooms are tiny  and there aren t lifts in the buildings  which some may view as a downside to a stay at Astons  I decided to take those things as part of choosing to stay  and planned accordingly  Gloucester Road station is no more than a five minute walk away  Sainsbury s is about a seven minute walk  so as a pied a terre it suited me just fine Some travellers may need to adjust their expectations  but Astons does what it is supposed to do  and for that I am very grateful  
P => Dreadful Location is great   max    min walking to Gloucester Rd   that is where the good news ends  The reservation was made by telephone rather than internet to specifically reserve a ground floor room  because we couldn t manage the stairs and there is no lift   however  upon check in were given options of upstairs or downstairs  Our reservation was ignored  No accommodation was made for our special needs upon checkin nor for any of the other four nights  Furthremore  The room reeked of curry  The tea kettle was broken  requested new one and it was not proivded  There is  in fact  no satellite TV and the first remote didn t work  requested a new one and the second one also didn t work  The towel heater doesn t work either  The clock  alarm clock buttons don t function   time is always three hours late I would not recommend staying here  There are numerous other self catering apartments within easy access of Earl s Court and Gloucester Rd for the same rate and better chances for decent accommodation  or at least that which is advertised   
P =>   Fantastic Location First of all the hotel is fantastically situated  Just     minutes walk to Gloscester road tube station  That tube station is located in zone   and has   lines passing by  Just great The hotel it self was nice  we stayed in the last floor  and we found a very clean room with a very well equipped kitchenette  Didn t like the bathroom so much  but have to admit that it did serve every of your needs So  next time i m in London i will check Aston apartments availability first  It s a great value for price  
P =>   Great Location but in need of renovation Aston Apartments are in a great location in South Kensington on a quiet residential street    minutes walk to Gloucester Road underground My husband  son and I had a  quot family quot  apartment which was on the lower  basement level   It had a large window and was very bright and an outside stairway access into the apartment It was smaller than we expected  It was damp and smelled musty  The beds and linen were clean  The kitchen area was adequate and moderately equipped  The bathroom was very small and damp These apartments could be great if they were upgraded especially the kitchen and bathroom  The photos on the website make it look grander than it is Staff were very helpful and polite Would I stay here again  be  Hotel accommodation is very expensive in London and this was adequate for a short stay  If you are looking for   star plus accommodation  this isn t it  
P =>   Lovely location  I m really much more of a pampered hotel traveller but I loved this experience  Yes it is like staying in a studio apartment complete w mini kitchen so it would be perfect for longer stays  I was there for only one night but wished it was longer  facing the courtyard Mews I felt like one of the locals for just a minute The staff was helpful and funny when she apologized for giving me an  quot upgrade quot   which meant putting me in the top floor room      steps  no elevator   Older travellers might want to ask for a lower floor The room was not very modern but everything worked and overall very comfortable  
P =>   Great location The apartments are basic but clean and comfortable and very quiet  The kitchenette was very handy and helped to save costs of always eating out  The bathroom  including toilet  was very very small  tiny  but adequate  If you need a larger bathroom you might want to consider upgrading to the next size room  The location of the apartments was the main drawcard for us  It was very close to the tube  Glouscester Road  and was on the hop on hop off bus route and also the normal bus route  The train from Heathrow Airport delivers you direct to the Glouscester Road Station then its a     minute walk to the hotel  The local shops included two supermarkets  banks  foreign exchange outlets and many pubs and cafe s  It was in easy walking distance to many museums including the Royal Albert Hall and Kensington Palace and gardens  
P =>  Cheaper than most London hotels  I often stay at the Astons  as it is  for central London  extremely cheap  The rooms are small  and basic  but it is beautifully located in the heart of South Kensington  It is completely self catering  which suits me fine  although that might not be everyone s preference  The only problem that bugs me is the complete lack of elevator  In the past  if I have had a very heavy suitcase  one of the guys at the front desk has helped me  and I tip them    that s the only way around that problem  really  Worth mentioning that the service is very friendly indeed  which often makes up for the lack of elevator and totally unreliable WiFi connections  
P =>  Pretend to be Wealthy Wouldn t it be brilliant to have a smart flat in a very exclusive London neighborhood  Kensington for example   Well  if you are anything like me you have no chance of ever affording that   but you can pretend for a few days by staying at the Astons  For about      a night you can essentially get a very small apartment on a tony London street with a Ferrari dealership at one end  Paradoxically  with the average London meal at the      mark you can actually save money by eating in using the small but functional kitchen  Our apartment was in need of a couple of handyman visits and the shower was so small enough that once you dropped the soap it was irretrievable but otherwise no complaints  
P =>   Go for the executive I chose this property after reviewing a number of listings in TripAdvisor  I would pretty much agree with what other writers have noted  I happened to stay in a  quot double quot  that was non executive and  while comfortable for    would have been cramped for    The neighbourhood is wonderful   quiet and conveniently close to a number of amenities and attractions  If you re a fan of Indian food  you must eat at Noor Jahan   just a short walk away  The staff were friendly and all  but I question the value  The sheet on the bed was torn  there was no bottle opener or corkscrew in the kitchenette and only one wine glass  one would think that you d want to share  if you re staying in a  quot double quot     I think I ll look elsewhere in my continuing pursuit of good value in Knightsbridge  
P =>  Still in Love with SW   thank you Astons  Ditto to the previous reviewer  for those of us who are on the road frequently  Astons is really a welcome change from our favorite haunts in and around the Capital  especially after arriving after an excruciating work week  amp  transatlantic flight  although AA         LAX LHR is what I consider one of the more pleasant ways to get across the pond  for a long weekend R amp R  You will not find room service or lifts  but what you will find is an exceedingly clean  quiet and comfortable property in an excellent residential setting in South Kensington  I stayed in an executive studio double  no      three flights up  with a fascinating couryard view  the fully equipped galley is actually the reason I stay at Astons  it s SO convenient to have coffee in the morning immediately on waking  without waiting for room service or leaving your room       and also to eat in at night as an option from restaurants and take away  For those not accustomed to European standards  be aware that the square footage is not extravagant  but for this part of town  Astons is a remarkable value  The shower offers adequate pressure  although the lighting in the bath area could be improved around the mirror area  the bedside lighting is also not the brightest  Staff is unfailing polite  and attractive   if you want to feel at home in one of the most exciting cities in the world  consider Astons  you won t be disappointed  
P =>   Extraordinarily convenient   but go Executive not Standard I have been staying at Astons   nights a week  on and off  since      There are many hotels in London that are more luxurious  if you want to pay twice the price  or you can pay the same price and enter the great London lottery to see just how small  noisy and depressing a hotel room can be What keeps me coming back to Astons week after week are    Independence   the kitchenettes are tiny but well equipped  and free you from the hassle of dining out every night    Convenience     minutes from Gloucester Road station and the Circle  District and Piccadilly lines     minutes walk from Victoria    Room size   I ve cooked a dinner for my visiting brother  done hours of work on my laptop  The executive rooms are very practical spaces  and most have acces to the wireless LAN The things that bug me are    Lack of aircon   but this is a general complaint with London hotels under the      mark  and many over it     Lack of a lift   it s no joke dragging everything up   flights of stairs to the topmost rooms Astons reception closes at        you can still get in by buzzing the bell but you can t then pay until the next morning  I ve always found the people in reception to be friendly and personable   again  not at all a  given  in London hotels For me  the key to a happy stay in Astons is to book an Executive room  The standard rooms are mostly poky and depressing  they are always less well decorated  
P =>   Great location Good value for money Excelent location    minutes from Gloucester Road subway station    lines   Not large room and tiny bathroom but very clean and with a very functional kitchenette Very friendly staff Good value for money paid 
P =>  quaint charming and convenient Aston s atments Having spent many hours researching comfy accomodations to fit our criteria  I settled on our weeks stay at Astons Apartments in London  England  A two minute walk from Gloucester Road tube  a charming South Kensington  SW   neighborhood with lots of amenities  the convenience was surpassed by Aston s accomodations  They have a few buildings that offer two levels of studios  the standard and the executive  We opted for the executive as they advertise on their site a larger bathroom and somewhat larger studios  It really felt like living in London and what with the dollar against the pound  we saved money on making our own breakfast and occasional dinners in the mini kitchen alcove  We shopped at the Gloucester mall right at the tube stop  for all our groceries at Waitrose  a very complete grocery store stocked with fresh produce  meats  seafood  a nice wine selection and all the baked goods  prepared foods and other items one would expect in a major high end grocery store in the states  We frequented two pubs in the neighborhood The Hereford and Stanhope Arms  both on Gloucester Road  the later of which is a bus stop for the tour bus called Big Bus  It operates   days a week from      ish to   ish and a bus stops in front of the pub every    to    minutes  Cost     pounds person but Aston s offers it for    pounds  One can hop on and off as frequently as desired as the ticket is good for the entire day  This bus gives one a good overview of London and the entire trip takes about   hours  round trip  Our favorite site was Westminster Abbey followed by The Churchill War Room and Museum  walking distance from one another  We also frequent Las Vegas and enjoy gaming so we were delighted to discover  after some online research  two casinos in the neighborhood  The Grosvenor Casino one block away  then one on Cromwell Road across from the Natural History Museum  next to Victoria and Albert Museum all in walking distance  All this information can be found through your favorite search engine including amenities  attractions  restaurants etc  near each tube staion in London  One word of warning  there is no lift at Aston s    Rosary Garden address and we were in room     charming and private but   flights up  Secondly  we had a problem with Hotel Link  the airport transportation service Aston s reccommended  We waited    minutes for them at the airport then they never showed up for our return trip although we pre paid  Aston s graciously ordered a cab and picked up the expense  The tube goes right from Heathrow to Gloucester Road and with rolling luggage  the two minute walk should not be a problem  Enjoy and cheerio  
P =>  Super location    We stayed in the Astons Apartments for a week in y       This was the week that London had the hottest temperatures on record    So if you wish to stay at the Astons Apartments   stay away from the hot summer months because the apartments do not have any A C  which is not uncommon in London  however  there was not even a fan  Aside from that  the apartment  a Deluxe Suite  was quite small  it looks bigger on the web site  but functional  The shower was good  lots of hot water  It was clean and there is daily maid service  The staff was very helpful and friendly  The best thing about the Astons is its fantastic location in a lovely residential district in South Kensington   nice and quiet  You can walk to the subway station within   minutes and there is a good grocery store right beside the subway station  Only have one negative comment  besides the heat     We could not use the hot water faucet in the kitchen sink  it sprayed sideways   we told the staff about it twice  but it never did get fixed  so we had to wash our dishes in the bathroom  Advice to Astons  it would be nice if there was a lamp on the dining table  and fix that darn faucet   The Altmann s from Canada 
P => A great value We found Astons Apartments a great value  but agree that realistic expectations are key  The room is small  but larger and better kept than several New York hotels we ve stayed at  And if you plan to use the room for much more than sleeping and dressing  you need to take a closer look at Time Out London  The bathroom is a bit of a challenge  comparable to what you d find in a tight ship s cabin  We appreciated the kitchenette  With it and several nearby supermarkets  you can compose a much better breakfast than anything you d get from a European hotel in this price range  Location is great  Gloucester Road underground stop is three blocks away and provides easy connections to Heathrow and most London attractions and theater  Plenty of restaurants  shops and the like in the area  
P =>   Realistic expectations are the key   If you approach a booking here with a few points in your mind you ll have no problems  We booked a double deluxe suite for just    pounds   this is one of the prime tourist areas of the city and a price like that represents an incredible bargain for the quality of accommodation offered  I ve paid more than twice the amount for a room less than half the size in a hotel just round the corner  What you will get for your money is essentially a moderate sized hotel room with a TV  a comfortable bed  a clean and acceptably sized but basic bathroom  ours looked just a bit tired  but you re not going to spend your life in there  and a useful kitchenette area behind foldaway doors  You won t get a whole hotel suite in the sense of numerous separate rooms   but for    pounds in central SW London that s hardly a sensible expectation  Reception was courteous and helpful   public areas clean and perfectly presentable  No noise problems  The area is quiet and safe and well supplied with pleasant bars and restaurants  transport links are excellent too  Useful extra services like airport shuttle  free internet access for two hours in the evening and a cheap laundry service are also available  There s no food at all  but numerous possibilities  including a    hr supermarket  are within three minutes  walk  A key deposit of    pounds is taken  this information was posted on the website through which we booked   If you want a room big enough for two people to watch TV in for   hours a day without getting in each other s way  then pay more money and go elsewhere  If you want a pleasant  clean and convenient base from which to do more exciting and worthwhile things before returning in the evening to sleep and maybe cook a meal  another big saving  remember  it s an absolute steal for the price  On that basis   very highly recommended  
P => Small Room Horrible Bathroom But Great Location I know European hotel rooms are often smaller than what Americans are used to  so I wasn t surprised by our cramped quarters at the Astons  However  the bathroom was so small that there wasn t even enough room to hang up towels  the ledge over the basin jutted out so far it was difficult to wash  the basin had two separate faucets for hot and cold water  which resulted in scalding if you held your hand over the hot water  and the shower  basin  and toilet were so close together that moving around was uncomfortable  The room came with utensils and a refrigerator  which were helpful given that London restaurant prices are so high we sometimes bought groceries and ate them in the room  note  a    hour grocery is nearby  Tne neighborhood is quiet and attractive  and best of all as other reviewers have said  is the proximity to the Gloucester Road underground station  only two blocks away  However  given the bathroom problems  I don t think I would stay here again  
P =>  Great apartments  We stayed at Astons Apartments for a couple of nights after Christmas and found it to be a terrific place to stay  There are so many choices in London  many of them of poor standards but we found that the rooms  although not huge  were the right size for two adults  The service at reception was friendly and helpful  the rooms were extremely clean  and the daily maid service was excellent  The location was excellent and the neighbourhood was quiet   I ve never slept so well in London before  
P => Bathroom  small  The best thing about the Astons is its great location  a short walk from Gloucester Road Tube stop in Kensington   and the accomodations are not terrible  The bathroom  however  was ridiculously  laughably small  The toilet was practically  in  the  quot shower  quot   See pic   
P => Astons apartments   a great London stay I have stayed at Astons apartments  Rosary Gardens  London on   occasions  My husband and I stayed there in      and I liked it so much  I returned in t       with a female friend for a week  The rooms are super clean  with a small kitchenette  with plates  tea kettle  etc  We stayed in a back room overlooking the garden   very quiet  and had a hugh bathroom by european standards  The area was great    blocks from Gloucester Rd  tube station  all sorts of good pubs in the area  try the Hereford Arms  and a Starbucks  and large grocery store just beside the tube station  South Kensington is a good area  just south of Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens  You may walk there if you re in good shape to walk  The staff at Astons were SUPERB  Very friendly and accomodating  Do stay at Astons the next time your go to London  The price is good  also  You won t regret it  
P =>  Simply a jewel  I stayed at Astons  for   nights during the summer  Bringing   kids with me to  quot see the best of London quot   I found Astons a very pleasant place to stay  with a great location   just a    minute walk  even for young children  from the tube station  the museums and Hyde Park within walking distances  and convenient shops for food nearby  There is also an internet bar down the main road  I was pleasantly surprised that the apartment was in a very quiet neighbourhood  so we could actually have very quiet evenings and undisturbed nights  We are Chinese from Hong Kong  so staying   days in London meant that my kids missed all the homemade delicacies  The kitchenette in the room solved all the problems  with well equipped sinks  pots and pans  crockery and utensils  plus a good sized fridge and microwave  stove    you name it  What better things can you expect when you are thousands of miles away from home  To make it even better  the dirty pans and dishes were all cleaned up during the daily service   Considering it was in central London  the room price was moderate  and the room size was OK for   adult     kids  Any extra person would make the room feel crowded  The bathroom however  was bigger than I expected and fitted with modern fixtures  but no tub in our room  I was satisfied with the cleanliness and the service of the room  even the hallway and stairs were clean and brightly decorated  though not on a luxurious scale  The staff were friendly enough though not much could be expected for sightseeing guidance  There was no air conditioning in the room but the summer nights were cool enough  There was no elevator so it would be quite demanding if you have lots of heavy baggage  This apartment hotel is highly recommended for family vacations  especially if you are thinking of cooking your own meals  which also helps with the budget  I would stay there again next time I visit London  
P => Great Choice We stayed for two nights with four people  The apartment      had two twin beds  a sleep sofa and a pull out single  With all the beds out  it was a little cramped  but fine  The bathroom was large and modern  The kitchen was useful  too with a good microwave and ample fridge  Everything was quite clean  Best of all  unit    had its own entrance from the street  The staff was very friendly and helpful  allowing us to check in at   am  The neighborhood is wonderful  the street was VERY quiet  and a short stroll from the Glocester Road tube stop  Two grocery stores nearby and numerous shops with coffee and sandwiches for breakfast  Highly recommended  
P =>  Perfect location My husband     month old daugher and I recently spent five days in London at the Astons Apartments  The room was very small by North American standards but really has all the amenities you need  Our kitchenette was perfect for storing fruit  breakfast and lunch supplies and the bathroom was compact but functionable  The main reason we would stay here again is its location  The apartments are quiet on their residential road but its just a short walk and you are on a busy roadway with cafes  pubs  grocery stores and the Glouchester Road tube station  It was perfect for us  
P =>  Cute but Small Our stay at Astons Apartments was nice  The bathroom was tiny  with a sink that was all but impossible to wash my face in without drenching the floor  however  the shower worked well with plenty of hot water  The rooms are very small  and there are not any dressers to store your clothes  Basic rooms  but nice views of the gardens  The  kitchen  had everthing you needed  but was also tiny  The staff was helpful and the location was a quiet street    blocks from the tube  A great restaurant nearby is  BALANS   We also stayed at the K  amp  K George Hotel in Earl s Court a short distance away  which was larger  cleaner and included a very nice breakfast with the cost of the room  
P =>  Perfect for Two My son and I spent eight nights at the Astons in il       and for us it was perfect  Whether other travellers will give it a high rating will depend on what your priorities are for your stay in London  Our four priorities were    Accomodations with a kitchenette     Location in a convenient  centrally located  pleasant  residential neighborhood   Reasonable price   Clean  well maintainedI have always found that having even a modest kitchen facility is a good idea when I travel with children  There s convenience and economy  We like to get an early start  and being able to make eggs  toast  coffee and have a glass of juice quickly does save time  Being able to have a snack at  quot home quot  is also a plus  Restaurant prices in London will quickly give you sticker shock  A coffee is typically about        Simple sandwiches at the many sandwich shops run about     Entrees at restaurants  even the more modest ethnic restaurants  pubs  and fish  amp  chips places start at about      Buying stuff at the local supermarket made life a lot simpler  in addition to substantial savingsSo  it was nice on occasion to just have a pizza  get a take out from the pizza restaurant in the arcade adjacent to the Gloucester Road tube or take out Chinese  there s a good place right outside the South Kensington tube on Thurloe St  or just a good old fashioned store bought chicken in the room after a long day of sightseeing  Food prices tend to be pretty much as in the States  There s a great  fairly large supermarket in the arcade which will be your regular starting point  A great selection of fresh cheeses  cold cuts  prepared foods and all the rest  About a    minute walk west on Cromwell Road as you exit the tube is an even larger Sainsbury supermarket The kitchenette at Astons is well equipped  better than average  basically a wall section with an electric range  small refrigerator  microwave and supply of glasses  dishes  pots  silverware  other cooking utensils and a cutting board  Two pluses were a toaster and and a French press for coffee  Dishes were cleaned every day by the housekeeper  There are cleaning supplies if needed  The location for Astons is easily one its best assets on many counts  It s five minute walk from the Gloucester Road tube  which has two major tube lines  It s never very crowded  and  in contrast to many other stations  the different lines are close together  A travel tip   If your re going to be in London for at least four weekdays  definitely get a   day Zone     travel card for both adults and children  bring a small passport size picture need for ID for children  A couple of things to note  If you re planning on taking the tube from Heathrow  an only slightly longer ride than the far more expensive express train  which is actually less convenient for Astons   buy a one day Zone     card  and get your   day card the next day  Also  children ride free on weekend  but they do need to physically have a travel card  even though it s free  A reason reason I chose Astons is that I knew from past travel that South Kensington is one of the nicest neighborhoods in London    quiet  quaint  residential  which we definitely appreciated after the noise and activity of the sights in Central London There s a couple of local pubs  you ll pass Hereford Arms  perfect for dinner  and Stanhope Arms on Gloucester Road  near both tube and bus connections  travel cards are for buses also   You re about       minutes from the Natural History  Science and Victoria  amp  Albert Museums  Harrods and Hyde Park  Also about    minutes from Fulham Road  in the other direction  a good place to wander  lots of interested shops  a multitude of ethnic restaurants Sticker shock will also hit you when you search for places to stay  There are several apartments in S Ken but they re either much more expensive or cheaper  but far less in other amenities  We did a bit of online searching once we settled on Astons  and found a rate of    pounds night for our   single bed studio at londontown com  Since Astons has a toll free number that puts you in touch directly with the apartments  we contacted them directly with that price and booked the room  It was nice to be able to talk to someone directly at no cost  When figuring our room rates  remember there s a       tax added on  Our final bill was about      night which met our budget of under       not an easy task in London  particularly in a nice area From the outside  Astons looks similar to all the other row houses on the block  Inside on the entrance floor is the reception office and a small foyer  The office will let you use their internet connection evenings from    pm  which was helpful for booking plans while we were in town  Depending on who s on duty  you can also sometimes use the internet in the morning to check out the weather  basically a useless exercise since the weather is highly changeable from one hour to the next   Our room was  B  three flights up  facing a garden  Everyone thing is clean and well cared for  The room and bathroom was cleaned daily  beds made  new towels given  dishes washed    all things we assume but don t always get Those are the positives  which were important for us  There are  however  a few things that may be an issue for others  The first is that  as others have reported  the rooms are definitely small    basically just large enough for two beds next to each other  night tables  an eating table with chairs and a tv  that gets only the five basic London  quot free quot  channels For those who need more room to move around  that wasn t one of our concerns since we spent very little non sleeping time in the room   that might be a problem  There are no bureaus  so our stuff went in either the closet or stayed in suitcases  The bathroom wasn t quite as small as others have suggested  but it was a bit tight and there was no vanity  so toiletries were left at the sink  The shower  also no spacious  but sufficient  worked well  although we did have a problem with hot water the first day   There s a phone in the room  but you re probably better off giving friends family the     number into the office and letting them connect to your room free of charge  the office does close at  pm   pm NY time  Don t expect any help from the office staff on tourist options    they were friendly and helpful with room matters  but weren t too knowledgeable about London stuff  So there you have it  For us a great experience  Since we covered London and surrounding with great detail  I d be happy to share our experiences  Since Trip Advisor was a great help to us  I m happy to reciprocate  
P =>  friendly and warm welcome We arrived to a friendly welcome  unfortunatly our room wasnt ready but we didnt have long to wait   The standard double room is small and an upgrade would be advisable but it does do if you are planning going out for most of your time in London  The area is very clean and tidy and very quite  There are plenty of local shops including a Tesco s if you fancy making yourself a morning bacon sandwich   There are two or three local pubs about   mins walking distance  prices quite reasonable  If you fancy eating out but dont feel like adventuring too far STAY AWAY from the Italians Cafe Restuarant on the corner  you feel like an outcast and the food well you wouldnt feed it to your worst emery it is a complete rip off stay well away  The nearest station is Gloucester Road and is central for most places  If you fancy a site seeing tour The Big London Bus is the one to use  excellent value  friendly staff and well worth seeing everything Overall       for the location  apartments and sites  If your looking for value for money  local amenitites and a quiet area  I would definatly recommend Astons 
P => Loved the Astons Apartments The Astons Apartments are serviced apartments  i e  maid service  located   minutes just west and north of the Gloucester Road Tube Station  The rooms are small   Remember this is LONDON   all hotel rooms are small  unless you want to pay      per night  The hotel has several buildings on a street of Georgian Row houses  We stayed for four nights in early tember  fewer tourists  in building     room    on the third floor  The room was at the back of the house with a view of the back yard and the backyards of the buildings on the next street  The reception closes at      p m     h     and the front desk staff were young and very helpful  There is no internet access here  We booked over the internet with Central London Apartments  www central london apartments com   The hotel can provide you with a taxi at a fixed rate to Heathrow Airport  Paddington Station or Waterloo Station  it was        between Astons Apartments and Waterloo Station   I am sure that this works from the stations and airports to the hotel as well   just ask   Our Double Studio  two persons  one double bed  had a bed with a firm mattress  soft sheets and ample pillows  The room also had a hob  this is a stove top with two elements   a small fridge  a sink  a toaster  a kettle and a microwave   as well as all of the necessary cutlery  plates  glasses and utensils  can and bottle openers      With groceries purchased from Waitrose  we spent less on food and had decent meals in our room  We paid        a night There was a table with two chairs and a phone  each room has its  own phone number so people can call you directly     no charge for incoming calls  and television  The bathroom had a shower  picture an airplane bathroom    and was built in to the wall  The place is great for adventurous types  If you are tall or wide  or aren t the adventurous type   stay somewhere else  The room was not air conditioned  but the large window opened  and it was sufficiently cool at night for sleeping This is a very safe neighbourhood day or night  with foot patrols by local police  There is a Waitrose grocery store located just beside the Gloucester Road Tube Station  buy your bottled water here   it s   p as opposed to paying       at the Tube Station   There are fresh and prepared foods for reasonable prices  Note  a Tesco Metro  groceries  will be opening soon directly across from the Tube Station  There is a good cafe  open late  for coffee and sweet snacks  The neighbourhood has restaurants and small shops  a great pub  a coin laundry           and a drycleaner  as well as two cash points  bank machines   It is fun to look in the windows of the local real estate offices which have listings of local properties for sale   not that one could afford anything in this area  We had a great time   and for London  this is a reasonable price to pay for a great little hotel  
P =>  Clean and centrally located   I recently spent   days at the Astons Hotel in y        After reading many reviews on hotels I thought this one had the best to offer for the value     pounds or      a night   I found the room to be quite small but very clean and was perfect if you are traveling alone  I had the standard room and it was good for a single  but for two people you will want the upgrade to a standard suite       more   The only problem with the room was that the small standard bed was rather uncomfortable  The   flights of stairs was good exercise and didn t bother me at all  Best of all the hotel is right in the heart of London  walking distance of Hyde Park and   blocks from the underground  Pubs and store galore in nearby Kennsingon  I would go back there again in a heart beat  
P =>  ent Accommodations We booked here for a recent trip because the rates were good     pounds night  and the location sounded great  The location is not a bad walk  about   min  to a Tube station and close to several fine restaurants  But our first room was a closet  The room was barely big enough for the double bed and the bathroom was miniscule  it really is like an airplane bathroom   The sink was so small that you couldn t wash your face in it without dismantling the shelf that hung over it  We upgraded to an executive suite  for another    pounds night  which was a four floor walkup but had a modern bathroom and shower at least  The room was relatively clean and they changed the sheets and towels daily  though they didn t add more tea or coffee in the kitchenette   The staff was very nice and probably would have given us more if we had asked  but it was more fun to go shopping for our own   Unless you re used to staying in hostels  don t even bother with a base model room here  Go straight to the executive rooms and then head down the street to the Hereford Arms pub for a pint

P =>   Astor Court   Its OK would stay again   The hotel is very close to Oxford Circus Tube and its location is ideal for Oxford Street  The service from reception was good and the staff are friendly and happy to help  The rooms are OK in size and very warm  exceptionally clean   The breakfast area is very small and the breakfast is very basic but its OK   toast and coffee etc only  no full english at this hotel 
P =>   Perfect location location location  without glamour or comfort   Our party of   booked a   bedroom apartment  with a kitchen  bath  and sofa bed in the lounge  First the good  The room sizes are generous  The original coving and moulding is fantastic  We were in a top floor apartment  with windows in every room  as well as skylights in the hall  so it was bright and cheerful  The rooms were clean  and kept nicely clean  The location can t be beat  as it is a   minute walk to both Soho and Oxford Circus     minutes on foot to Picadilly   and the tube is really the only way to travel in London  For the not so good  the sheets were starched and more than one of us woke up with skinned elbows  The matresses were old and very uncomfortable  The windows are single paned and let in every noise from the busy district outside  lorries thundering by literally all night   The bath and shower had no shower head  The bathroom floor was a bit iffy  and definitely sloping toward scary  The continental breakfast  although conscienciously attended by friendly staff  was very basic  The desk staff  also very friendly  know nothing  so don t even bother to ask   they don t even know the type of parking zone in front of the hotel  Overall  it was a clean  budget friendly hotel in a fabulous location  Anyone raised on television would be horrified by the old and battered state of the place  Realists without rheumatism can manage quite well  Pampering this is not  but there s all the rest of London to take care of that  
P =>  Ideal for Central London We booked an apartment for   people with   bed rooms  kitchen and bathroom shower for two nights  Arrived to find apartment not available for the first night due to refurbishment of a floor  so we had to settle for one without a kitchen and only a sofa bed in the second room  Only suitable for three people really  Continental breakfast buffet was adequate to set us up for the day sightseeing  etc  For the second night we were offered our original standard of apartment which was far superior   twin beds in second lounge room and kitchen with microwave  fridge  cutlery and crockery  The bathrooms  which were just ok  are in need of refurbishment  Good quality TV in the lounge bedroom Ideally situated for Oxford Circus  Regent s Park  Great Portland Street Tube Station  Right next to BBC Broadcasting House  Overall  quite good value for   people in the centre of London  
P =>   Enjoyed Our Stay Would Recommend And return Hello folksI don t often leave reviews  but thought i would as others helped me in coming to a decision  Hopefully mine will do the same  although i do think that perhaps some of this all depends on which room you get  I took my girlfriend on a theatre break   all inclusive deal   and chose Astor court hotel due mainly to it s location and mostly good reviews The hotel is around ten minutes walk from Oxford street and Regents street and so really is in a good location for shoppping and the tube The room we had was fine   high ceilings  bathroom was big with bath  shower sink and toilet  Bedroom was fine with a comfortable bed  and the icing on the cake was a separate living room with two seater sofa good sized television with built in free view   Some of the furniture is quite oldy worldy  that may bother some  but didn t us  Wireless internet was there  although we didn t use it so can t comment on really   and the usual tea   coffee maker   hair dryer facilities  oh and a trouser press  The room wasn t an apartment  just a normal double room that for some reason i was expecting to be small and cosey  perhaps from reading another review somewhere   but it was the opposite  All in all very nice and all clean  The included breakfast was continental style and held down stairs in two separate  quot breakfast rooms quot   Selection was good  including  cereals  yogurt  tea  coffee  toast  Croissants   apple and orange juice  Cutlery was clean as were the tables  table cloths chairs etc and it was all  quot help yourself quot  so you could make as many return trips to the food as you wanted  you won t go hungry  Staff were all foreign and very friendly  We came back fairly late one night and asked for more tea   coffee for the room and were supplied with plenty  We also asked for directions and locations of shops for the next day and we were understood so there were no  quot language barrier quot  problems All in all we were very happy  i would return again  i would ask for the same room again  and i d recommend to a friend  Hope this helps Simon H  
P =>   Deffo Recommend this hotel for young travellers Me and my friends make a trip to London once a year and the last time we went we stayed in this hotel  It is only   minutes walk from the centre of Oxford st so is really ideal for shopping  The rooms are a bit dated but are very clean  We stayed in one of the apartment rooms at the top there was   of us   it was a little cramped but would be ideal for   people  It think it worked out about    or    euro each for   nights which was pretty good value  I dont think there is a restaurant or any thing there so dont be thinking u can ring for room service    
P =>  A lovely clean and centrally placed hotel My husband and I and our   young children stayed here in        I had read positive reviews on trip advisor and I wanted to echo these  The hotel is minutes walk from Oxford Street  It is an old hotel but very clean  We had an apartment with   bedrooms  a seperate toilet and bathroom and a kitchen including fridge and microwave which meant we could make snacks after a days sightseeing  The continental breakfast was lovely too  The hotel staff were very helpful also  This hotel really helped to make our stay in London a very pleasant one  
P =>   What a rip off    I am really disappointed after paying         for the night of the state this hotel is in  The rooms were really dated and in urgent need of modernisation and breakfast was not served until       It was extremely hot in the evening as the radiators didn t switch off which meant I woke up with a terrible sore throat  The rooms didn t have double glazing which meant the very noisy street sounds kept me awake  including the banging from the building site just opposite  plus I could feel the underground vibrate through the hotel  My shower didn t work and there was no hot water  which meant I had to have a cold shower in the morning  The walls were so paper thin that I was also kept awake by the person in the room next to mine who was snoring  The bathroom is extremely cold  I would not recommend this hotel to anyone  Please go to another hotel  otel Euston is only    minutes walk from this hotel and there is only a     difference in the price   WHAT A RIP OFF    
P =>   ent hotel    excellent location    some problems though  Room     We stayed there for   nights and while we never planned for a   star hotel  some things there just threw me off  First the positive  Location is excellent      min to the tube  all the shopping and sightseeing buses minutes away  Good neighborhood  The hotel is relatively clean  not by Ritz standards but Holiday Inn clean   Rooms are small by US standards but very generous for Europe  Housekeeping is decent   still trying to figure out how they managed to vacuum around couple of books and newspapers that fell on the floor without moving them though  Breakfast is included but don t count on it being very nutritious   packed cheese and day old croissants    some jam  toasted bread and tea coffee  Staff is extremely friendly  Internet station in the lobby  expensive   Wi Fi available  even more expensive  Negative  Yes  it s an old  old and older building  but it would be a good idea to change fix the windows   you can feel every wind gust in the room  Restroom is extremely small  which would be fine  but COLD  old single pane window and NO Heat  It does get cold in UK  I m not sure why people wanted AC in the rooms in Winter  but trust me   you d rather settle for heat in the restroom  Staff is very friendly but useless  They don t know what s around the hotel and are only able to call a cab  the most expensive one   don t ask them to call you a cab   and direct you to the tube station where you can find  supposedly  whatever you re looking for  Not too much to eat around the hotel after  pm   everything closes early except for McDonalds and couple restaurants  Appliances  bathtub  sink  etc  are probably as old as the building itself and the enamel on the bathtub is peeling off really bad   we were in room    but I think it ll be similar with other rooms  Generally speaking  except for the cold restroom and leaking windows this was pretty much what we expected  Unless you re looking for luxury  this hotel will provide reasonably clean rooms and comfortable beds and generously large  by european standards  rooms  
P =>   Fine for a family break We stayed here for two nights for a midweek half term break to see a couple of shows  with children aged    and     We booked one of the  quot apartments quot  which was actually a small sitting room with   single beds in an alcove off  plus a double bedroom  bathroom and separate WC  OK not     but decent     Quiet room  comfortable beds  TV in sitting room and double bedroom  Fine for what we wanted   just a place to sleep and get breakfast  Bath enamel was somewhat stained and damaged  but it s an old building and the room certainly wasn t dirty   just old  Staff were polite and let us check in early  leaving our luggage in the  unsecured  luggage room at our own risk  but no problems  Continental breakfast in the basement breakfast room wasn t frilly  but it was fine and there was plenty of it  We were quite satisfied with the place  and would certainly use it again because it s incredibly convenient  
P =>   Great location for shopping and shows Stayed here   night for a shopping and theatre trip  Fantastic location for the price   just   mins brisk walk from Oxford Circus  Room was clean  bed comfortable  plenty of hot water  helpful staff  and a perfectly adequate continental breakfast  Exactly what we wanted for a short break  
P =>  Simple but a perfect base My husband and I stayed   nights at this hotel  We wanted a good base to see London from Check in was painless and the staff were both polite and friendly The room wasn t   star but we never expected it to be   it was clean and warm    apart from the bathroom which was very draughty and my only real complaint There is no bar in the hotel which is a shame but there s a nice little  local  pub literally   doors down   which does nice daytime food and is reasonably priced  We had a great weekend    nights in central london for      B B    cannot complain   didn t try the breakfast unfortunatley bed was too comfy   
P =>   Great location The Astor Court Hotel is placed right in the heart of London  just a few minutes walk from Oxford Street Oxford Circus  The room was fine and the breakfast buffet was ok  but nothing special  The staff is friendly and helpful  
P =>   Not so bad after all  OK  before booking a hotel in London  we trawled all the review sites  Basically most hotels under      a night in a good location have mixed reviews  many comments mention hotels are older and suffer common problems such as old fashioned  small rooms  noise from Underground  no lift  miserable staff etc  so we were prepared for the worst  OK  the negatives first  hotel was older and a little tired especially the stair carpets  very Austin Powers   The luggage rooms were pokey and undecorated and the room had a suspicious odour of cigarette smoke  did not last too long once we got some windows open  The bathroom was pretty clean although a little  quot mix and match quot  and the shower mixer was temperamental Now the middle ground  the staff varied between indifferent and excellent  the breakfast girl was a joy  There was a lift but quite small  There was noise from the Underground but we were too tired to notice when in the room  The room was well decorated and clean although the desk and office chair took up much space Now the good stuff  walk in off the street and pay      a night for a double  We paid just over     by shopping around on the net  My favourite thing of note were the shoe shining machines on each floor  quirky The room came with tea and coffee facs   hairdryer  trouser press  LCD TV  telephone  free digital safe and plenty of storage  The breakfast  although continental  was plentiful  the breakfast room was clean and bright and just a great start to the day  And finally the location    mins walk to Regents Park or Regent Street     min amble to Oxford Street    mins to Great Portland St Underground  loads of pubs  delis and eateries nearby  busy with friendly media types from BBC Radio  Dave and the like  Recommend Villandry for gifts  nibbles  Horse and Groom for a homely cheap pub  The Albany for trendy young things with the best pint of Peroni I have ever tasted and Sergios  as recommended to me by Steve Lemacq   for some home cooked Italian fare that won t break the bank Happy  
P =>   Budget with a capital B    Stayed in the Astor Court recently and I fail to see how this property is rated   star  Furthermore  I certainly could not see any evidence of redecoration anywhere  contrary to what is stated on the hotel website  All in all it is just adequate  More a  hotel  for those only wanting a bed for a night without any of the trimmings of a modern   star or   star hotel  The location is fine in that we could walk to the main attractions in       mins  We did not have the luxury of hot water any morning of our stay and the bathroom and toilet appear not to have been changed since the war  All in all a bit of a disappointment  
P =>  Worst hotel ever While Astor Court Hotel had a good location for our needs and the breakfast was OK  that is all I can say positive about it  I know that European hotel standards are not the same as US standards  but this hotel set a low for quality during our three week trip through five countries  The rooms are old and several items did not work  The towel rack literally fell off the wall drenching our towels in the tub  The room layouts are atrocious and do not allow for any air circulation  It was hot while we were in London and the hotel has no air conditioning  This would not be a problem but for the room layout and the fact they have no ceiling fans in the rooms or fans they can give to you to put in the window  When asked about this the staff could have cared less  Except for the girl who worked nights the staff was totally useless  In an effort to get the room cool we had to leave the window wide open  The street noise is horrible and the ongoing construction next door wakes you early and goes all day long  The TV s are miniscule and the cable  if you can call it that  quality was horrible  We supposedly had a three person room which appears to be a two person room with a cot cramed into it leaving absolutely no room for luggage let alone to walk around or sit  The only positive attribute the Astor Court Hotel has to offer is location  I would pick any other place to stay over the Astor Court Hotel  
P =>   Superb Value For Money I ve stayed here previously in      and wasn t terribly impressed but we have just had a very positive stay this weekend  The standards have really improved and the rooms  corridors and the breakfast area all refurbished   I was pleasantly surprised  Our room was large  clean and well equiped and the breakfast was varied and tasty  My only two dissapointments were the standard of reception staff   very uncheerful when we arrived coupled with a late check in so our room wasn t ready  we arrive at      pm   and the Night Porter was very rude when he had to let us in at  am  who doesn t stay out late in London     we were made to feel like naughty teenagers However  overall this hotel is much improved and excellent value for money   espcially considering the great location off Regent s Street  I would recommend this place to anyone on a budget who wants simple and straightforward accommodation  just don t be put off by the surly staff  
P =>   Good value Great location much better than the crappy hotels around Russel Sq Choosing small London hotels with great locations can be dicey  Had a number of upsets around the Russel Square hotels with terrible  quot value quot  hotels  Astor Court is small  very freindly service  great location     min walk from Oxford Circus  Rooms are fairly new  Only complaint is that there was no hot water for a morning shower  I will return to this hotel  
P =>   Good budget hotel We stayed for   nights in early ruary  The hotel is small and quaint but in a great location for exploring central London  The large construction site nearby did not give us any problems and overnight there was virtually no noise from the nearby main road  The rooms are clean and spacious but there isn t much wardrobe space    hangers on a rail and no drawers  Breakfast is your average continental spread  which was enough for us  Ideal hotel for mini break on a budget  
P =>   Central but dated  I needed a centrally located hotel for one night as I had an appointment nearby the following morning so going on the fairly favourable reviews for the Astor Court on Tripadvisor  I booked it  The location is excellent just   minutes from oxford Circus and as a previous review stated  there is a big construction site right across the street  I was in a room facing this street yet I had no problem with noise  The receptionist was efficient and friendly and gave me a room even thought I was a little early arriving for check in  I was allocated room      which was spacious and clean but badly laid out  It was probably a little overfurnished and the very comfortable bed was through and arch into an area which was really too small to accommodate it  The decor was oldfashioned with lots of plasterwork and coving  Like many older buildings the various electrical modifications added over the years detracted from it  The window seemed to be missing the net curtain which might preserve the modesty of the guest from the occupants of the buildings across the street  An expanding cord from which it once hung dangled bare  The bathroom decor was of the same vintage with a mish mash of electrical conduits and exposed water pipes and a curtainless window  The fittings were ancient   a cistern with a chain  very early last century    and a mis matched collection of tiling completed the outdated effect  This is a very well located hotel and is a good resting place for one night but I do not imagine that I would fancy it for a longer stay  On a positive note  the shower was powerful and there was ample towelling  With a bit of investment and imagination this could be a great hotel  The unsupervised luggage storage and the friendly welcome are an advantage  The     rate rescued it somewhat but I would in future probably spend a little extra for more modern lodgings  
P =>  Leader of the Band I lead a group to theatre and overnight stay  I booked   rooms at Astor Court because of its reasonable rates and location convenient for walking to Oxford Circus   Palladium Theatre All in my party agreed that the rooms were spotlessly clean and surprisingly spacious for a budget hotel This was my first visit but certainly not my last  Well done Astor 
P =>   Clean nice and good location We stayed here for   nights   th   th of e this year  I was very pleased with the location and the cleanliness of the hotel  Large room  ok breakfast and nice staff  The only thing that was annoying was the construction site on the other side of the road  a lot of noise  But I absolutely recommend this hotel  as a matter of fact I m staying there this ember also  can t wait     
P =>  Clean hotel Lacks facilities for longer stays Booked through Superbreaks        BB  well continental breakfast  Hotel is excellently located just round the corner from the BBC Studios and minutes walk from oxford street Bedroom and bathroom very clean although decor a bit dated  thin walls but fine for a one night stay   lack of business facilities  
P =>   SUPERB VALUE We stayed at the astor court for one night for a  quot  mums and kids  quot  trip  We had booked a triple room but were given an apartment with two bedrooms  Superb  A break from the kids for mum and they didn t have to listen to my snoring   The hotel was clean  the staff friendly  they even opened a second dining room for us  Great location  will definitely stay again  
P =>  ent well located We stated at Astor Court for four nights in e  We had requested a high floor and ended up on the fourth floor at the back of the hotel so that the street noise was not too noticible  There was daytime nioise from a nearby construction site  but that s London these days  We could feel the tube trains faintly  but it did not bother us  Our room was small  but had a separate lounge with the TV and much appreciated blackout curtains  as the London sunrise is very early in e The bathroom was old fashioned  but clean and had a full bathtub  The cleaning staff was very nice and efficient  Breakfast was crowded with lots of families and kids jostling for cereal and seats  It is continental as stated  We were glad for a break from heavy  quot full English quot  breakfasts  We loved the location  It is close to Oxford Circus with plenty of restaurants  the British Museum  and even a launderette within walking distance  All in all  we enjoyed our stay and would return  
P =>   Noisy Stuffy Dirty Noisy Unfriendly and Noisy  The reason we chose this hotel was its location   it s a short walk from Oxford Circus and the West End  which made it ideal Unfortunately  we found the staff were unfriendly and unsympathetic  the room was dirty  the noise from the building site across the road was all pervading  even with the windows shut   shutting the windows made the room feel unbearably humid and stuffy  and the bolt on the lavatory door had a tendency to fall apart   I was trapped inside what appeared to be the world s most cramped toilet cubicle for a good five minutes before I could unlock it The breakfast was rubbish  too   where were the bacon  eggs  sausages  and so on This hotel was a blight on an otherwise fun trip to the capital  I had more sleep the time I spent the night at Paddington Station  I strongly recommend staying elsewhere  
P =>   Perfect Location Had a weekend break recently and found the location of this Hotel superb  It is situated just a stones throw from Oxford Circus On arrival the receptionist was very friendly and efficient and let us leave our luggage in the store room as we had arrived quite early We had a double room on the fifth floor and it was more than adequate for our needs  This IS budget accomodation and as such is good value  Although the rooms may be a little dated  it just adds character to the hotel Breakfast can be a little chaotic simply because of the size of the dining room but the staff ensured that food available was plentiful Would strongly reccomend this hotel for its location and value 
P =>   Perfect for a weekend away Me and a friend stayed in the Astor Court Hotel for two nights in a recent weekend away in London We booked online through a booking agency at around     per night for a twin room bed and breakfast  We weren t sure what to expect as London hotels are typically rubbish  But we were very impressed and it was a perfect base for our stay The hotel is really easy to find and    mins walk from Topshop  perfect   The breakfast was standard continental but fine for us  You could have as much as you wanted and the staff were really attentive and cleaning the tables  stocking up food etc  On the Sunday we had to wait about   mins for a table but that was because everyone seemed to come down to breakfast at once I would reccomend this hotel for short breaks and just as a base only  for this it is PERFECT   The rooms are standard but clean and really have everything that you need  We didn t have much interaction with the staff but everything was running smoothly so we didn t need to   
P =>   good location I have just spent a weekend at the Astor Court and it was a really enjoyable stay  I have read the reviews before going there and I can confirm that the rooms are a bit old fashined  My room was quite large  and toilet and bathrooms were seperate  I was staying at the  th floor and I could not hear any noise from trains or the tube  as it was mentionned in other reviews  The TV set was not working properly  there was only sound but no picture  When I informed reception  they did not seem to be very surprised about that Breakfast was good  with croissants  pain au chocolat and other bakery and cereals  But no ham or eggs  The most negative impression was from the plastic tablecloth which gave the whole breakfast room a very cheap and uncomfortable look  But in general it is a good hotel in a nice surrounding with several restaurants and pubs nearby  
P =>  Wonderful service centrally located If you re looking for a cheap and very cheerful place to stay in central London  I can definitely recommend the Astor Court  We arrived quite early  before    but the hotel was happy to check us in anyway and allowed us to leave our luggage in the storage room so we could be out and about   They also offered to let us wait while they got the room ready but the shops were waiting  The rooms are fairly small  a little shabby  with old style doors  with doorbells   on the rooms   but everything was very clean and tidy  and rooms included tea  amp  coffee making facilities  built in hair dryer  trouser press  etc The best thing about the place  however  was the service  be all the staff had just got a raise or something because everybody was smiling  very helpful and pleasant about any request  I stay in central London with work quite a lot  and found the service and general attitude here to be far above the usual you get at hotels   and   times the price of this one Breakfast was a simple  continental affair but very filling   cereal  yogurt  toast  juice  fresh brewed coffee  no instant stuff    buns  pastries  the works  
P =>  Ideal Base but avoid the breakfast We stayed at the Astor Court Hotel for   nights in ust and found the   bedroom appartment we booked very spacious and ideal for families with children  The rooms were tastefully decorated  very spacious and included all the facilities necessary including a kitchen  again very useful if travelling with children  Overall  we felt the appartment was extremely good value for money  My only gripe was the breakfast which was very poor   and obligatory inlcuded in the price  but given the price of the appartment this still made a good value for money accomodation and there is a good cafe just around the corner  Would definately recommend as a good tourist base  
P => Nice hotel in good location if you don t mind the noise of the trains Don t stay here unless you bring your earplugs  While the hotel is pleasant enough  I found the noise and rumble of the underground trains passing beneath the hotel to be very disruptive to sleeping  even on the  rd floor  My first room was on the  nd floor but the drain from the basin in the bathroom was barely working and I couldn t get any hot water so I was moved to another room the next day  Both rooms were quite spacious with nice period details in the d cor but with an odd layout   a bit more like suite than a room  The sitting area had plenty of space with a desk  chair  large armchair and occasional table  But the space around the bed s  was very cramped due to the small hallway leading in from the corridor  The bathroom had a good sized bath and overhead shower  The toilet was situated in its own room off another tiny hall but the hotel needs to move the paper holder off the door where it can easily catch you when walking out   I had the bruises to prove it  The continental breakfast was good with all the basics provided  The location was only    minutes walk from Oxford Street and there was a little convenience shop a couple of blocks away  There are also some pubs nearby  I found some of the staff to be helpful but the receptionist the night I arrived was not welcoming and very off hand when she pointed out that the lift wasn t working  As a woman traveling alone  I d particularly chosen hotels with a lift and having just arrived from a long haul flight I was tired and not happy at the prospect of hauling my bags up three flights  Fortunately a fellow guest came to my aid because the hotel was clearly not going to offer any assistance  My check out wasn t much better  As I had to leave at     am I d asked Reception to book me a taxi to Victoria  Instead of a black cab  I was provided with a mini cab and a driver who didn t know the address and had trouble finding it   all for quite a high set charge  While the rooms are pleasant and the location good  the rumble from the trains would stop me from staying at the Ascot Court Hotel again  
P =>  Great Value Hotel We stayed at the Astor Court for the weekend and would definitely recommend it to our friends and families  The location is brilliant and is only a few minutes walk from the tube  The hotel and room was spotless and the breakfast was fine for what we needed  The area around the hotel was safe and the staff were all very helpful and friendly  Could not fault it in any way  
P =>  Location location location  This hotel is all about location and price so don t go there expecting   star treatment    Probably not a great place for a romantic weekend  but fine for singles or groups of friends  I d certainly stay there again Good things about the Astor Court    Only    minutes walk from Oxford Circus on a quiet side street   Not very expensive considering its central location   Very clean  decent sized roomBad things about the Astor Court    Rooms badly need redecoration   Terrible shower   basically an old fashioned bath tap attachment   not very user friendly and the bathroom floor ended up soaked every morning    Very limited breakfast   in a very drab  dreary basement room   Not very secure luggage store room   it s near the front door and is never locked 
P => Cheap Basic   suited us perfectly Myself and three mates needed somewhere cheap to stay for one night in central London  The other reports on here seem to be fairly accurate  It is basic  nothing fancy but that was ok with us   it cost just     each for a room with   single beds  or not great but bathroom very clean  TV worked ok  Beds very narrow  Some noise from party goers above our room who had returned from a night out at about  am but that s not the hotel s fault  Breakfast room small and couldn t all get seated together but cereal  toast  croissants were adequate  Most of the people staying here seemed to be under    years old  Great location   just    mins walk from Oxford Circus towards Regent Park If you re expecting comfort  relaxation in plush surroundings this isn t the place for you  If on the other hand a cheap room is the most important thing to you  then it s definitely worth a look  
P =>  Very Nice My husband  daughter and I spent   nights in a triple room  I found the beds to be comfortable and had very warm comforters on them  The only problem  was with the extra bed  it was very tippy  We put the waste basket under the end of the bed to keep it stable  The room also had a desk  comfortable arm chair and coffee table   The en suite bathroom was in   rooms  The toilet in one room  The very large tub with shower and the sink were in another room  There was also a closet with hangers   The room had been recently redecorated  new carpeting and beautifully painted  There is an elevator  The room was very quiet  we couldn t hear our neighbors   It s located on a side street so no street noise  Continental breakfast was included  It was adequate  nothing exciting  
P =>  pleasantly surprised  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this fine hotel after reading reviews on Trip Advisor    a friend and I stayed a couple of weeks ago and it was great  especially for the price  The location could not be beat  it doesn t get more central than Oxford Circus for the price   and it IS in one of the safest neighbourhoods  right nearthe business district pople claiming that the area is unsafe obviously haven t been into the dodgier parts of London    Picadilly Circus is a fifteen minute walk  and the shopping in the immediate area is fantastic   you could walk to most major attractions in    minutes or less   and you could certainly walk to your hotel alone after midnight without any concern The hotel is just in the process of being renovated  floors   and   are complete  we stayed on the  th floor  and the renos are very good no mustiness whatsoever   The cleanliness of the hotel was fantastic   I have stayed in much fancier hotels that have had less pride in their cleaning practices   and the staff absolutely lovely  they even made up our room ahead of schedule upon check in so we could take a much needed nap   Breakfast was simple  but be realistic  IT quot S BREAKFAST  If you are looking for something more  pay for it I would stay at this hotel again without hesitation  
P => Lovely hotel

P => Excellent hotel I actually purchased my room on priceline and was not sure what to expect because price was quite reasonable  When I arrived at hotel i was pleasantly suprised  It was a lovely hotel with extremely helpful front desk staff  It has beautiful public space and rooms are comfortable with free minibar and wonderful hot showers  The location was perfect as well in heart of fair  Hotel is highly recommended  
P => Above and beyond my expectations   perfect location amazing service  Fabulous place to stay for adult travelers or families  Stayed with   kids    and     children s concierge was amazing   brought movies  a Wii  Monopoly  kids  maps      gave the kids plenty of activities to be content after a long day of sightseeing Perfect location   across from park  quick walk to Buckingham Palace and walking distance     mins  to Westminster Abbey  Big Ben  and London Eye  short walk to tube stations  Staff was attentive and accommodating to every request Would absolutely recommend this hotel and stay again and again  A hidden gem  
P => Fabulous Hotel What a truly Fabulous hotel  I booked this hotel on laterooms com for a romantic break with my partner  We arrived at the hotel and the staff were very polite and friendly   yes and the doormen   O  We were told that we had been upgraded to an apartment that was very nice with a bath  huge bed  living room and kitchen  The bed was so comfy that me and my partner had trouble getting out of it in the morning The nice late check out meant we could relax and use the sauna and spa rooms and well equip gymAs it was a fleeting visit we didn t have time to use the bar or restaurant but they looked fabulous I would recommend this hotel without hesitation  It was centrally located with a two min walk from Greens park tube station and a hop and a skip to Buckingham palace  We saw a show in the evening and again it is a    minute walk to theatrelands West End or   tube stops fabulous fabulous fabulous  stay at the Athenaeum hotel If you want to have a glorious time in London Georgina Hurcombe Documentary Producer 
P =>   Your Second Home This is how a hotel should be  As you arrive  the charming doormen give you the feeling that you are at home  They are extremely polite and friendly  Check in was great  due to an early train  we were already able to check in at   AM  The concierge is amazing  he can make any last minute reservations for you  The spa is very practical as well  especially after a long day in London  I am always sad to leave  but I know that I will come back  Once you ve stayed at the Athenaeum  you just don t go to another hotel  it is just too addictive    
P =>   A perfect choice for a stay in LONDON This hotel is not to be compared against other   star hotels  It s a unique boutique hotel which just gets better every time we stay there  We always look forward to being greeted by the loyal doormen  Jim or John and the reception staff  who always greet you with a smile  We have stayed at this hotel on many occasions over the past   years  They have thought of everything to ensure you have an enjoyable stay  The Children s Concierge is an additional luxury service  as they can organize activities  supply you with computer consoles and board games  The staff uniform is also worth mentioning  as it complements all the staff and you don t feel your ordering your breakfast with last night s menu all over the waiter s shirt  The location is great as its only streets away from Bond Street and surrounded by an endless list of restaurants  However the lunch and evening menu options are great value with traditional classics  cooked with a modern edge served on fine china and silverware Breakfast at The Athenaeum is great way to start your day  with a wide choice of locally sourced healthy specialties  A personal favorite of mine is the Regents Park Honey  The cooked breakfast is just as it should be its spot on  There is only one thing that spoils a good breakfast and that s miserable staff  something you definitely will not find at this hotel The bar is a cosy area to enjoy a drink of any kind surrounded by people enjoying themselves  If you do have time there is a great choice of top magazines and newspapers available around the public areas The rooms have been recently renovated with soft light welcoming tones  which follow through and lead you to a welcoming luxurious bed with luxurious linen and perfect pillows The rooftop suites overlooking Green Park have dream views of London  There is a free mini bar on all soft drinks and free Wifi and an ipod docking station  The white marble bathrooms in the suites have televisions and the sumptuous bathroom products by REN are a perfect choice to pamper yourself with The hotel just seems to get busier and busier every time we stay  Its the perfect choice for a London stay  
P =>   friendliest staff yet How refreshing it is to be greeted with genuine warmth by friendly staff  From the cheery doorman to the cheerier  if this is possible  receptionist   this is the welcome you expect  but rarely receive  from a    hotel  The rooms are spotless and a good size  If you can get a room overlooking green park you will be delighted  The bathroom is alsod size and tastefully decorated in marble Non alcoholic drinks and snacks are FREE in the minibar  Non alcoholic drinks and snacks are FREE in the minibar  This is true  pick yourself up off the floor What a lovely  friendly top hotel  in a top location  Handy for bus and tube and all the super fair  St James s shops Many other hotels charge similar rates  but only a couple nearby offer such genuinely friendly  helpful staff Ace  
P =>  The Athenaeum Hotel What an awesome place to stay  Right on Picadilly in London across the park form Buckingham Palace  They treat you like royalty  
P =>  A never to be forgotten weekend Just spend a wonderful night in a rooftop suite  A bed like sleeping on downy air  fantastic views over the park  breakfast in bed  intermingling with sitting on the balcony in the fluffy robe  It was my   th birthday and this was a wonderful surprise  I could hardly sleep after an evening with bubbly and friends in the suite and then dancing at the Dover St jazz bar  The Athenaeum staff were absolutely charming  Standing on the balcony looking over at Big Ben and the Wheel  with all the wonderful autumn colours of the park was just the best  If this is    give me more of it   
P =>  A true  home away from home  I have stayed in the Athenaeum apartments twice in      and would recomend them to anyone staying for a few days or more in London  The location is great for sighseeing or business and the apartments are wonderfully fitted out  Service from the staff is excellent particulalry at breakfast in the restaurant  I will always stay there when in London 
P =>  PERFECTION The Atheneum Hotel is PERFECT It was our  quot home quot  for   days  while in London the last week of ober Customer service is impeccable   from doorman  to bellman  to front desk  chambermaids  concierge  Everyone is happy  friendly and polite no pretenses Our room was amazing   luxurious and comfortable bed  linens  towels  robe  slippers  Lighting  A C  amp  heat control right next to your bed  Bathroom has all the luxurious amenities one may desire for and more  They provide REN bath products  mending kits  shower cap  cotton buds  facial cotton  Heated towel rack a huge plus Stunning view of Green Park  extremely lovely in Autumn when colors are changing   stars for free Wifi and unlimited free supply of beverages  cola  water  coffee   Nespresso machine to boot  teas  hot cocoa   snacks of nuts  crisps and chocolate bars  A skip hop and a jump away to Green Park underground and an M amp S   grocery store  A stroll away from various high end shops and restaurants The Atheneum is sheer perfection  a hidden gem in London Thank you Atheneum staff and management  
P =>  I just didn t want to leave This hotel is perfect in every way  The staff are the hotels secret ingredient to a superb stay as they are welcoming  friendly  efficient  helpful and professional  The decor is really interesting and a bit quirky with artistic touches that make me smile  the rooms are comfortable with heavenly beds and pillows  lighting that can be adjusted to bright  for people like me who are not seeing as well as they used to  or muted for a more romantic touch  They are well equipped with free soft drinks  snacks  nespresso coffee   or instant if preferred  slippers and lovely warm bathrobes  Good REN bath products including both shampoo and conditioner  so much better than the all in one variety  big fluffy towels  powerful shower  good bath and  for a change  free wifi  What could be better than a good nights sleep in a lovley bed with a fresh cup of good coffee and the paper in the morning  in a room kept beautifylly clean and fresh by wonderfully efficient chambermaids and people who seem genuinely interested in your having had a good day night and then after wandering back after the theatre to be greeted with  quot welcome Home quot   This hotel is heaven  
P =>   An absolute gem My wife and I stayed at the Athenaeum sadly only for one night on the   th ober We have stayed here a few times before for a treat and never been disappointed our last stay was no exception We were checked in speedily and also greeted by name which i thought was a nice touch As it was our wedding anniversary the hotel very kindly upgraded us to an Apartment     WOW it was the size of our house  very very comfortable and made our stay all the more memorableThe one thing that makes this hotel is that its family run and all the staff are so helpful and friendly We cant wait to go back 
P =>   Expesive Dated and Noisy   bed Apartment My family and I recently stayed in a   bed apartment at the Athenaeum  In short  the apartment we were allocated was situated directly above a very popular tapas bar  open      am midnight   The noise from below was very bad  and continued throughout the day  totally unsuitable for our young family  particularly our baby who was sleeping in the lounge area   Despite the promise of toys suitable for our children  a box of lego and   colouring books were provided for the first nights stay  we later requested a DVD which promptly arrived complete with popcorn   The   bed apartments are situated at the back of the hotel and have yet to be refurbished  The decor is dated  but the beds were comfortable  Upon arrival there was a small leak in one of the bathrooms which was quickly addressed  Unfortunately the same could not be said for the entry cards which continually did not work  we ended up needing   replacement cards for our   night stay  The kitchen was very handy and the inclusive mini bar a great idea  though it wasn t restocked during our stay   We ended up ordering breakfast in the room   arrived punctually  however  both mornings a couple of items were missing On the whole  the staff were very pleasant  it was more the accommodation that was very disappointing  Certainly the   bed apartments are not suitable for anyone who has young children  or light sleepers  Needless to say  we won t be returning  
P =>   Best hotel in London  This is the best place I have ever stayed in when in London  The staff are fantastic and always able to help  The rooms were perfect and much larger than most London hotels  plus they are equipped with everything you could possibly need  The location is perfect for walking or catching the subway as Green Park station is right there  My friend and I had the most pleasant experience and i would recommend this hotel to anyone  
P =>   Unexpectedly luxurious up to date without too much minimalist decor This is a boutique style hotel  newly refurbished so everything is pristine  lots of glass and light being used to good effect to create a sense of space  Well located about   mins walk to Green Park Station  Lovely comfortable rooms with every facility incl  an iPod dock  although not an LED clock somewhere in the room which would have been handy as I can t see my watch in the dark   Luxurious if small bathroom with fluffy new white robes   slippers delivered at turndown time   and great view onto Green Park and beyond  A special feature is the staff who are charming and helpful  Table d hote dinner is good value  for London  with prices at     for   courses      for    Breakfast is expensive but the quality was great  It was a pleasure to find a mini bar where soft drinks and snacks were not charged for at a hefty rate  being free  We liked the Whisky lounge with its mellow atmosphere for the evenings  and the Garden Room is a nice spot for afternoon tea  for which the hotel apparently has an award  and is not too feminine in decor  so we spotted quite a few men having tea there  unlike some other places where it has all got very frilly  We loved it and would happily return when we are staying in London again  
P =>   The staff makes a stay at this boutique hotel very special My three sisters and I had beautiful connecting rooms on the third floor overlooking Green park  The bay windows that opened with the juliet balconies were wonderful and we would sit having our tea or whiskies and watch the world whirl by  Shutting the windows cut the noise dramatically but we kept them cracked a bit to soak up the London sounds  The rooms were a good size with comfortable beds covered with fluffy duvets The bathroom was larger than others I have had in London  Because we paid for these upgraded rooms we had free access to eveything in the mini bar  including alcohol  Everything was replenished daily  We loved the peppercorn crisps  The hotel has free wireless which was great The staff of this hotel is what really makes the difference  From Jim and John  the doormen  to Saleem  who checked us in and then personally took us to our rooms  to the general manager and his staff who invited us to a cocktail reception and then made us feel very welcome     this hotel made us feel very special The location is perfect for seeing London  There are two tube stops nearby  You can cross the street and be at Buckingham Palace in   minutes  We had many restaurants within a couple blocks  We loved Pret a Manger for breakfast and stopped by several times  We had one breakfast in the hotel but we aren t really buffet brunch people no matter how elegant it is I can t think of a negative thing to say about the Athenaeum  It will be the hotel we return to on our next trip to London  
P =>    Green  Hotel in a Perfect Location I was staying in the Athenaeum in tember for two nights  I ve been trying out hotels in London in the past few years  and I must say  this one is one of my favourites  Its location is very good  only five minutes from Green Park tube station and only a couple of minutes to ble Arch Tube station You instantly recognise the hotel by its landmark wall garden  which attracts butterflies in the day and is lit in a gloomy green at night  The staff is friendly and helpful  and although our room was located with its windows looking at the backyard  the rooms surpassed my expectations  The beds are fluffy  the minibar is complimentary  except for some alcoholic drinks  and the entertainment system is faboulus  The Athenaeum might become one of my  quot safe harbours quot  in London    
P =>   lovely My teenage daughter and i stayed here for four nights  Great location  very clean and well appointed rooms  free mini bar goodies  excellent espresso machine in the room  The service was good and they provided popcorn with free DVD s and milk and cookies in the evening  The location is right across from Green Park and only a few minutes from the Piccadilly Line tube  yet surprisingly quiet  The staff is very helpful  Our room was only one step up from the basic and it had a lovely bay window  The breakfast is over priced but for a minute s walk you have many other choices  Great workout facilities and spa amenities  
P =>  Fabulous Hotel  If you want to treat yourself in London  stay here  It is expensive  on my salary   but worth it  The staff was excellent  They answered every question that I had and made reservations for a play and a bus tour  They had a maid in the morning and a maid that turned down the bed at night   Nice touch   You could have everything in the fridge for free  except for the liquor  and that was great  They had a tea kettle  a coffee thing  that I didn t understand  and various cups etc  We were in the back  so we didn t have any problem falling asleep I found tiny flaws  I know that they just made over the rooms  And  I had a small room  as one would expect in London  But the mirrors  They were on one wall  the closet was mirrored  the bathroom door was mirrored  both sides  It would have been nice if I was size    but I am not  The other thing was the bathroom door didn t open all the way  so I had to wedge myself in  I had a hard time getting in the bathtub to take a shower   I have a disability   I asked the manager and had another manager show me a room that had a shower that you didn t have climb into  That was important and now I know what to ask before I make a reservation  All in all  if I had the money again  I would stay here again  
P =>  Perfect location and beautiful decor though expensive  I treated my husband to a night s stay at this hotel for a birthday present and booked it through the  quot Secret Rooms quot  on Laterooms com  The hotel itself has the most perfect location being a five minute walk from Buckingham Palace and very close to Hyde Park and Kensington Palace  It is easily accessible by tube  though tricky at weekend due to ongoing maintenance   and car and occupies a plot opposite the beautiful Green Park On arrival  we were greeted by the wonderfully friendly and caring staff who couldn t do enough for us  They made a huge fuss of our   month old baby which was especially good as many higher end hotels are not keen fans of babies  Our room was beautifully decorated with warm colours and quirky London features such as miniature soldiers in bearskins in a cabinet and a picture with many London landmarks  There was a Nespresso machine with a choice of coffee and all the soft drinks and snacks in the mini bar were free  Prior to arrival  we were sent a questionnaire asking us our favourite hobbies etc and when we arrived  they had put a Nintendo Wii with games in the room  as well as a DVD player and children s DVDs My only criticism of the hotel is the food and beverages prices  It was       for a   ml measure of gin and our two club sandwiches with chips and bottle of wine room service bill came to         Whilst I accept that London is expensive and    hotels are expensive  I cannot possible fathom how a sandwich can cost       Having said that  I would stay in the hotel again as the location was perfect and the staff were excellent  I just might take my own sandwiches next time    
P =>  Encore visit superb service elegant comfort the best staff  A second visit for us to this hotel  we are a well traveled family of that frequents     star properties in the US  Upon arrival we were welcomed by the on staff mgr kids  concierge who personally installed the Wii to my jet lagged kids  delight  The bell staff are world class and make each entrance and exit of your trip like you are leaving a friend s home  The accomodations are superb down from the comfortable bedding and the elegant restaurant  to the complementary stocked pantry with a stash of pleasant snacks and bottled water  There are a lot of high end options in London yet this distinguishes itself from the others in numerous ways that are important to the well traveled  It is competitively priced  
P =>  SPA Booked a Spa treatment at the hotel for myself and daughter  Wonderful location and very nice staff  Pleasant doorman   great all round  
P =>  Lovely hotel individual and great service This is a lovely hotel   the staff are full of personality and very helpful  The location is great    minutes from Green Park tube and walking distance from Picadilly REgents Street etc we stayed in a room quite high up and it was small  In fact it was very small  and the double bed was also small  Got a good deal on Lastminute but   although well equipped  small room  BUT   lots of lovely freebies  REN toiletries  robes to use  slippers  everything non alcoholic in the mini bar was complimentary and well equipped room with great Ipod speakers  free wifi  well stocked fridge  state of the art lighting system and nice and quiet  Overall  I would return  I might try and get a bigger room but it was a good deal and I really liked the ambience  Bar is very nice and well stocked  if you like scotch whisky you re really in luck  but tiny  Menu looked good too  All in all cosy  stylish  friendly and well equipped  
P =>   Wonderful Afternoon Tea We had an absolutely wonderful afternoon tea at the Athenaeum   I had looked at the reviews online and saw that it had won an award this year The staff were extremely helpful and courteous  Would highly recommend  
P =>   Milk and Cookies Turn Down Serive   London for Kids at its Best  Athenaeum Hotel and Apartments offer spacious luxury living with a family twist think video game coffee tables  game boards  toy baskets and milk and cookies delivered to your room every night  Your kids will never want to go home  Occupying a row of Edwardian townhouses in a classic English neighborhood  the apartments offer plenty of room for the whole family to spread out as well as the convenience of a full kitchen  washer and dryer  dining area and more  This hotel offers parents top design and luxury while catering to kids of all ages offering a home away from home you ve always wanted  if it weren t for those pesky kids leaving all their toys everywhere  atmosphere  
P =>   Great service combined with a wonderful location This gem of a hotel has one of the best people  From the bellhop to the receptionists  they were all very warm and welcoming to all their guests  I enjoyed the fact that the tall guy up front  it s too bad I didn t get his name but he is hard to miss   tall English man with white hair  always says  quot Welcome home  quot  with his deep voice and trademark smile whenever you get back to the hotel  He is my favorite guy there  The waiters in the restaurants were also kind enough to explain how the breakfast menu works  there were   types of breakfast available  and the different courses for lunch  The amount attention given to us was just right  they aim to please but are not over eager to do so  The big ks and Spencers is just about    miles away  Oxford Street  while Harrods and Harvey Nichols would be approximately the same distance     to    miles  but towards a different direction  The Original Sightseeing Tour buss has a stop across the street so this added to the convenience of this hotel s location  Numerous restaurants are within walking distance  The room and toilet were quite small but they were very clean  Other than the room size  there is really nothing to complain about  Another plus was that the internet was free  
P =>  Great hotel Stayed for the weekend Staff very friendly and helpful The room was spacious and very comfortable and recently refurbished The hotel location is great for getting around west london Would definately stay again  
P =>   Fabulously splendid luxury girly retreat Having frequented the Athenaeum for a variety of occassions previously  I booked the Athenaeum expecting the warmth  generosity of staff and relaxed luxury that I have come to expect from this establishment  However I did know that the hotel has been slowly refurbishing over the past year and so hoped that the magical qualities that had  prescribed its quiet charm had not been disrupted  We were not disappointed  On entering the hotel for check in we were told that there would be a short ten minute wait for our room and were shown into the beautifully appointed hotel bar where we were served complimentary mango sorbet chocolate cones whilst we waited  It is hidden touches such as these that just serve to create the delightful ambience where you are consistantly surprised and provoke some very precious memories  After being shown up to our room by the receptionist we set our eyes on a fabulously quirky design that consisted of all the most dapper of British qualities  humour  eccentricity  glamour and complete style  an elegant setting for an elegant trip  Throughout our stay we could not have felt more welcomed by the staff who really do act as though they are just there to create every detail for your utter ease and also enjoyed some superb cocktails and wine in the beautiful bar  A higly recommended place to stay  thank you so much the Athenaeum  
P =>   Wonderful Service and Perfect Location We stayed four nights in a  BR  BA apt  actually two one bedroom apartments opened up to connect   We had terrific service the entire time from all of the staff   desk  door  bell  concierge  even when my temper flared over the DVD and airconditioning  This was clearly   star service  Any time we asked for ice  or anything  someone arrived very promptly  Ditto previous poster regarding location   could not be better  I would also mention that the Shepherd s Square area of fair is a three minute walk from the apartments and is a great place to grab a late breakfast or visit a pub  The rooms were nicely furnished and housekeeping was very good  Our apartment could have used a little fresh paint and carpet  and a microwave  Also  one side of our apartment had a strangely controlled air conditioning unit and I had to call for help with it  Later  I discovered a laminated card in the drawer of one of the tables that explained its use  I m sure a previous occupant had put the card in a drawer  However  it was really handy to have the small washer dryer unit in the kitchen  and the concierge had placed an XBOX in the unit for my son  We had plenty of space to spread out  The apartment felt like a home away from home  We had one breakfast in the hotel and it was fabulous  and quite expensive  The restaurant was very stylishly decorated and appeared to be very popular I would definitely return and recommend it to anyone looking for an apartment  but also with the service of a fine hotel  
P =>   Yet another enjoyable experience at the wonderful Athenaeum I first had the pleasure of staying at the Athenaeum approx   years ago  and having stayed in numerous other establishments over the years I have found nowhere that comes close  From the moment you approach the main doors  either John or Jim are there to welcome you  in a manner that goes beyond simple politeness  the welcome feels as genuine as it possibly could be  Reception staff have at all times been polite  friendly and efficient  The rooms are always well presented and the recent refurbishment is testimony to the owners determination to keep this hotel at the top of its game  Unlike many hotels who let their rooms become worn and tired to the point that they almost scream  quot refurb quot  at you as you enter   I ve yet to see a room that I would have considered in need of any works whatsoever  hence my suprise that works were being carried out throughout the establishment  My only gripe in the older rooms was the size of the bath  that now seems to be remedied and certainly feels more comfortable   not sure where the extra space has been stolen from though  The park view rooms feature floor to ceiling opening doors with views of    and from higher floors   over  Green Park and Piccadilly  Complementary soft drinks  mini bar snacks  tea  coffee and hot chocolate add to the experience  that whilst representing no  quot great quot  cost for any hotel  its just something that you don t normally see provided    but do normally pay unreasonable charges for  Well done Athenaeum management for that little touch The Whisky Bar has a warm and friendly ambience and is very welcoming after a late night  Its the only bar that I have seen the Arran Malt on sale  and as I refuse to open my own bottle of Founders Reserve for sentimental reasons  I get to sample it at the Athenaeum  Again  service is always polite and friendly If I had to look for any faults  perhaps a cd player in the room  a tv with a sleep timer  less complex lighting  feels good once its sussed out  and the return of the Neutrogena Rainbath shower gel    but all very minor and really wouldn t stop me from recommending it to anyone    OH and there s always an adequate number of coat hangers and a working iron and often a copy of Time Out or a Whats On magazine in the rooms  Externally the addition of the living wall is something to behold and sets the Athenaeum apart as host to the first such wall in London All great stuff and looking forward to the next visit Glenn  
P =>  THE ATHENAEUM Amazing London Apartment hotel  We have just returned from a wonderful family trip to London  Spain  France and Italy  I will write reviews for all of our  quot finds quot   For the London portion of our trip  we stayed at The Athenaeum Hotel and Apartments  We are a family of five  three teens  along with my mother who met us in London for five days  LOCATION Unbelievably perfect   located just down the street from The Ritz on Piccadilly  Cross the street from the hotel and you are in Green Park  we enjoyed a picnic dinner in the park on our last night   Walk thru the park and you are standing right in front of Buckingham Palace  Cross the street  from the hotel  and walk less than a block and you are at Green Park Tube station  Look out one of your windows and see a picture perfect London street with a little church at the end  APPEARANCE gorgeous  elegant Manhattan style apartment building  they also have a hotel at the front of the building   Beautiful flower boxes welcome you as you enter the oversized shiny black front door and foyer with an inlaid tile floor  The high ceilinged rooms that house the living room  w a fireplace surrounded by an elegant mantel   it was well into the    s  so it was not used   bedroom  eating room  and bathrooms are traditionally decorated with gorgeous damask fabric curtains  The kitchen allowed us to shop at k and Spencer  great London grocery store about a block away  and prepare breakfasts and sometimes dinner on our own schedule  The washing machine came in handy as well  THE STAFF  they became dear family friends to our family  Serena  John  il  Emma  and Tom  and every other employee I may be forgetting  were the sweetest  most helpful people while we stayed in London  Our oldest celebrated his birthday while we were in London and Serena helped make it a special day for him  The Hard Rock Cafe is just down the street as well  Our kids are in love with London and look forward to returning   be it for pleasure  study or living   All of us were a bit sad to leave our home away from home on our last day  I truly believe our children s love for London comes in part from their stay at the Athenaeum  
P =>  Great location  friendly  We stayed for   nights in a   bedroom apartment  The service was wonderful   warm and helpful from the moment we walked into the lobby  Compared to the light filled hotel rooms  which face Green Park  the apartments are a little dark as they face a narrow streetfront  However  they were very comfortable and spacious  and it was a lovely touch that there were books and toys for our young child in the apartment upon our arrival  The kitchenette was adequate for a few days  stay However  it could really do with a microwave  especially for families with young children who need to warm up milk several times a day and don t want to be standing over a stove  I learned later that the Athenaeum has a sister property of serviced apartments at    Greengarden House near Oxford Street which looks better equipped for longer stays  so I may well check that out next time  The location of the Athenaeum is pretty unbeatable though   walking distance to pretty much everywhere one would want to visit in central London  assuming the weather cooperates  
P =>   Great people in a nice location We rented a   bedroom apartment within    hours notice  Quite spacious apartments in the heart of London in fair   just a   minute walk from Green Park tube station  Diana and Serena in guest relations are simply superb After having traveled for nearly    days in Europe over three trips  I have now a fairly decent sense of hotels and so even though I really like this hotel  I am rating it the way it is   my overall impression is favorable but specifics of the hotel left me wanting a bit  The wifi here also has some issues   serviced by a company called WiFiSpark   I sent them an email with issues  does not work on iphone and does not support facebook  and it took them only   days to write back to me The price is high and perhaps the value is low  We decided to stay at the     Bishopsgate for the second half of our trip   I will post a review when the trip ends  
P =>   Fantastic Hotel I loved every minute of my stay The Athenaeum is one of the best hotels I have ever had the pleasure of staying in  We were staying in a suite on the  th floor  overlooking Green Park and it was simply divine  Our suite had everything ready and in perfect working order to make our stay comfortable and the staff were very efficient and helpful  going out of their way to make sure we were happy and well looked after  The bed was luxuriously comfortable  with soft  freshly washed linen and our suite also featured a walk in double shower in the bathroom  including a bath with a huge mirrored wall  which gave a sense of spaciousness  All the rooms in the suite were very large in comparrison to other London hotels and this made us feel very at home and comfortable during our stay The room service is very quick and efficient and the food is delicious  After returning from a show rather late at night I was incredibly hungry so ordered up some food  it arrived to my room promptly and the dining staff were very helpful and professional  I would definitely stay at The Athenaeum again and am also considering booking my parents a weekend stay for their anniversary  A delightful hotel that is both exceedingly beautiful and up market  but also comfortable and homely  a real gem    
P =>   Welcome home  Welcome home  That s the Athenaeum s motto when you walk in the door  And  boy  do they life up to that statement  This really does become your HOME while in London  I struck up conversations with most of the doormen  who were all top notch  They would see me walking from a far and wave  There was also EXCELLENT service everywhere else as well  The front desk man who checked me in and escorted me to my room would see me occasionally during my stay and approach me  call me by name  and ask me if everything was OK   Do you need anything   And the politeness and courtesy never seemed forced or pressured  It seemed like they really  genuinely cared about my needs and my experience at their hotel  The room was large and very comfy  And the soft drinks  water  and snacks in the mini bar were all complementary something I have NEVER  EVER seen in London before  Would I say here again  In a heartbeat  Welcome home is right  
P =>   Wonderful Experience My husband had business in London and naturally I came along  It s the  rd time we have stayed here and it was the best  The rooms are large and well appointed  The service is amazing and the hotel is sparkling clean  Everyone is cordial and beyond helpful  I want to give a shout out to Jim and John at the door  John behind the front desk  Darren and Duncan were great as concierges and the siblings from Brazil in the dining room for breakfast each moring made my meal extremely enjoyable  What can I say  I can t wait to come back  I adore London and staying at the Atheneum is one of the reasons  
P =>  Beautiful friendly and individual facilities and service   highly recommend I booked the Athenaeum as a Last Minute top secret hotel  I wanted to try something different   so I literelly didn t know what to expect  I was so  so pleasantly surprised  The location is central and convenient for pretty much anything in central London  But the facilities and staff themselves are what make the place so fantastic  My room was so well decorated that I m actually considering stealing some of their ideas  When I checked in  they informed me that all the soft drinks and snacks in the mini bar were complimentary  and they really didn t charge me for them    and their whisky selection and the bar is really amazing  the choice and service all round is great   I didn t get to use their spa sauna steam room facilities  but extrapolating judgement from other areas I d expect them to be great  The best part was  I booked the hotel for my husband s birthday  and looked totally awesome for doing so  I definitely plan to go back again  
P =>   The best place I ve ever stayed  Like many reviewers I booked this as a top secret hotel on last minute com we stayed the weekend of my boyfriends birthday  We didn t get any birthday cards or uogrades  but even without either of these it was still an amazing hotel  I ve never stayed in a hotel where the receptionist leads you to your room  so that felt a nice touch The room was huge and well maintained  There are only two things I could complain about  if nit picking  one was that the central controls for the room were too easy to turn off all the lights  The other was the lemony fragrance pumped through the air con day and night which i could almost taste in the morning  Aside from this the stay was amazing and I d definitely go back  if I could get the same price again  however it seems to be a lot more now than when I stayed so it doesn t look likely to happen soon   
P =>   top hotel me and my wife booked it for our birthday what can i say top staff great room clean stylish  location is perfect we loved it and would be there again very soon i recomend this place to all 
P =>   Awful service     I had the most awful experience I ve ever had at any hotel I ve stayed at during my stay at the Athenaeum Hotel in ch  I found many of the concierge to be unfriendly and the service to be of a consistently low standard  especially reservationist Myriam who was pretty unpleasant and unhappy when I was asking questions and an indian guy showing no respect for other people  How Awful   Moreover  I did my drycleaning there and had to return a pair of pants three times  and another shirt twice  before stains were removed that I had pointed out each time  Room are very tiny This was a disappointing stay and I wouldn t recommend it to anyone  
P =>   Very very nice indeed  Not really sure why some people are not happy with this place as the rooms and public areas are the cleanest of any hotel I have ever stayed at in London and I ve stayed in many  Yes the breakfast is not cheap at         most rates include it anyway  and the minibar is way overpriced  there s a minimarket on the adjacent street just a minutes walk away   but everyhting else was absolutely top notch and the staff are just so  so friendly  Overall a great clean bill of health  
P =>   good location smart hotel attentive staff Arrived and made welcome quick check in and room good  breakfast expensive as were bar drinks  
P =>  Good location great staff Really enjoyed our recent stay at this hotel  The standard rooms are as small as one would expect for a city central hotel room  but the staff were so welcoming and helpful that I would recommend this hotel to anyone  Makes a world of difference when you get a sense of genuine hospitality  
P =>   Great hotel and great location  I stayed here for a night whilst catching up with friends in London  Booked through a well known late availability site and was very impressed with the hotel  I usually stay at the Cavendish on Jermyn St but decided to try the Athenaeum because my parents had stayed here and said it was nice  On arrival I was greeted by a very friendly and polite doorman and then an equally friendly and polite chap on reception  I think his name was Jonathan   He could not have been more helpful and also told me that I had been given an upgraded room  room     if anyone s interested    The room was fantastic   I had a view across Green Park   and was spacious and spotlessly clean  Nicely furnished and even had a very swanky coffee machine  CD player and a minibar with complimentary chocolate  nuts  crisps and soft drinks which was a nice touch  I m guessing this would be an Executive Room and they just upgraded me because they had the availability to do so   it was nice that they did  The bathroom was very nice with a powerful shower and plenty of fluffy towels  The location is perfect   just a short walk from Green Park tube and close to Buckingham Palace  Fortnum  amp  Mason and a wealth of shops on Piccadilly and Regent St  Also just a       minute walk from Leicester Square  There are also lots of great restaurants nearby including the very nice Shepherd ket area just a few steps away  I would emphasise that I was lucky enough given an upgraded room whilst when my parents were staying they had a standard room   however they had absolutely no complaints with it at all  I don t think they had a park view but other than that they were very happy with it  I found all the staff to be really friendly and helpful and there definitely was no  quot big hotel quot  indifference  They really seem to care about making sure guests have a nice stay  For the quality of accomodation and price paid I felt that the Athenaeum was extremely good value and I would definitely recommend it and stay there again  
P =>   Incredible staff wonderful Hotel My husband  amp  I just had a lovely   th Wedding Anniversary Weekend at The Athenaeum Hotel  the staff were the so friendly  amp  helpful  Special thanks to Diane who organized for our room to be upgraded  We will be returning very soon  thank you so much for making it so special  
P =>   Hypnos Beds Fantastic Breakfasts and Super Friendly staff This is our fifth visit to the Athenaeum in the last three years  The hotel is currently shrouded in scafflding while exterior work is being done  Finished soon  Usually a bad sign  Not here  We were shown to our room by a bubbly front desk girl who clearly loved her job  The room was recently renovated and spotless  They had maintaned the lovely marble bathrooms  but put in new large flat screen tv s After two nights on the luxurious mattress my wife looked to see what kind it wa and voila  a Hypnos bed  This is a bedmaker to the Queen and is particularly good if like me you have allergies to dust mites  At home I wake up every morning feeling stuffed up  here no such problem  Great timing for us as we were considering buying just such a bed  but wanted to be sure it was worth the high price  Now thanks to Athenaeum we can go ahead and purchase in complete confidence  What a fantastic side benefit from returning to this hotel  Breakfasts are served in a modern smart restaurant and is excellent and varied  All staff from front desk  concierge  bellman  and restaurant staff really do seem to love their jobs  We have seen most of them on repeat visits  and I think that too is a good sign I just hope my glowing review does not do too much to make this hotel much more popular  selfish I know   
P =>  Uniquely designed rooms a pleasure  The rooms and public areas of the hotel are fairly plush with well designed and luxurious features  We only stayed one night before flying overseas but we took the opportunity to go out in the west end  It is a fairly easy walk into Piccadilly Circus and Soho  passing St James  Park and Buckingham Palace  opposite the hotel   but there is a bus stop right outside that will take you into the heart of things in less than five minutes should you feel inclined The only down side was that we would have been willing to raid the minibar as we were  ahem  thirsty and definitely starving but the prices were off the wall  Why do hotels have to charge five quid for a kitkat  
P =>  It just gets better This is the second time we have stayed here and it just gets better  Because of the building work we were upgraded to apartment    which was stunning  All the staff are so welcoming and freindly  The whole place has such a lovely feel to it unlike a lot of the other   star hotels in London  We will definately be staying here again  
P =>   Amazing  I stayed at this hotel for my boyfriend s   th birthday and found the hotel staff to be fantastic and the hotel itself wonderful  I had contacted the hotel prior to our visit to pay for a room upgrade and champagne for his birthday  When we arrived the hotel had upgradeed us to an amazing suite and even had a birthday card there waiting for him  The apartment was fantastic and the staff were ever so friendly  I would definitely recommend this hotel as the experience was fantastic  
P =>   Fantastic I have just returned from a weekend break in London for my husbands   th birthday  I had booked the hotel as one of the  last minute com  mystery    hotels as I wanted to be near the west end  Once the hotel was confirmed I sent them an email upgrading from the standard double room to an executive room for an extra cost of      making nightly tariff        On arrival we were informed that they had upgraded us to a one bedroom apartment free of charge  These are situated to the back of the hotel and have there own private entrances  We stayed in apartment     house    and was impressed by the size  cleanliness  and quality of it  Ideal if we had been staying for longer than the one night  but as it happened the facilities were not required for a brief visit  although much appreciated and enjoyed   The hotel had placed a birthday card for my husband in the room  which was a nice personal touch We ate in the hotels restaurant  Damask  and the food was lovely  staff were fantastic  and once again effort was made by the staff to celebrate my husbands birthday by writing happy birthday in chocolate around the dessert plate  thankfully  no candles or singing    The price in the restaurant is very reasonable costing     pp for   course meal and glass of champagne  Only criticism would be limited availability for room service after   pm  mostly sandwiches or few hot food choices   but if you are lucky enough to stay in an apartment you could stock up for any late night snacks  Overall  the staff were very professional and friendly  and the hotel and communal areas were impeccable  Directly opposite the palace and a short walk from west end  Perfect location and I would recommend it to anyone  Don t be put off by the scaffolding at the front of the hotel  during the weekend we didn t see one workman or hear any maintenance  
P =>  Wonderful  We booked the  quot Christmas in London quot  tour from Maupintour and we stayed at this hotel  It was first class all the way   from the bellman to the desk staff  We stayed in the apartments and they were beautifully decorated with antiques as well as contemporary  as in  plasma televisions in both the living room and bedroom   The only complaint we had was the coffee pot and the washer dryer  We couldn t quite figure them out   but then I m sure the staff would ve been more than happy to assist  if we had made use of them The hotel is within walking distance to Buckingham Palace  Picadilly Circus and a short bus ride to Oxford Street  Location is perfect  The restaurant staff was beyond expectations   they addressed us by name each time we saw them  They have had top notch customer service training The food in the restaurant was delicious  we particularly loved the fresh fruit offered at breakfast We would definitely stay here again and would recommend it  if price is not a huge issue  
P =>   Location location location    I had a wonderful   nights here just after Christmas     for a very special occasion  proposed to my now wife   The staff were very professional  Door staff were particularly friendly  The very helpful guy at concierge even managed to get us a last minute table at an apparently very exclusive restaurant after calling pretty much everywhere and he didn t show a hint of disappointment when I suddenly cancelled his efforts at the very last moment as I instead  rather impulsively  opted to pop the big question in the middle of Green Park that night    very romantic place by the way  with Buckingham Palace  The Ritz and even Big Ben all lit up and surrounding the peaceful  old style lampost ridden green expanse The room  park view  overlooking said Green Park  or to be honest  the main road in front of the hotel with reasonable Green Park view beyond    well my room was only on the  rd floor  was on the small side  but I guess that s par for the course in London I remember having to request simple things like shaver and toothbrush which I couldn t believe were not supplied as standard in such a pricey establishment  but the house staff were extremely prompt in meeting my needs  once requested Enjoyed an amazing room service dinner  Highly recommended The restaurant itself was a bit on the  quot cozy quot  side  quite small and intimate   but the food and service were very good Overall  a very pleasant and well run hotel  but it wasn t the exceptional    star luxury that I had imagined  maybe my expectations were unrealistic for a London hotel and I was unfairly measuring my hopes against other hotels I ve stayed at in other countries such as Japan for example  I guess no matter where you choose in London  the majority of your hard earned cash will go on the actual LOCATION of the venue and not the extra fringe benefits associated with other establishments of the same level in other cities  And with that said  I d have to give this place full marks as you really couldn t wish for a better location in London    easy walking distance  for a healthy thirty something anyway  to all the main sites such as Piccadilly Circus  Leicester Square  Buckingham Palace  all the way to Trafalgar Square  Big Ben and the London Eye  we never used any transport other than our feet the whole time there  Probably won t stay there again  but that s no reflection on the hotel  I just want to try one of the other top end hotels in the same area the next time I m in town  which might not be for another few years anyway   This hotel great  The location perfect  
P =>   Absolutely Perfect We booked this through lastminute com as a Top Secret Hotel so were not sure what we would get  To say that we were pleasantly surprised is an understatement  It was fabulous  The Athenaeum has a boutique feel to it and the room was perfect  It is apparently being updated but we neither saw nor heard any sign of this and apart from the odd stain on the carpet I would not have noticed that it was in need of updating  We arrived early at       am and expected to just leave our bags until we could check in but they changed our room so that we could check in straight away which was wonderful  The only down side is that we were only there one night so didn t have the chance to fully appreciate it  The location is wonderful and despite being on Piccadilly we could hear no traffic noise from our room at the back of the hotel  All of the staff we met were very friendly and helpful  Would definitely stay there again  
P =>   What a Wonderful Hotel  The Boyfriend and I headed for the bright city lights of London once again to celebrate his entry into middle age  I keep telling him    is the old    but will he listen      Anyway  dear reader I digress I booked The Athenaeum Hotel via Last Minute as one of their Secret Hotels and paid the princely sum of      of your Earth Pounds for two nights room only I rang the hotel during the week to say it was The Boyfriends Birthday if they were able to do anything speacial  not having any expectations at all On arrival  we were made so welcome by the delightful Alexis  The car was whisked away by John the doorman to be secreted away until we next required it We had been given an upgrade and then to our delight we found we had been given a suite overlooking the park with a bottle of wine awaiting our arrival  Alexis showed us the room and we really felt very special The room was lovely  a bedroom  bathroom and sitting room  all in immaculate order and clean and comfortable  We were amazed to hear that they are in the process of renovation  as it certainly didnt feel tired or look worn I would definately recommend this hotel for its location  Buckingham Palace is across the park  and Picadilly just a short walk along the road In summary  if I had the choice of The Sanderson  see review under The Peke  or The Athenaeum  for location and value for money  this one wins hands down Thanks to all that looked after us The Peke and The Boyfriend  who thought it was  rather marvellous    
P =>   Lovely Boutique Hotel in Great Location My family    adults and   kids  and I have just returned from staying at this beautiful boutique hotel  On arrival  we were immediately greeted by Jim  Doorman  who asked for all our names and remembered them during our stay  I would have to say that it was the best welcome we ve ever received and our kids loved it  He was also very helpful and gave us some good advice  I loved the decor and thought the lounge was extremely beautiful  The bedrooms are a good size although I feel that they are in need of redecorating  The location is excellent  We had no problem with road noise and we would stay there again  We found the staff very pleasant but special mention goes to Jim  
P =>  Wonderful Hotel and Staff Got a room as part of a theatre package and was stunned at both the quality of the hotel and staff One of the best hotels I have ever stayed at  
P => Superb location One of the best locations in London  the park across the road  a stroll to Piccadilly and St James  Great restaurants nearby  try the fashionable Wolseley   Fortnum  amp  Mason  bookshops and art galleries  We had an apartment on the side road of the hotel  which was extremely comfortable  Would be very happy to stay there again  
P =>  Pleasant surprise  My patrner and I got a good deal on this hotel  we weren t expecting the best  and from the outside initially still had reservations  All was dismissed as soon as we walked in and experienced a very cute boutique hotel  The staff and the interior were fabulous and we truely recommend  
P =>   Great breakfast staff very helpful and friendly  I have stayed here on a number of occasions over the past couple of years and have enjoyed every visit  The location is excellent  with all the main shopping areas within walking distance and lots of restaurants cafes on the doorstep  I have stayed in all their different grades of room and the only difference between them  in my opinion  is the size  as the facilities were excellent in all  my only complaint being a slightly short bed in the suite   The decor of the rooms  although a bit dated in places  is well maintained with individual touches everywhere  The breakfast is particularly good  try the creme brulee   odd for breakfast but it is truly delicious   The health spa  although small  is very clean and well run  with an excellent choice of treatments  I would thoroughly recommend this hotel for a business or leisure stay  
P =>   Surprisingly good We stayed for   nights in this hotel  chosen mainly for its extremely good location  However it proved to be surprisingly good  The rooms were very clean with lovely linen  but the best bit was the standard of the staff  Every single person was helpful and went out of their way to help  Well done you lot  You managed to turn what might have been a stay of convenience into a nice mini break  I think we will do it again  
P =>   Very Special Vacation We recently stayed in the Athenaeum Hotel Apartments  We had friends in London and wanted a place where everyone could come by and visit  We found the apartments online with a sitting area  a small well equipted kitchen  and a lovely balcony  We needed   rooms and were able to get one that connected and opened in between  which gave us   living rooms along with   kitchens  We could not believe how gorgeous and inviting the rooms were  We really hated to leave the room at all  They had also stocked the fridge with breakfast items and such at our request  We had been traveling the week before and were able to do some laundry in the machines provided in our rooms  BIG PLUS   I had contacted the hotel ahead to ask about special arrangements as we were celebrating a college graduation    th birthday  and wedding anniversary  They told me not to worry and that they would take care of it  Wow were we suprised at how they remembered each and every detail and arranged a special treat for each occasion at their expense   Flowers  Champagne Chocolates and Strawberries Cakes and Cheese Trays   We have stayed in some of the best hotels in the world and have never had such royal treatment  Any time we called down for anything they were knocking at the door before we could hang up the phone  I m sure there are many fine hotels in London  but when we return in the future there will be only one place for us and that s the ATHENAEUM HOTEL  The Doormen even remembered our name after only one day  Thank you for making our vacation PERFECT    P S  The afternoon tea is also something not to miss  
P =>   Awful experience at the Athenaeum I had the most awful experience I ve ever had at any hotel I ve stayed at during my stay at the Athenaeum Hotel in ch il this year   the night before I left  I found a rat in my room  When I called the front desk  they didn t even sound genuinely apologetic and I was moved to another room for my last night  Even before this incident  though  I had already decided I would never stay at the hotel again because in the few weeks that I was staying there  I found many of the concierge to be unfriendly and the service to be of a consistently low standard  especially for the room rates charged  I did my drycleaning there and had to return a pair of pants three times  and another shirt twice  before stains were removed that I had pointed out each time  Further  the rooms are tiny  The best part about the hotel is the gym  it s small  but great new equipment  The location is also fantastic especially if you can get a room with a view over Green Park  but for the price you ll be paying  I d definitely recommend staying at the Intercontintental or the Radisson fair This was a disappointing stay and I wouldn t recommend it to anyone  
P =>   Great hotel in central london Stayed at the Athenaeum Hotel in London for two nights in mid   Found a fantastic deal on the room  single room  on Skoosh com Paid     dollars for two nights including continental breakfast  Room was lovely  a double bed  clean and bright bath  Staff was amazing  From the first greeting by  quot big Jim quot  the derby hatted doorman  to reception  to everyone on the wait staff they could not have been nicer  Was traveling alone and they made me feel very comfortable  Had high tea and Sunday dinner and the food was excellent  continental breakfast included in the room rate was large and lovely  every kind of pastry  fruit  fresh yogurt  and cereals  The location of this hotel is excellent  on Piccadilly directly across from Green Park  Finally  the spa in the basement level is small but great  a steam room  a sauna  and a lovely jacuzzi  perfect for a soak before bed after a day of walking  Hope to return often  
P =>   Great experience   recommended Chose this hotel through last minute s secret selection and was really pleased as it was for a birthday treat On arrival we were upgraded to a penthouse room on the   th floor with stunning views over green park and the London panorama  The room was warm  welcoming and comfortable with room to relax and rest  Whilst it is not as pristene or contemporary as some of it s competitors this only adds to its quirkiness and charm All the staff were helpful and charming from the doorman  to the reception staff and in house dining team  The whisky bar is to be recommended and although we did not partake the afternoon tea looked fab All in all a great bijoux boutique hotel with a little soul We would certainly return for another stay  
P =>   great room   poor special dietary requirements My husband booked this for my birthday I really liked the hotel  our executive room was spacious   the reception staff and door man were very helpful  The only fault I have is that although the resturant menu states if you have a special dietary requirment advise them and they can help   they couldn t     when I explained my condition of Coeliac disease and what could they provide for breakfast the response from the evening staff   which was positive  to the breakfast stafff totally changed and they were unable to help at all with my gluten   wheat free diet and therefore I paid     for coffee  o juice  yoghurt and some fresh fruit   and left feeling hungry  
P =>   Incredible Value  We recently stayed at the Athenaeum and couldn t have been happier  I chose this hotel based upon the reviews I read on this website and booked it thru lastminute com using the  quot secret hotels quot  feature  I had a pretty good idea what hotel I was getting  I couldn t believe what a deal it was  particularly given the exchange rate  It is in a great location across from Green Park  From the time we checked in until the time we left  the service was excellent  The rooms were nice  comfortable  and quiet  The beds were comfortably appointed with Frette linens  The bathrooms were all marble and spotless  We did not eat there or use the spa so I can t comment on those  We will definitely stay there again  
P =>   Lovely Hotel We stayed for three nights and had a pleasant time  The hotel dining room is a little overpriced  but the rooms were very clean and nicely appointed  It is conveniently located to take long walks in the beautiful parks and to pick up the tour bus  The door man is quite a delight  
P =>   Disappointing  My husband and I recently stayed at the Athenaeum Hotel for two nights for an Easter break  My overall impression of the hotel is that it is really not of a five star standard  The lobby is very small and we were surprised to note that there is no permanent wheelchair access from the street to the lobby and instead a ramp is put in place where necessary  A simple remodelling of the steps would take care of this The room itself was a good enough size for central London and we requested a view of Green Park which was lovely  The decor however was very dated  We appreciate that some tourists enjoy an  quot olde worlde quot  room however the furniture instead of looking antique  actually looked shabby and the curtains and throw on the bed were very worn The bathroom did not have a separate shower and instead the shower was above the bath  In our opinion that is not what one would expect of a five star establishment  On our last morning in the room the television stopped working  We booked our room through a website and our receipt stated that the rate paid was for  quot Bed and Breakfast quot   We therefore ate a cooked breakfast in the dining room both mornings  On checking out we were presented with a bill  When we queried this bill we were told it was for our breakfast  We pointed out that we paid for bed and breakfast and we were told that it is continental breakfast only that is included  The girl at reception produced a computer printout from the hotel stating that it was continental breakfast and we produced our receipt  which we thankfully had brought with us  and pointed out to her that nowhere did it state that only continental breakfast was included and also pointed out that no one either at check in or at breakfast had told us that only continental breakfast was included in our room rate  After much haggling the Manager at reception told the girl to remove the charge for the breakfast from our bill  Clearly this is something that the hotel should clear up with the agents selling their rooms  In summary we would not stay at this hotel again and nor would we recommend it to others  We have stayed in the Cumberland Hotel in ble Arch previously  which was less expensive and far superior  
P =>   Poor Service   Phone Charges Stayed four days for a business trip   ended on a low note with their surprising phone charges Before placing calls to the U S  from the hotel  I called the hotel operator and told them I was using a       card and what would be the charge  They replied back      pounds per call connection with no mention of a charge per minute  in actuality it was   pounds per connection since they had recently done some kind of in house upgrade   Later that night I check my in room TV and the bill was not available  The recording made no mention of the charge per minute  When I checked out  I recieved a shocking bill of over     pounds for less than     minutes of calls  The on site manager even argued that it had been a problem in the past  yet nothing had been done to correct these problems   I did not have all day to fight the charges since I was catching a flight out  so I was able to get     of the bill taken off still reflecting   pounds per minute  Many hotels only pay     pence per minute that would give them    x profit at   pence per minute for the  quot operating overhead  quot  I gave them notice that I was not satisfied and they would be taking it up later  After multiple letters  the hotel refuses to change their stance  All I can say is  quot buyer beware  quot  Based on my calculation     pounds for a five minute call to New York   the Athenaeum would be the top of the list of shame on charges from London hotel for outgoing calls  The article can be found at  travel timesonline co uk tol life and style travel essentials article        ece 
P =>   Loved My husband and   small children stayed here and loved it   It is an excellent way to enjoy London with Apartment living with hotel amenities  The service was outstanding and I would recommend this hotel for families  My husband and I plus kids have travelled to London on several occassions and have found this hotel to be the best  
P =>   If you need an incentive to start jogging        A wonderful stay in this hotel  Beautiful park views and a rare glimpse of some warm sunshine made our trip outstanding  All the staff were friendly and helpful  especially the doormen who have to be amongst the best in london  Joggers  you re in for a treat  Towels and water are considerately placed by the hotel exit to make your run a bit more special  Almost made me want to start exercising Good bedrooms although i never worked out how the cd players worked  Beautiful decor too  I have a phobia of lifts so always find myself wandering around the hotel stairs at odd hours  often a miserable experience as regular readers of my reviews will know  This hotel gets a    from me   even their fire exits are beautiful and well kept  Can t wait to return  
P =>   Great location Good Location close to lovely restaurants in fair  Booked standard room through Lastminute com and were upgraded to a lovely room overlooking Green Park  The Doorman was delightful and the ladies on reception could learn from his friendly and warm disposition  Didn t use the restaurant as it looked very bright but seemed very popular  The whiskey bar was nice but pricey  we didn t bother with breakfast as there were lots of coffee places close by  Bus stop directly outside and always lots of taxis in that location  Was a very pleasant hotel  didn t blow me away but for the same sort of cost would stay again  Bed was very comfortable with great pillows which is so important  
P =>   Perfect By London Standards This is a real nice little hotel  by London standards   Obviously room was on the smallish size  but that s par for the course so I didn t mark them down on that Reception and check in was flawless  Room was pricey  but I only booked it on the night before  so that s my problem   so expect to get it at a reasonable rate  I paid      for   night Room was clean  everything worked  It was really comfortable  No complaints on the bathroom either  great shower  Bed was very comfy  Staff were great  I managed to get a late checkout  with no problem at all Location is nice  but very posh  
P =>   Excellent value central London Friendly hotel Stayed for one night this weekend and I was very impressed by the friendly staff  great room and excellent location  I would recommend this hotel for anyone looking for       in central London and not wanting to pay silly money  We booked on lastminute com and got a standard double for       we were assigned an executive double on arrival which was slightly bigger   The bed was very comfortable with very nice linens and the bathroom was small but classy  The spa is small but clean and nice and the bar cosy  We did not eat at the hotel so can t comment on the food  Very handy for Green Park tube  with its M amp S food store if you don t want to pay mini bar prices  I will definitely stay again if available at this price  
P =>   Great value loved it  Stayed here for two nights with my girlfriend in uary and it was PERFECT  The staff were fantastic  friendly and helpful  We booked on lastminute com as part of the Top Secret Hotels deal  with a bit of detective work you can figure out which one is the Athenaeum by Googling parts of the description   It was      per night for their normal class of room   spacious room  big comfortable bed  nice seating area with view of the park  large bathroom with tub and a great shower  Everything was right  from the quality toiletries to the super soft robes and the big Bose television  They have a great    hour bar lounge  perfect for midnight snacking after a night out on the town  Location was fantastic  only    minutes walk from Leicester Square  or   minutes to Green Park tube  If you can get a good deal online for this hotel then pelase stay here  you ll love it  This was absolutely a five star experience If you are going to see a concert at the O  Arena  Millenium Dome  it may look like this hotel is far away  but really its only    minutes on the Jubilee Line between the O  and Green Park  so do consider this hotel  
P =>   A real Find   We stayed for   night this past weekend  We managed to get a fantastic rate and they kindly upgraded us to an Apartment  It was nicely decorated in traditional English style  It was large and clean  There was a plasma TV in the living room and a TV in the bedroom  The staff were super friendly and kind  The place is really well done up  Seems to have had a refurb recently  It is ideally located as you may have read  Next time we hope to have a room with a view and stay in the hotel bit  This is trully a   star hotel with a terrific staff  Both my wife and I really enjoyed our stay  If you can get a good rate  I would highly recommend the hotel  We booked through Lastminute  
P =>  Athenaeum is Awesome  My wife and I spent a week at the Athanaeum  and we couldn t have enjoyed it more  We were greeted with a smile by Bill  the quintessential British doorman  who welcomed us as though we were returning regulars  though it was our first stay     our room was splendid  featuring a spectacular view of Green Park s fall foliage     the concierge got us tickets for the sold out  quot Buddy Holly  The Musical quot  in the West End     the Athenaeum is centrally located  only a short walk to Piccadilly Circus  Hyde Park  Buckingham Palace     the hotel restaurant  Damask  rates four stars     they offer a sumptuous breakfast buffet  and a great menu for dinner     hotel staff is friendly and gracious  and works hard to ensure a perfect stay  We can t wait to return to London for another week at the Athenaeum  
P =>   Awesome hotel with the best staff  My best friend and I recently stayed   this hotel for    days and had the best experience ever  The staff especially Alfred and Dan who are so helpful and friendly  The room service is available at any hour of the day and as we found out late nite   am  This is not party central but they r not so uptight that your stay becomes hum drum and boring all the great things you want in a four or five star space without the attitude  A   min walk across the park and your at the gates of Buckingham Palace  Hermes burberry stella etc are   min away  We have stayed at a couple trendy boutique hotels and this is one of the best so far   we will definately b staying here again and hopefully getting an apt next visit  Btw room     has an amazing view overlooking the park  
P =>   Wow what a gem  For the second time in my life I booked a hotel on Priceline by bidding  bid for     hotel   central London   and I am so happy that I did  because we got the best hotel I have ever stayed in in London  When we arrived rather late on a Friday evening we were greeted by very friendly and helpful staff and when the room we were given did not meet our wishes  it was a smoking room with double bed  we were instead given a very nice and roomy apartment   for the entire stay  Simply wonderful  We had dinner at the hotel restaurant as we arrived late   and to our pleasant surprise it was an excellent meal and very fairly priced   two courses were just      the same as the breakfast buffet  We wanted a   star hotel in the middle of London and that is exactly what we got  My mother and I were on a girls trip to London and wanted to be near all the great shopping that London has to offer  and were very pleased with the location of the hotel  It is situated within walking distance from Oxford street  Bond Street  new and old   Regent street and Knightsbridge with Harvey Nichols and Harrods and Sloan street  Of course we got a great deal on Priceline  but I would definitively be willing to pay the full price the next time I go to London  
P =>   Comfortable apartment with hotel amenieties We booked a one bedroom apartment  with the classic interior  The price is quite high compared to other apartments but we received the equivelant of a   star hotel service The bedroom is comfortable  looking onto a quiet street  we could open the windows  a plus The bathroom was quite small  but fine The lounge was comfortable with a dining alchove and a small kitchenette  Soft drinks were complimentary and we were made to feel very welcome Being part of the hotel we were able to use the hotel facilities such as dining rooms and lounges  They have a very large lounge which was great for meetings and the service was very good The location is excellent in central London  we enjoy walking and nowhere was too far We would probably stay there again  
P =>   Nice place Friendly staff  great location right on the park  and clean  comfortable rooms  Bathrooms efficient  great showers  but a bit small  or a bit too traditional for my tatste though  
P =>   Fantastic experience I had not been in London for a while  but remembered the city from its overpriced dingy hotels and ridiculous pricelevel  I travel quite a bit so I am not easily impressed  or chocked for that matter  by a new hotel experience  But can I just say  the Athenaeum did just that  What an amazing stay  I was there just for one  weekend   night  London was at its best  sunny and warm for ober  perfect for going out you would say  Well  I just did not want to leave the room  I spend afternoon  evening  night and most of the morning until check out in the room  Anyone who complains about the design of the hotel after its obvious refurbishment should have a second look  The lobby is just spectacular in design and detail  I was met by extremely efficient and super friendly check in staff  This person walked me to the room which was one the apartments that are part of the hotel  Mine was in the second or third building on the  th flloor    apartments in each house I assume   These houses have been restored with the most incredible eye for detail  Spectacular finishing  and modern and edgy design is just everywhere  I loved it The apartment was just breathtaking  orated in what I would describe a very very New York type of atmosphere  Dark  glamorous and just incredibly comfortable  Very high beautiful ceilings  I love hotels that have thought of every detail  Well this is one  Anything you would could think of is anticipated here  This apartment had a livingroom  open pantry  hallway  bedroom and nice basic bathroom  All the amenities you want and more than that  With M amp S deli foodmarket around the corner  I am talking gourmet food here   it was just heaven to drink champagne and eat lobster and just hang out in the apartment  The Athenaeum gave new meaning to the word romance for me  I had the most romantic stay in a hotel in ages  Who needs London nightlife  theatre  culture    if you have this  well I don t Roomservice breakfast was fantastic and on the dot on time and don t you love there are no extra charges  No Service charge  no delivery charge nothing  I am always so anoyed by the extra s  If I spent       or more on a room I really don t care about paying      for a burger but don t break up the price in all charges  taxes and fees and show me the details when I am hungry and about to enjoy the food drinks you just brought to my room  Guests dont care   At    pounds per person for breakfast I thought this was absolute value for money  With this fantastic apartment I did not see any other part of the hotel so I cant comment on that  It s location is beautiful and convenient  I will be back to this hotel  
P =>   excellent hotel We booked this as part of a theatre break with last minute  We were upgraded to a suite    as promised by last minute  subjest to availability  The suite was very sumptious   red wall paper in the bedroom   antique  furnitire and a very large bathroom with floors and walls covered in marble The room overlooked Green Park which I was glad about having read some of the previous reviews      Breakfast was not included in the deal and at     a head was was very expensive  however  the breakfast was excellent with a good selection of fruit and other things one would not normally associate with breakfast        creme brulee for example   and a full English The TV looked a bit dated and I don t think there were any wi fi facilities but I may be wrong about that The hotel is ideally located for theatre land  just stroll up Picadilly to Picadilly Circus and you are in thetre land  
P =>  Nice hotel great rates This hotel is well located  on Piccadilly  and a few minutes walk from either Piccadilly Circus  Buckingham Palace  through Green Park  or Hyde Park corner  It is surrounded by other four and five star hotels  and has plenty of other eating and drinking establishments near by The hotel itself is a nice  well furnished  well decorated building in the style that you would expect from such an establishment  The staff at the hotel were helpful and friendly throughout  and pleasant to deal with  I overheard some of the staff giving tourist advice to other guests  that was delivered both accurately and with good humour Our room was relatively large and well equipped  and the bed was remarkably comfortable One of the best things about the hotel was the price  It seemed to be the cheapest premium hotel in the area  which made what was already a pleasant stay even better I would certainly recommend this establishment  
P =>  Beautiful hotel Great Service  From the time we arrived by taxi  greeted by the doorman with a smile  and had our bags taken for us  we were treated like royalty  We stayed here for a Romantic weekend through Last minute s secret hotels and got a very good rate  Once we checked in  the receptionist accompanied us to our room and showed us all the amenities available  A very nice touch  The room was plenty big enough with everything you could need  Lots of mirrors make it look spacious  the bed was very comfortable  the shower was very powerful  and we had great views from the top floor of london and green park The gym and spa downstairs is very nicely done  with dressing gowns and towels provided  We did not have breakfast here  but went around to shepherds market where there was a good choice of cafes  The bar is very cosy and intimate  which we loved  the service very attentive and friendly  We had afternoon tea in the garden room  which is beautifully done out with comfy sofas  and the selection of sandwiches and cakes were delicious  It is certainly one of the friendliest hotels I have stayed at  everyone is smiling and want to ensure you have everything you need  When my wife requested foam pillows instead of the feather ones provided at midnight  they were delivered in   minutes  Nothing here is too much trouble  and I would certainly recommend it for a romantic getaway  We had a fabulous meal at Galvin At Windows at the top of the Hilton  just a few minutes walk around the corner  which I would highly recommend also 
P =>   Apartment Living in London My husband     year old son and I stayed here for a week in early y in one of the Athenaeum s apartments  and highly recommend the experience  We had a  quot Classic quot  apartment  meaning traditional formal decor  featuring one bedroom  a large living room with dining el  and a petite but serviceable kitchen complete with oven  microwave  washer dryer and a great espresso machine  It was great to have a washer dryer during a long stay  but it s the combination type of machine that can only handle very small loads and takes several hours to dry the clothes The apartment was in a townhouse on a quiet residential street around the corner from the hotel s main entrance  At the end of the street is a terrific tapas restaurant   quot El Pirate quot   try it    and across the street is a small convenience store for most food shopping needs  It was a very comfortable way to stay with a family  The only drawback was that the sole bathroom is through the bedroom  so that impacted everyone s privacy  The hotel has a very nice cocktail lounge area and library off the lobby where good drinks are served  the staff is very pleasant and helpful  and the location  across from Green Park  is lovely  It s about a four block walk to the nearest tube station  and the neighborhood has lots of great pubs and restaurants  There were a few slips in the service  and the fuses in parts of the apartment blew out a couple of times during our stay  but nothing was seriously wrong  On the whole  this is a great way to stay in London  
P =>   Clean rooms  good staff  hard beds We stayed here for two nights  The service was super  my only problem was that the bed was  very  hard and that we had a few problems with the light switches  which never worked quite the way one would have expected Everything was very clean  and overall I feel that it is good value for money I would like to add that we stayed there in winter  and the heating was more than adequate  
P =>  It s OK   but    If you like really hard beds  this is the place for you  I complained and the manager went out and got us a nice foam pad  which was really nice of them  But no one that I know wants the slab bed anymore    And despite the much advertised remodel  this place needs another remodel  We stayed in the  classic  style apartment  with pretty dinged up furniture  the same old tiny bathrooms and very little storage space  All the electrical outlets are on the floorboards   you should have seen my wife trying to dry her hair  Electricity outlets don t always work and you need a PH D to turn the lights and other switches on and off  I will say that the staff is great  and this place does have a great location  The owners of the hotel ought to give the staff a better product to work with  
P =>   Nice Hotel Good location The hotel is well located at the one end of piccadilly road  Within easy walking distance of piccadilly circus  oxford st  regent street shopping  theatre district  across the park from Buckingham palace and a short taxi ride to knightbridge  amp  Harrods  The hotel is relatively small but very nice and on the main road  we booked on Londontown com   just my wife and myself  It was expensive but it is all relative and given the location and the hotel standard  I was happy  We had a standard double room  The room was not particularly big  probably true of most of the hotels in London anyway  but was still reasonable sized  good beds and the bathroom was very nice with bath and strong shower  and most importantly very clean and well kept  otel and the visit  Really enjoyed the hThe staff are very couteous and helpful and friendly  We did not eat in the hotel  Try the local restaurants around the corner in  Shepards ket   some very nice restaurants and breakfast available  I would also recommend the Wolsley restaurant down the road beside the Ritz hotel for breakfast and lunch  over priced but worth a visit  
P =>   Very nice  Stayed at the Athenaeum for only one night because of business meetings  When arriving late everything went smooth  got my shirts ironed in    minutes  Everything was a smooth and nothing seemed to be a problem The service was excellent  rooms were clean and nice despite the fact I was given a room with a view over the back yard I think it was a good atmosphere in the lobby and the whisky room as well as at breakfast  however the breakfast buffe could have been better Peter Gustafsson 
P =>   smart chic hotel Booked as a top secret hotel through Last minute com Well located smart recpetion  with a boutique feel  Friendly welcome and the rooms are very nice with are the mod cons and personel touches like chilled milk for your tea in the room Great for a couple of nights in London  Would stay here again 
P =>   Brilliant service My husband and i stayed at the Athenaeum for   night  We had booked a standard room  and on arrival asked if there was a possibility of having a room with a view of Green Park  We were told this would cost extra  so we decided to keep the room we d originally booked  However  on showing us to our room the receptionist told us she had upgraded us to a suite on the tenth floor  The room was lovely  spacious  with a large double  comfortable  bed  a large spa bath and most importantly  a great view overlooking Green Park  You can see the London eye clearly too  We did not eat at the hotel so i cannot comment on the standard of food  however we did use the spa steam room  Small  but relaxing all the same  Our only complaint was that the sauna wasn t working  There is a small gym with up to date equipment also In general  we found the hotel to be clean  in good decorative order and in an excellent location  All of the staff were very friendly and we had a wonderful time  We would definitely go back  
P =>   spacious apartments My family and I stayed in the apartments of the hotel  and we were very impressed  The room has a nice kitchenette with stove top  dishwasher and washing machine dryer  The sofa pulls out to a double bed  and the living room is quite large  There is also a   person dinette which was nice for room service breakfast  They can also connect apartments if you have a larger family or need extra space  Rates can be high  but they do offer some good deals and the extra room is well worth it especially with children after a    hour flight   Food and service were also quite good  Food was rather expensive  but the pound vs dollar didn t help  The front desk staff  door staff  and restaurant staff were all very friendly and helpful  Some people have complained about the lounge  but it really is just a place to relax and have a drink  Atmosphere and style are at the surrounding pubs  bars and nightclubs  
P =>   Excellent Stay I would Highly reccommend the Athrnaeum hotel if you would like a nice relaxing stay The hotel is extremley clean  amp  well presented The staff were so friendly  amp  helpfull through out our stay  It is not a cheep hotel but you are treated well for the money you pay Are room was large and well equiped with everything you could need a    minute walk to Oxford street  amp  a   min walk from Green Park station the hotel is ideally located for a romantic weekend or a shopping trip  
P =>  Great  Stayed one night this weekend  Great hotel which has been recently refurbished  The staff are extremely efficient and friendly  Our room was good and very clean although it did not have a great view   we were hoping for a view of Green Park and on reflection I should have requested this when booking One disconcerting thing though   there was a mouse trap in the room  Luckily we didn t find this until the morning otherwise I am sure I would have had a sleepless night  No evidence of a resident mouse were found either though   thank goodness    
P =>   Wonderful experience Just returned from London and the second time that we stayed at The Athenaeum and  once again  we were very pleased Location is wonderful  rooms are comfortable and all of the staff is more than willing to help with any request or need  We accidently left some papers in the lounge one evening and they were delivered to our room before we noticed that they were missing  
P => Very good stay but   star too many We booked this hotel as a  Top Secret  deal on lastminute com and got a standard double room only for   nights for       This was     less than expedia s price so we felt we were getting a bargain Reception lobby area is relatively small and it has a boutique hotel feel about it when you first walk in  We checked in early and our room wasn t ready  however the receptionist personally escorted us to a different room and explained all it s facilities  Unknown to us she had upgraded us to an executive double  ED  instead of our standard double  SD   The bed in the ED is a huge king size and was soo  soo comfortable  I note some American reviewers felt the rooms in this hotel  and London hotels in general  are too small  much of that probably depends upon what they are used to in the US  but I felt the ED room was very spacious with a sitting area at the window  TV  amp  DVD  broadband internet  good air con and a large built in wardrobe  The upgrade was much appreciated as we discovered the SD rooms face inwards in the hotel  i e  your window will likely look out upon a brick wall and service pipes  whereas the ED rooms have views looking out over Green park or Down Street  ED rooms are also MUCH bigger  The extra cost for these rooms is worth it  The bathroom was reasonably sized with all necessary facilities  The bath itself was very small  you cannot stretch out in it  but the shower was extremely powerful with plenty of hot water  The concierge service is first class  We dealt with Duncan who was able to answer any question and provide all sorts of advice to us regarding our trip LOCATIONThe hotel is ideally located on Picadilly next door to the Park Lane Hotel  The  Green park  and  Hyde Park corner  subways are only a   minute walk in opposite directions i e  the hotel is between the   of them  Knightsbridge  Park Lane and Hyde Park are all only a     minute walk  Harvey Nicholls       minutes  Upon leaving the hotel and crossing the road you are in beautiful Green Park and after a leisurely    minute stroll you arrive at Buckingham Palace on the opposite end of the park  The top half of the Palace can be seen from the park view bedrooms  Leaving the hotel and walking up Picadilly will bring you to bottom of Bond Street in about      minutes  You can hit Regent Street in about    mins and Picadilly Circus in about    minutes Our stay was room only but breakfast is available for     per person  We felt this too pricey and were able to eat a hearty breakfast each morning in one of the many eateries near the hotel  Henry s do a full English breakfast for     The whiskey bar is a nice way to unwind after you arrive back from a night out  Cocktails are about     and bottled bear         prices which are to be expected in a   star hotel  Service again is impeccable  This hotel does lack some of the services you expect to find in a typical   star hotel e g  a swimming pool and a bigger gym  grander lobby area  several bars etc  As a boutique hotel it is a   star  I find it hard to classify as a   star but the service is certainly   star material  
P =>   A mixed experience For our   night stay we were given a standard room on the  th floor  This was clean but very small  in need of refurbishment and the en suite bathroom was microscopic  At full price  in excess of      per night  I would have felt ripped off   not what should be expected of a   star hotel Late in the evening on our first night  the  very worn  bedside panel that controlled ALL the lights went on the blink  After three attempts by the duty manager to fix the problem  all the lights blew and we were sat there by torchlight  in our robes  It was now well past midnight and after I declined the offer of a similar room on the same corridor we were upgraded to one of the apartments for the remainder of our stay The apartment was spacious  separate living room  large bedroom  and meticulously clean  if somewhat dated and frayed in its chinzy decore  There were real light switches  a large flat screen TV  DVD and broadband etc  The kitchenette was well equipped  but much too small for any serious cooking The staff were courteous and very helpful throughout  but they did fail to explain idiosyncracies of their lighting system Overall we liked the location and certainly enjoyed our stay  once we had been upgraded  but if asked to pay the full   star price   i e       per night for the apartment  plus English breakfast at     etc  there is much better to be had  even in grossly overpriced London Our   star rating is based on the actual experience of our stay  including the upgrade  
P =>  Quiet bedroom traditional decor Stayed here one night just before Christmas in a one bed apartment  The staff in the restaurant were great and the food was good  Our teenager ate it  to my surprise as they normally prefer junk food  and highly recommends the elderflower sorbet and the new potatoes  A full breakfast is expensive but you have a choice of part of the menu at lower cost   and a full breakfast will keep you going all day  Breakfast can also be served in your room but we opted for the restaurant  Ask for herbal tea if you wish although it s not listed on the menu  Our child loved their pot of chocolate  The apartment was furnished with traditional style furniture including desk and dining table  Tiny kitchenette but included a washing machine  we didn t try it out  Couldn t get the    inch TV to work but the second TV was fine for us  we didn t bother asking someone to deal with it By Central London standards the bedroom was very quiet  We didn t have a view but I d trade that for a good nights sleep anytime  The bed was very comfortable and you can choose a pillow  Shower either wasn t thermostatic or the thermostat had gone  Toiletries great  towels very clean and a good size  I m not keen on a full size mirror over the bath but also reflecting the toilet  But if that s what turns you on    When we checked out the bill was wrong  too high of course  and the pre theatre dinner shows as afternoon tea  which is confusing  It was sorted out after we left but check the bill carefully  This hotel has a great location  the beds are large  comfortable and very clean  The food is good and the restaurant staff excellent  I d definitely eat here again  not quite so sure about staying as the hassle with the bill did spoil a good experience  
P =>  Consistently Great I ve stayed at the Athenaeum in London four times in the past year plus  First and foremost it offers a perfect location on Picadilly across from Green Park and steps to Hyde Park  You can walk everywhere or hop the tube  Second  the staff  some have been there as long as    years  should be politicians because they always remember me  or a do a great job pretending   third the rooms    while on the medium small to small side    are exquisitely clean with some of the silkiest sheets I ve encountered in a hotel  along with the perfect weight duvet   Love the marble baths and fixtures  Also like that this is a smaller hotel with an intimate feel as well as the fact I can always find a competitive price online  
P =>   Pure Luxury Enlglish style  The Athenaeum hotel is a gorgeous hotel situated in fair  about five minutes walk from Green Park station and ten minutes from Hyde Park Corner  It differs from some other renowned London hotels in that it has a friendly  informal atmosphere and a welcoming feel  despite its grand appearance and luxurious d cor  The second you walk through the imposing front entrance  the door held open for you by a smiling doorman  you feel instantly relaxed and pampered A friendly concierge greets you and helped us through to the check in  He showed us to the Windsor Lounge  where afternoon tea and light refreshments are served  evening meals are served in Bullochs  their restaurant  which I have tried and also heartily recommend for a special occasion   The Windsor lounge is furnished with big  comfy armchairs  squishy sofas and tables  It s decorated in warm  earthy tones and is a lovely place to relax and unwind  The egg mayonaise sandwiches are a delight  but my favorite is the chicken tempura with a curried dipping sauce  I hope that never vanishes from the serving menu  
P =>  excellent boutique hotel I recently stayed at the Athenaeum hotel and was very pleased  The location is ideally located a few blocks down from the Green Park subway station that you can take from Heathrow and a short walk to Buckingham Palace   The room itself was superb  There was a very comfortable bed with pillow valet  you can choose what type of pillow you would like such as tempurpedic  buckwheat   heated towel racks and excellent water pressure in the shower   Also greatly appreciated was the jacuzzi tub downstairs and steam room  There is also a small gym that has treadmill  elliptical trainer and row machine  There wasn t any street noise  but you could sometimes hear hallway noise  but it wasn t a problem since it seemed like most of the clientele was older and there wasn t a lot of in and out traffic during the middle of the night   I will definitely be staying there again  
P => 	star too many I stayed at the athenaeum for   saturday night  I booked to relax in my room  watch a few DVDs and be near a restaurant i was dining in that evening  Reception staff were happy and friendly  I turned on my usual charm and asked for an upgrade as i am a travel agent  without even the slightest hesitation i was upgraded to a large executive room overlooking the park  I was shown a standard double by the guy who took me to my room as i mentioned that if this hotel was nice enough i d reccomend it to my clients  There is this habit in   star hotels where the staff take you to your room and show you how everything works and where everything is   insulting your intelligence comes to mind   and then they hang around waiting for a tip  but not this guy  off he went when he was done and that was nice  Do not stay in the standard rooms  there is no little sitting area and they are pretty small with horrid views The executive room i had was only  okay    The room had everything i needed  DVD and Cd player was great and the pillows are the most comfortable i have ever come across  The bathroom was dull and average  could do with refurbishing  There were things scattered around the room that had price tags on them   an umbrella for     in one corner of the room and a hotel teddy bear by the bed for     and so on    strange   i ve never come across this before at a   star hotel  This hotel is trying hard to be a   star hotel but falls a star short  firstly the bar here is actually the lobby and tiny  the restaurant that serves breakfast  lunch and dinner has the weirdest decor but serves a great breakfast    at     per person  i wouldn t think they would dare to get it wrong   the location is on a busy piccadilly but       minutes to all the action I would actually reccomend this hotel but not to anyone expecting a   star experience  I d place this hotel at the better end of the   star range  
P =>  Great Hotel  Perfect location at a very reasonable price if you book in advance with Expedia  Make sure you get a room looking over Green Park  Great bar  Highly Recommended  
P =>   Good for the business traveller I stayed at the Athenaeum Hotel for one night due to business in London  It offered an average tariff for the area        The hotel was clean  well lit and fragrant smelling  The lift is tiny and since there are    floors you may wait a while  I had a standard room on the  th floor which was very comfortable  I liked that it didn t have the usual awkward narrow entrance into the room  The decor was reasonably neutral and the window quite large  Despite being on the main road  it was totally quiet   good sound proofing I guess  The hotel offers a  quot breakfast to go quot  service which I found very useful  All the staff where warm and friendly  I would definitely choose the Athenaeum again  although I felt underdressed in my office attire next to the glamourous tourists I met in the tiny lift  The bed and the bathroom in the standard room are too small for    but for me by myself and being only  ft  in  it was perfectly fine  
P =>  Good experience at the Athenaeum Hotel The hotel was located in a very central location and well within walking distance of an underground station  The rooms were quite a bit smaller than I expected  though still functional and comfortable  Everyone we encountered at the hotel was extremely helpful and attentive  Be warned that the hotel is currently undergoing renovations and some ammenaties may not be available  The lift can be slow and many times we found it quicker to take the stairs up to our room on the  th floor  The one main drawback  both the water pressure and temperature fluctuated during each shower I took at the hotel  All in all  I would recommend this hotel and would stay there again  
P =>  Not a Five Star but Good This hotel is not a   star  as last minute or any other providers claim    star    I paid      for   night which was pricey because it was just me  I had a ball in London that night This high rating comes mainly from the service  The staff  especially in the hair salon  amp  the doormen  Jim and an Australian man  are wonderful  However  the Irish concierge is rude  Wonderful too is the location opposite Green Park and behind Park lane  You can also walk to along Picadilly  to fair market or go shopping in the Oxfor Circuis area The reason it is not anywhere near   star is that its just too shabby and small  It needs an upgrade  Honestly ask yourself  when you are stuck in the small elevators  devouring a stale  over priced high tea  sampling a lunch in the half empty restaurant  using a spa without a pool and with the sauna not working  and an unattractive  relatively run down and     s decorated building  is this really on a par with Claridges or the Ritz   However  its probably cheaper so I d say  if the price is right  go for it Contact me at chriseng   fsmail net for further questions  
P =>  Great Hotel We stayed   nights at the Athenaeum Hotel on a recent trip to Europe  The room was very nice  very spacious and had a comfortable bed  The staff were helpful and ready to please  Great location  easy access to the  tourist  type activities  We would definitely stay at this hotel again  
P =>  Made our weekend special This was one of the most friendly and accomodating hotels I have ever stayed in  Although we were disappointed that the sauna etc was shut down  we were upgraded to an executive room  sent a bottle of champagne for my partners birthday and given breakfast the next morning  All of the staff were efficient and friendly and ensured that our weekend away was a very special one  I would definitely recommend this hotel  
P =>  Great value Booked through LastMinute and got a great deal  The room was lovely  very modern with lots of gadgets e g  remote controlled curtains  Bed was extremely comfortable  Service was excellent  Don t be put off by the external view of the hotel Only downside was that there is a refurb of the ground floor going on which means the jacuzi sauna etc are closed  spa treatments still available    no noise from the work though  at weekend at least  but it is expected to last   months  
P =>  Super Christmas break at the Athenaeum Had a wonderful stay at the Athenaeum  As with other reviews we booked through lastminute and paid approx     each  for both room at Athenaeum and top price theatre tickets at the Palladium  This turned out to be superb value  The hotel is in a great location on Piccadilly and has smart decor  Our room was maybe on the smaller side  but was immaculate  with a huge comfy bed  plasma tv dvd and marble bathroom  The room service breakfast is extortionate see below   but we ate out so cannot comment on its quality  The small whisky bar is also expensive      for   large gin and tonics but has a homely atmosphere and somehow feels like it s worth paying the extra friendly  knowledgeable barman and really lovely glasses etc   I would definitely go back to the Athenaeum and happily recommend it  
P =>  Fantastic deal   I booked this hotel as part of a surprise birthday night out for my boyfriend  I got a fantastic deal on lasminute   only     which is fantastic for a    hotel in Picadilly I travelled up to london the night before his birthday with an over night bag  he wasn t aware that I had booked us in a hotel   and the hotels reception were fantastic and agreed to put our luggage in a safe room over night We were really pleased with our room   it is exactly like the pictures shown on this internet site  Very large  comfy bed  marble bathroom with fluffy robes and slippers   fantastic As the person said in the review before  breakfast is a little pricy  I think for both of us the breakfast which we had ordered to our room was about      It came on a huge trolley and had a selection of fruits  yoghurts  cooked breakfast etc but was really worth it We had a lovely stay  the price was great and we would come back  
P => Good deal from lastminite com Got a good deal from t Internet         Hotel location on Picadilly is great   right next door the the Sheraton  Check in was swift and friendly and room we were given was great I think we got an upgrade to the  quot normal quot  discount rooms though  as we checked in quite early  We were on the  th Floor to the side of the hotel  Good size room with excellent bathroom  All mod cons   including Digital TV  In room broadband Internet etc MY Wife had breakfast in the hotel   quite pricey at       I opted for a Coffee and Muffin from the nearby Starbucks and sat in Green Park watching the birds and squirrels play on a beautiful warm Autumn morning All in all a good hotel for the money if booked on lastminite com  Would probably suit the more  quot mature quot  traveller rather than a younger person coming to London Would I stay again    Yes  
P =>  Location great  Hotel above average     We stayed two nights at the Athenaeum at the end of tember  The lobby is unimpressive  The desk staff was cordial  but not really friendly  The complimentary champagne at check in was a lovely touch  The concierge was wonderful   very funny and helpful  The doorman was great  I misplaced a shawl while checking in  and the manager tried very hard to try to help me locate it  which I very much appreciated  The room was small  but comfortable  The bed was nice  The lights were hard to figure out  as they worked on a remote  The bath was small  but nice  We got an excellent price for the room       night US   I feel that the value was good at that price  the room was adequate and the location was prime  However  at the more usual rate of      night US  I believe you can do better  
P => Good location I recently stayed at the Atheneum for a holiday weekend with my husband  I got a fantastic rate on lastminute for their double room  When we checked in they offered us an upgrade to a larger room  which was     per night  The  quot cheap quot  was very small although nicely furnished  The upgraded room was much nicer and larger  I was surprised that they offered it at     which I think is quite expensive  The bed was very big and comfortable and had two excellent night sleep  The staff were all very friendly  the common rooms were clean and the maid staff nice  Everything was efficient  The hotel is in a great location with Shepard ket very close by I would recommend it again  
P =>   Good but not top I have stayed a few times at the Athenaeum London over the past three years  Even though I would say it is a nice hotel  it is not fantastic  The location across from Green Park near Hyde Park Corner is good  Try to get a Park View Room  even though you might have a little street noise  it is not too disturbing  The gym  though small  is open    hours  However the wet zones are only form   to   which is a shame  The rooms are not very large but cosy  beds are comfortable  though a bit on the small side for tall people Breakfast is pleasant with lots of freshly baked breads and fresh fruits Reception is ok but could be a little friendlier  in particular when it is not very busy  Also the hotel constantly asks you to fill in reviews about the quality of the place  however I never notice that much changes  The place is on my emplyer s corporate list  therefore I return often  However I question the Small Luxury Hotel award slightly having been to other SLH places  
P =>  Delighted I made reservations at the Athaneum based on a combination of good reviews on Tripadvisor and a  quot fair quot  weekend rate  It is difficult to find a hotel for    my wife and two children    and    in London I did not expect the hotel to be as good as we found it  Check in was personable   though as a previous reviewer wrote   the front desk staff are all  quot foreign quot   The doorman is fantastic   with the impressive skill of greeting me by name every time I came in and out  The one bedroom suite was beautiful  It was a few doors up the quiet side street  Traditionally furnished with comfortable chairs  desks and sofa  The children loved the large flat panel wall mounted TV in the bedroom  The living room had a large modern B amp O TV and there was a seperate stereo system with its own remote   minutes after checking in the children were brought a basket of games and sticker books We did not use the kitchen but it apeared to be well supplied A full English breakfast and impressive breakfast buffet in the pleasant restaurant  was included in the weekend rate As a bonus   about    minutes after arriving  we walked across Green Park and as we got to the Mall  saw a small motorcade followed by the Queen Checkout was painless with no added surprises  
P => Excellent Service at the Athenaeum  I booked the Athenaeum through Last Minute com for       This was booked without knowing the name of the hotel  just general location and rating        We were pleasantly surprised to find it just        minutes walk away from Green Park Underground  although not  across the road  as described in their website    After contacting the hotel regarding an upgrade  we took up their offer of     for an executive twin  We arrived early at   am and our rooms weren t ready  to be expected at that time   John the Concierge practially wrestled the bags off our shoulders   not used to such service  The concierge took our bags for storage and we freshened up in the powder room  just on the first floor  It is gorgeous   Take a look ladies  step back in time to a really traditional ladies powder room We arrived back at the hotel late afternoon and was taken to our room on the  th floor by receptionist  who offered to show us round the hotel and explain the facilities  Unfortunatley we were running late so had to decline  It was a lovely traditional style room with two single beds that were side by side  A bay window looked out onto a side street  and if you looked down the street to the left you could see Green Park  View wasn t an interest of ours  so we were quite happy  There were two chairs and a small table between them  The TV was equiped with CD DVD player  which was excellent and the optional extra of using the interet at a charge  The room was spotless with gorgeous white duvets  pillows and sheets  The room itself was an ok size   I must say I think the standard room would therefore be very small  Bathroom was nice with two towelling robes and Neutragena toiletries  Fantastic shower as well  The beds were truly a delight to sleep in  The most comfortable beds ever  We didn t use the other facilities in the hotel  so can t coment  Green Park tube is on the Piccaddily  Victoria and Jubilee lines  so it is a good base to move around  We took a stroll through Green Park and ended up facing Buckingham Palace  It was only    mins away and we hadn t realised it was so close  I don t know that I would pay the rack rate of       a night for a room  but at a discount  you are really getting more than your money s worth  Beautiful hotel with really pleasant staff and in a great location for sight seeing  
P => Still a Class Leader I stayed at this Hotel on  nd il overnight  I had a great deal from lastminute where it is currently listed  il     as a secret hotel   quot    near park lane quot  This is and always has been a stunning hotel  I have been staying here off and on over   years  I am not someone who is into loyalty for the sake of it but I keep returning because I cannot find anywhere else to beat it For     inc taxes I got a superb ior suite with a vast marble bathroom  The room was decorated like a jewel case and was spotless  The rich but tasteful decoration sets all of their rooms off individually and increases the sense of comfort As ever  even though I checked in early    am   they had a room for me  just compare that with what happens when you turn up early at a chain hotel  In the past I have turned up at  am and they still checked me in  All the staff were as ever polite and downright friendly  Food ordered was delicious and promptly delivered  With the current deals you can stay here for the same as a Hilton  even though the class difference is total  It is every way the equal of the Dorchester  and cheaper  and friendlier  It knocks the Ritz into a cocked hat and is cheaper and friendlier  I could go on  but like I said I keep staying here because it is the best I can find  
P => Comfortable hotel in top class location Booked a   night stay using lastminute for a weekend break Good Points Location   Superb position overlooking Green park Buckingham palace   step outside of the lobby onto the street and you feel as if you should be wearing your top hat and tails  Central to everything and close to the tube station Room   A nice relaxing feel with very comfortable bed Staff   Generally helpful and prompt Bad Points Noise   Woken at   am Sunday morning by the loud clattering of a truck loading unloading deliveries outside hotel window in a side street  
P =>  This place has gone downhill I have stayed at the hotel several times over the last    months and normally I find the Athenaeum a very pleasant experience  hence my decision to use the hotel for a personal trip rather than the usual business trips  On this occasion I was very disappointed  by some small issues and one particular issue which left me feeling really rather annoyed Generally the service levels seem to have dropped siginificantly  this time the staff were rude and unhelpful  Not sure if there are different people who work at the weekends  but it was a different experience for sure  I wouldn t recommend this hotel anymore  
P =>   First class Just returned from the Athenaeum and I can t speak highly enough of it  From the moment we entered  the quality was evident  From the concierge who remembers your name to the luxury of the rooms  this is a very good experience for London  Even though the hotel is situated on Piccadilly  the rooms were quiet  Another bonus is that it is only five minutes walk to Le Caprice  an excellent restaurant in Arlington Street  situated at the side of the Ritz  which offers atmosphere  great food yet doesn t break the bank This is  without doubt  one of the best hotels in London and is worth the expense   or better still  look for a good deal on lastminute comHighly recommended  When we are next in London this is where we will be heading   
P =>  pricey but worth it This is a quiet  sophisticated hotel with a staff that is attentive without being intrusive  The bed was exceptionally comfortable  and the food excellent  I was there in y and the breakfast buffet included a wide choice of fresh  seasonal fruit  uncommon in big city hotels in my experience  Deals that include breakfast are best  because the menu price is steep  While this is not an inexpensive hotel  there is real value for the price  
P => Fantastic proper     accomodation from the moment you enter this hotel you are greeted with a warm welcome Its not stuffy like other     hotels in London and you are not looked upon like scum if you have jeans on  Would definatly stay again easily the best hotel I have stayed in  in London    minutes walk from Tube station and approx    minutes walk from piccadily and    minutes from Knightsbridge Concierge are fantastic and cannot do enough to help Should be higher up in rank of hotels  
P =>   First Class This is easily the best hotel I ve stayed at         in London  It s small  quiet  despite being on Piccadilly   welcoming  well appointed and extremely comfortable  Very well worth staying here if you can  currently selling on lastminute for around      per night   
P =>  Fantastic Christmas in London Everything was better than my family and I expected  We had a magical Christmas          at the Athenaeum  In fact  I wanted to go back to London just to stay at the hotel  This was the first time we had our Christmas away from home but we felt so much at home at the Athenaeum  We had a one bedroom apartment which was perfect for our family of four because it has a completely separate bedroom with a king size bed and a very lovely bathroom  The living room is spacious  elegantly decorated  has a queen size sofa bed and with windows look out to a partial park view  not to mention the giant plasma display that my boys loved so much  In fact  my husband and I were able to go for English Tea twice thanks to the DVDs from the front desk  The petite and adorable kitchen has everything to make you feel like home  including a washer dryer unit to take care of your daily laundry  I used the washer everyday  note  it is better to dry your clothes on a hanger than in the dryer   We love having our English breakfast  included in the room rate  and our dinner at the restaurant  The food was exceptional and the service was absolutely outstanding  Donald from the concierge is friendly  helpful and humorous  I just wish there are more people like him at other five star hotels  The compact gym is perfect for exercise and the rest of the spa facilities is very nicely done  We did make full use of it during our eight day stay at the hotel  Lastly  I got a lot of help from the reservation staff to plan my vacation via email before we arrived London  
P => a treasure of a hotel This is a gem of a hotel  It is a small  boutique hotel that has a prime location   across from Green Park  a short walk to Buckingham Palace and Shepherd s ket  It is located in the area of fair which boasts some of the finest shops  art galleries and antique stores  The service was impeccable from the concierge to the waiters in the restaurants  Our family stayed in the apartments  situated next door to the hotel on a quiet and charming street  The apartment was beautifully appointed with fine English decorations  furnishings and draperies  the television in our living room was large with flat screen and offered many options such as internet access and movie viewing  We saw other apartments that had different decore  one next door had a bachelor theme with modern furniture  Tea is an understated tradition served in the living room area with wonderful delicacies that my nine year old daughter Rachel was delighted with  Breakfast was superb with a range of fresh fruits  baked goods and delicious eggs and omelettes  The whiskey bar was intimate and a great refuge for my husband  I also used the exercise facilities  which while small in size  was adequate  The Athenaeum is highly recommended hotel that is small enough to give its clientele superior service and I will most definitely return  
P => Almost perfect WoW  Why isn t this place higher on the list  I stayed here for one night this week doing some business in London  It was almost perfect  I wanted a place that wasn t full of flowers  amp  chintz  The Athenaeum is as sophisticated and stylish as any hotel in the world   the perfect antidote to an overdose of Laura Ashley  Service was excellent  
P =>  Five star class We have stayed at the Athenaeum four times and are heading back soon at the end of ember   it is a lovely hotel  We feel at home the moment we walk in the door  The staff are wonderful and everyone remembers us   from the doorman to the maitre d  The facilities are top notch   just how a top class London hotel should be  but without the stuffiness  A great location too   you can walk everywhere  Can t wait to be back on the   th  
P => Lovely London Hotel We stayed at the Athenaeum for a week while in London recently  It was wonderful  The room was clean upon arrival  There were nice touches  such as a towel warmer in the bathroom  good water pressure and consistent temperature in the shower  lights that come on as you enter the room  turn down service  newspaper delivery and a cute fitness room and jacuzzi with sauna and steam rooms  Donald  the concierge  was most helpful with sightseeing plans and routes  Room service and housekeeping were fast and efficient  We enjoyed a delicious meal in Bulloch s Restaurant and cocktails in the Windsor Lounge  The location was excellent as it was close to the Tube and in a nice neighborhood for walking while not being too noisy or overcrowded  I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a nice place to stay while in London  
P =>  A Gem  I have stayed here twice  they treat you like family  Have not seen any reviews of their apartments next door to the hotel  what luxury and comfort  what space  You won t want to leave  I rented a one bedroom and they kindly upgraded me to a two bedroom because at the last minute  family from Ireland decided to come and stay with me  The manager was just wonderful  Doesn t hurt to have a great Irish concierge who has been at the hotel for years  As someone else mentioned  the front staff are the best in the world  I highly recommend this hotel to anyone  The location is top notch also  This is a family owned and operated hotel and it feels like it too  
P => HOW A HOTEL SHOULD BE Those of you who travel to London regularly know how often you come across unfriendly and amateur staff  The Athenaeum is the complete opposite of this  The rooms are great as is the location  The only thing stopping me staying there on every visit is the lack of availability action within my wallet  
P =>  Fabulous weekend spoilt by an over zealous front office Fabulous location  good room  all be it at the back of the hotel with no view and this despite the fact that the hotel was very quiet during our stay  The meal in the restaurant was excellent and the al a carte menu represented reasonably good value  Shame the truffles didn t arrive with the coffee when it was taken in the bar  The bar by the way was excellent and the member of staff absolutely superb However  a thoroughly enjoyable weekend has been spoilt by an ill judged decision on the part of the hotel to make a charge for mini bar items to my visa card after my departure  something I only discovered when my credit card account arrived  and this despite my having advised upon departure that we hadn t used the mini bar  A letter and three telephone calls were required before my account was credited for the mischarged items and even then an apology for the inconvenience hasn t been forthcoming  I have stayed in many hotels  over many years  in many countries  but never have I had experience of a hotel that charges your credit debit charge card after departure without your prior consent  This is just not acceptable and I would certainly expect much better of a hotel with five red stars which prides itself on the quality of its personal service  
P =>  Great hotel but watch out for the short beds  Great hotel  good location  fantastic staff     but  probably because we booked a special offer  we had a very small room  The bed was very short  my husband had to sleep with his feet over the edge     and he s only   foot tall   
P =>  Such a comfortable Place We have just returned from a wonderful visit at the Athenaeum hotel  From the outside the hotel looks quite drab  but don t let this put you off  The staff and the interior more than make up for a building you would probably walk past without a second glance  The door men are so helpful  down to the point of offering bottled water and face towels to the hotel guests who have been out jogging  Reception are shining examples of how reception staff should be  efficient and friendly  Initially I was disappointed by the room  It was small and only contains a     sized bath  But the view  of Green Park   the comfortable bed and the airconditioning more than made up for the rooms size  My only complaint  A loud guest in the next room conducting a telephone conversation at  am and having an animated discussion with other guests in her room  The reason I could probably hear EVERYTHING was that our room had an integral door to her room to enable families to have   rooms ajoining etc   I think it would be best to check that your room doesn t have this facility unless you need it  With respect the fact that our neighbour was loud wasn t the hotels fault We had a fabulous evening meal in the hotel restaurant  it was perfect in every way  All in all a comfortable stay  with friendly staff  who couldn t do enough to help  We will no doubt be back  we will check that the room isn t an ajoining room next time though   
P =>  Wonderful place to stay I stayed twice at this hotel this year and I really can recommend it  The rooms are wonderful for English standards  They are more spacy than at other hotels  The location is perfect  You can almost do everything by foot if you don t want to take the subway as it can be overcrowded  The staff at the front desk is very helpful  especially Patricia  The breakfast comes in a small buffet style for the continental option or you order a cooked breakfast as well  They have  quot The Times quot  delivered to your room every morning as well as the  quot Daily Express quot  layed out in the lounge  The lounge is also very cosy and typical English  The concierge is very good and an institution  I definitely would stay there again    
P =>  The best in town From the moment we stepped out of the taxi the Hotel felt special  the staff were excellent  the rooms perfect and the breakfast would set you up for the day I stay in London on a regular basis and will be making this my home    
P =>  Professional comfortable Good location on Piccadilly  very comfortable  professional and welcoming staff The bedroom was an example of how  designer  can sometimes mean  horrible    it was comfortable  fairly recently refurbished  but just not very attractive  On the day I stayed  there was no running water for several hours   not the hotel s fault  but it didn t help It s a really nice hotel  and doesn t have that  chain  feel of so many London hotels  But given the acclaim it s received  five red AA stars  for example   I think I d expected it to be more special than it actually was

P =>  Big improvement since our last visit We stayed in Athena Hotel in       and thought it is very nice hotel worth to come back to however this time I was amazed on huge improvement this hotel has made  From the very beginning and through all our stay we received friendly and helpful service at reception  Rooms have been recently refreshed with new wall paper  headboards  bed lamps and some furniture  We were very pleased  room looks fresh and clean  Don t look at the photos put on this site  those are out of date  Breakfast is good but when the hotel is full restaurant is very busy just before  am  It could be very good idea to have breakfast half an hour earlier when other people are still in the rooms  
P =>   Great Value for the Money Prior to arriving in London  my wife and I booked online a hotel  around the corner  and had a terrible experiece  We knew we would be returning to London the next week so we stopped in at the Athena to inquire about a room for the return  The staff was pleasant and showed us a room  We could see the building  though old  was maintained with a level of pride  clean rooms and everything worked   For a more thorough review  read Mr Sadiq Lakhani s  uary         write up  I feel this is an accurate portrayal of what we found  I would like to  quot ditto quot  his comments  Thank you Athena for helping my wife and I regroup on accomodations during our stay in London  Don Kudrna  California 
P => 	Most Amazing Experience    highly recommeded     RECOMMENDED   I booked this hotel from the internet for a one night stay prior to arrival online by Credit card Reading your reviews had me scared  the website of the hotel showed all facilities i wanted  But your reviews were so bad   So I just booked online by credit card for only one night  In case it turned out to be like you said I would run away the next day  I arrived last night  however I called the booking agent and took the hotel direct number and called the hotel in the morning to please give me good room as I have heard scary review about it  I tell you its not true at all  I assume probably it could be other nearby hotel people killing competition    who knows  it just takes a few lines to kill business  But really dont go  quot too much quot  on reviews  call personally and take name of the person at the desk so you can later tell them how your room was   Ok    review    Its an amazing hotel   excellent location  great service  has lift to the rooms  not drag bags to  th floors and losr   lbs  Internet wireless for     a day    hours if you have laptop  Does not feel like a BB at all  but like a proper hotel  if you wait and book just one or two days before you come you have a chance to get amazing rates     There is good coffee tea making in the room  The decor  fixtures  lights  plugs  and the design of room is just right    There is attention to detail  and the heating is superb   its    degrees nowadays here     brrrr           The TV is nice  new wall mounted  and washroom were clean and impeccable  and I must say its an amazing room  in the price         price      from the internet Sussex Gardens location is great too   close to Hyde park and close to Edgware Road too with budget restaurants and internet cafes open till late at night  Buses and tube real close In London Sussex gardens is a great area to stay in  so close to ble Arch  and Oxford Street for you crazy shoppers  just a few minutes pop down on any bus going down Edgware road  I love London and I love this hotel and by the way no one is paying me to write this  I am also   like most of you an avid traveler and a budding travel writer  I travel mostly in SE Asia  Thailand and around  London after many years now  So give it a shot  if you coming to London  call them from before  not the agents  take the number of the hotel from the agent and call personally and ask for a good room  And you are made Try for one night if in doubt  and if you don t like it there are so many BBs all lined up on Sussex gardens  more than    I assume  so you can move the next day too  Happy traveling     thank you Athena    Sadiq Lakhani A Banker   Adventure traveler  IT professional  Wannabe Travel Writer     sadiq lakhani yahoo com 
P =>  NEVER AGAIN  Horrible  We stayed only for one night and paid     pound  The room was in the basement   not very clean  The lady at the reception terrible  I had the feeling that she felt disturbed in reading her book  The breakfast was horrible  We then changed the hotel and got a much better one for    pound THIS  quot Athena Hotel quot  is not a hotel  It is more or less a dosshouse  but a very expensive one l Through your money out of the window and you have much jmore than staying at this place NEVER AGAIN       
P =>   Nice clean hotel perfect location We stayed at the Athena hotel for   nights in a family room at a very reasonable rate  We were more than happy with this nice  clean hotel  The breakfast was very good  English breakfast  and was included in the price of the room  The staff were very kind and helpful  This hotel is located in Sussex Gardens  a pleasant avenue lined with London plane trees  Platanus acerifolia  not far from Hyde Park  close to Edgware Road and Paddington tube stations so from here you can easily go anywhere in London  Restaurants  convenience stores and internet facilities are also within easy reach  just round the corner towards Paddington station  Praed Street  London Street   I would definitely come back  
P =>  Nice hotel good location We stayed at the Athena hotel for   nights  The staff were very pleasant and helpful  any requests we had were dealt with speedily   The breakfast each morning was very good  english breakfast  and was included in the price of the room  The hotel itself is located close to Edgeware Road and Paddington tube stations so its easy to get to and from there from anywhere in London  The hotel is also around the corner from a rather fine Indian restaurant  the Ryath  if you fancy a lovely meal  My only gripe about the hotel would be the decor  needs a makeover  but if all you need is somewhere to put your head down at night  and a good breakfast then you cant go wrong here Louise  Dublin  Ireland  
P =>  what do you expect We stayed at the Athena for   nights  I booked the hotel over the web and after booking it read a couple of reviews   I know wrong way round and started to panic at what people had written and was dreading arriving there  For what we paid I didn t expect the Ritz  but the room was clean and tidy plenty of hot water staff were friendly and helpful you get what you pay for  I remember reading a reviews about the riott quis    star  in New York were we stayed last year and that was all negative  the hotel was fantastic in every way so you can not always go by reviews wriiten you have to try these hotels yourself  
P =>  Utter Rubbish If i could give this hotel zero stars i would  Stayed here with my partner in february and place is a dump  Wallpaper falling off the walls  smokey room  awful shower  dirty bed clothes stains on the floor  Staff dull and uninterested  reception smelt like a takeaway  Do not stay here  save your money for something better  like a cardboard box  
P => Third time not the charm I ve stayed at the Athena twice before        amp         I came to expect a friendly  helpful staff and clean  well kept rooms  This last trip         told a different tale  An un friendly staff with little knowledge of how to help a tourist make their way through basic tour reservations  Torn wallpaper in public areas  torn drapery in the room  and a general tired  worn out feeling has taken the place of warm  amp  friendly  It is sad to see a once charming gem tarnish and become undesirable  
P =>  Gone down hill My wife and I have had some nice stays at this hotel shortly after the refurnishment in       room   was especially nice  with a wonderful big bathroom  However     on our last two vists in      and      we experianced rude uninterested staff  and rooms that deperately required basic maintainace  Really a shame to see this place go down hill  We now prefer the Holiday Express at North Acton    Clean and professional  
P => Disappointing This hotel was very disappointing and its surprising considering the local competition  We were originally offered room    which is in the basement and is so small that you can barely walk around the bed to get to the shower room  We were offered an alternative but this was below the reception and we could here the receptionist walking above us  The second night we were in room    and although on the front of the building we has a better night  The rooms are tatty although clean and there is a lack of attention to works needing doing such as lightbulbs and heating  Breakfast was okay but other hotels do better

P =>   Felt like home  Me  my friend and my mom spent a weekend      and             in the Avalon hotel and we absolutely loved this place  After having read some of the reviews and because of the bargain price     pounds night for a triple room  we were mentally prepared for some hostel like disastrous accommodation  but we have found a real gem instead  We arrived at London on early Friday morning and the hotel was just a few minutes walk from the St  Pancras International railway metro station  situated in a really calm street and there were also lots of small shops and restaurants nearby The hotel had a cosy hall and a pleasant atmosphere with soft carpets everywhere All the hotel staff was very nice and friendly  It was absolutely no problem to leave our luggage in the hotel before the check in and again the whole day after the check out  Our room was situated on the top floor and there was everything that a tourist might need to stay overnight  The toilets and shower bathtub were in the corridor on our floor and everything was very neat and clean  Our room was large  with a wash basin  a plug adaptor  a TV and facilities to make our tea coffee  The beds were comfortable and we heard no noise from the neighbours  In fact  there must have been other people on our floor  the hotel had no vacancies   but we never saw anyone nor had to wait for the shower or toilet   We had a great time in London  were very satisfied with the Avalon hotel and will definitely come back there again  
P =>   Basic with a capital B Ok  it s clean Ok  they are friendly And the location is not too bad  close to St  Pancras   Euston train sations  Unfortunately this is pretty much everything positive i can say about this place  It is basic   very basic even for London standards  The furniture looks like either someone disposed it or they got it from the salvation army  rooms are tiny  walls are thin  you can hear almost everone else coming and going  and the window did not close properly  i would not want to stay here in winter Bathrooms and toilets are shared Fifty pound  what i paid per night  will get you something more decent  with private facilities  even in Central London Stay elsewhere if you don t depend on the location  
P =>  Value for Money Have stayed at this hotel several times over a number of years and found it value for money  The location is good  reasonably clean  and quiet  Plenty of restaurants in the vicinity and convenient to transportation as well as the British Library It used to have excellent breakfasts but alas no more  The management is friendly and it is possible to haggle over the price of a room especially if you stay a week  
P =>  Hands down worst hotel I ve ever  not  stayed at I absolutely hated this hotel  When we first came in  there was this weird smell I couldn t get rid of  We had two very large suitcases  and then found out we were on the very top floor  The first one or two staircases were fine  but the third was treacherous  I m honestly glad I didn t sprain an ankle  Upon entering the room  we saw that there were panes missing from the window  and the room was really chilly  The beds were lumpy and thin  and it felt like I might as well have been sitting on the ground  The t v  didn t even turn on  And worst of all  the communal bathroom was absolutely disgusting  There was no showerhead  and to hell would I take a bath in one of the dirtiest bathrooms I d ever seen  That did it for us  We took our bags right down again  checked out  and stayed at another hotel  
P => Convenient and good value  I stayed overnight at the Avalon Hotel with my two children of   and     also with my friend who has two children of the same age  The hotel was fine and good value  the men who booked us in seemed helpful  there was a strange smell but I think I got used to it  The rooms were comfortable and no complaints there  except my room was next to the floors toilets and the doors kept banging keeping me awake  my children were fine though so it was all part of the tales to tell about our trip  When checking out early we had difficulty in finding anyone so we could settle our bill  but got there in the end  Would stay there again for a cheap and cheerful overnight London stay ie  Lewis and Leah  Nr Banbury  Oxfordshire  
P =>  Excellent value  I originally was a bit put off by the reviews I saw on this site for the Avalon  but booked a room there anyway  for     night  their Internet rate    as my photos show  I lucked out and got a twin for the price of a single  because no singles were available  and I called the hotel directly   and am extremely happy I did so  The location  Cartwright Gardens  is fantastic  and the room was perfectly serviceable    small but clean  Breakfast was also very good  I think the staff has made a real effort recently to update and upgrade the hotel  As long as you realize you re getting a bargain  and know what small hotels B amp Bs in the UK are like  then I have no hesitation in recommending the Avalon to you  
P =>  Used to love it  I first stopped at the Avalon when I was just ten years old  It was a very nice comfortable private hotel run by a very nice couple  They cared about their guests and accommodated the traveler whenever possible  I enjoyed the Avalon at least ten times  Through the years  I won t say how many   the hotel has simply stagnated  No changes  no upgrades  no paint  no new wallpaper  no mending  no     well you get the picture  I no longer stop at the Avalon  They are uncomfortable  shabby  not chic   cold and unaccommodating  Late breakfasts crammed in a tiny cubby in the basement  no holding of cases while the traveler travels  this used to be a major benefit   no one on duty  no heat in the room  window pane missing in the rain and NO ONE ON DUTY  Mr  and Mrs Taylor would turn blue to know that their lovely home is now a hole in the wall    BY THE WAY    there are still MANY lovely private hotels on Cartwright Gardens   ones like the Avalon used to be  
P =>  Taken by surprise The key words about the Avalon are  quot Spartan quot    quot aged quot  and  quot worn out quot   This is the absolutely basic accomodation and this fact takes travellers not familiar with London by surprise  The room and the bathroom were tiny and in need of some extra dusting  plaster was peeling  one of the faucets was leaking  Linens were well worn  There were no things like shampoo  The walls were certainly far from being soundproof  which was a problem  since a public bathroom was next door from your room We were asked to pay immediately upon checking in  There was nobody at the front desk in the morning  On Sundays  breakfast is served at       so you are out of luck if you are an early bird  The bottom line   this is a students  accommodation for a hefty price       day for a triple room with a bathroom   This discrepancy between the price and amenities may be a general London problem  but the available descriptions of the hotel carefully avoided these details  
P =>  It started with the smell    We should have left when we walked in the door and the entire first floor smelled strongly of rancid cooking oil  but for some reason we checked in anyway  On the plus side  they did give us a triple for the cost of a double so we had a pretty big room  On the other hand  the room was terribly taken care of  grimy and with plaster coming off  Our window wouldn t close all the way  so we had a lot of noise coming in  not birdsong like the last reviewer as our room looked out on the backcourtyard of another building which seemed full of screaming children much of the time   The shower looked like it would fall apart and had no hot water for one of our three mornings  The toilet had a constant slow leak all over the floor  Our room was situated so the head of our bed was right next to the two hallway bathrooms  so doors slammed next to our heads all night  The staff wasn t rude  but certainly wasn t particularly helpful or caring  The breakfast was decent if you could get past the smell of the kitchen  
P =>  Basic Friendly and Cheap I had a single room and shared a bath down the hall  A small  old hotel  Very basic accomodations  BUT  wonderfully central  friendly staff  great breakfast  On a scenic Georgian Crescent in the Univ of London British Library area  I could open my window in the morning and hear the birds singing in the little park across the way  I don t mind funky if I can have bird song instead of traffic noise  
P =>  Cuidado   Es un timo  
P =>  Deutschen Standard bitte vergessen  
P => 
P =>   tidy clean and cozy hotel in superb location The Averard was tidy and comfortable  The price on the hotel room was very reasonable and included daily breakfast     pounds  booked through londonrooms com   We enjoyed our visit there  particularly since the Averard was so centrally located  a stone s throw from Hyde Park  close to a well stocked and hospitable convenience store and close to Tube stops   Paddington and Lancaster  It suited our budget conscious needs perfectly  When we were there  there was some work being done on the building  scaffolding in pic  
P =>  Good but could be so much better  Booked this through Superbreaks at very short notice   two hundred pounds for two people for three nights  The hotel itself did not inspire confidence as my companion and I approached it  since half of it is currently covered in scaffolding   once you get into the lobby  though  it looks a lot better  Our room was on the ground floor  but there is a lift to other floors   useful for families with pushchairs or people who may be less mobile for any reason  Staff were all friendly  from the smiley South African lady who checked us in to the people working in the breakfast room   during our entire stay we saw none of the squabbling mentioned by other reviewers  Breakfast was great  with an excellent selection for a  continental  that outdoes anything else I have come across   and waitress service  too  The location was unbeatable   step outside and you re looking at Hyde Park  the tube was five minutes away on foot  and there are some great restaurants within easy walking distance   if you like Italian  check out La Rosa Now on to the niggles  There are no tea and coffee facilities in the rooms   admittedly  the hotel s website does not mention having them  but even the most basic B  amp  B provides them these days  Sheets were superbly clean  not so the itchy blankets and slightly grubby bedcovers  duvets mean less work when changing beds  and are easier to launder too  The notice on the back of the door in our room referred to the bar being open between   and    p m  which it wasn t  they also refer to the availability of a TV in the lounge  which there isn t   and I went in search of it when the snowy reception in our room was ruining  quot Britain s Got Talent quot  for my young travel companion I would stay there again  despite these problems  because I use a hotel as a place to sleep when I m in London and that s all  the room was cosy  the breakfast was fantastic and the staff went out of their way to be helpful   and if they made the Averard as good as it probably was once  they d be able to charge twice as much and I wouldn t be able to afford to stay there any longer  
P =>   Far better than I expected We stayed   nights at the Averard  We needed to travel frugally  and the cost of the Averard was perfect for our budget  After reading all the reviews  we were apprehensive  however  the hotel provided far more than we expected from the reviews  The location is excellent  We found the staff for the most part very helpful and alwasys nice  the rooms were clean  and there was enough hot to very warm water for our needs  The hotel is past its prime  however  has great character  The breakfast was good  and we made it our goal to make the servers smile  we succeeded  and they ended up being very nice  I recommend this hotel for people who do not need to stay in a riott  
P => Great location Having read the other reviews I must say the location is a must but the hotel does need some TLC but otherwise my stay was ok and the breakfast was of good value even though not a full one it was enough  Bedding and towels clean and liked the old character feel to the room and reception etc Best of all the location and the value of the hotel was very good  have stayed not so good for the price  
P =>  It could have been better I have stayed here twice  mainly because of the price         for a double  and the location  The hotel would have been great if they took better care of it  I was first given a room with a bath which looked awful and the shower head didn t work  so we were given another room  It was much better  large with a new shower room People at the reception ok  but do not expect any help from the porter  they shouldn t mention this service since they do not offer it    Blankets and bed covers should be changed  they don t look very clean The worst thing is ALL the african waitresses  who are very rude and unhelpful  I really wonder why they have them in this post  The rudest people I ve seen  And they gather in the kitchen around   in the morning and make so much noise laughing and shouting  that was heard in our room   st floor   
P =>  Mixed opinion I booked through londonrooms com  The hotel was run down and although clean bedding and bathroom it could have done with a general tidy up such as marks and tears in the wallpaper  carpet etc  We were in   ground floor rooms  one near reception was OK and our teenage kids were OK but we were in a room right at the back and hidden behind an old style broken lift down an unlit corridor  i felt like i was walking to a cupboard hidden from all the other guests  Unfortunately this room is also right next to the kitchen so you get woken early by the noisy kitchen staff  The staff are the main issue  On arrival I was told where the rooms were but not shown them and not really told any info about the hotel except breakfast times  The breakfast staff do not come across as friendly at all and on the  nd day of my stay they were arguing very loudly in the kitchen with a full room of guests  On departure the receptionist did not even ask if everything had been alright  There is no parking as stated and you get a leaflet for a carpark saying could be as low as   p an hour  I never saw it less than   p an hour which adds up  The TV s in the room are not very good as only a portable aerial and no tea or coffee making facilities in the rooms  Also the toilet in my room was like sitting in a broom cupboard with no ventilation to that or the separate bathroom  Manageable for   nights but would have been unhappy to stay longer  
P =>   Good value faded  gloire   We booked through London Rooms and had a good deal at      I think  or even      for a double room  The hotel looks pretty discouraging from the outside  especially from the back but as it is presently covered in scaffolding  I suppose that they are going to paint it  which it urgently needs  Once inside  the reception area rooms are very spacious  though all with an atmosphere of faded gloire from better days Our double room was comfortable and had a spacious and very light bathroom  much better than the artificially lit cupboard like shower rooms of several other budget hotels The hotel is in a good area with several restaurants and a good pub and a pretty London mews behind it The reception staff were friendly  but I agree with other reviewers that the breakfast staff need to be trained how to behave appropriately in front of guests  When we were there  the chef was having a loud slanging match with one of the waitresses who was shouting back about hours and days that she had to work etc  not conducive to a calm breakfast  which incidentally was otherwise fine and included in the price Compared to other budget chain hotels in the area the Averard is good value and if you ask for a room on the lower floors  I think the standard will be better Potentially  this could be a much better hotel with a bit more investment in its appearance both inside and out  However  it is very good value and I would recommend it for a short London stay  
P =>  The most miserable hotel I have EVER stayed at  I rang to book a room directly with the Hotel       which was good value given the location  The lady who took the call  Trish  was very polite and friendly  When I turned up at the hotel  i didnt expect a red carpet but atleast a smile rather than a grunt from the receptionist  Not Trish   which it appeared I had interrupted her sight seeing outside  For     I didnt expect much  the room was very small  amp  faded and the water pressure laughable  the breakfast was ok  My main problem is that not once did the staff acknowledge my existance with so much as a smile  This indifference to the paying guests  from receptionists who talk over you to their friends when you are trying to pay your bill  to the surley miserable staff in the brekfast room   This miserable approach gives the whole hotel a rather depressing  run down and ultimately  never come back feel   rather than a well priced cheap hotel with a certain level of quirky faded graduer which it could do with a lesson in customer service  
P =>   Good value for money I have booked through londonrooms com and everything went ok Good aspects   really close to Hyde Park and lancaster tube station I have paid    pounds per night  which I think it is worth The room is not small  the bathroom is quite nice  they even provide soap and shampoo  Clean room with new towells every day Nice guy at the reception desk  Quiet zone Bad aspects   the ladies that serve breakfast are really in a bad mood  every day    And they don t allow you to seat in a table for    if you are only      even if the room is empty    The hotel is a little old  therefore there are some paiting coming off the walls  but  at least for me  nothing too serious Much better than other low budget hotels at London  
P =>   Does the trick This hotel even though a wee bit faded from it s former years is great  The staff are very helpful  our bathroom had just been done up  and our room had enough space for huge cases  It s only a stones throw from Hyde Park 
P =>  needs decorating but great location          I will start with the postive comments  the hotel is easy to get to from Heathrow aiport getting the heathrow express to paddington station which is just    mins walk away   Its in a good area of London  quiet but near to everything you could need  walk out of the hotel and you have the beautiful hyde park infront of you and a cozy pub called the swan on the left  thats if you can afford the price of a pint in the U k now       the london tour bus stop is just   mins away to  the usual indian  chinese cuisine restaurants are within walking distance to  The negative points are that The building is impressive but is well overdue for some painting and decorating      the breakfasts are good enough and a fry up for a fiver is optional     the staff at breakfast are not the happiest i have seen   which i mentioned to the very nice receptionist staff      rooms were clean and     was a very nice size twin room which faced the front road   i would stay there again   the price was excellent considering the location  ps in the winter months the tour bus is valid for    hours for the same price of    pounds  well recommended    
P =>   I felt like a real Victorian Englishman After reading all reviews on this site  I was a little suspicious about my choice  but  once arrived  I became impressed  The hotel is old  but people are kind and helpful  If you d like to stay in a museum  make this choice It looks a little like a dump  but it isn t  The room and sheets are very clean and they change all towels daily From hotel location you can easily reach all Central London The area is clean and it s a good neighbourhood Very close to hotel it s pub  quot The Swan quot  where they serve great fish amp chips  Average price for a combo  fish amp beer  is    GBP Take care to have with you plug adaptors  because they are short on those at the front desk  
P =>  Very Old hotel and room The Hotel is Old  rooms are old  beds are old and not comf  no internet  staff dull and telephone bill incredible high  breakfast is ok and location is very good Enrico Italy 
P =>   Good value good location Nice quiet  value hotel in a very good location just north of Hyde park  We stayed in a room with   single beds for    pounds per night including a decent continental breakfast  We booked through       The hotel is a short walk from the Lancaster Gate tube station  There are several good restaurants nearby particularly if you walk a few blocks north towards the Paddington tube station  also within easy walking distance   Cabs drive by the hotel every few minutes and there is also good access to buses  A Cab ride to Buckingham Palace was   pounds and Victoria station was    pounds  We got day passes for the bus and tube and it was very easy to get around London riding the buses and tubes I would agree with the other reviewers that the hotel is a bit run down but it is very good value especially for families  It must have been quite a posh place when in first opened in the      s but it looks like nothing has been repaired or maintained since then Reception staff was helpful and friendly  
P =>   Get what you pay for If you can accept that this is a very very old hotel then you will not be shocked when you arrive  Our room s shower had no curtain etc and only hot water form shower  Our group complained that their beds were dirty with hairs etc  However our room was always clean and beds too The staff were very very helpful  always willing to help and always happy which makes a big difference  Breakfast staff were great too If owner upgraded the bed covers and fixed plumbing it would be more appealing Thank you to the front desk staff for all of your help you were excellent 
P =>  cheap but not cheerful As some one already pointed out  the only good thing about it was the price  oh and the pleasant porter standing outside the entrance of the hotel across the road  If only the Averard were that friendly  It suited us in a way because we only used it for sleeping in  but put this way you wouldn t be seen having a drink in the  quot bar quot  at night  There wasn t a fire door in our bedroom  nor way there a fire alarm  If there was an actual fire then it would be likely that there would be many survivors due to the lay out of the corridors and rooms  The lift wasn t up to much  could only fit in about   people which made it very dificult when arriving with luggage  The staff were not very welcoming  and I won t say anything else incase it is interpreted as an insult  which it isn t  it s just matter of fact  It would just be nice to see a smile and some polite manners  especially whilst dealing with tourists and paying customer  
P =>  needs renovation but it s OK This is the third time I selected Averard Hotel When I have first seen the facade  I was a bit shocked  Fortunately it proved to be a very good deal for this price  Room and bathroom are cleaned everyday  TV is working  and I write this review from my room  might be accidental luck   Breakfast is basic  but at least for me it is sufficient  You can get some extras  eggs  sausages      for some additional charge The location is perfect  It is few steps from Lancaster Gate on Central Line  short walk from Paddington Station  and if you are lucky  you can see the Hyde Park from your window If the weather is nice  you can walk through the park to ble Arch  or Kensington Palace There are quite a few good restaurants in the neighborhood  The pub behind the hotel serves very nice fish amp chips  
P =>  A good price and a good location  I stayed here in last e  in a single room  I made my reservation in Internet in  and I payed          each night Therefore it sems to me a right price Vantages  it s very well located  almost in front of one of the gates of Hyde Park  near the subway  and near some bus stops that will take you to the city center Near it have some souvenir shops and some restaurants  and the commercial zone of Quenways is not far Inside the Hotel is very beautiful with a piano  paintings  statues Disvantages  the Hotel is very old  the interiors made of wood   the rooms  when the weather is warm   very  very hot  because it have not A C  just a single windown with just a curtain The ceiling  the walls and the floor are in wood  witch makes that you could hear anything  a person walking in corridor or a person walking in the room above you One of the worse things  is the breakfast  It s not a buffet style  and every day you have to choose  the things you want  Bread  or just a single croissant  cofee or hot chocolate     g of cheese in very small package  no ham or other meat  pinnapeaple juice our apple juice   you have always to choose  you could not eat all of this together In a city which everything is so expansive a good breakfast matters   is very important Everyday a our or two later he have to eat in the street If you have any question about this Hotel  just let me know  
P =>  So so hotel We stayed here for one night in         The rooms varied in  style  depending upon which type you booked  At  am  the occupants in the room above us checked in and we had to listen to them walk back and forth for over an hour  The lobby is very sparse      only an old piano and ugly chairs  The elevator is TINY  The best part of this hotel is the continental breakfast in the nice  small  breakfast area  DO NOT trust this hotel s website photo as I did and book your room for that reason  Also  it isn t in the best part of town as far as walking to restaurants  etc     
P =>  Just Stayed Just stayed at the Averard    great location near Hyde Park  close to Paddington  walking distance from Heathrow Express train  My family stayed and found the beds very comfortable and new carpets added to first stage of refurbishment  quot feel  quot  Staff was generally helpful  but inconsistent  If hotel were to spruce up with some fresh paint outside and inside  could reach potential of a real gem  All in all  quite satisfactory and a good bargain which is hard to find in London  
P => Nice quite low cost hotel convenient to transportation This is a very cozy hotel  The decor and how the hotel is laid out make it feel like a large house  On both my stays there  I requested singles with en suite baths  Both times  the bathrooms were very clean and modern  The beds were not the most comfortable for either stay  however  The room sizes also differ significantly  During my first stay  the room was the size of a closet  the second stay  the room was three times larger  The hotel is two blocks to the Lancaster Gate tube stop which makes getting around easy  The location it s in is also fairly quite  To get a good deal  I would recommend a booking engine that specializes in london accomodations rather than the bigger sites  
P =>  Nice Hydeaway Good price  good basic breakfast and service  two rooms for family of five  one block off Bayswater in Kesington District above Hyde Park  Very quiet neighborhood  nice oasis from London s hustle bustle  Tube stop around corner  Great day help  young night receptionist a bit uninformative  Great spot  
P =>  Nice afffordable little hotel I stayed at the Averard for nearly two weeks  The location is excellent  right across from Kensington Hyde park    minute walk to Lancaster Gate tube station  There s a tour bus stop right around the corner  Staff was friendly and helpful  breakfast  included  was great  Room nothing fancy  but clean and well kept  I d stay there again Kelly

P =>   Nice clean and affordable I ve stayed here a few times and in different rooms  The rooms are clean  nice in decor and a good size  Breakfast isn t bad  just a continental so you get cereal  toast  croisants  fruit  yogurt  juices  tea and coffee and some jams and cheese etc    With the location and cost and what you get for your money this is a great hotel to stay at and I will continue to stay there when I am in London  
P =>   Gotta Hate Avni My husband and I stayed at this hotel recently for   nights  I would not recommend this hotel to anybody  The previous comments made were spot on The only thing good about this hotel is its location in South Kensington  which was very close to everything including restaurants  grocery stores and the Underground  However  there are many hotels in this area so you have a lot to choose from When we checked in  we were told to come back since the rooms were not ready yet  We asked the front desk staff  looks like it s a poorly run family business  if we could get a map of London  We were told that they didn t have any  I would think that most of their guests are tourists and I would think that they d be able to at least give you a city map  My husband and I had to go down the street to the riot to get a map of London and the concierge at the riot was a lot more helpful in terms of suggesting sites of interest in the area We stayed on the  st floor and as mentioned in other reviews  the walls are very thin and you can hear footsteps of the room above and people s conversation in adjacent rooms  There s a closet room in the hallway which is left open so feel free to grab a fresh and non smelly towel  The makeshift window covering wasn t working properly  The beds were too small and pillows too flat  I had to leave a note to ask the cleaning person to change our sheets and to supply us with soap and shampoo The pressure in the shower is good but don t drop the soap because if you bend down you won t be able to get back up and we re average sized people too  The towels stink like bleach so you better bring your own if you re planning on staying at this hotel The breakfast was ok  The coffee was basically instant coffee put into a coffee pots  The front desk staff were basically non responsive  You ask them a question and they pretend they don t understand you  
P =>   OK for   or   nights Has a well deserved bad reputation  as i suppose many other  star hotels in London Little difficult to write anything totally original although I do think that some of the reviews are a little forgiving  remember these people are running a business and some things are very easy to correct i e  very basic maintenance Pro s are   Location  near tube Gloucester Road and in a nice area  lots of good pubs and restaurants within a few mins walk Room size ok   compact  and relatively clean Bed comfortable Breakfast ok   plenty of cereals  toast  Fruit  etcCon s   Shower in room fairly pathetic water flow   although Hot No double glazing and rotting window framesMassive problem with damp in corner of room  which I would Guess runs down the whole side of the Hotel Some light fittings just hanging out of holes in the ceiling  I think some basic maintenance would sort out   Temperature is either too cold because of the window frames or too hot if you switch on the radiator which is hit or miss too work  it has a mind of its own and switches on and off on some unknown cycle Thin walls so can hear all sorts   may effect some but I sleep like the  proverbial dead  so didn t effect me I would stay again but max   nights and I wouldnt take my  better half    
P =>  Dont stay here Stayed at the Avni Hotel for   nights  The best thing about the Hotel is the location just a few minutes from the Tube station  The hotel however was terrible  There was no hot water for   nights out of     the lights in the room did not work when we arrived  The room was a box and a dirty one at that  makeup marks all over the walls the paint was peeling off there was no wardrobe just a little shelf with about   coat hangers   The description said you had tea and coffee making facilities which we did but there was no Milk and asked every day and never did get any  The staff were not overly helpful and did not want to know when we complained  The breakfast is served in the basement which is damp and smelly again paint peeling off the walls  My advise is to pay a little bit extra for somem comfort  I will not be staying at the Avni hotel again in afraid  
P =>  Nice location terrible hotel Lock box and curtain were broken in the room and repeated reminders from us and promises from staff brought no resolution  They did  however  read the printed instructions including all of the spelling and grammar errors  They didn t seem to appreciate that I UNDERSTOOD and followed the instructions and that the issue was that the instructions DID NOT WORK I fixed the curtain myself and did without the lock box  No reduction in price Staff could not agree on breakfast hours and seemed puzzled when I suggested that they simply post a sign  They did post a sign announcing a    pound penalty for loss of a key card  I decided to leave my key card at reception but the card seldom worked to open my room when I returned and retrieved it  The desk person explained me that the card was probably demagnetized by my credit cards of the gates in the tube  Neat trick from the shelf behind the desk  One time THEY lost the key at reception but did not appreciate my request that they pay ME a    pound penalty  When I travel  I learn a basic vocabulary in the local language  The Avni staff must recognize that the local language in London is English   my native tongue This was by far the highest cost and lowest quality and service of any of the hotels where I stayed during almost a month in Europe I WILL stay in the Earls Court area again  however  Some great restaurants  shops and pubs  Convenient by tube and bus to everything we wanted to see  Just avoid this hotel and other like it  Avni is clearly about making money and NOT about customer service  
P =>   Strategic location I think the best location to stay in London would be around gloucester station  Kensington  because the tube line from there connect you directly to lots of places of interest in central London  For this reason i chosed Avni hotel  The hotel lies in quite  amp  safe environment  no traffic sounds through your room s window  The breakfast is included with the room s price  amp  the bedroom is immaculate  It also has elevator  enough for     persons However  if you are the type of visitor who love to live in spacious room complete with AC  i won t suggest to stay in this hotel because it wouldn t live up your expectation  The room is tiny and non AC  eventhough they provide electrical fan   But hey  if you wanna pay below the     punds in such good location  I think you have to compromise for certain things isn t it Do not forget to dine or have lunch in the Singaporean restaurant nearby   quot The Bugis street quot  below the milennium hotel    they serve tasty  amp  mouth watering Asian cuisine for good prices  
P =>   Ok as long as you know what you are getting into    Paid roughly      per night which is too much for a hotel like this but it s London so what are you going to do  Motel   room size  Very simple furnishings  Only a few channels on the TV  Really just a set of converted apartments  Very nice  calm neighborhood but still a lot of noise from cars all night  Simple single pane windows don t help  We were on the mezzanine floor and when people were walking in the room above us it sounded like a heard of elephants  Staff was friendly Roughly   minutes walk from Gloucester Station and lots of restaurants and a few pubs Seems that unless you are willing to spend LOTS of money on a hotel  this is one of the best you will find  
P =>   B eware of Room       Beware of Room     and  according to a staff member  Room      Through some heating design or installation problem Room     and its ensuite become very warm  While this may be ok in winter  in spring or summer  the room becomes unbearably hot  We complained after the first night of our   night stay and moved to a much cooler and much smaller room  The housekeeper visited us in the new room to apologise  and told us that the problem rooms were only supposed to be used for one night stays  Which really typifies the attitude of the staff in this recently opened hotel  They just do not care about the customers and take no pride in their work or in their hotel  Do not expect assistance in connecting to the WiFi offered in the reception area or in response to any complaint Generally the facilities are reasonable quality  although some double rooms are tiny and should only be singles  and the breakfasts are adequate  but the whole place is let down by the staff  
P =>   Just ok for a short stay  The Avni Courtfield hotel is ok for a short stay of   or   days  but for anything longer I would look elsewhere The reception area was very disorganised  with luggage everywhere as there was no luggage storage room  It also looked temporary  with computer cables and cords everywhere  The room itself was quite large  with a small kitchenette downstairs  which was quite handy  with microwave  some cups and plates and cutlery  and a decent fridge  Upstairs  with a tiny spiral staircase  was the bedroom and bathroom  The living space was large  but the bathroom tiny  A couple of lounge chairs would have been a welcome addition  The free WIFI was a bonus  The worst thing about some London rooms is lack of airconditioning  and this was quite noticeable  The room was very hot  even though it was a mild day  One window in the room would not stay closed  it kept opening as the latch was broken  We asked if someone could come and fix it  and were told  quot There is nothing we can do  the maintenance staff are not coming until Monday quot   Eventually  someone did come and look and told us that the screw that was lying on the floor was the way to hold it shut  just use that  so it had obviously been broken for a while  They did not seem to understand that it was not secure  there was a terrace outside and people could have come in   and the attitude was essentially   quot what do you want us to do about it quot   I m not sure if I will stay at the AVNI again unless the rates are cheap  Overall it was comfortable  close to Gloucester Road Tube  and reasonably quiet  
P =>  Not bad for the price My husband and I stayed at the Avni for   nights in   I agree with most postings about this hotel  it is a good location  rooms are not bad for the price  They did try to go for the boutique hotel thing but seemed to have just missed in my opinion  Lobby is nice enough but hallways are narrow with scuffed up walls  and blue lighting on the stairs could have worked  but somehow doesn t  maybe its the carpet   The elevator is small and slow  The internet did not work in the rooms  you have to go downstairs and sit in the lobby to use it   Breakfast is included and a nice additional value but the music playing from the boom box in the buffet area could be a little quieter and perhaps something other than    s dance music would be more appropriate at  am  The reception staff was hit and miss   there was one man who was very helpful and willing to make us reservations for dinner  The other   weren t terribly willing to go out of their way to help  Maid service was prompt  Rooms themselves are good size  clean and functional although they could use another luggage rack  Last and most importantly  there is NO Air conditioning so the room was extremely hot and stuffy  even when it was about    degrees and raining outside   We were in a room on Floor   so perhaps its a bit stuffier than higher floors     Overall  not a bad value for money in a VERY expensive city but we wouldn t stay here again  
P =>   Clean Convenient Value Small Room but has everything you need  Good Location near Gloucester Rd Tube  Picadilly Circle District Lines   Great for Heathrow  Very Clean and Breakfast was fine  Lots of places to eat locally  Very good budget option  
P =>   A Good Choice You re not going to be impressed by the minimalist front desk or by the size of your room if you re used to North American standards  but everything else is about perfect for the practical traveller  The room was modern  clean  and comfortable  The washroom was clean and simple  The flat screen tv was just the right fit for the room  Hotel location is ideal  as many have pointed out  I found the    hour Tesco  Supermarket  across from the Gloucester station to be very convenient to grab snacks and sandwiches to go at very reasonable prices  Check out the Trobadour Cafe on Old Brompton road for a drink or meal  great atmosphere and was frequented by the likes of is Joplin and Jimi Hendrix back in the day  There are a couple of things that could be improved  The continental breakfast was adequate  but nothing special and full sized ironing boards would be preferrable to the mini ones that were provided by the front desk Overall  would not hesitate to stay at the Avni again  
P =>   Loved it  After doing alot of research I decided on the Avni in South Kennsington  I was extremely pleased with the room  service and location  A short walk from the Glouster Road tube  which then can get you anywhere in London with in minutes  So many great restaurants  stores  amp  pubs near by  The neighborhood is safe  amp  friendly  The room is modern and clean with your own bathroom  hairdryer  coffemaker  amp  TV  Having never been to England I relied on pictures  amp  reviews in making my decision  I was so scard I would end up in a small room in a bad area  I was so relieved when I steped off the tube to see a nice area  amp  great hotel  I will definately stay at the Avni if I ever get to England again  I am including a picture of the bathroom so you can get an idea of the size  and also a pic of the hotel  amp  a view from a block away  Have a great trip Cheers E  
P =>   Great little convenient Hotel A very reasonably priced room  twin   although I had booked a single    I paid     plus a booking fee for one night  The room was clean and fresh  a good bathroom  slightly small   but had all that I needed  with clean white fluffy towels  The room was good for one   if there had been two people it might have felt a bit cramped  But quite honestly for what I paid it was a bargain  I booked it very late and there was no choice about where to stay and I was pleasantly surprised  I was a single woman staying by myself in London and felt very safe  The hotel staff were helpful and courtious  Great location as it is close to Gloucester Road tube and close to most of the Museums  easy walking distance   I have paid much more at other hotels and been horrified   this was so different  Would definitely stay there again  Thank you for a good experience  
P =>   Nice Hotel We stayed in this hotel for   nights and thought it was great  The location is fantastic  literally a   minute walk to Gloucester road tube station  where you can get the picadilly line to Heathrow  or the circle line  very handy for most major sites   The room was clean and spacious  staff were very friendly and helpful  Only one minor complaint  there was no fridge in the room  which we usually like to keep cold water in  but for the very reasonable price  we didnt mind that       Would definitely stay again  
P =>  everyone is right  Me and my husband stayed at Avni for five nights in ch  All the London hotels reviews on this site were very helpful  so we didn t have many great expectations from our hotel stay  The room on the  th floor was really tiny  but it had everything you needed in it  hot water  adjustable heating  no noise from the neighbours  All windows in this victorian area of the town  full of other hotels  have single sheets of glass  so it is impossible that the streetnoise doesn t get inside  The TV signal had problems on wednesday and thursday  but from friday it was very OK  don t know why  didn t ask  The staff was very friendly  gave us immediately an extra blanket as we asked for one  Breakfast simple  but plenty of it  good coffee I think you can t expect much more for the money in any other London hotels of this category  You can stay there too  if you don t have a really bigger budget  
P =>   Mainly very good with a couple of niggles    Booked this hotel for its location and stylish look   boutique  no frills  It is walking distance from the South Ken museums  easy to find  close to the tube  in a quiet and  upmarket  part of town  The reception staff were friendly and helpful  let us check in early  and the room was clean and comfortable  The bathroom was spacious and shower good  everything we needed for the night s stay was provided  We had a bit of a laugh about the beds which were on casters and kept rolling around the room uncontrollably when we sat on them  Glad to say they behaved themselves when we slept and were very comfortable  with fresh clean cotton sheets Our biggest  niggle  was the TV  which was a state of the art lcd flatscreen but had a terrible signal and there were no watchable channels  The other niggle was that the breakfast croissants were a bit past it  Apart from these fairly unimportant things I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a very good value stay in central London  
P =>   Anvi Courtfield I stayed at the Avni for   nights in late uary and I think my review is probably going to contradict a lot of the other reviews both with good and bad points  I d also like to stress that a lot of the gripes in my review are either down to personal preference or are circumstantial and not necessarily a criticism of the hotel itself Firstly  I d like to say that this hotel s location cannot be faulted  It s in a respectable  safe area with excellent amenities and is only   minutes walk along pleasant streets to Gloucester St tube station which is on Central and District lines  amp  links directly to the Gatwick Express via Victoria  There are restaurants  supermarkets and many attractions are       minutes walk away including the V amp A  the Natural History Museum  the Science Museum  amp  the Albert Hall The hotel itself had a mixture of good and bad aspects in my experience The reception  whilst stylish  looks very makeshift and temporary   which is partly to do with the design of the desk   I know the reception desk shouldn t matter but first impressions count and despite the desk being made of marble  it looked like it had been placed there  just for now  and it s not a good look with pc wires trailing and staff being quite so exposed The staff on arrival were helpful  we arrived an hour early and although a room wasn t available  we were able to leave our bags at reception and return later in the afternoon The room we were allocated was on the  rd floor and I didn t find it small at all  I thought it a perfectly adequate size for a double room  although I can see how guests staying for more than a few days may struggle with the storage space  The rooms are decorated in a clean  simple  stylish manner with neutral colours The bed was far too soft in our opinion and we both woke with sore backs on both mornings  but I guess bed firmness is a personal preference  The bed only had   pillows between the two of us and only a sheet and one blanket which didn t seem enough bearing in mind it was uary in the UK  Perhaps spare blankets and pillows on top of the wardrobe might be an idea in colder months In saying that thouhg  the heating was a bit too efficient and more than made up for missing blankets The heating controls weren t the best and a guide to using them would maybe be helpful for other guests  The room was uncomfortably hot until  on the  rd attempt we worked out the combination of valves to be turned to switch it off  The room was clean and well decorated  although our panel tv had been put on the wall squint and had a terrible picture on   of   channels  We didn t bother to complain because we were out most of the time  but in retrospect I wish we had so that other guests might not be bothered Bathroom  it was clean  towels were clean  shower gel  soap and shampoo were provided   no complaints The one thing that was a major problem for us was the noise in the room  No noise travelled from either side  presumably due to thick walls  but the noise from above was absolutely awful  especially because we had the misfortune to be below a  am arrival with insomnia and a furniture rearranging obsession  There is also a lot of noise from the street but that s to be expected in London  I suggest earplugs for any future guests who are less than the deepest of sleepers Breakfast was nice enough  fresh fruit    types of cereal  yoghurts  sliced bread for toasting and croissants which weren t the freshest I ve ever tasted but perfectly edible  Coffee  tea  milk and preserves also available in a spacious breakfast room At the end of the day I have very mixed views about this hotel  as I say the location couldn t be faulted  the staff were helpful and generally friendly and a lot of what was wrong with my visit could be down to the room we were given and the guests there at the time  However  I do feel that a lot of things just weren t quite right and while you get what you pay for I d be tempted to say that  in some aspects this hotel is verging on a    and not a      hopefully the flaws will be ironed out as the hotel develops  it s not been open long and it could be a great wee place if the little things were looked at

P =>  Will Return My husband and I stayed for   nights at the Avni Kensington and throughly enjoyed our break  The rooms are very clean and stylish  with a modern bathroom  flat screen tv  plenty of cupboard drawer space and tea and coffee  and no unnecessary clutter with things like arm chairs or trouser presses  The breakfast is continental  with a good amount of choice and kept us going till lunch  The hotel is very reasonably priced for London and the rest of UK  We ve paid far more for a worse hotel The area is really lovely residental area and felt very safe  Surrounded by beautiful architecture  shops  banks  restaurants  pubs  amp  bars  museums  and a   min walk from Gloucester Road Station We will definitely be returning  
P =>   Good location would stay again  We just spent   nights at the Avni and would stay there again Not a tiny room  by London standards  when paying     per night Lovely clean bathroom and crisp sheets Tea and coffee facilities in room Well located in Kensington  merely a   minute walk to Gloucester Road tube and plenty of resturants and coffee shops in the local area A short walk to the Natural History musuem and not too far if you want to walk to Hyde Park or Harrods If there was a minus point  it would be that the breakfast was a bit poor  but im sure my body appreciated being fed fruit and cereal instead of a fry up   I can appreciate that some people would find the rooms a bit hot  but for us it was lovely  
P =>   Mumbai Sweatbox in England My family and I stayed for four nights and were on the  th floor  It was hot in the room   damn hot and no airconditioning  The only ventilation provided was via a small fan  Windows would only open about   inches  The location was great and the rooms were clean and modern  Breakfast was okay  Close to the tube  shops and restaurants  Staff were okay depending on who you spoke to  If you want to sleep in a sauna this is the Hotel for you   it s not for me  
P =>  Stay here if you don t mind risking your identity  This place should be closed down  Never have I been asked to pay the full amount up front and then had further  quot photo identity quot  documents demanded  Everything about this place is  quot Minimalist quot   Minimal courtesy  minimal space  minimal quality   the bedside lamp is nothing but an extremely cheap toy that has NO stability  the shower is claustrophobic  the bed  double  is against the window wall and enterable only from one side which means climbing over ones partner  the Lift says  quot Six persons max quot  But i was in it with one other slim man and   small children and we were all  quot connected quot   the heat was unbearable and the window opened only a few inches  the receptionist lied when asked  quot Who owns this Hotel quot   he said Bobby Cupro  it is in fact owned by Kaavan Puri  We were so disturbed by the whole experience we did not return for the remainder of our bookin  we checked out the following day and are still waiting for refund of cancelled booking   apparently the  quot Machine quot  isn t working  they asked for bank details    this place smacks of  quot Con quot  the photographs on their own site bear no resemblance to the reality  The review asks  quot would you recommend this hotel to a friend quot    quot I wouldn t recommend it to a Tramp  
P =>  Refurbished Minimalistic Hotel in a Great Location I stayed in the Avni Kensington for three nights  initially I was concerned because of some of the reports here  however I realised that many of these trip reports were made before the hotel had been refurbished so I decided to give it a go I had booked a deluxe double and was pleasantly suprised at how large the room was considering how cheap the rate was that I had paid  The room was very minimalistic  no fridge  tiny bathroom but everything was new and very clean  And the huge plasma tv on the wall was a suprise Breakfast is included in the rate  quite basic just toast  cereal and fruit  The location in Kensington is great  very close to supermarkets  restaurants and all the other amenities you need  Gloucester Road tube is   minutes walk away  which is convienient to getting around London  Especially the Piccadilly line which connects to Heathrow Airport This is not a luxury hotel  but for the price  location and standard of the room it is fantastic value especially for London  
P =>   Fair price great location friendly staff free Wi fi Stayed for   nights in ust       on the  th floor in a standard double room  Our floor and room were quite hot  about    degrees hotter than outside  but we didn t spend too much time in the room so it didn t really matter  The location of the hotel is very convenient  a   minute walk to Gloucester tube station  The staff were very friendly and helpful  and the free breakfast was a good budget and money saving advantage We would definitely stay here again  as it s one of the least expensive hotels in central London  and is located in a lovely area of Kensington  
P =>   Very Dirty We were three couples during three nights  Request rooms of the fifth plant  I was fortunate because these rooms are dirty but  reformed  recently  In my case  the shower had a hole and there were leaks for the light of the WC  first night was raining outside    and in our rooms  My partners  suffered  rooms of the second plant  Horrible  Dirty of not having cleaned them for a long time  The hotel s personnel don t make the bed  they only stretch the blanket  The best thing  the location  this is perfect  near the tube and five minutes far from the center of London  but I think that doesn t compensate the disgust that gives to sleep in their rooms  
P =>   Great Expectations This is what rates to go says   quot Kensington Edwardian is a charming and delightful hotel  with an exellent location to suit tourists and businessmen alike  Our Hotel is situated in between two underground stations giving our guests easy access to the whole of London  The Kensington Edwardian is also sited in one of the most fashionable and affable residential areas in London  It is only minutes away from a great shopping center  entertainment  leisure activities and dining out  The magnificent Kensington Gardens and The Royal Albert Hall are only Minutes away from the Kensington Edwardian Hotel  for our guests to enjoy  quot This is the truth   quot Kensington Edwardian is an extremely ugly hotel  with an exellent location to suit backpackers only  Our Hotel is situated close to Glouchester underground station giving our guests easy access to the whole of London  The Kensington Edwardian is also sited in one of the most fashionable and affable residential areas in London which really depresses you if you are on holiday wondering why you have to stay in a nasty hotel like that  It is only minutes away from a great shopping center  entertainment  leisure activities and dining out  The magnificent Kensington Gardens and The Royal Albert Hall are only Minutes away from the Kensington Edwardian Hotel  for our guests to enjoy  quot Allow me to explain  Tell the truth so we know what to expect  There will be no hopes  just expecting the worst  Staying in a backpackers lodge would have been much better since they both have bunk beds  
P =>  Value for money    After reading terrible reviews  we were dreading our stay at the Kensington Edwardian  It was  however  the cheapest hotel we could find and being    and skint  it seemed our best option  And so we took the risk and were     pleasently surprised   It was clean   tidy  quite spacious and the staff were very helpfull  We were not distubed at all by any other guests or members of staff  apart from the cleaner  and although we found it hard to find  we soon realised that it was a short distance away from the nearest tube station  The hotel was in a very convenient location as there were numerous places to eat and shop close by  Also  it was within easy access of the major attractions in London  Our room had a fridge  handy for storing alcoholic beverages  and laminate flooring  handy for mopping up spilled alcoholic beverages   The only problems we had was that the room was incredibly warm  although it was summer  and the shower pressure was crap  Also  a bin and a tv would have been appreciated  but for     a night we really enjoyed our stay  The hotel is perfect for students or anyone looking for somewhere decent to stay at a low price  We would not however reccomend the Kensington Edwardian for couples or families with small children Han D   Han L   Nik   Sal    
P =>  Wouldn t Recommend it I ll begin with the negative  We booked a double bed and were given two twin size beds  Our room had a nice view of the street  which is a nice neighborhood  However  with no air conditioning and no fans  it was very hot  If you opened the door to the balcony  the sound of cars on the street below kept you awake  Also  the balcony was shared with another room  so the fear that someone could break in to the room was always present  A room in the back of the hotel could have been quieter  There was not a TV in the room  and the sink in the bathroom didn t drain very well  The breakfast room looked very bright and cheery on Expedia  but the first morning we went down to breakfast  I literally cried  It was sad and dingy and the smell was terrible  Now  for the positive  The hotel was in a nice neighborhood  and was a short walk to the Tube and several restaurants and grocery stores   There was an especially great    hour grocery right across from the entrance to the Tube   As long as you don t mind a lack of sleep and aren t planning on staying in your room very much  which we did not   this would be an alright place to stay  
P => Good value The reviews for this hotel were terrible and we thought that it had been a big mistake to book here  but we were pleasantly surprised  We had a superior double and single room and they were both clean and serviced on a daily basis  The bathrooms and towels were clean and there was hot water at all times  The staff were friendly and helpful  The location of this hotel is perfect for visiting London  We found it to be excellent value for money  
P =>  only as a last resort  i don t know how this rat trap got   stars  if this was in the states the place woulda been shut down  honestly  this is just a horrible  horrible place  if i had to choose between staying here and the local prison     it would be close  
P => The filthiest hotel I have ever stayed in I have stayed in    foreign countries throughout Europe  Hawaii  and Scandinavia  If I had not paid for this hotel in advance  without seeing it  I never would have stayed there  The windows were covered by filthy sheer curtains hanging on a line of string  The carpet was disgusting and there was matter on the walls that looked as if someone had blown their nose on the walls  The beds were terrible and like trying to sleep in a cylinder  At the time I stayed there the flags on the front of the building were tattered and dirty  I just felt like I didn t want to touch anything there Beware   I will say that the people at the front desk were nice  but I would never stay there again nor recommend anyone else doing so  
P =>  Don t be afraid  This hotel served our needs well  The reviews scared us  but it was ok  This hotel is being renovated  the staff is really trying hard to fix it up  Our room was very clean  and the employees were always friendly and helpful  We had a room for   people    single beds  cots  really  not the most comfortable  but not terrible   small tv  and a tiny bathroom  The shower was our biggest gripe  water didn t drain well  no soap dish  and a flimsy shower curtain that fought hard to keep the water in the shower  but lost  However  the water was hot for all four of our showers each day  and we saw none of the dreaded mold talked about in other reviews  Each day when we returned to our room  it was immaculate  beds made with fresh linens  floor washed  and there were fresh towels and such waiting for us  Also  there is a computer room off the lobby with internet access for a pound per    minutes  The hotel is in a great and very safe neighborhood  a few blocks from lots of restaurants  and more important  from the underground station and bus stops  Our desk clerk told us about breakfast offered at the hotel next door for only two and a half pounds  a full English breakfast with more food than we could possibly finish  AND free coffee refills    which were not available anywhere else we went  unless we paid another two pounds for each refill   That was a great find  So  really  don t be afraid  If you don t need fancy but just want something convenient  safe  clean  and comfortable enough  with a great staff  this is the place for you  
P =>  Lovely European place The hotel it s a nice place with an increrible location for get around easily in the city  Like all european place it has a small space but well use it  It s clean and the service it s complete increrible  Also the staff it s polite and educated and all the time are happy to help you  I spend a wonderfull time there and I ll staid there again when I travel to London  
P =>   Good location very accessible Very convenient location  near the tube  a main road in to London close by  big supermarket round the corner  Friendly bunch too   Seemed prety cheap compared to some of the other hotels in the area  
P =>  Watch Out    An Awful Place     This is the most nasty and filthy place I have ever seen  If you think this is a  hotel  as you find elsewhere and intend to make booking  you have to think twice before making up your final decision  The quality and standard of accomodation  and the facilities inside the room were completely not what were listed and depicted in the hotel web page and the attached photos  Other than the dirty wall  carpet  bedsheets  the room was filled with a strong unpleasant odour  making you feel uncomfortable and difficult to stay there for a second  Inside the wardrobe  you could find dirt in every corner  The washrooom was another terrible place  The bowl was not clean and the shower hose was punctured and disconneted from the shower head  When you requested the two memebers of staff in the reception to replace the shower hose  they looked motionless and took no heed to your request  Indeed  their manner were unfriendly and cool  Furthermore  you could see furniture being left in the corridor and lobby  posing threat to the fire exit  You could also feel some vibration when the only one lift was going up  As my family could not stand for the unbearable condition inside the room  we checked out the hotel only after an hour of check in This is my experience  I will never go back and doubt how this hotel was rated  Two Stars   If you are constrained by your budget  this is not the only choice for you  
P =>  Danger       DANGER  DANGER Do not stay here  The place is absolutely filthy  In addition to some questionable people staying there  This hotel gives a bad impression of the Brits and London  Should be closed down and sold  DO yourself a favor and listen to these reviews  You ll be glad you did  Beyond my comprehension how this place rates   stars  I guess the one stars must be in Bagdad          
P =>  Stay away    One of the worst experiences we ve ever had in a hotel and we ve stayed in a lot of them  The room was so dirty we were hesitant to sleep in it and the staff was un friendly un pleasant and un helpful at best  
P => DO NOT stay in this hotel   I unfortunately only discovered this website AFTER I stayed at the Kensington Edwardian Hotel  Let me sum up  and agree with all the other reviews written about this hotel  IT IS TERRIBLE  Whatever you do  do not waste your money on this excuse for a hotel  It s a disgrace to London tourism and the authorities should do something about it  
P =>  Fawlty Towers without John Cleese  I m certain the bedspread had never been washed or cleaned  Everything dingy and dusty  Big deal they give you an electric hot water pot but the cord was so short you had to heat the water on the floor because the cord was too short to reach the table    How many ways can one spell D U M P  
P => Shabby It is a pity that I did not come across the reviews about this hotel before I booked and paid for my rooms over the internet  As we had already paid for the room when I booked it   months earlier  my wife and I decided to put up with what we had  Nothing seems to have changed from what other reviewers have written The plus points for this hotel that its location is a nice and quiet area  is within    minutes walk to the underground station  is relatively cheap  bed linen and towels are clean  and the  complimentary continental breakfast  is basic and OK  Even though our room was next to the lift we were lucky not to be disturbed by lift movements As soon as we signed in at reception we were told to use the lift  elevator for US guests  nearest to reception because the adjoining elevator was not working  Having read the past reviews it would appear that they have had only one lift in operation in      and       You have to be good friends to get more than   people without luggage into the lift  On the third floor  the external lift down button does not work  You have to press the up button to call the lift  so that you can then press the internal button to go to ground floor  When you are in the basement there is no external up button for the lift  There is a hole where the button should be  As soon as we entered the room     on the third floor we were shocked at the shabby appearance of the room  As it was Wimbledon tennis week the first thing I noticed was that there was no TV  I decided to go down to reception to ask why we did not have a TV  I had to use the stairs to go down because the lift did not arrive when I pressed the DOWN button several times  As I mentioned earlier  the DOWN button does not work on the third floor  The receptionist said that all TVs were removed because the hotel was having power problems  The receptionist delivered a working TV about    minutes later  A few minutes after checking in we decided to make a hot drinks  The tea and coffee making facilities consisted of an electric kettle perched on a tiny flimsy plastic shelf  the depth of which was slightly smaller than the base of the kettle  On it was a transparent flexible plastic cup and a cup holder which was too small for the cup  I told the receptionist that it would be unsafe to pour boiling water into this cup and still be able to handle it  We asked for   ceramic cups instead of the single plastic cup  The receptionist who brought us the TV agreed to provide us with proper cups  When the cups did not arrive I had to go to reception to remind him  He appeared to be the only staff member in the hotel and therefore he did all the chores  When making a hot drink you either place your cups and saucers on the floor or on the TV  It is not easy for elderly people to use the floor when making hot drinks  Using the top of the TV is unsafe  but we took extra care   There was no other flat surface on which to place our cups of hot drinks The floorboards are very squeaky and the floor had not been introduced to a vacuum cleaner for some days  The paint on the wooden door frames were peeling and bits of it were on the carpet  There were brown streaks on the wall  and the where the wall joins the ceiling  This suggests that there must have been a water overflow on the floor above  The wardrobe s louvered doors were very dusty and the appearance of the inside prevented us from hanging our clothes inside  There were several trailing electric cables along the wall and floor  The sink in the bathroom was chipped and had a crack across it  The tiles around the bath was covered in black mould and one of the white ceiling panels was almost rust brown  If you sit on the toilet you elbow will knock against the shower screen over the bath  and if you bend forward to touch your feet your head will hit the sink  There is self service breakfast in the basement  To get to this room you had to go through an empty damp smelling room which had part of its ceiling missing  The person in charge of breakfast obviously has no training  Tea is available in an insulated jug  and coffee is in a stainless steel pot  It would normally be the other way around  You can tell which is which only by sniffing the containers or pouring them into cups  There are stainless steel spoons for cereal  plastic spoons for stirring your tea or coffee  fish knives for spreading jam and butter on toast rolls croissants  In my experience hotel rooms always have a safety notice on the door inside the room  Such a notice will explain to the occupants where to go in case of a fire alarm  and a layout of the rooms is shown on a diagram  There was no such notice in our room  but there were half a dozen staples on the door The door to our room and the neighbouring room were in darkness because the light outside our doors did not work The dust bin ash tray outside the lift on our floor and in the basement  had not been emptied between the day we checked in and the day we checked out     hours When talking to some American guests I understand that when they complained about their room on a lower floor they were  upgraded  to a room on the fifth floor  Unfortunately some of their party had to put up with rooms like ours  I am British and I felt that foreign tourists will get a poor impression of British tourist hotels after their experience here For a relatively small expense per room  the rooms could be made more pleasant and welcoming  even though they are small

P =>  Avni Luxury aparments   good value for money but beware the double bed  Great part of London  close to the tube and other transport  The apartments are newly refurbished  The only issue I had was the double bed   if there are two of you staying and you are used to a queen bed  or a king  it will be a real squeeze The free wireless connection was a bonus and one of the main reasons I booked the apartments  The front desk staff speak limited English  but as there wasn t anything I particularly needed  that wasn t too problematic  
P =>   Fantastic would stay there again I am really fussy  but I really liked this apartment for it s value  The location was great  as you can catch the train directly from Heathrow to Gloucester Tube Station  The local area is lovely  and easy access to the rest of London  The bedroom and living area with kitchen was spacious and really good value for money  The decor was quite modern  but a little worn out from previous patrons  I think a really good clean and the walls could do with a fresh coat of paint  But all in all  a really fab place to stay  
P =>  Convenient Spacious great value modern Avni serviced apartments off Gloucester Road is probably the best accomodation I have stayed in London thus far  I m primarily here for business and it s nice to have a self contained apartment that feels like a home away from home  It s literally    footsteps away from the tube station and it s close to supermarkets  drycleaners  pharmarcies  late night restaurants etc I got the one bedroom apartment  the studio seemed too small   for      per night on wotif com and I was given the corner apartment at the end of the corridor  I ve read reviews about the noise issue but I didn t hear my neighbours at all  probably because I was in the corner  and the street noise was also minimal It has a living room  with sofa bed if you need it   dining set  large flatscreen with cable  a full kitchen with all the utensils and kitchenware you need  a large fridge  The Bedroom is small but still has built ins  dressing table and large flatscreen TV with cable  The blankets are a comfortable duvet and pillows are great The bathroom is small but very clean  with a great shower  good pressure    They also provide salon quality hairdryers   which is important for a girl like me  Normal hotel hairdryers wheeze loudly and take hours to dry anything On top of everything  free wifi  so I m always connected  with both my laptop and my iphone  The staff were all extremely friendly  I didn t ask for help with anything   there was nothing else I needed  
P =>   Poor Service Very poor front desk service and terrible rooms  had a room on the front and you can hear the noise all night  Combine this with changing rooms and then going to a room with ajoining room and people making noise all night Told the front desk and they weren t even bothered Overpriced and not worth it  stay in the holiday inn instead  
P => 
P =>  Aww       Bless them      These people try so hard    Bless them I went to the Avonmore with a my mate Dave  we needed somewhere to put our heads down in between getting drunk and watching Blur in Hyde Park   and that was it  For    quid a night in the centre of London i really didnt expect much so i thought the Avonmore was fine The staff are flippin lovely  the slightly camp fella on reception always had a smile on his face and a genuinely interesting line of chat for us  The foreign lady who ran the breakfast room was smart  alert and fairly efficient  She could do with a pen and pad though as she kept forgetting our order   but then again we were speaking English and it s obviously not her strongest point  They all felt genuine that was the main thing  like they actually gave a damn about the place  Most chain franchise style cheap hotel s staff look like they re paid to grin inanely and make crap small talk nowadays The hotel itself  Hmmm     well      You cant polish a turd but you can keep it clean and tidy  The decor was tired and mismatched  the furniture even more so   apart form the beds actually which were very comfy  The ensuite was bloody awful  but clean    the shower curtain was minging and it was hard to sit on the loo without banging your knees on the opposite wall  Plus the fan didnt work so a bog the size of an understairs cupboard gets very hot  very quickly  We thought all the furniture was crooked till we realised the floor was actually sloping in from the edges as all the joists are obviously bowing with the age of the place  I ve got a bigger screen on my mobile than the telly in the room too  plus the wardrobe only had    mismatched   natch  coat hangers in it  The room was in fact tiny   especially since it was supposed to be a triple  The view was bloody awful too   but then again it is central London So in summary  It s a dump  But it s a CLEAN dump  with lovely staff  comfy beds  and a great cooked breakfast all for    quid a night  If you re after a romantic break or even a family friendly base   avoid  If you need somewhere to get a kip in between racing around the heady sights of London you really have got a diamond in the rough here  
P =>   Nice hotel free WIFI within easy walking distance to centre Secured my stay for an excellent cost  considering it was Valentine s weekend  We stayed on the top floor  although there was a steep climb  this didn t cause any problems   The bedroom was en suite  with tea coffee facilities  The room was clean  comfortable  with free WIFI access  which is very rare in a hotel   well done   The breakfast provided was of excellent quality with fresh toast  Other options were cereal  yoghurts  fresh fruit and a selection of fruit juices  The reception staff were polite  helpful   these had been excellent in the past when I had e mailed for advice information  prior to my travel  A good place to stay  if your needs are simple and you re on a tight budget  
P =>  OK but no great shakes Friendly people  helpful with directions and travel information  Good location eg for Eurostar  Tube  British Museum and Oxford Street  Clean but very basic  eg no clothes hooks in the bathroom  no bedside lamps  blankets not duvets etc  A bit overheated  Breakfast standard B amp B fare  
P =>  Friendly staff fair service for a room in this location and price range  For this price in London you have to expect small rooms and having to carry your cases up the stairs  My boyfriend and I stayed here for only one night and I wouldn t want to stay here for a week  but for what we wanted it was fine  We stayed on the very top floor and there was a bit of a climb up a slim staircase to get there  The bathroom we were given was across the hall but we were given a key to maintain privacy so this was fine  It could do with some modernisation but was clean and comfortable  The breakfast provided was basic however we were offered refills of tea coffee and fresh toast  other options were cereal and fresh fruit  The bloke that checked us in was polite and helpful and told us in peak season they offered a full English breakfast  A good place to stay for one or two nights if your needs are simple and you re on a tight budget  
P =>   Beware you have the right one  There are   Avonmore hotels in London  One on Avonmore Rd    star  and one in Cartwright Gardens  terrible   Unfortunately for me I didn t appreciate this when reading the reviews and was booked into the Cartwright Gdns one  This was terrible  The staff may have been friendly but it didn t make up for tired and worn decor  old and shabby rooms  The room had not even as much as a telephone or bedside light  Make sure you choose the correct one as I suspect most reviews relate to the   star hotel  On the same street at the same prices are clean and modern hotels if this suits your budget  I m not fussy but this is the worst I have ever been too  we spent the evening trawling around other hotels to book in  This was booked for a course  We cancelled for the second visit to the course and found somthing much better  
P =>   Wonderful friendly staff Great location  Worn rooms but very clean and friendly  Highly recommended  
P =>  hotel sobre mais tout   fait correct  
P =>   Fantastico     
P =>   ok   mit einigen Abstrichen

P =>   A hidden gem Just stayed here this past weekend  and what can I say  It was lovely  My only regret is sleeping through the free breakfast  It is within walk able distance of   tube stations and its a lovely area  Rooms are small but very clean and just enough space is provided   I didnt feel cramped or anything  its very good value for        for one night  I only needed a bed this one was more than sufficient and basic hotel amenities were present in the room  It was quaint   very English   although I believe it was Chines folks that own it   the staff were very friendly  There are a million stairs and NO lift so if you have extra baggage be aware you will have to carry it up   flights of stairs    also the walls are paper thin so again if you are a light sleeper bring ear plugs  haha Altho when I went   I think I may have been the last guest to get in so no one kept me up  I REALLY LIKE THIS PLACE AND WILL BE STAYING THERE AGAIN IF I HAVE A MINI WEEKEND IN London          
P =>   We Slept Just Fine  Each morning we awoke  showered and headed for the breakfast area  This B amp B is not in the US and the service  like everywhere else in London  is what it is  The staff were more than accomodating  as well as polite  If you are truly on vacation  then all you are really doing is sleeping there  which is exactly what my wife    year old daughter and I did  It s not like we were staying at a resort  We were in London to see London  The Tube was within a     minute walk and then you could virtually go everywhere  Shame on those people who bad mouthed the Avonmore  My only gripe would be that I wish they had a lift  Quite the     story walk at the end of a long day  Cheers to you  Victor and staff  We would definetely be your guests again  
P =>  Very Rundown After reading glowing reviews in   guidebooks  we booked a room at the Avonmore unfortunately before reading reviews on Trip Advisor  Then it was too late because of their   week cancellation policy  So we decided we d make the best of it  The pictures on the web site are terribly outdated  I m sure the hotel was a lovely place at one time   a long time ago  I don t thing they ve touched the place in    years  The carpet is stained  The wallpaper is peeling  The drapes are ancient and dirty  The towels  although clean  are frayed  And the place is in a rundown  but safe and quiet  neighborhood  There really aren t many restaurants or pubs withing a decent walking distance  And West Kensington is pretty far outside of London  No way can you walk to the city  You have to take the tube or a bus  But the sheets were clean and the staff was very accomodating  and the breakfast was good  The maddening thing was we paid the same as we would have paid to stay in a much better and more conveniently located place  Only stay here if you get a really good deal   
P =>   Perfectly nice hotel I stayed at the Avonmore while attending a conference at Olympia  I much preffered the experience to that of staying in the large chain hotels nearby as I have done in previous years The hotel isn t luxurious  but it s clean  comfortable and the staff are polite and helpful  Breakfast was very good  
P =>  Reasonably pleasant stay Just returned from a stay at the Avonmore Hotel  I d give it a bit of a mixed review   the hotel is somewhat shabby  the rooms are small and the staircases quite steep going up to small rooms  The toilet took a long time to refill  so sometimes didn t flush consistently  The website definitely makes it look more luxurious than the reality  The staff  however  was very lovely and helpful  the breakfast was good  the hotel was clean  the rooms made up promptly  and the single beds were comfortable  West Kensington is a residential neighborhood a little outside central London  the hotel is a      minute walk to both the undeground and buses that go directly into the center of the city   Need to figure on about    minutes on the Tube or bus   There is a very good Turkish restaurant nearby  as well as several local pubs  but otherwise not a big restaurant or shopping area  
P =>   Watch out for their cancellation policy We never stayed in the  quot hotel quot  and reading the other reviews I am so happy we cancelled  But they have the most absurd cancellation terms I ve ever come across  We booked on a Monday for the following Wednesday to Sunday  We called the next day to cancel and we were told that since we hadn t cancelled    days in advance          we will be charged one night s rate So  my advice  Go to a Holiday Inn Express  there are plenty in London  and for about the same price you get a lovely  modern room and a normal    hour cancellation policy  
P =>   Terrible and filthy By the time we carried the luggage with significant difficulty up four flights of stairs  last of which was in the dark  to enter a poorly furnished  very musty smelling room  we phoned another hotel  secured a room  and immediately left  There was hair in the bed and it appeared the sheets had not been changed  There was significant mildew in the bathroom  and noisy trains just outside the window  This is advertised as a four star hotel awarded by AA UK  but in fact it had some years earlier been awarded a four diamond rating  and the diamond ratings have not been in use for at least two years   meaning it has not received a new AA UK rating  Their cancellation policy is being contested with the credit card vendor for a refund of the because the accomodations were totally unacceptable  and the photos and advertising are incorrect and misleading at the least  
P =>   Quirky little gem of a hotel This place has its quirks   the rooms are VERY basic  the queen sized bed was actually two singles pushed together and was a bit lumpy  the staff is ragtag  and the bar is a story unto itself We loved the location  It is situated on a quiet street in Kensington  If you are looking to actually relax after a day of touring around and or a night of pub crawling  the Avonmore is perfect for you  Yes  the tube runs through the backyard  but the windows are double glazed and we never found it to be an issue  our sleep was never distrubed by the noise  There is a small selection of restaurants in the area   Persian  Chinese  greasy burger shop   amp c  There are a few cute pubs that also serve meals  The tube station is a quick walk from the hotel  making it easy to get to any attraction you may be interested in seeing  The staff is adorable  Someone should base a sitcom around this place  There is  quot Helga quot   we nicknamed her that   the Amazon Angelica Huston lookalike who seems to be the maid and the cook  and a fine cook  we enjoyed breakfast each day    She walks around barefoot quite a bit  Then there is the tiny Asian night bartender  who measures out shots in a bottle cap  The proprietress is very chatty and sweet  She also has an affection towards skintight jeans   meow  Overall  a great experience  Loved the quiet location  The place could use a bit of TLC  but is kept clean  The rates are cheap as chips  so one cannot expect luxury  When looking to stay outside of the noise of touristy spots  yet have easy access to attractions restaurants nightlife  pick the Avonmore  
P => Cheap and not so cheerful Price and location  especially for Olympia and Earls Court  are great  but the hotel is very tired  Everything is poorly maintained  carpets are warn  blankets on beds are old  building itself needs a lot of TLC and problems with water pressure in top rooms  i e  no water coming out of shower Staff are overall friendly and helpful  but there are just not enough of them  In the morning one girl does all the cooking and serving leading to rather Faulty Towers situations and delays   do NOT be in a hurry in the morning and do not expect to be served at the same time Hotel is certainly not appropriate for anybody who is not fully mobile  as there are several stairs to get anywhere in the hotel  
P =>  Disappointed We stayed at the Avonmore hotel in tember  The website for the hotel is much nicer than it actually is  The room was a good size  but the property has not been maintained at all  The bathroom was tiny and if it had functioned properly  the size would have been okay  The shower door looked like a second hand one as it was much too large for the shower and so the door did not close all the way  The worst part was the toilet didn t flush most of the time The closest tube station is West Kensington  about a    minute walk  The hotel is not really near any restaurants as it is in a mostly residential area  Although this was a clean hotel  there must be nicer ones out there for a price of    pounds per night  
P =>   very pleasant experience Room was small and basic  but sufficient for needs  Overall it was clean Staff more than made up for lack of luxury  They were extremely pleasant and courteous at all times  Good for anyone needing bed and breakfast in town Breakfast menu could be expanded but I understand this is being addressed in the near future 
P =>   Be wary We booked   rooms with this hotel  It was probably the poorest accommodation we have stayed in for the price paid Good points    Staff friendly and helpful   Beds comfortable    Well placed for access to buses and tubeBad points    On arrival  the main door was out of use due to a broken lock and was to remain so for our stay  so we had to access via the basement door    One room was on the first floor  with the two remaining on the  th  The stairway was extremely narrow  with glass fire doors  one of which was consistently wedged open  this was done by the owner right in front of me   presenting an extreme fire hazard as there was no other way out other than to jump from the  th floor    The rooms appeared clean on first sight  and indeed the sheets and pillow cases were  but the blankets and bedspreads were stained and appeared not to have been washed for some time    Some of our beds were made on the second day  but one was left unmade  only   milk capsules left on arrival for   people  but   on  nd day  There was no hot water on the  nd day but this was fixed quickly after speaking to the person on duty    The breakfast was disappointing  Cereal was either museli or cornflakes of which we ordered the latter   they were clearly cheap alternatives and tasted awful  We then had cooked breakfast which was actually quite tasty  but the sausages were poor quality and there were no tomatoes  as advertised   and no veggie option  The food is prepared and cooked to a small kitchen right next to the dining room  with the door wide open which is a little off putting    On checking out we were asked to pay by cash  something I notice other guests have been asked to do   We didn t have the      plus required in cash so the Visa was accepted in the end  Very odd       One of my party was in a  th floor room and was kept awake for over   hours by the noise of a TV coming from a neighbouring house  in addition to the trains to the rear of the hotel and traffic noise to the front    Generally the decor was very dated and shabby  towels frayed and old  bathrooms contained mould and needed more attention paid to the cleaning of themOverall  I would say that the websited is quite misleading  and guests should be warned that the tube runs directly behind the hotel  and the road is fairly busy to the front  It should also be noted that there is no lift  and therefore is not suitable for elderly  or unfit infirm  people  The staff  however were very polite  and did remedy any immediate problems we had  I do think the hotel would benefit from a visit from an hotel inspector very soon   I would not stay here again 
P =>   Cheap and cheerful Location  Within walking distance of Kings Cross or Euston Squre tube as I required  Most of nearby buildings in Cartwright gardens are also hotels Staff  Friendly and welcoming  Ownership has recently changed  according to the manager on duty Room  Small but clean  There were some renovation works going on in other parts of the hotel Security  Although I had no problems  I was concerned about leaving valuables in the room  I got a warning from the manager on duty not to allow strangers into the building Value  Good  as expected for    GBP  
P =>   Awful breakfast  I feel a real need to comment on this bed and breakfast   I will start with the positive  The room was clean and large  The location is close to west kensignton tube station The negative  for     a night it was rather expensive and the breakfast wasn t worth it  Firstly we went down to breakfast in the morning and there wasn t a table avaliable  We had to wait as there were only   tables  and nine guest rooms    We were told we would have to share a table  My mums coffee was like sludge  it was undrinkable and had grounded beans at the bottom  The breakfast took    minutes to appear  The musesli was way too sweet and the scrambled egg was rock hard  it had been left in the pan for ages   The girl informed my mum that they didn t do mushrooms  There was no vege option instead of sausage and bacon  There was one girl serving  cooking and keeping an eye on reception  They should definitely employ more staff  I have stayed in many b and b s and hotels on my travels around the world but none as bad as this  
P =>  The most filthy hotel I ve stayed in The carpets were dirty  The blankets were filthy  There was no top sheet  I had to call for one  There were no pads on the mattresses  only the bottom sheet  The TV did not work  The railroad was very loud outside the window  so the window could not be opened for air  The bacon at breakfast was rancid and smelled up the whole room  Need I go on  
P =>  disgusting Date            I have reserved and confirmed a triple bed room with en suite  When I arrived  the room is fully occupied  We are then re located to another room with train rail outside  Every few minutes  there should be a train going through   very noise and can t sleep Since we arrive at night and are very tired  we entered the room and felt asleep  In the next morning  we find that the bed sheets are very dirty and the blanket  the cover are very dirty  They seem no be washed for years  I am very disappointed with this hotel and leave as quickly as I can Stephen Tang 
P =>   Little gem of a hotel I wanted a clean and well located B amp B with a private bath near a subway station  Avonmore was all of that and more  because the persons who staffed the front desk and the dining room were very personable and always helpful  The price of the room was very fair in the middle of the summer tourist season  I would stay there again  
P =>  Cute and Cosy We stayed here  after much trepidation  during the abnormal heat wave in early   We were worried because of mixed reviews on this and other sites  But we had no cause for worry  The staff was extremely pleasant  the meals wonderful  and the facilities were large  clean and comfortable  We had the large bedroom in the front of the hotel  and if there were trains we never heard any  The only downside is the lack of elevators  so pack lightly if you have to go to the third floor The location was brilliant   close to tube station and nearby main roads  garet was a warm and helpful hostess and we would certainly be willing to return there  Quiet and safe locale  
P =>  Acceptable accomodations If you prefer a quiet location  as long as you aren t in the back where the trains rattle past  off the beaten tourist track  then the Avonmore is acceptable and reasonably priced for London The breakfast is good  rooms clean  service good Make sure your room is on the  nd floor in the front  or it will be quite a haul getting your luggage up the stairs The only downside  really  is the area  West Ken is not an overly popular tube spot and the district line is not one of the more efficient of the tube lines  and in terms of eating  there is basically nothing in the area except the excellent Three Kings  which  being the only pub of note in the area  is always packed However  these are only observations  not complaints  Overall  not a bad experience for the value  
P => Excellent Staff Enjoyed the stay The staff and attention to detail are simply wonderful  This was my first visit to London and garet is an excellent source of information about the city and surrounding area especially transportation options including the underground or tube  She is an outstanding cook and breakfast is top notch experience  This was a business trip and my meetings took place at the nearby Olympia Exhibition Centre  It was truly a delight to stay here and avoid the typical cookie cutter hotel chains  The hotel is very clean and I enjoyed the neighborhood atmosphere  The hotel does not have an elevator or lift so pack lightly  I would stay here again for business or vacation  garet and the staff make the difference and go the extra mile for customer service R  Vargha  Durham  North Carolina  USA 
P =>  Warm welcome but Friendly staff  excellent breakfast  good location  room ok  but on  th floor  no lift  very small staircases and just   way out Never again  
P =>   An Outstanding Value The breakfast was outstanding  the rooms excellent  the location near the West Kensington Underground convenient  five minutes   and the personality and experience of the staff  especially owner garet McKenzie  near perfect  Our five night stay could not have been more pleasant  If you are looking for a negative  there is no lift and you might have to carry your bags up four flights  but  on the other staff  the staff will probably help you carry the bags  And when we were waiting for a taxi to Heathrow  garet went out of her way to provide us tea and a newspaper  
P =>  Friendly Staff   Clean Economic London Lodging We were greeted upon our arrival at the Avonmore hotel by Aggie a very helpful and friendly member of the hotel s staff  Aggie provided excellent service throughout our   day stay in ust  Our room was located up many stairs but was a clean and reasonably sized room for Europe  The hotel is located direcly on a tube train line so you will hear train activity into the night and starting early in the morning if you have a room in the back of the hotel  The noise was loud but could be adequately blocked with the windows closed  The hotel is located within an easy walk to the West Kensington tube station and or the Olympic bus stop  My friend and I were able to walk all the way to Kensington Palace but it is a haul  The neighborhood appeared safe and we felt comfortable walking alone both day and night  The English breakfast was hearty and filling and a great way to start the day  Overall  I felt that the Avonmore hotel provided a reasonably priced room with easy access to London and a friendly  accommodating staff  I would stay at the Avonmore on a future trip to London  
P => Charming Little Band B My husband and I spent two weeks at the Avonmore Hotel in London  We were given a quiet and nicely decorated room      on the first floor  The owner  garet  and her staff were very friendly and helpful  The full English breakfast was generous  eggs  Canadian bacon  sausage  cereal  toast  juice  coffee and tea  The only inconveniences were the stairs with no lift and the required  quot cash only quot  payment at the conclusion of our stay                 
P =>  Friendly Staff at the Avonmore My family of five stayed at the Avonmore for    nights  We very much enjoyed the hospitality we received   garet accomodated us with special breakfast items  helped us to hire a car  and assisted in finding a place to do our laundry  The value was great  We slept very well in the quiet neighborhood and really felt at home at the Avonmore  
P => Great for the Older Crowd  We enjoyed our stay at the Avonmore  The staff was excellent and very accomodating to our needs  The breakfast was very good  We did find the accomodations a little older than we expected and further from the heart of things  It was located in a neighborhood with few restaurants or pubs close by  Probably a better location for the  older crowd  and not those who stay out later into the evening  
P =>  A Big Fat Resounding No  Arrived at the Avonmore to find that it was nothing like described on the Internet  Checked into room     Shower head was totally clogged with limescale and the hose was kinked so that hardly any water would come out  see photo   and the shower door wouldn t close  Tried to make tea   a black lump of something fell out of the kettle  Hair dryer didn t work  Worst of all  the bedspreads  decorative pillows and draperies were gray with dirt  see photo   Seat covers were stained  see photo   My girlfriend and I had made a reservation for   nights but I checked out the next morning  before my friend arrived  because I knew she would hate it  That s when it got really ugly  The young girl at the desk told me she would have to charge us for the full   nights or she would lose her job  She said there is a    day cancellation policy  This was news to me  This policy is NOT stated on the website  nor was it communicated to us when the reservation was made via e mail  I politely told her to go ahead and charge it  but that I would pay for one night and contest the following   nights  She called the owner and handed the phone to me  The owner started yelling   very unprofessional  I left and checked into another hotel  When I returned to the U S   our credit card company disputed the credit card charge  The hotel owner then produced an e mail advising us of the cancellation policy  Here s the thing   that e mail was never received  Not only that  it did not follow the  thread  of the e mail conversation  AND it was written in perfect English whereas the other e mails were written in broken English  This e mail was a fabrication  The hotel owner s bank  however  refused to bend because of the production of the said e mail  and we were charged for the full   nights  It still makes me sick to my stomach  I lived in Britain for    years   I know what to expect from a London hotel  This is not it  Traveller beware  
P =>  London planning for the Olympics      We were visiting family in the U K  and planned to spend a few days ahead touring London with   of our sons  aged    and     Having experienced London and European hotels in the past  I was anxious to see travel reviews from consumers in addition to the often ridiculous and meaningless hotel descriptions given on Expedia  Orbits etc  We finally settled on the Avonmore Hotel near W  Kensington  London   an independant hotel that has won awards in the past for the best independant hotel in London  We spoke with the owner over the phone and she was very helpful I have some thoughts about this hotel and as a long time traveler   want to share them with others   actually  if London is indeed hoping to win an Olympic Host spot   I hope the Avonmore will also take note    This hotel offers bed and breakfast   but beware as to the specific rooms you are booking  There is a huge difference in accomodations    While the price is good incomparison with high London prices   this hotel is located in a very risky neighborhood  There is a   minute walk to the nearest subway station  While it is a  quot quiet residential quot  neighborhood  one of our sons was stopped   blocks from the hotel and held up at knifepoint  en route to the hotel  at     pm  The walk from the tube station to the hotel crosses a threatening couple of blocks   would not recommend it to anyone traveling alone     What is not said in the hotel description is that this hotel backs on the subway line and the noise is considerable  Several of us experienced noise in front rooms and there was constant street traffic and brawls on   nights     On our first night  we stayed on the second level   and used a shared bath  There was not only no hot water  but no water pressure whatsoever   there was also very little heat in the bathroom     The bedspreads  carpets and pillows on the second level  were extremely filthy  While we ve come to expect this in London and small hotels in Europe   we just frankly don t understand it  We heard the washing machines going full tilt and saw the housekeeping staff working very hard   why not wash the bedspreads    If you re going to have throw pillows  could you please wash them from time to time    We arrived in London early and the hotel welcomed us   going to the extent of keeping our luggage and getting our room ready quite early with no additional charge     The breakfast offered is home cooked  full English and wonderfully served   home style  Remember  this is a small independant B and B   the very same person that puts your bread in the toaster  handles the money and answers the phone  Get my drift     Each room has a mini bar that is well stocked   no diet drinks though      Each room has coffee tea service   very nice    Every staff member we encountered was very friendly and very helpful   we had the sense we were visiting in a very kind family member s home       Sadly for Americans and typical of the British   it was advertised that they accepted American Express   however  when it came time to pay the bill    they were not willing to accept it  siting the     service charge they would need to pay  As an American  I was tempted to site the      VAT charge I pay for everything   willingly or not   but I didn t      All in all  If London is truly making a bid for the Olympics   they will need to get a grip with regard to hotel accomodation  
P =>  Love the Avonmore  We stayed at the Avonmore four different times in the past few years and found it to be wonderful each time  garet is a most gracious hostess  and the hotel staff people are very helpful and friendly  The rooms are clean  well appointed  the breakfasts absolutely marvelous  Our first three trips were with our children and the last one was just two of us  The Avonmore is in a very convenient location a couple blocks from West Kensington tube station  which is an easy tube ride from Heathrow  We plan to stay there again this year  and will stay at the Avonmore every time we visit London  We felt very much at home at the Avonmore  and highly recommend it  
P =>  Buyer Beware  Having seen this private hotel on the web it looked very impressive  However  that s the only time it looks impressive It is located in a pretty run down part of London  Close to the underground so you don t have far to walk in the area  Even so we did not want to be out after dark They have no elevator and a lot of stairs so don t plan on taking any heavy cases The rooms are pretty run down with old everything  However  they did have all you need in them  after you have recovered from moving the cases   However  the constant TV and reggae music noise from the houses next door does not allow for a  quot quiet night s sleep quot   Earplugs definately recommended Breakfast is traditional English  same every day and plentiful and the hostess is very polite and helpful Also  don t forget cash  It appears they like cash instead of credit cards  which will cost you more money to use  Wouldn t stay here again  
P =>  Great Location Very lovely B amp B  Close to bus stops and tube stations  Within walking distance to many sites  Staff very helpful and knowledgeable  
P =>  Nice people OK hotel The hotel is in a generally quiet neighborhood about three blocks from the West Kensington tube stop  Time to Picadilly is about       minutes  seems longer after a day of site seeing  There are a number of shops along the street near the tube  a mix of fast food restaurants  small markets  banks  a bar or two  The hotel room was a decent size and clean  We stayed in one of the rooms at the back of the hotel which faces the railroad tracks  This would have been fine except there was a heatwave and the rooms did not have air conditioning  We had to keep the window open which let in the noise of the trains  quite loud  The rooms at the front of the hotel were better in this respect  but from all the open doors  it must have been very hot  The staff is very helpful and friendly  The included breakfast was served in a small room on the first level  and you can choose eggs  sausage  cereal  beans  etc  
P => Pleasant Quiet place to stay We recently stayed at the Avonmore for   days and found it to be clean  comfortable and quiet  Although the accomodations were cramped by North American standards  they were typical for Britain Europe  The location is very convenient to the tube station of West Kensington and the area was safe to walk in at night  The staff were helpful and friendly  
P =>  A jewel in West Kensington   
P => Hidden Treasure  
P =>  We had a wonderful experience at the Avonmore  
P =>  A very pleasant stay  
P =>  Good Value for the Money

P =>  avonmore hotel una delusione  
P => 
P =>  worst place I ve stayed I m sorry to say this but this hotel is the worst place I ve ever stayed in  The room was so small my suitcase had to be left on the floor and I had to step over it or move it every time I needed to get into the wardrobe or the bathroom  The shower had no curtain so the bathroom ended up soaking wet whenever I took a shower  The toilet did not flush very well and it took ages to be able to flush it again  The room was dirty in places with a layer of thick dust on the TV and TV socket  The decor was shabby in places and wallpaper was coming off  The stairs were very steep and exhausting to climb  however it does say there is no lift in this hotel on the website  The only good things about this hotel are it s excellent location and the breakfast on a morning was lovely in a nice breakfast room  Also the staff who served the breakfast were friendly and kind so it s such a shame the rest of the hotel lets them down  
P => Not good I recently stayed at the Avon hotel  It s pictures look good but what your actually seeing to be the lobby is the lobby  No bins in toilets  Please note toilet is very  very small  don t bring in clothes as there was no shower curtin and eveything will get wet  Lady I presume to be owner very unsatisfactory and the way I was spoken to when I asked for another towel isn t the way you would be treated in Ireland  No chair as room was so small  Don t bring heavy suitcase if you intend on staying as its all stairs and trust me i no as i was on top floor    steps   flights that is and no one to help carry cases  it would suit someone who just needed a bed for the night  price expensive and mind the service charge of    when you pay on departure using you credit card         
P =>   NO THANKS Good value  Excellent location at Paddington Station and generally well kept although can find comparable B amp Bs in the area for less  Poor service  While the front desk staff were lovely  the person whom I presume to be the owner of the place has a bedside manner that leaves something to be desired  After several days of rude  snappy answers when for example we asked when the sheets were going to be changed  the final departure was classic  Whilst waiting in the lobby for the rest of our family to come down after breakfast  she retorted   Can you please pay now so that I can get on with the rest of my day   Charming  I have stayed at many hotels hostels all over the world and never have I felt such hostility than at this establishment  After enduring a   day visit it is safe to say that I will never stay there again  
P =>  Perfect Location good service  When I step into my room  I didn t like it as it is very small  Thought of changing the hotel but was told that hotels surrounding that area are small  Well  we decided to stay on and I am glad we did so  Anna  who was the person in charge of the reception  was very nice  She helped me a lot by giving me good tips on what good food to eat and was never too busy to help us with any questions  I love my morning wake up call  As the hotel is a townhouse      am sharp  we will smell the bacon and food for our breakfast  We know it is time to get up as our stomach will be growling  Location was fantastic as on the last day when we were leaving to our airport  there is a heathrow express train which help us get to the airport hassle free and very comfortable without carrying our luggages up and down the stairways of the tube  The only set back is the room which is pretty small but it is clean  Overall  it is a good place  One stop for convenience and feeling at home  
P =>  Good budget hotel We slept in this hotel for   nights  We had a triple room  which was big enough for the real time you spent in your room on a citytrip  The room was in the basement and we could hear the tube underneath us  But the second night you don t hear that anymore  Very friendly staff  good breakfast  Clean room with excellent beds  Tube and bus just around the corner  Hotel has no elevator  This could be a problem for people with legproblems  In nearby Springstreet is restaurant Ask  it s an open kitchen restaurant  good fresh food for a good price  Also in the same street there is a Caff  Nero  wonderful muffins  brownies etc  etc  and excellent cappuccino   And all that just around the corner  What more do you want We had a pleasant time here   
P =>  Compact and Bijoux A compact room in a very friendly hotel  Basic and very handy for business or pleasure   Easy access to Paddington Tube station  Heathrow Express from paddington  all major tour buses and restaurants  Very convenient for Green Park  ble Arch  Oxford Street  
P =>   Cute and Homely We had a comfortable and pleasant stay here  It is reasonably priced  neat and clean and homely  The service is good  people friendly and very helpful  The best thing is the Breakfast  They serve a wonderful continental breakfast which will keep you going even for a whole day of sight seeing  
P =>  A good basic budget Hotel with a great cooked breakfast  We have just spent   nights at the Avon Hotel     th   th ust         We found the Hotel to be a good budget hotel and the staff were more than helpful  The cooked breakfast was excellent and the location  just around the corner from Paddington Railway Station  superb  We were more than happy with the Hotel and would stay there again  Older visitors need to make sure that they request a room on the ground or first floor as there is no lift  
P =>   Perfect Location We stay at the Avon in il       for   nights  Yes the room is tiny  but it s a budget hotel  so I don t know what other traveler expect when they booked the hotel  The room is tidy  bathroom is clean and the hotel staffs are friendly  But the best thing about Avon is the location    minutes walk to Paddington Station which goes directly to Heathrow  Hyde Park is    minutes  Oxford Circus is   hrs walking distance  the bus stop infront of the hotel  and everything is so close by or just hops on the tube  I also compare the price with other hotel around and they have the best rate  the rate also includes a full breakfast  I would stay here again for the location and rate  
P => 	too small I m afraid    Well  we can agree with the the most of the statements mentionned here  but unfortunately everything in this  quot Hotel quot  is definitively too small  when you are no more a teenie or a twen The rooms to the rear side e g  are not much bigger than the bed  If you want to go from the door to the window your partner has to lie on the bed    In one of two rooms we have seen there was one single chair   in the other room was no chair  And where do you put your suitcase   The shower cubicle must be the same you know from a caravan  In the photo there are only a few inches left you can t see at the left and at the right side of this sadly cubicle This is no place for someone who has visited the city and now wants to relax in his room  Or you sleep there or you leave it And if you are quite sensitive the narrow breakfast room in the basement is also not a subject you want to spend your money for So the more you reach a middle age calculate some extra   and go to a better hotel  
P =>  Good and friendly hotel We  mother with two teenage daughters  stayed at Avon hotel in ust       The room was quite small as it was a triple room and the bathroom was really tiny  We later changed the room and got a room with a bit more space  That bathroom was also larger  The hotel is small with a friendly and serviceminded staff  I recommend the hotel if you want to have a clean  nice stay with a good breakfast  Breakfast was continental english as you could order egg and bacon or boiled egg with tea  coffee  orange or lemonjuice  cerial  jam and toast  We were very pleased with our stay and will try to book this hotel next time we visit London  Good location in Paddington too  with a quiet square with not much traffic outside the hotel  Buses stops just around the corner of the hotel for transport to wherever you want to go for sightseeing  Also the Big Bus Company sightseeing buses stops there so it s really a good location  It s close to the subway too  As many hotels in Norfolk Square area it is a lot of stairs and no elevator if you happen to live at the top floor  But the good things about the hotel take the edge out of that little disturbing matter  Ann  Kate and Ahmed  who where the staff we met  give the hotel a good face and a warm friendly touch  
P =>  I Love London     I just love London   I stayed with a friend in the Avon Hotel in Paddington  We liked it very much  The room was quite small  but very cosy and clean  It s a small hotel with    rooms and a friendly staff  Breakfast was good  London has many famous sightseeing attractions like the Big Ben  London Eye  Buckingham Palace  Tower  amp  Tower Bridge  But there s much more    I like Hamstead Heath with Kenwood House and Greenwich is beautiful  You really have to see London at least once in a lifetime    and if you have been there you want to go back  
P =>   Gutes Billighotel  
P =>   TRAVELER BEWARE This place STINKS    With our three night stay at this hotel completing our two week trip to Europe  we had high hopes based on the excellent success we had using other  budget  hotels during the trip  We consider ourselves very flexible travelers that can easily adapt to various conditions  This hotel BB left us very disappointed and angry First  when you walk in  the  Lobby  is completely cluttered with personal stuff and closed locked most of the time  Not sure how many family friends permanently stay there  If you return in the evening  you will see the manager and a host of friends family in the  Lobby  crouched in the dark around the TV We stayed in Quad room in basement the first two nights  The room was dirty  the bed coverings were filthy  the lights over the sink didn t work  and there was a constant odor of natural gas in the hallway  When you are using the shared bathroom  a tiny closet with folding door containing toilet  sink and  x  shower stall   you can sit there and enjoy the mold on the walls or count the bugs walking around your feet  We came back after our second day out to find the bathroom floor soaked from toilet overflow OK  it s a budget hotel  maybe a little dirt or grime can be excused  However  grime added with a nasty hotel manager can not  Not sure if this middle Eastern kid is a friend or relative of the owner  but his people and service skills are abysmal at best  Without ever raising an issue about the grime or smell  at breakfast the first morning  my wife came into the dining  nook  about       minutes before serving time was to end  We were curtly told we would have to get there earlier the following morning if we wanted to be served  Being  served  consists of helping yourself to juice or coffee  one of two choices of cereal flakes  and then having him standing there manning the toaster  while glowering at you as you eat  for your   slice ration of white bread toast  After three nights  and a mandatory change of rooms on the third night  do you think we could have been spared a single clean towel   Not without an extra charge  Common  for    pounds a night  they can t spare even one of their cheap and flimsy towels Oh  and if you want to use their WiFi  pony up some more pounds for that as well  When I asked to speak to the owner  I was told I could not because he was  quot at work quot  and could not be reached Our last night  two of the three shared bathrooms were out of commission and I heard grumbling from other guests that they didn t have any towels Bottom line  this place is a bit grubby with a nasty ass kid running the place  BEWARE    Sorry Rick Steve  you blew it on this one  There are so many other nicer choices in the same neighborhood or even closer to Victoria Station  
P => Bakers Hotel  pearl among swine  BAKERS HOTEL VICTORIALONDON SW   JAOne up for Bakers Hotel  I am writing to throughly recommend Bakers having experienced some of the nearby located alternates  this hotel wins hands down So central  clean beyond a doubt with helpful staff  I stayed after selling my property in London two years ago and was just about to recommend to friends who wanted some place to stay in London Some of the negative comment about this hotel was not acceptable on reviews I read  small  it is a typical London style town house tall and narrow  Not central  unless you want to stay with the Queen  can t get anymore central for the price I am a Londoner born and bred so take it from me  Bakers is a  pearl among swine  try the others accommadation aroundabout  you ll run back to      Warwick Way  Victoria  JA TillyerAntalya TURKEY 
P =>   Great value for money in Westminster  I arrived     am at the hotel after an    hr flight from Johannesburg  Needless to say  I was brain dead and needed sleep asap  The usual check in time at the hotel is        but the guy on duty was so kind as to check me in at     am  I was sooooo pleased  I stayed in room    It s small  but clean and a view of St George s Street  Luckily I always travel with ear plugs and an eye mask  so the traffic noise didn t bother me  Very good value for money in the posh City of Westminster  The hotel is a mere   min walk from Victoria bus station  which is really convenient  as I had to catch a bus to Stansted airport at     am after my stay  The shower and toilet were downstairs and really clean   Scandinavian standard  I will definitely stay here again  It s a safe  clean and great place to crash in the evening after partying and exploring all the great sites in London  
P =>   Pay a little more for a better hotel in the same area  I booked this hotel after reading many favorable reviews on Trip Advisor  I knew it was an economy hotel and I was not expecting much  Unfortunalely  they didn t really live up to my low expectations I booked a single room with a shared bath  That s OK  I m used to that in many of the cities I stay in Europe  All I really expect is a clean room and an even cleaner bathroom  This place had neither A few minutes after getting into my room  the front desk attendant  knocked on my door asking if he could vacuum the floor  I let him  as there were several traces of the last guest  This was a bit awkward  because the room was about the size of a broom closet It had a sink and a television mounted very high up on the wall  I found out later that a remote for the television required a    pound deposit  I opted not to have a remote  since I wasn t planning on watching a whole lot of television anyway  I just found it a bit rude  since I had already paid for three days in advance  Is the black market for television remotes still that strong I also paid   pounds for wireless internet access  which only worked for half of my stay  When it went down  the front desk agent said   quot Yeah  sorry  quot  Then he suggested I steal a signal from one of the surrounding apartments  I didn t ask for a refund  because the cash I had paid him went straight into his pocket and wasn t coming out The bathroom  which took some getting to  was small  cold and cleaned with very little care  The shower was luke warn  at best  It made an uncomfortable chore out of getting ready for the day The location was good  but there are so many hotels in that area that  next time  I will gladly pay more for a few of the basic comforts  I know you can t always luck out when taking the budget route  but you should  at least  get a clean bathroom I would strongly advise against staying at this  quot hotel quot   
P =>  Bakers Hotel Victoria Stayed in the VERY cramped top floor single  bedroom  for   nights  OK if you just want a place to bed down without any frills  Bathroom is   flights of stairs below and inconvenient  Continental breakfast is adequate and prepared by mildly grumpy owner s son receptionist  I complained about window locks not permitting means of escape in case of emergency from this cramped room 
P => Very Basic Hotel Centrally Located I stayed here for a week in ember       I chose it from Rick Steves London because of the very cheap  for London  price and proximity to Victoria Station  I stayed in the topmost single room  tiny number     up many  many stairs  Being over     I was out of breath every time I made the climb  It was a tiny room with a little sink  a hair dryer  hot water maker  a teeny tiny wardrobe  a window  and a narrow little bed  which they made up neatly every day  My suitcase went on the floor  no table or chair  and there was just barely enough room for it  The carpet was stained  But generally it looked as though effort was made to keep things clean and tidy in the hotel  My room was adjacent to another room at the top of the stairs and this was noisy when the occupants would unlock their door  or talk  or have the TV on  I used earplugs every night  and Ambien  and slept fine  The weather was chilly  but the room was pleasantly warm  The shared bathroom was down a flight of stairs   which was a negative for me  It was kept pretty clean for the heavy usage it got  hotel was full  even in ember   I never figured out how to get a fresh towel  so I used the same one all week  Breakfast  in the basement  was spartan and after   days there I was real tired of it  white bread toast  butter and jam  corn or bran flakes  milk  OJ  tea  or instant coffee  It was fuel though  so I ate my fill every day  It seemed to be a safe neighborhood  I walked home alone every night  though not very late   I noticed that young Winston Churchill lived in a building nearby on the walk to the station  look for the blue circle marker denoting  quot a famous person lived here quot    
P =>  Dont take a cat there s no room to swing it   Tiny  and i mean tiny  little room on the top   the size of a shoebox  A Broken sink   one single teabag with no milk  No shower in the room  No towels or soap in the bathroom  noise from the street  roasting hot room    etc etcwouldnt stay at this dump again if Tripadvisor picked me up in a horsedrawn carriage and paid me to lodge there   AvoidCheap isnt always cheerful 
P =>   Ok for a cheaper hotel and within walking distance of Victoria Station Stayed here for   nights with daughters    and   years old  Had the basement quad room which was a double bed in the middle of the room with two singles on either side  a tv on the wall  a table and small sink  No top sheet on any of the beds so that was surprising and not mentioned in other reviews  The bedding was not fresh other than the bottom sheet  Bathroom at the end of the hall was tiny with a tiny shower but it was fine if you are a shower person  Hotel is close to a semi busy street and street noise traffic is noteworthy  bring earplugs if you like quiet nights   We also noticed the smell in the basement  There was a nice hot water pot on the shelf so we made hot tea and boiled water for our water bottles each night  Breakfast was ok   cereal  no sugary kinds   toast with jams  and some orange juice  milk  or coffee  This hotel is close to a laundrymat and a brochure for it was near the office  It is also quite close to a large grocery called Sainsbury  smaller version of this store in Victoria station   We found lots of reasonably priced breads  fruit  and hot deli items in the bigger Sainsbury store  Perfect for budget travelers like us and you can easily pick up hot or cold  good  and cheap dinner here every day   Would use this hotel again since the location is so near to Victoria Station but would bring hostel sheets  A cheap and comfortable bus picks up at Victoria station and goes to Oxford regularly  the London Tube bus and kids were free as was WiFi   and also had a pickup drop off spot for the two major London hop on off tour busses  
P =>   Small Triple Room We reserved a triple room for   nights and were disappointed with how small the room was  There were   twin beds pushed together  a sink  a small chair and small cabinet  about     wide  with a few hangers  We had to remove the chair and stack our suitcases on top of one another to open the door  The room was clean  the price was good for London  the staff was courteous and the location was great  Even with these advantages  the fact that we were so cramped wasn t worth it  
P =>  nice clean and very friendly staff Nice and clean rooms  very friendly and welcoming staff  located in the center of london  breakfast room is small but neat and clean

P =>  Thumbs up for Bankside and its central location  I stayed with a large group at Bankside House during the Thames Festival weekend this must have been one of Bankside s busiest weekends  the accommodation was a sell out  Some of us arrived early and knowing we could not access our rooms before   pm  the staff were very obliging and allowed us to leave our bags in the store room  When we did check in  we were dealt with quickly and efficiently  Our room was facing the rear of the building onto modern office blocks  it was basic  very clean  with towels  ensuite  tea and coffee making facilities  One of our group members stayed in a front facing room with views over looking St Paul s  The breakfast was certainly a full monty  you could choose from a belly bursting english or continental  vegetarians were also catered for  We came and whent from our rooms at all hours of the day and night  our room was quiet even with the windows open  The staff were top drawer  nothing was too much trouble and each room was refreshed daily  As for the guys serving in the bar  well chin  chin for keeping up with us  Hey come on folks  for     pp night for a single room and     pp night twin room including breakfast  during peak season London  this has to be a bargain  Bankside is approx ten minute walk from the underground at Southwark and right next door to some stylish eateries  Within a minutes walk we were soaking up the ambience of the Tate Modern and the fesitval s vibrant atmosphere  which stretched the south bank from Westminster Bridge to Tower Bridge  Westminster Palace  the London Eye  The National Theatre  St Pauls  The Globe Theatre  HMS Belfast and other historical finds are all within easy walking distance  Many more famous attractions and places to visit are also easily accessable either by foot  river boat or by tube For food luvers and shop a holics don t miss the Borough ket  the OXO building and More London   all have an eclectic mix of restaurants bars  arts and crafts plus free street entertainment along the way  What more could you ask for from this fantabulous budget B amp B location    
P =>   Bloody Brilliant The staff are lovely the rooms are clean with very adequate facilities  The interent is kinda overpriced as well as the laundry facilities but the price of the accomodation itself makes this not worth worrying about Had a fantastic time  Great value  
P =>  Horrific  I struggle to find where to begin  I ll start by saying a little about the purpose of my trip trips to London this summer and you will get a better idea I am studying law and intend to study at the bar  Thus I was doing several mini pupillages this summer  A mini pupil is an intern barrister for those of you who don t know that  I ve stayed in the Travel Lodge Islington once and the Travellodge Kingston Central Twice  I liked it so much I went back the second time even though I was working in the center   I have nothing but the best to say about the Travellodges and London  This time since I was down for two weeks in a row I decided to get a cheaper better value for money accommodation and I came upon Bankside House  Now I wish I hadn t  I arrived late at night to be greeted by some sleepy students who took ages to check me in  Finally  after trying to haul my huge case  I carry alot of legal materials when I m working  through the swivel door I went up to my room  with the rather industrious looking key in hand  and opened the door  I was greeted by a dark room with three doors  one I later would learn to be the bathroom  I finally got into my box    sorry     room  Lets go through the room itself  There is a bed  a single bed  which had a matress so worn out and soft my back started to hurt after the first night  You get one pillow  that is I am assuming there was something inside the pillowcase  however  I may have been wrong  There is no headboard  Don t bother trying to read and don t move about  which I did  try to read  and hit my head  So every morning I woke up with a crippled back and a concussion There is a desk and some shelves  There is a chest of drawers  however  the middle one was broken and because of that the bottom one didn t open  There is also a huge wardrobe with three hangers  One curtain was short  shorter than the other curtain  therefore I couldn t make the room dark enough to sleep in  Then there was the bathroom  It was small  grotty  dirty and a very unpleasant place to be  The shower itself was coming away from the wall  When turned on it took a while to even get wet there was so little water  It only had two temperatures boiling and cold  Any pinpoint of tepid was disrupted by the slightest movement which caused the handle to move slightly turning it boiling again  I m Kate Moss thin  What would a fat person do There is no TV or internet access  even wireless  so there is absolutely no entertainment whatsoever  I actually spent more money  going out to wireless enabled bars  than it would have cost for a Travellodge being that you can t spend any time in the cell   sorry    room whatsoever  If you want to use the internet it is    per half hour at reception  The residents of the hotel appear to be foreign students  not interns  but groups of rowdy horny teenagers who party all night  They have a trick of some of them standing outside shouting up several floors in conversation with people in the rooms  Some of the staff were okay  Most of them were obnoxious  arrogant and rude  At one point I informed the receptionist that if he ever considered speaking to me like that again he would loose his front teeth  Most of the vending machines and other pay per use facilities were broken  however  still swallowed the money entered into them  You have to carry identification to get in  instead of some credit card sized item  you get this huge card thing that will not fit in a wallet or a jacket pocket  The whole place feels tired  dirty and pathetic  If you think the price is too good to be true  let me assure you  it is  To summarise this place is a kennel  Not a b and b or a hotel but a place where you would keep animals  Qualify that   a place where you would send animals you don t really care about  It is not a place you could spend any time  The facilities are sub standard  The place is totally unsuitable for guests  I will never ever go there again  And I would urge you  if you like yourself  to avoid this place like the plague  I have stayed in better mud huts in the middle of deserts  Plus there is  apart from the Tate Gallery  absolutley nothing near it  
P =>  A little gem of a place A real find for a solo traveller on a budget Bankside House is literally at the back of the Tate Modern in London  A      s art deco building  with aproximately     rooms  Easy to get to by public transport  from Waterloo station  Buses RV  or     stop nearby  Southwark tube is the nearest tube stop The building and my room was clean and quiet  Kettle  tea and coffee  and towels provided  It smelt a bit at first  but probably hadn t been used for a while  Nothing that an open window and airfreshner couldnt cure  No TV in the room  but was available in the bar  amp  restaurant in the basementA free local paper and magazines were available in reception  Internet access is available near reception  but its a bit pricey Cooked English breakfast came with my package deal  One tip  make sure you diet before coming here  The breakfasts were huge  with unlimited coffee  juice  and breakfast cereal  in addition to the cooked meal  Had to share a shower  sink and toilet with another room  but the bathroom was clean and tidy  room  bathroom and bins cleaned daily Plus points   Size of room  cleanliness  BREAKFASTS     friendly and helpful staff  a cheap laundrette in the basement   great for families with messy kids  location to attractions  Tate Modern  St Pauls  Borough ket   peace and quiet for London  good value for money Negative points   the mattresses need changing  could feel springs  would have been nice to know how the room heaters worked  driers in the laundrette didnt work  Would have been good to have a cheap supermarket nearby  and a kitchenette to prepare food  for families on a budget  
P =>   Great location fab breakfasts borderline dump rooms Location  Fantastic  Right behind the Tate Modern  It s a quiet  upscale  safe area and you are   min  from the millenium bridge  For evening walks along the Thames  this place cannot be beat Building  It s fine from the outside  The reception area is bare and basic  On the right  there is a very worn brown leather couch to sit on and two computers where you pay    per hour to use  On the left is a very basic long counter and     worn out staff trying to patiently  and in English  do a quick check in  When groups come in  there will definitely be a long wait Check in  We pre paid our rooms so check in went quite fast  We got an  quot id quot  card to use whenever we left the building or got our breakfast  We also received just ONE key for our room  The key is deposited at the front desk before leaving and then handed back to you upon showing your  quot id quot  Lift and Corridors  There are about   large lifts to use  The corridors have stained blue carpets  some doors have chipped paint and everything seems run down Room  We had a large room facing a few rows of nice flats  It was very quiet  There s a dirty window  all the windows are dirty  that you can crack open  No a c  The room is very bare but has enough drawers and closet space to put away your things  There is a large desk and two chairs  The single beds are OK  The carpet is stained but the room didn t smell  Except for the carpet stains  the room was clean  There is no mirror  phone or pictures or safe in the room  No TV or radio  There is plugs  Two sets of towels were laid out on the bed  The towels are changed every two days  The beds are made daily  The bathroom is small  the shower was a bit grotty but otherwise clean and had a shower door  The bathroom mirror is very highly placed  There s one sink  The toilet made a funny noise after every flush so we complained to the front desk and the toilet was fixed the next day  Noise level  It depends on your neighbours  There are signs asking guests to be quiet between    pm and   am  I found this to be basically followed  Our room was thankfully at the end of a corridor  You ll hear people walking past your door if they are loud  Sometimes you ll hear a toilet flush or a shower run somewhere in the building but otherwise I d say  all things considered  it was quiet inside and outside the building  If your room is facing the entry  you might hear people outside at night or in the morning Breakfast  Very good  It s cafeteria style and you get a choice of six items  There are meats  sausages    kinds of yogurt  scrambled eggs  pancakes  waffles  fresh fruit  tomatoes  toast and croissants to choose from  Outside of the serving area  you can get as much cereal  coffee  tea  milk and juice as you want  There s a TV in the eating area so you can find out what s been going on in the world Nearest metro stations  Southwark        min  walk  is a bit closer than London Bridge  The path between London Bridge and Bankside has lots of cobble stones so it wasn t too handy to pull a suitcase on  However  if you take the Southwark road  it s a bit longer but easier on the suitcases  Since we took the train from Gatwick to London Bridge  we didn t need use the metro for the first two days  The second day we used the Original Bus Tours to get around Guests  I d say it was     teenager groups and     adults while we were there Housekeeping  I wish they would clean all the windows inside and out more  Also do a bit more cleaning around the reception area and lifts  especially during this swine flu epidemic  I didn t hear any rumours about swine flu in the building but I did have the need to sanitize my hands after pushing the doors and lift buttons throughout the building The Bar  There s a bar in the building somewhere by the name of Beaver Belching bar  We never went to look for it I would return to Bankside House only after a very urgently needed refurbishment  Because everything looks run down  it just didn t feel that clean Rating  Location   star  Breakfast   star  Price   star     stars 
P =>  Great Location and QUIET After hearing from friends about the high cost of decent London Hotels  I decided to book the Bankside House  I was glad I did  The location behind the Tate Modern and blocks from the Thames was perfect for us  The room was a no frills affair but functioned perfectly and the cafeteria style breakfast was more than adequate  The staff was friendly and helpful  Perhaps the most unexpected feature was how quiet the area was  City noises have bothered me in the past  but not here  There was very little street noise and no noise in the rooms at all  I was certainly pleased with my choice  
P =>   Great Location Great Breakfast Nothing Negative   guys  we were well impressed with this accommodation   traveled to London on a  c flight      It was very easy to find   just follow the orange lampposts from Southwark Tube  Also the lit tower of Tate Modern made it an easy find returning at night   The staff were nice  beds were comfy  the breakfast was great  Just a few minutes walk from the Tate Modern   have coffee on the balcony  and from lovely walks by the Thames  I liked it so much have booked two more of lse s vacation buildings for a trip this weekend Also have to say every one we met in London were very kind re directions etc We opted for ensuite but in reality no need   shower was tiny but no complaints   Cost us        for two nights  worth it for the location alone  but compared to reviews of cheap hotel accommodation when you consider the cleanliness  the staff  the security   would stay here again an y time  if it was available  
P =>  Good location for walking and good buzz This is a student hall of residence for the LSE  London School of Economics  a university   It is just behind the new Tate Modern museum  so ideal for that  Since it is now possible to walk along the Thames past the Oxo building  the National Theatre  the South Bank complex of concert halls and museums    mins max  this is ideal for all of those places  Walking in the opposite direction is the Globe theatre  It is easy to walk across one of the bridges to Westminister and central London  which is just as well as public transport is not as good as central London hotel  The three nearest tube stations are    to    mins away and there is really only one main bus line  One unusual place to visit is the market near London Bridge station  next to Southwark Cathedral which has LOVELY food in many stalls The prices are relatively cheap  and of course it is only available during the summer holiday  and some other holiday times   The accommodation is sparse  no television  no radio  minimal shower toilet  There is a kettle and tea coffee facilities  But the food was good and there is a real buzz from the mixture of nationalities  The weekend we were there saw organised groups from China  Italy  and the USA as well as individual pairs and families from many countries  
P => Where London begins for us London begins at the Bankside  for all   of our visits starting in       Its location  two blocks from the south end of the Millennium Bridge to St  Paul s  can t be beat  We love walking home from the theatre along the strings of lights on the riverside  We love checking the tides and seeing the boat traffic go by We take a double room for a week  with two comfortable single beds and a pair of desks that quickly fill up with our books  amp  theatre programs  amp  newspapers  We start every day with a full breakfast in the large  busy cafeteria  full of tourists and students of all ages  but never so noisy or crowded we can t find a comfortable table to gossip about the people all around us  The first thing we buy in London on each of our trips is a pair of cheap and colorful mugs  to use when we make tea every afternoon with the tea setup in our room  often accompanied by pastries from nearby Borough ket or from Louis  pastry shop in Hampstead And the last two things we usually do is     visit the Tate Modern  which is right next door  but which we are always too busy to see until the last day  and     use the coin operated laundry room down on the ground floor to be ready for our further travels What s wrong with Bankside  The only thing we can think of is that it is only open summers  when the London School of Economics is not in session  
P =>  LSE Summer Vacationers Our family have just returned from a week at the Bankside House   The residence is good with lifts for us to bring luggages into the room  The reception teams were part time university students and they were very nice and helpful as well as the security personnel  We booked a Quad room with private facilities and actually there were   beds in the room  But I think they should check their housekeeping staff whether they did their job well  the carpet was so dirty and it seems never vacuum cleaning the floor during the whole summer  They changed towels everyday but not cleaned the bedside table where I left breadcombs in the morning but still in there when I came back at night  We only expect cleanliness and not much  Location is good with RVI the bus route stopped in front of Bankside before but not now due to construction  I think if the RV  bus runs the old route again in the near future  easy access is one of the advantages of Bankside House  From my experience  the nearest and shortest subway to Bankside House should be London Bridge Subway station  and just follow the direction given by Bankside House information  I came from Gatwick airport and took thameslink train to London Bridge train station and the fare is pay two person and get two person free  Good though as we are family of four  We have difficulty in walking to Bankside House with luggage from London Bridge Train Station and I think we should study the street map before walking Remember to buy a Unlimited Travel card     days    days or   day  online before leaving the country  I found it very great to buy the travelcard and get around to London s point of interest  The breakfast that was included in the room rate  The breakfast is great and it can fill up the stomach until noon    items can be chosen from dozen of choices    egg  scramble  hardboiled  fried   yogourt  fruits   orange  apple  peach and cream   ham and bacon  sausage  potato waffle  tomato  baked beams brownish  deep fried toast  croissant  cereal etc  and what I like most is the unlimited   toasts  milk  juices  coffee and tea  I think everybody love it  too  The security that I found was good and every guest has to show registration card before the reception to let them in  The dryer in the laundry room was not working well because clothes were still wet after in the dryer for    minutes  I did a couple of washing there during my stay and when I talked to other guests and they complained their clothes needed ironing when coming out from dryer  I am using tag at home and it work well but not those tag in the laundry room of Bankside House  After all  Bankside House is still a good choice for us the budget traveller who want to live in central London  The room rate is reasonable with excellent value and with this price we can have all the facilities that we were looking for  
P =>  Excellent Budget Sleep Please note  this is a budget accommodation  The dorms of the London school of Economics convert to a B amp B during the summer  The rooms are no frills  I got a triple  as it was the only room ready when I arrived in e  The beds are comfortable cot like affairs  The room was big enough  there is a desk and a wardrobe  and a good sized bathroom with shower only  The rooms are clean  The breakfast  included  is good  with eggs  meats  cereals  juice or coffee  and croissants  You can also buy dinner here  which I did not do  and the price is reasonable  The staff were VERY helpful for me  I was on my way to the airport  and confused about the buses  One of the staff walked me to the bus stop    and they were ALL helpful  There is a bank of lifts  so there s no problem with luggage  My only beef is that there was no TV  I like to see local programming and news when I travel  But the location is FANTASTIC  Right behind the Tate Modern  which is an outstanding museum  Around the corner from the Globe Theatre  Three minutes  walk from the Millenium Bridge  which is a pedestrain bridge from the South Bank to the City of London and Spittlefields  Minutes to walk to Southwark and the Tower of London  Pubs  cafes  etc  are everywhere  I have stayed in Bloomsbury  Notting Hill  and Hyde Park Kensington  I much prefer this South Bank area  And Bankside House is a great budget alternative to high priced lodging  
P => LSE summer acommodation  Bankside is London School of Economics holiday accommodation  In a very nice area  bordering on  posh   My window overlooked the Tate Modern  and Bankside is next door to The Globe Theatre  Nearest tube Blackfriars   about ten min walk away  and Bankiside give you precise instructions when you book which was appreciated   The most splendid buffet breakfast imaginable  What a choice    Quite cheap for London at    pounds for a single en suite  I wouldve given this excellent if it wasnt for the fact that I was given a wheelchair friendly room  okay  I m    but am unbelievably fit Oh  and there were probably about     of oldies as guests   There were three beds to pick from in my room  but the bathroom was made for  obviously  a wheelchair  For the following two hours after I d had my shower  I had to wade through water if I wanted to use the toilet or wash my hands   The reception staff didnt speak english very well  it was hard to get through to them when paying and telling them about deposits and bookings  Still for proximity  it was great

P =>   Good hotel GREAT value I just spent almost   weeks at this hotel on a solo leisure shopping trip  and I don t have many complaints  It s an incredible value in such a pricey city and as others have mentioned  it s access to the Earl s Court tube station is it s shining glory  The area has a nice neighborhood feeling and there are many amenities within a few steps from the hotel  drugstore  grocers  post office  atms  pubs  restaurants  convenience stores  stationers  internet cafe  etc etc    The room was nothing special    quite drab and outdated  but it was very clean and everything was in working order  It was small  but I had plenty of room to move about and put my belongings  Oh  and that tea kettle that boils water in seconds was a lovely thing to have in the room  I never saw any insects or pests  I never ran out of hot water for showers  and whenever I requested anything from the staff  they were very prompt and polite  I was definitely a late riser and the housekeeping staff always took the  quot do not disturb quot  sign seriously  I also have to thank the gentleman at the front desk the morning of my checkout    I was short    or    pence for some phone calls I had made from my room  and he just smiled and told me not to worry  Thanks There were only a very minor complaints about my stay  The main one is the creaky floorboards  I know there isn t much the hotel can do about it  but my goodness was it annoying  I couldn t walk anywhere in my room without a headache  And I could hear everything that was going on in the hallway like it was right next to me  so I inadvertently eavesdropped on many conversations  Although I wasn t in London to watch TV  the couple of channels that were available had a bit of static  The room was always too warm for me  even with the fan and windows open  in the middle of ember   and the bed was a bit uncomfortable at times  there was small plastic circles embedded in mattress    I have no idea what they were   Also  the halls were never really tidy    always piles of towels or toilet paper laying around from housekeeping  It never bothered me  but I can see how it might look disorderly to some visitors Although I was thinking that on my next trip to London I would try to find accommodations with self service lodging  kitchenette  fridge   to save a bit of money on dining out    I would definitely stay at Barkston Gardens again and give it my recommendation  
P =>   Average hotel in good location I stayed in this hotel for   nights and overall it is a fair value for money in London  Main benefit is that this hotel is only a couple of minutes walk from Earl s Court tube station  which is very central and you don t need to spend hours to get to main places of interest  Breakfast is also quite good   we had a full English breakfast package  which worked out very well  However the  quot restaurant quot  looks very tired and reminds me of an old public canteen  Nevertheless  quality and variety of food is very reasonable  Bedrooms in this hotel overall are not that great  Good things are  spacious room  clean  Bad things   everything looks very very tired  bathroom   although shower works   looks awful  old and very outdated  but still clean   Windows   forget double glazing  Very old and very dirty  can t open them properly   I needed to use a folder to stop it from shutting  Curtains used to be white  but it I think it was a long long time ago  and now they are grey  Floor  and carpets  is also quite bad and every time you walk  it makes terrible noise   which is especially noticeable during the night if you or your kids have to get up I first thought of rating this hotel as   out of   because of it s location and room rates  But the more I think about it  the more negatives I find  I would not really like to stay in this hotel in the future   I would rather move away from the city centre  or choose a bit more expensive hotel in the same area  
P =>   Excellent value for money Located just a few meters away from Earls court tube  it is easily accessible by public transport that drops you only a few meters away  Location is excellent  couldn t be better Even if it is next to a busy road  at night the area is quiet and you can sleep well Rooms are very big when compared to other same level London hotels with plenty of room to put baggage and be comfortable  Bathroom is ensuite and not very small  the only problem was that water wasn t very hot  but we could manage to have a bath without any problem  Rooms and hotel were clean Breakfast was nothing special but accaptable with fresh toast  another type of bread  cereals  one type of ham ans cheese  jams  ecc  You can also choose from hot chocolate  tea or coffee  I had the first two  and the two of them weren t good I definately recommend this hotel since it is excellent value for money  located in the centre of london with easy transport facilities being just a few seconds away  
P =>   surly arrogant condescending and demeaning staff  If your idea of customer service is surly  arrogant  condescending and demeaning staff you will simply adore the Barkston Gardens Hotel  If not  i suggest you run the other way  fast  
P =>  Under construction The hotel was under construction while we were there  It wasn t too disruptive  but it made walking down the hall unpleasant as they put in a new elevator  Our room was okay and very spacious  the beds soft and comfortable  but our bathroom was scary  I say scary because the shower sang  and the tiling was poor  with large gobs of caulk everywhere to fill in gaps The location was Excellent  From Earl s Court tube station  you turn right  walk half a block  turn left and you are there  It s on the Piccadilly line which makes it convenient to get to and from the airport  or Kings Cross  St  Pancras train station if you don t have a car  There were also plenty of choices as far as restaurants  grocery stores  bakerys  internet cafes  and a little shopping  ATMs located accross the street from the underground Breakfast was a nice buffet  Tea and toast plus whatever you can concoct with cheese  rolls  ham  cut up fruit  and cereal  
P =>   A good hotel for many reasons I just returned from London where I stayed for the fourth time at Barkston Gardens The hotel has a very good position along the Piccadilly Line  just a few minutes walk from Earl s Court underground station  The rooms are good enough  not luxurious The floor makes  terrible  noise and sometimes theres no hot water  but it does not bother me to much  The international breakfast is always the same but contains the basic drinks and food stuffs  The personal is friendly  
P =>  Great location  Great location  I was surprised how close everything was to this hotel  The restaurants  drugstore  grocery store  and shopping was close by  The tube was literally a   minute walk  Great location overall  The hotel is an older building  but it does have big rooms and big bathrooms  They need to update the furnitures  The bed was uncomfortable The hotel staffs were very nice and courteous  Great customer service  I will definitely stay here again  Hopefully  they would have new beds  
P =>  Excellent Location We have just returned from London   our one week at the Barkston Hotel was quite nice  it is very functional  close to all travel   subway and access to Brit Rail   shopping  bank  boots drug store  food  bakeries  etc  We found the hotel basic   amp  clean and met out needs  The buffet breakfast was well organized and exceeded our expectations  The front desk staff and the staff in general were prompt  professional and responsive to our needs Our room was on the  th floor   you should ask for a  th floor room   the floors are  quot creaky quot   Our room was clean and quite adequate   we were out most of the day and only spent time in the room at night  I will say that the furnishings in our room were a bit  quot tired quot    the carpet and bed clothing need to be updated  The windows are old   but we could open them  We found the room warm and asked for another fan for the room   which was promptly delivered  Lots of hot water in the bathroom  very clean and modern  Lovely huge bathtub A new elevator is being installed  however  we were never bothered by the noise   they started work around    am and finished by   pm  This hotel is basic but close to everything you need if you are out all day  Would recommend it and also would stay there again  
P =>   Good location so so hotel Located two blocks from the Earl s Court tube station  the Barkston Gardens is a convenient place to stay for travelers in London  The hotel is clean and the staff at reception  especially Lorenza  is very helpful  The room itself is just basic lodging  There was a lot of closet space but few drawers for storage  The room was larger than most European hotel rooms but it could do with refurbishment  All in all  however  it wasn t a bad deal for the price  about      American  considering how expensive London is  
P => 	Star Hotel at absolute best no air con and no service  Stayed here for   nights in ust     with my partner Its a definite no no to stay during summer as they have central heating in the hotel but no aircon whatsoever  There are also several rooms  like ours  located inbetween floors so you have to drag your suitcases up and down stairs to get to an elevator Inside the actual room its the tiniest room I ve ever seen with the smallest double bed in history  even   normal average people lying down on their backs with arms against their sides would be falling off the bed or be on top of each other  TV is   cm dinosaur and the whole floor creaks and moans and theres no sound proofing at all The only positive is the location  right next to Earls court tube stop which is a step free tube station so that s handy  Also the old gentleman in charge of the breakfast was excellent and the English cooked breakfast was very good as well Staff barely spoke English  many were Spanish but in Spain could speak better English Price isn t that high  but you definitely suffer for the lower price    and at     a night  A     A      you really expect better  
P =>  avoid at all costs Absolutley horrible  Run down  mildew and mold everywhere in bathroom  Staff simply didn t care  Free continental breakfast  barely adequate  but featured a most officious breakfast captain  who controlled the dining room  The hostel down the street is likely a better value and probably in bertter condition 
P =>   Great location on a budget My husband and I stayed at Barkston Gardens the end of il  Fairly large room with double bed and large bathroom  Very nice for cheap price   bigger than expected  Included breakfast which was perfect to start the day  Staff were helpful and polite  The location is the best if you can t afford to stay in central London  Right on the Piccadily Line at Earl s Court tube station   you are the last stop in Zone    It is a great neighbourhood to retreat to after an evening seeing the sights  Also excellent for taking the Tube to Heathrow airport     minutes from Tube station  
P =>   Tired and Tatty Room The location for our visit was good  Easy walking distance from tube   though not a great help as there was a tube strike on our second and third day  Reception staff very pleasant and helpful allowed us to check in before time  Our room on the top floor  though large was very gloomy and had no ventilation  There was a small portable fan and the window was broken  The reception area and breakfast area were bright and cheerful  Breakfast was adequate  
P =>   Close to train station and great breakfast This hotel is a short walk from Earls Court train station  We used the underground from this station to travel around London  There are a number of small shops on the way to the station where you can buy snacks and also places to eat  There is a park across the road as others have mentioned but access if by key and limited to the local residents The hotel is old and worn with thin walls and small rooms  but you would have to pay a lot more probably to get something better  The breakfast was very nice with plenty to eat  Despite being around the corner from a pub it was very quiet  
P =>  value for money  What a find  Clean  handsome  well run hotel in London for about    GBP        a night  The rooms are spacious  for London  and bright  Bathroom was big and newly refurbished  and the shower was great  Our room        led to an almost private courtyard  The hotel is about a   minute walk from Earl s Court tube  which gives easy access to everywhere  including Heathrow   and is across the street from a park  Breakfast is available  and there is a small bar in the hotel  Wireless Internet was reliable  even in our room  Staff were accessible and friendly  This was just great  
P =>  Nice hotel   Great location  Would definitely stay again  Stayed there for   nights in  ch      Was recommended to stay there by a friend and wasn t disappointed  Nothing can beat the location  a couple of minutes away from the tube station  from which I did most of my trips around the city  There is also a Tesco store  a pharmacy and a Burger King just across the road  Had a view of a lovely garden just outside the window Room was fairly small but cosy and heated  clean and neat  The shower stream was lacking a bit of life  though it was told on an info sheet inside the lift that it was due to maintenance in the water system  although they did say it would affect the water stream between     am  and in my room at least  it lasted all day All in all  was worth the price and what you would expect from a   star hotel  Would definitely be coming back  
P =>   Amazing Location Soured by Old Dingy Feel We stayed at the Barkston Garden Hotel for three days on our recent trip to London  The location cannot be beat   about a   minute walk from the underground station  It s in a great little neighborhood with a grocery store  pharmacy  and a lot of restaurants around for entertainment  The hotel has a cute walk up  and is well lit with friendly front desk staff  There is free wi fi available throughout the hotel if you have a laptop  which was a huge bonus for us It has been said before  but this is definitely a case of you get what you pay for  The first thing I noticed was that when we walked into our room  which was at the end of a long hall with zero lights   the floor creaked  EVERYWHERE  There wasn t one spot in the small room that didn t make noise when you walked around  which I m sure irritated the people below us  The bathroom was quite large  but the showerhead was a miser with water  We froze every time we showered because the water wouldn t come out fast enough  so by the last day  I had resorted to washing my hair under the running tap We considered the room fine  because we weren t expecting much  but even so  I wouldn t stay here again  I will definitely pay more and upgrade my experience  
P =>   Got what you paid for    Me and my Fiance stayed in the Barkston for   nights in ch  We paid     per night for the room  Our room was number      On arrival  my fiance noticed when you opened the  patio  door window  when you shut it  it wouldn t lock  and was easy to pull or push open  Not great considering there was no safe in the room  and on check in we were not offered a safe  It was very annoying when we checked out  I commented on the room and about the spring sticking out of the mattress and everything else  and all the man did was scribbled it down on a peice of paper and just said  ok  when I finished NO SORRY about that  and thankyou for letting us know Anyway  we left the hotel and went out  When we came back I got into bed  and felt a sharp pain in my leg  when I looked  I saw a spring that was stuck out of the mattress on the left side of the bed  It was stuck out about two inches  and had caught my leg  Because of the time I just pushed the spring back into the mattress and covered it over with the sheet  When we woke in the morning  we ran the tap for a bath  and had NO hot water  We had reasonably hot water on an evening  but NONE in a morning  Another couple of picky things were the walls are like paper like some of the reviews said you can hear everything that goes on above you  and the decor is very dated  but this didnt bother us  The pipes to the radiator were exposed the radiator didnt work  and had two portable radiators in the room  along with a fan  kettle  very old hair dryer  drop down ironing board and old iron  didnt use any of these The shower head was an old metal one   the tiles around the bathroom could of done with a good clean  and when I had my first bath  I had to wash the bath out as there were  body hair  in the bath The good points to this hotel though  were that you got a television in your room with about    channels on it  you got a sofa bed as well as a bed and plenty of pillows and bedding  you had a desk with a full length mirror  a wardrobe  kettle and tea coffee and sugar with two packs of biscuits  room service every morning and clean towels  free internet in the bar downstairs  and the lager looked lively  The breakfast in a morning was ok  not a big fan  it was a continental breakfast  croissants were hard  toast was cold People that worked there weren t english but this is very comman in London  Would not stay here again  have learnt that it pays to pay more when it comes to your accommodation  Area was good and central  a bit rough but    you can t have everything   
P =>  Good For the Cost The selection of this hotel for our stay in London was based on cost and location  its within a   minute walk of Earls Court Underground  and the cost averaged     per night The staff were friendly and helpful during our stay  The room was available to us despite arriving a little early and the check in out was fast The room itself was larger that others we ve stayed in  in the area  The decor is showing signs of wear and is probably due a revamp  The window is our room didn t lock although it opened onto a flat roof  There were some extras  a floor standing fax  trouser press etc  that lead to the room seeming cluttered  The bathroom was large athough the shower head kept sliding down the height adustment bracket Free wifi in the hotel bar was a plus with free newspapers available with breakfast  We had a continental breakfast included in the room rate and we found it good enough to set us up for the day  cereal  OJ  tex  coffee  toast  rolls  yogurts  ham  chess and fruit I would stay here again 
P =>   ent hotel with some pros and cons We stayed in the Barkston Gardens hotel for three nights in late february for    euros a night  which is a good deal for a hotel in central London  The hotel had pros and cons Pros   Location  just     metres from Earl s Court tube  which is on the Picadilly and District Line   free continental breakfast with fresh croissants and rolls  Comfortable bed  but it was small   ent bathroom with a lot of space  hot water and good water pressure   Computer with free use of internet in the lobby and free wifi  when it s working    see cons Cons   The room was very hot  We had to sleep without any blankets  I think it was at least   C in the room  may have been more   The creaky floors  We could hear the people above us walking around the room and were annoyed by our own creaky floor  The showerhead could use some cleaning   Very slow elevator  we used the stairs instead   The wi fi internet wasn t available on the first two days we were thereAll in all we had a nice stay and would recommend this hotel for anyone who is travelling on a budget  Just don t expect luxury and dress lightly  
P =>  Good Budget Hotel for London Location is definitely a great selling point for this hotel   just off Earls Court Road  which is full of places to eat and a very quick walk to the tube  Nevertheless  our room was very quiet  overlooking the residences that back onto the rear of the hotel  The staff were friendly and helpful  allowing us to check in two hours early without charge  I ll be honest   when I visit London I don t spend too much time in the hotel and this is fine for crashing out at the end of the day  Beds were comfortable and the room itself was of a good size and clean  The bathroom would have benefited from a little refurbishment work but was perfectly acceptable  I cannot comment on breakfast as I always ate outside the hotel  Note  no evening meals are now being served  Only downside to our stay was the lift  It proved increasingly difficult to call and by the last day had given up completely  We left the engineers to it and walked down the stairs  Could happen anywhere but it did seem that this event wasn t too unusual   not be great for those with limited mobility  Don t expect    comfort here but for a brief visit to London on a budget  it s fine  I would recommend the hotel for budget conscious travellers who do not spend too much time at the hotel  If you re looking for luxury  it may not be the place for you  For the value  it gets four stars  
P =>  Competitive price for a comfortable hotel Pros      mt from Earl s Court station   quiet zone  with fast food and restaurants in the immediate nearby   comfortable bed with two pillows  and I am     mt high    very good price  I paid    pounds day   clean bathroom and room   free wifi Neutral   breakfast   very hot  I cannot stay fully dressed in my room Cons   noisy floor  especially from the above floor  
P =>   lived up to the reviews As a traveller on a budget I rely heavily on Trip Advisor reviews when it comes to booking accomodation  Once again I have found a hotel which  perhaps because of realistic expectations  has not dissapointed Yes it is a little tired  especially in the corridors  and a lick of paint would do no harm  Yes the floors creaked and as an added extra during my one week stay the fire alarm went off for no apparent reason a number of times     including memorably once at  am   BUT        The room I was allocated was clean  the bedding  and importantly the bed itself  was in good order  The bathroom was well maintained and while I did have a shower over the bath i also had a bath large enough to have a proper bath in    and I had no problems with lack of hot water The staff were very helpful      starting with reception who  even though I arrived at   am were happy for me to check in and go straight to my room  Gus and his team made sure that the breakfast rush was well managed and the cooked breakfast was fine The hotel is well located and when I compared its prices with others that I investigated  gives value for money  
P =>   To some extent then   the luck of the draw In London with my work   stayed at this hotel  Monday with a check out Friday morning  on two consecutive weeks  Overall impressions  Staff were friendly and accommodating  The hotel is tired but the bedding and towels in the rooms are clean and in good order  On both my visits I was located at the front of the building overlooking what must be  The Barkston Gardens  The hotel is just around the corner from the Earls Court tube   Earls Court Road end   I like to sleep with the window open  and the noise from the Earls Court Road was always present and can be really loud at times  Breakfast was provided  staff friendly   but the fare was so totally bland I only tried it the once  First week  small single room   cosy  on the fourth floor  Cubicle shower  quite adequate  but hot water is something that appears to be provided only at certain times during any    hour period   The central heating works fine and can be turned up and down to suit  so if you like it cooler when you go to bed  as I do  then you re catered for  Nice touch  tea coffee making facility provided and the staff did keep this topped up  Second week  larger room on the sixth floor  Shower over bath   and I can only guess that due to insufficient water pressure at this altitude was the reason I had to run around under the shower in order to get wet   didn t really matter though as hot water barely managed to get up there  When in the room I noted that from the state of my bare black feet  that the carpet was due a clean   could have really used that hot water To some extent then  clearly a case of the luck of the draw in The Barkston  Although I have returned to London for subsequent weeks I ve relocated to another hotel for a similar price and overall I m happier there  
P =>  Cheap but a bit of a dump This hotel is in a pretty good location  on a side street off Earls  Court Road  overlooking a garden area  It is very convenient for the Earls  Court tube station  The traffic and people on the main road are audible but with the windows shut just about bearable  ear plugs might be a good move though   The noise does continue fairly late though The hotel is pretty grubby looking  paintwork etc desperately needs attention  which makes you feel that it is not very clean  although in reality the sheets and bathroom seemed fine  It s ok if you re on a budget and willing to tolerate it  but not ideal My main gripe was the temperature of the room  I visited in ember and for some reason the room was absolutely boiling hot  I arrived about   pm and opened the windows immediately  in the hope that it would cool down before I wanted to go to sleep  The radiator had evidently been on but was off by that time and there seemed to be no other way to control the temperature  Unfortunately it remained extremely hot all through the night  forcing me to leave the windows and curtains wide open to try and get as much air as possible  and even then I only got a few hours  sleep  I do not think this is normal for ember  especially considering that I generally get cold easily I will definitely not be returning  
P =>  positionposition this hotel is a typically old London hotel with acceptable service and good breakfast   though it can get a little crowded However the position is great   a side street off Earl s Court Road facing leafy private gardens The tube is a five minute walk and offers a quick direct ride from Heathrow being on the Piccadilly line which then offers you an ideal base to all the attractions of London Get an Oyster card before you leave for use on the tube from Heathrow and then yse it for the rest of your stay It s so easy and much cheaper than single tickets Avoid eating at the pubs in Earl s Court   check out the little restaurants down some of the side streets   
P => perfect location all reviews i read before booking this hotel were right  the hotel is a perfect location with subway only about   mins away  only complaint and it very small was that lift so slow  would highly recommend it to anyone going to london just for holiday  willie waterford ireland  
P =>   Convenient location close to tube I picked this hotel as I needed to stay in the Earls Court area and wanted to be near the tube so I wouldn t have to drag my suitcase very far  This hotel is ideally situated Check in was efficient and friendy  I was on the  th floor   there is a lift  My room was at the back and was very quiet  The room was clean  tidy and cosy  A hospitality tray was provided with a kettle  tea  coffee and   packs of biscuits  There was a trouser press  chest of drawers and a small wardrobe with approx   hangers There was a TV   old but works fine for the main   channels The bathroom was fine   shower over the bath  Plenty of towels and a little basket containing soap  shower cap  sewing kit and shoe shine pad  There was a large container of shower gel mounted on the wall above the bath  Continental breakfast was included in my room rate  The breakfast room was very busy   it was a Sunday morning   but I got a table without trouble  The choice of breakfast items was fine  Different cereals  tinned fruit including prunes  slices of ham and cheese  croissants and fresh rolls   which were lovely  toast  yoghurt  tea and coffee  The staff were very efficient in clearing tables etc If required there are plenty of places to eat in Earls Court Road which is a minutes walk from the hotel   restaurants  takeaways  coffee shops  pubs  grocery shops etc  I needed to leave my luggage at the hotel after check out time and this was no problem as they have a secure luggage room All in all I had a good stay at this reasonably priced hotel and I would certainly stay there again when I am next in London  
P =>   This wonderful hotel seems to generate very mixed reviews  It was only with great trepidation that I took a chance that the guests who had loved this hotel were more precise than those who hated it  I was travelling with a good friend who expects good accommodations and who is probably used to spending more than what I am willing to spend I booked this room as part of a package through Air Canada vacations  They had the best deal for a direct flight from Ottawa and had the flexibility to book for the exact number of days we needed to be in London Our check in and check out were efficient  they had a safety deposit box for our valuables  They also had plug adaptors at the front desk for a small deposit so I could plug my laptop and camera into the     volt mains power   check to ensure that you have a switch able           volt power supply  My bedside lamp died one morning and when the problem was reported to the front desk they came right up with a box of assorted lamps  one which corrected the problem Our room on level   faced the back courtyard   not a very pretty view but very quiet  We had a large bedroom with a comfortable king sized bed with sufficient room to move about in and plenty of storage space  The room and bathroom were approximately twice the size of similar priced accommodations I have had in Paris There have been comments about the television reception   about the   available channels and the old TV s   but we could get the BBC for the news and who needs anything else  The room also has wireless internet  slow   an iron and ironing board and a hair dryer  The bathroom was enormous with a large tub and shower with an unlimited supply of hot water though the shower was tricky and it took a little time to determine how it worked Our room was super clean with very cosy towels and sheets We had pre paid for the continental buffet breakfast as part of our package deal  There seems to be a lot of complaints about the breakfasts but I don t know what the complainers are talking about  Every morning our breakfast included an assortment of juices  coffee  the English have difficulty making palatable coffee  and tea  prunes  grapefruit and orange slices or peaches  sliced ham and cheese  toast and jams  The full English breakfast is an additional      pounds  Granted this isn t what I normally eat for breakfast but the variety and quantity of the food offered was very reasonable considering the cost  On a few occasions we had to wait for about   minutes for a seat in the welcoming and bright breakfast room  The service was efficient and friendly  The hotel is located about a three minute walk from Earl s Court   There is terrific local connections to the tube and buses run frequently a few steps away  We found a number of local restaurants  Chinese  Indian and French which were both inexpensive and excellent just around the corner on Earl s Court Road  Earl s Court Gardens  Hogarth Place and Kenway Road  In closing I found the staff helpful and their English skills were adequate to their tasks  
P =>   what a gem This was my second stay at the Barkston Gardens  having stayed in     also  The reason i returned was because it was such a great stay the first time round i thought it must be a fluke It wasnt  the hotel is a little worn and could do with a little decor TLC however it is clean  the staff are friendly  the rooms are a good size and it is so advantageously situated for travel with both underground  road links and within walking distance    mins  from some of the museums through some of londons most affulent and beguiling architecture  Also you can simply fall out of the hotel and you are eating out in any number of restaurants you simply couldnt ask for more Another       from me and a definate promise to return A well priced gem in the heart of London  
P =>   Itchy few days  I booked this hotel as a   th Birthday surprise and emailed the hotel advising it was a   th but got no reply    perhaps I was hoping for to much  Arrived  checked in and all ok  had asked for joining rooms as we have   young children and got rooms on different floors which makes sharing the shampoo and toothpaste a cardiac workout  Rooms are basic  only   channels on TV but you are in London so TV is not a priority  After  st night I noticed bite marks from insects on my arms  checked the beds and found    what we think were bed bugs  now I am home and checked on the net I am convinced  In fact I am still itching now Rooms get very warm  our windows looked onto the back  into private homes so make sure your curtains are closed  The floors creak but it is old Breakfast is very very simple  Its not even what I would class a continental breakfast which is what it was advised as  You get a pot of Tea  Coffee or Chocolate    Rounds of toast    people   the  quot buffet quot  is a plate of cheese slices  ham slices  buns  yoghurts  fruit  tinned  and cereal    how old     The staff are all foreign  If you need help getting to places ask at the tube  they are very helpful  Bar is for the dead or elderly only  the lady serving spent the hour glaring at us as we only got   round So I think thats it  we will not be staying there again   its cheap  ish  not cheerful and very basic    and with bed bugs  
P =>   Good location average hotel This hotel is strictly average  The size of the room you re in is hit or miss  so be a little fussy while checking in  The rooms have all the basic amenities and are reasonable clean and comfortable Breakfast is usually included and is adequate  but nothing fancy  Don t bother with room service or the hotel restaurant  there s plenty of options for food and drink nearby that are far better  Staff are rather stoic and don t speak English very well The advantage of picking this hotel is its location  it s a stone s throw from Earl s Court station on the Picadilly Line  so getting to the hotel from Heathrow Airport is quite easy  And once you re there  the proximity to the Tube station makes it quite easy to get to other parts of London you want to go  
P =>  Complete Satisfaction Excellent Hotel  main is Room and Bed Size Confort and cleanness is Important  Everythig is all right  stay there and Happy and Enjoyble Trip  NICE   
P =>  Convenient Quiet Location Our family of   stayed at the Barkston Gardens Hotel for   nights  Having previously traveled in Europe  we re aware that the standards in European budget hotels are not the same as are expected routinely by US hotel guests  The last time we stayed in London  the room was only slightly larger than our single double bed Our family room was spacious and comfortable  allowing us to move around without tripping over each other or our suitcases  Yes the carpet is worn  and  as expected  the floor was very squeaky  but the street outside was quiet at night  and we loved having a view of the gardens across the street The continental breakfast had enough variety that you didn t have to eat exactly the same thing every day  but it gave you a good start for your day and the breakfast room was sunny and pleasant  We loved the convenience of being so close to the tube stop  and thought that the prices on the nearby restaurants were more reasonable than those in Central London  We ate at Dino s and the Little French Restaurant We would stay here the next time we visit London 
P =>  Value for money    We booked this hotel as we were staying in London on a budget and were looking for a hotel near central London  We had booked the full English for breakfast and found this to be good value and there was plenty to eat  along with the continental on offer was enough to set you up for the day  The staff were poliet and friendly enough  We booked a double room and were pleasantly surprised to find   double beds in our room along with a massive bathroom  all clean  The hotel is clean but if anything could do with a spruce up here and there  In all if you want to stay in central London for less than     this is the hotel for you  We will certainly stay here in future  
P =>   Good value The hotel is conveniently located near to Earls Court tube station   convenient access from Heathrow  Eating places  launderette and pharmacy are nearby  Staff were friendly and helpful  Has a comfortable lounge and bar  Room and bathroom were adequate size  Continental breakfast was plain but ample  Is in the London traffic congestion zone and has no parking  I would stay there again  
P =>   Cut Your Expections in Half It is often said you get what you pay for   and this is true about this hotel  While the U S  Dollar is at a low point in value  many Americans still want to travel to London  but  usually look for hotels is a price range that fit their wallet  That was my situation and how I ended up staying at this hotel for four nights The hotel is fairly well worn and the lobby is nothing special  The outside look of the hotel is better that its inside  The hotel is made up of a series of old Victorian homes and the narrow corridors with multiple fire doors makes navigating these halls very difficult when you have luggage in tow The hotel s location is good  being just a short walk from the Earls Court tube station  There is a wide range of eateries  including fast food  in the neighborhood Do not go to this hotel expecting a range of services   there are barely any  The WIFI service only works in the lobby so if you are traveling on business  I would hesitate to recommend this property to you The TV reception in my room was like watching a blizzard on a tiny set  While the room was basic and clean  I regret the front desk staff were lacking in skills on how to be friendly  To rate this hotel two stars is a bit of a stretch  I have stayed in Motel   s that are far superior to this property  I have learned my lesson  cut the ratings in half when it comes to Trip Advisor    
P =>   Bleak and dreary just like the weather I would like to preface this review with the fact that I found London to be the most depressing city that I have ever had the pleasure of visiting  and as such my opinions of the Barkston Gardens Hotel are coloured by my opinions  We stayed here as part of an around the world honeymoon for almost a week  We had a room on the  th floor  at the back of the hotel  On arriving we discovered that the window had a gap in it and that the heater did not come on until after  pm   not good when it is   degrees celsius outside  and all you want to do is go to sleep  Our room was basic  although it did have a kettle with tea making facilities which we greatly appreciated  The breakfast was strange  with an entire ritual revolving around the maitre d for the breakfast room  If you speak limited English beware  Questions and requests by staff in the breakfast room to non English speakers were treated with greatest aplomb and tact  shouted or yelled when these guests failed to understand the first time  be some staff training in continental European languages such as Italian  French  German and even Japanese wouldn t go astray  perhaps   The one thing that the Barkston Gardens Hotel could immediately improve upon  is its customer service ethic  A smile or a more pleasant attitude at the check in counter would have made most of our qualms with this hotel wash away immediately That said  the price was good for London and the location is excellent   just around the corner from the Earl s Court Road tube station  
P =>   Great Location Friendly staff We have just returned from a   night stay at this hotel   Check the Hotel Website for rates as they were cheaper than other sites we tried  We arrived around  pm in the evening and found the reception staff to be very helpful  Breakfast is served on Weekdays from     and the continental breakfast offers basic but good and plentiful choice  We found that the decor in the room was a little tired  but the bathroom had been refurbished and was very clean  with fresh towels provided daily  After reading the reviews on this site we decided that we should shower in the evening  but the first morning we tried the shower and found that we had a lot of hot water  maybe this was because other guests were following the hotels advice to shower in the evening  There are a lot of choice of restaurants near to the hotel  we tried Zizzi  good for Pizza  and Masala Zone  where we shared a grand Thali   Lots of other choice in the area  Chinese  Japanese  Portugese  Hamburgers  French and more  Very handy if you have had a long day sightseeing and don t feel like going far for something to eat  The hotel is very close to Earls court Tube station  but it is situated just off Earls Court Road and there is not a lot of street noise  Check out was efficient  and we were able to leave our luggage and have another full day of sightseeing before returning to the hotel to collect the luggage  This hotel is very handy for sightseeing as you are able to access the Piccadilly line on the tube  Earls court tube station is in Zone   of the metro and travelling to the hotel was the only time that we travelled into Zone    apart from a quick trip to portabella road   All in all I would recommend this hotel for people travelling on a budget  who are looking for somewhere clean  comfortable  and in a good location  
P =>   Very Nice Stayed three nights at this hotel  Picked it because it was close to the tube station and busses  I was very happy with the location  The single room was suitable and I did not feel closed in  The hotel is old but the bathroom had been updated  Continental breakfast was included and enough to get a good start on the day  The staff was good and check in and out was simple  They also offer free internet  That was a plus just to keep in touch with family  I travel on my own and have a problem walking long distances so this hotel was the best for me  It was not the Ritz or Hilton  but the value was above average for being in London  I would definitely stay there again  I saw a lot of single travelers  couples and business people when I stayed  The worst thing for me is that they have central heating and at night the room was too hot  I had to open the window and because I was in the front of the hotel  heard all the noise from the traffic on the main road  Otherwise  I enjoyed the stay  
P =>   Find an alternate hotel  Hotel had a sign stating that there were  quot problems with running shower water between       a m  quot  We tried to alter our shower times  planning to shower in the evenings or afternoons but instead found NO hot water available at any time throughout the day  When we discussed this with the manager  our room was moved to an alternate one in the hotel   this time  the shower ran only a trickle of ice cold water any time of day or night  In addition  when we turned on the light in the morning there were roaches on our floor running for cover   Ick  The TV plays only   channels  no alternatives like cable or movies  and internet access is only in the lobby lounge area where there is no privacy to work  Location was great  but there are FAR more important things than only that   there are other alternatives near the tube throughout London that are reasonably priced   take one of those  Run  don t walk  from this spot  Finally  you should know that the photo run on all websites is NOT the hotel  it s a building across the street   Talk about false advertising    
P =>   Avoid the basement rooms Unfortunately we were given a basement room  it was very dark  and needed the lights on all the time  It was a big room  with bath and shower  but there was no heating in the bathroom  and the toilet was dirty at the bottom of the bowl  The breakfast was good  and it was very convenient for Earls Court underground  
P => Think about what you want and set your expectations accordingly  I stayed for   nights when visiting London with my wife to spend some time with our children  The location is excellent     minutes walk from EC tube station  There is a very good choice of places to eat  including the hotel  within easy walking distance  Basic shops are handy   Boots  M amp S food  Sainsburys  Threshers  Somerfield etc    so you can pick up your day s picnic provisions on your way to the tube The hotel is old  amp  shabby  but it s clean and the TV in the room worked OK  The staff were very helpful and friendly  despite my having seen some of them receiving totally unjustified abuse from an African  prima donna  type  This while they were  quot going the extra mile quot  to try and help her with her travel plans  I guess she was missing her slaves Our room rate included  continental breakfast   which was better than we expected  One morning we  upgraded  to a full English breakfast for    each   and it saw us through the rest of the day  The fried bread was brilliant During check in  it was pointed out to us that they were experiencing difficulties with the water supply  which meant reduced pressure  amp  airlocks  and that baths  amp  showers could be problematic during peak periods  As far as I could see  water pressure was poor       but we worked around it with a bit of patience  Had we checked in to the Best Western a few yards further along the road  I m sure the plumbing would have been fine  amp  everything less shabby   but it wasn t worth the extra         per night to us If you want a great location  decent breakfast  free wireless internet throughout the ground floor  a reasonably priced yet comfortable bar  with a free PC Internet station  and somewhere clean and relatively cheap to rest your head then it s fine  If you want the  branded chain  experience then pay for the logo  amp  don t stay here  It s London  The city is expensive  so set realistic expectations  amp  decide what matters to you  
P =>   Great price and excellent location My   year old daughter and I arrived early  before our room was available  but were greeted by friendly staff and were able to leave our bags in the office until we returned  The hotel is situated on a quiet street a mere   minute walk from Earl s Court underground station and has very handy banks  resturants  an M amp S and Boots etc  on the main road  The hotel itself was very clean  our room was spacious with   queen sized beds  an armchair  kettle  TV and bathroom  Water pressue is a problem in the mornings so shower in the evening  The shower was very English style  so do not expect any power shower jets  Soap  amp  shampoo provided Breakfast is self service overseen by a manager complete with bow tie  Basic fare but eat all you like Recommended  
P =>  Excellent value pleasant experience Excellent location  about   mins walk from Earls court tube station   which is a very good starting point to get around London   I was a little concerned about this hotel after reading reviews  I like my comfort  but we had a good experience Check in was quick efficient  The room was a good size  nice view over a small park and posh apartments  Good high ceilings and tv with usual   uk channels  The room also had kettle and teabags coffee milk sugar etc  Conveniently  there was an iron and ironing board  The bathroom was large and very clean  The water in the shower was a bit low in pressure but when running for a couple of mins it was good  The floorboards were very creaky and yes carpets a bit worn but overall decor and room in general was quite good  We ordered breakfast one morning and it was fairly poor       for   people  It wasn t quite what we had ordered and it was small and cheap  Given the location it s worth popping out for breakfast The major attraction to this hotel is the price  about    euro for   nights for   people   This is fantastic value for the location  We didn t have any problems whatsoever and would certainly return  
P =>   Great location clean hotel better price The hotel is just a few steps from Earl s Court station in a very nice area There are plenty of choices for your meals around the area The rooms are clean   bathrooms have generous proportions if compared to hotels of its ranking Definitively I would not mind staying there again if I return to London for vacations  
P =>  A real bargain Make no mistake  this hotel is not perfect  The mattress sagged a little  the carpet was worn  and everything was very plain  But for the price  it s an  incredible  bargain  We stayed in central London for about    pounds a night  We had feared the place would be flyblown and bedbug infested  but it was perfectly clean and serviceable  We would definitely stay there again  
P =>   Okay for the price This hotel has a fantastic location in Earl s Court with really large bedrooms with high ceilings and large bathrooms  The property is in dire need of renovation in that the carpets  both in the hallways and the bedrooms are very worn and stained  The bedroom furniture is basic and the beds could do with upgrading  Having said that the rooms are spotlessly clean with clean linen and tea and coffee facilities  The bar is basic and serves snacks and light meals with very friendly staff Compared to other hotels available in Earls Court this hotel is good value  
P =>  Nice Hotel Great Location This was my fist trip to London  I booked the hotel thru the website lastminutetravel com  Upon arrival  the front desk could not find my reservation  I presented the voucher that I printed from the website  The hotel stored my luggage while they worked out the issue and I took a walk for about one hour in the neighborhood  which is exceptional  A coworker recommended Earl s Court  which turned out to be spot on  Not only was the tube station right around the corner from the hotel  but also the main street  which has all the amenities that you would need  banks  restaurants  pubs  cafes    Upon returning  they had the problem rectified and I checked into my room  The room was somewhat typical of other   star European hotels that I stayed at  The only issues I can recall is that the comforter on the bed had a rip in it  and the floors were somewhat creaky  Making for some distraction when trying to fall asleep at night  but it wasn t completely awful by any means  I had my breakfast in the hotel almost every day  which was included in the price of the room  I took advantage of this since the exchange rate from US to GBP was     at the time  worse today   If I were to return I would consider this hotel again only because the price was right and the location was fantastic  However  I would also take a look at some other alternatives for a few more coins  
P =>  Perfect location lovely room I stayed in this hotel and I have to say  I was very surprised  room was very clean  breakfast was very good  staff was very helpful and friendly  Location wise it is brilliant  you can go around London easily and the underground is literally one minute walking distance from the hotel  district  circle and piccadilly line   I really suggest to book this hotel if you are looking for a nice  handy and not   star place to stay in London  
P =>   loved this hotel We stayed in this hotel for   nights this ust and were very pleased with our accommodations  The room and the bathroom were very surprisingly large  considering that we paid    pounds per for twin room   Everything was very clean and we had all toiletries replaced as required  The only problem was that the room was on the first floor with the windows to the street  so it could be quite noise in the evening  I must say that we were so tired every day that it did not ruin our vacation  The location is very convenient    mins to the subway and there are several fast food places around  a necessary when you are traveling with a teenager  plus a pharmacy  ks and Spencer and some sit  down restaurants  we liked ZiZi   This hotel is also only     minutes to riot Kensington hotel from were most of the tour agencies can pick you up for day tours  Definitely will be staying there again  
P =>    Staff  were awful I stayed here thank GOD for only   night  I tried to check in early      AM  and they said I would have to pay for one night s  the previous night  and the rate is USA dollar s  get this       USD  IT WAS AWFUL  AVOID    AND on Expedia they rank this as a   star  NOT   Expedia asked me to rate my stay  I CERTAINLY DID     
P =>  Nice Option on a budget A little worn around the edges but was quiet  clean and comfortable at an affortable price for London  Just around the corner from   Pubs with food   tons of Restaurants sit down and fast food   internet cafes  cheap long distance calls  a laundromat  a ks and Spencer  a Boots  the Earl s Court Tube and numerous bustops     is one I remember   Was upgraded from a twin room to a family room at no extra cost  Dan at the front deck was very helpful at check in  Breakfast was very basic and dull but was included in the price and you could upgrade to a full English one if so desired  Would recommend this Hotel as a good Budget option with a great location near restaurants and the Tube  
P =>  Quiet and excellent loaction  Stayed here   one week Excellent location  less than   minutes from the tube  And located on a quiet street Stayed in a twin room on the ground floor  Close to the dining room Check in was fast and efficient  Keycard entry to the rooms The room was clean and of a good size  Beds were comfy and had clean sheets and duvets  The sheets had a couple holes in them and the pillows were rather flat and not firm at all The room was tastefully decorated There were tea coffee facilites but the complimentary biscuits were not the freshest There was a trousers press in the room and an iron and board was available at reception Usual TV  with standard   channels with good reception and a working remote The ensuite was big and clean  but only had a shower  The shower was powerful but drained very slowly  u ended standing in a pool  I reported the problem to reception and they sorted it But then we noticed that it began to leak      we ended putting newspaper down to soak up the excess water  And on a few nights i saw small roaches  But i guess that was due to the fact of being so close to the kitchen and the leaking bathroom There was body shampoo provided The first few nights were hot but in most hotels in london there was no AC or fans  But with the window open it was ok We had complimentary continental breakfast in our deal      pn Included cereals yogort cheese ham and fruits Breakfast was run by the matre de  who ran a prompt and efficient service and the waitresses were aso very polite Full english was available at       The lobby as nice and there was a large reception room  where u can watch tv  read the complimentary newspapers or magazines Free wifi was available  which was fast The hotel is located in an area  with restaurants  ATMs Pharmacy and every other shop u may need I found the staff overall very helpful and polite  I misplaced my keycard on the last night    i came back in a     pm and it was replaced with out any hesitation I left my brand new mobile phone in the room by mistake  went into london  when i came back the bed was made and my phone was placed on the bed for me Because of the honesty of the staff and how polite they were  I am able to overlook the bathroom problems     Nice comfy hotel  at a good price in an ideal loaction  Would stay here again  
P =>   Spacious rooms and excellent location Barkston Gardens Hotel is an old hotel situated only   minute from Earl s Court Tube Station  The location is unbeatable  the area is pleasant and safe and packed with nice restaurants  try the  quot Little French Restaurant quot  on Hogarth Rd nearby  they serve three course dinner for only       supermarkets and shops  The reception is very large and well maintained and so is the breakfast dining room  Breakfast is buffet style and consists of tea coffee  fruit juice  cerals  bread rolls  toast and marmalade cheese ham  Twin rooms are the largest I have experienced in London  I have visited this city at least    times and thus tried numerous hotels  Non smoking rooms are situated on  th floor but make sure to be very specific when asking for one  I did but upon arrival I was informed that they had missed my request  However  they managed to fix that after the first night  If you want a quiet room  ask for one facing the backyard  I have stayed at Barkston Gdns Hotel four times  both in summer and in winter  and will certainly return again  A big minus for the very worn plastic carpet in the bathrooms though  Staff is mostly efficient and helpful  Be careful at check out however  if you are paying with a non British credit card they will charge you in your local currency   at a not very good rate  Ask them to charge you in   Sterling instead and save money In all a decent hotel with excellent location  Don t hesitate to go there but don t expect it to be like Hilton  
P =>   Smelly on the ground floor Stayed from   th   th of e  booked on      and it looked reasonable  We were staying on the ground floor near the dining room  smelly smelly Smelly is all I can say about it  Perhaps they reserve these rooms for people like us who booked through a booking agency    No fan in the toilet so it got even more smelly quickly  the carpet was ill fitting  coming off the stairs  and worn  One of our party was all bites over her legs from the bed fleas It has a good location and one could overlook the tattiness if it didn t smell  but for giving one of us a bad dose of bites  the Barkston Gardens gets one out of five  Don t stay here if you don t book direct  
P =>  Loved it We stayed here for   nights in il on our honeymoon  We were pleasantly surprised after hearing some negative reviews  The room we were in  although the door wouldn t open all the way due to the bed being in the way  was clean and looked out onto the gardens   really made us feel like we were in London The bathroom was massive and also really clean  Although the decor wasn t beautiful  I m really fussy when it comes to cleanliness and sleeping in strange beds  but in this place I had no problem There s also an internet downstairs in the bar which is free to use  Sometimes we d have to wait  but not for long  The internet is quick to use and the room isn t too nosiy to use it in One of the best things was the breakfast  The room is nice  and they give you a pot of coffee or tea along with a rack of toast  You can then eat cereal  croissants  cheeses  fruit  yoghurt  juice    there s plenty and it s done really nicely  It was our favourite breakfast in the whole of Europe Also  as others have mentioned it s really close to Earls Court Station   it takes less than   minutes to walk  So if you come by plane  get the tube from the airport to Earls Court  It takes only half an hour and is much cheaper than paying for taxi  We loved it here  Don t go expecting a glamorous hotel  but if you want something clean  affordable and convenient then this is the place for you  We d definitely go back  
P =>  Good value Adequate sized double room and en suite bathroom  if a little dated but clean and comfortable  Basic continental breakfast included in a good value for money package Staff friendly and helpful and the hotel is in a very well served area for shops and restaurants and   minutes from the Underground station The only downside was the incredibly creaky floorboards everywhere  If you cannot get a room on the top floor  just hope that the occupants above you weigh less than   stone and are not training for a marathon  Take earplugs if you are a light sleeper  
P =>  Great Value for Money for a London Hotel As others have said  the hotel is not outstanding  however it is a good price  clean  if rather well worn  and extremely well situated  When I stayed I was in a large twin room with views out over roof tops  not over the garden   It was quiet and perfectly adequate for our needs  The staff were extremely friendly and there was plenty for breakfast  even if it does showcase the more stereotypical view of English food   You are right next to Earl s Court so on my upcoming trip to London for a show at Earl s Court I have chosen to stay there again  The price and location are difficult to beat  
P =>  Do not stay here  I stayed at this property in il      with my wife  son and brother in law and I am still angry  Do not stay here  It is advertised as a superior property and it is not  Nice location and good view of the park from the front of the hotel  Very poor value for the money  I was injured at the hotel and was denied medical attention by the manager on duty  Actually I was berated by the manager on duty  JS 
P =>   absolutely fine Stayed here for   nights on      and      with my girlfriend  We had a lovely big room on the third floor  I ve never seen such a large  bright room in a London hotel  I paid     pounds for the whole stay inc  breakfast  The hotel had friendly staff  is in an excellent location  and was very quiet  There is a nice little bar and pleasantdining room serving a good breakfast  I was very worried by some of the bad reviews i d read but I have nothing to complain about  I willstay here again and would recommend it to anyone  particularly room      Thanks to the hotel for a lovely weekend  
P =>  Absolutely Disgusting A health hazard  Stay here at you peril I arrived at the hotel at seven in the morning  note that the postcode provided by the hotel is incorrect   Check in was at two in the afternoon  but the hotel had a secure storage room for me to store my luggage  This was the first of two good things about the hotel When I came back in the afternoon I was booked into a twin share room in the basement  even though I had booked a single   To get to this room I had to walk past the dining area  through a set of double doors and down two flights of stairs  As I walked through the second of the double doors I got the shock of my life  The air stank of cigarette smell  Not only did it stink to high heaven  but it smelt like it had been around since World War Two  The smell continued all the way down into the basement and into my room The room was surprisingly large   too large really for my needs  The sheets in the beds were clean  but I d say the bedcovers were well and truly due for their yearly bath  The bathroom was adequate  All in all I d say the state of the room was reasonable  but this doesn t mean much if you can t breath After spending the last forty something hours in transit from country Australia and then walking around London  I did not have the energy to complain  I collapsed and woke up six hours later choking and wheezing from the cigarette fumes  I tried to get more sleep but it was impossible I spent the next couple of days snorting black soot out of my nose  After washing my clothes a couple of times I still couldn t get the smell out of them The second of the good thing about the hotel was the breakfast  The service and the food were excellent   not enough to get me through the front door again though  Stay at the York Hotel instead  
P =>  Really good value for money This hotel is a perfect place if you are looking for a lower budget but still decent  I suspect some of the negative reviews are written by people that are or competition or have no idea what you can get for different price levels in London The location on a side street of Earl s Court road and   min form Earl s Court tube station is excellent  The area is really nice with lot s of restaurants at all price levels and food types and also nicepubs  I went yesterday to the Blackbird which is round the corner  with mixed public but a lot of trendy people  young professionals let s say Then the staff is very friendly  They have loads of adapters so you can connect your stuff to the UK mains system  Instead of charging you     a day  which they did once to us in Hilton LAX  they ask you a deposit of    pounds that you get back when you return it  A half pint beer costs only      pounds The wireless access if you have a laptop  or the available workstation is fantastic  I am here on business and I am working all day here looking out on the garden  which is in front of the building  accross the street  not on the back My room was good  clean  the bed very comfortable  the shower with lot s of hot water  Of course  for this price  I paid    pounds incl  breakfast  the furniture is not supernice design or supernew  but it works and it is clean  What else do you need  The room even has a press to press your pants Next time when I stay in London for business I definitely come back  
P =>   Overall not bad   some rooms nicer than others  My friends and I stayed here on   separate occasions  during   week   and each time we had   rooms  So we saw   different rooms altogether  and I can tell you that your satisfaction will depend largely on the room you re assigned  It s a very oddly shaped building  or conglomeration of buildings   and some rooms are much roomier and easier to get to than others  Overall the place was clean  pleasant and well located  Don t stay here on your honeymoon  but it s a good base if you re planning to spend your days sightseeing  Yes  it smelled of smoke  but so does everything in Europe  the interiors were shabby  but again  that s Europe  And the free wireless in the lobby bar area was a very nice perk  In our experience  the rooms with one double bed were much nicer than the rooms with   single beds  so keep that in mind if you re traveling with someone you don t mind sharing a bed with  
P =>   I second what a dump  Warning do not go here  This hotel was a complete disappointment  The only plus is the one other reviewers have mentioned in that it s close to the tube  The room was bigger than those in Europe and bathroom was quite large   We stayed on the fourth floor and it needs a re do  Did not want to touch anything  the bedspreads  curtains  carpet and chairs were filthy and very worn out  The windows don t close all the way letting in cold air  it got so cold I asked the desk how we turn on the radiator in room  he said you don t  but gave me a small room heater  Doesn t look anything like the picture  picture makes it look like it s out in the country away from things  it is not and there seemed to be alot of traffic noise for having a small park across the street from it  Have pic showing park just outside of hotel 
P =>  What a Dump What a Dump  I was booked there for four nights at the end of ober thru Brit Air  The room was reeking of mold and had rotten spots in the floorboards  The whole bathroom and especially the shower was festooned with mold  The desk people were surly and unresponsive and made no effort to at least get the mold neutralized in the bathroom and would not provide an alternate room  be they don t like Brit Air customers  London hotel rooms are rarely a good value compared to any first world country but this room and hotel don t even qualify as third world  What a Dump  I see this hotel belongs to the Cairn group and if this is an example of their management competence  all their hotels should be avoided  
P =>  What s the fuss all about  I booked a single en suite with continental breakfast for    pounds night via venere com  My room was great  clean  decent bed  and had a kettle and complimentary tea coffe cookies  The front desk was kind enough to bring me an electric heater when I called down  the heat isn t on this early in the season  and I m from California so I have zero tolerance for cold  The staff was helpful  the hotel was clean and inviting  I couldn t have picked a more convienient location  close to Earl s Court tube station  food stores  a small grocery  and several pubs  I d definitely stay there again  and would encourage friends to do so also  
P =>  Basic but good hotel I have stayed at the Barkston Gardens Hotel a few times now  The main reason being that is a two minute walk to Earls  Court Underground station which connects you onto the district line and piccadily line   great for eating and shopping in Covent Garden or going to see a show   ie Phantom of the Opera The staff are very friendly   for example my flight was delayed and then travelled up from gatwick airport and there were queues everywhere  i arrived at the hotel at   am and asked if i could leave my luggage only to be told that my room was ready of me to check in to  Breakfast is also good  The restaurant serves beautiful food  only thing is it is nearly always empty and sometimes it is a long wait   but worth it I would agree that the hotel needs redecorated and new bathrooms  but when you pay          for a room in london you can t really compain I would recommend the hotel to people on budget and want it as base for a trip to London  
P =>  Stay somewhere else The only plus with this hotel is the location  It is only   mins walk to the Earl s Court underground station The room we stayed was horrible   Transparent  sheer  curtain on bathroom window  the window is big and facing the bathtub  I have to get undress dress behind the shower curtain  standing inside the bathtub   Extremely noisy  People yelling from the street  I dont think it is a good neighborhood  and you can always hear sirens from police car early morning and late night  You can also hear truck coming to pick up trash in the morning  Paint in the bathroom is peeling off Wallpaper in the room is peeling off Big stain on blanket Rotten wood window frame Dirty carpet Dusty hair blow dryerOne thing we found funny is the mirror  It was cut from a big mirror  you can tell from the design and the cutting  and put in a picture frame  Another room probably have the other half  
P =>  Location location If you want a cheap clean hotel in central London this is the place for you  The hotel is just around the corner from Earl s Court underground station  in a very quiet side street overlooking a park  With Earl s Court providing direct lines to Heathrow airport and all the sights of London it is an ideal base for a few days sightseeing The hotel itself is basic but clean  with very friendly  helpful staff  They provide free wireless internet in the foyer and the breakfast is above average  All in alll a great place to stay in central London for the budget conscious traveller  
P =>   Great value Stayed here over Bank Holiday weekend as I was attending a course  Booked through the hotel s good website the day before I checked in and got a good rate of     a night I was impressed with my room  As it was just me  and the room stated single  I wasn t expecting much  Had a comfortable double bed  tv  hairdryer  kettle  coffee  tea  desk  comfy chair  and a spacious bathroom with an incredibly powerful shower Most impressive was the high ceiling  which sounds silly but makes the rooms seem so much bigger  And judging by a fire evacuation map  my room was one of the smallest Maid service was great  check in was Ok  not great but no problems  Breakfast fine  no frills but for the price no complaints  Best of all   location   min walk to Earls Court tube which is on the Picc and District lines  so it s very easy to get anywhere  And loads of shops and restaurants on your doorstep   tesco  boots  all the fast foods  pubs etc  The hotel is just off a busy main road  and opposite a quiet garden  There is a bit of noise  but not at night  and remember  this is central london I had a great stay  and would recommend this hotel to budget conscious people who don t want to compromise on comfort  
P =>  What a location I would like to start off by stating my girlfriend and i traveled all throughout europe and stayed at many different locations If you follow my user idea you will be able to figure out our trip and you could use this as a guideline for yourself  We did tons of research and used all the sites to make our choices  I hope this review helps The Barkston Gardens hotel is a few short minute walk from the Earls Court train station  which is a train station with many different train lines running right through it  The location is wonderful and in a great area where you will find many bars and many places where you will be able to find fresh fruit  bread and basic nessaities  Now for the hotel  the staff was very friendly and were eager to help out with directions throughout the city  Our room was clean  but we did find an unused condom wrapper under the bed  it would be hard for cleaning staff to reach or see it but it was still found  and the washroom meet all basic needs  Our room was small and only had windows that opened and a small personal size fan  NO AIR in this one  but as long as your not there for a heat wave you should be fine  london is cool    c  most of the time anyhow  We think the room we had was a   person room  Overall i would stay there again but only for a few nights  we found that hotels that were cheaper but more out of the way had more extras  like ac and bigger rooms PS  Our flight arrived in london at  am and reached the hotel at     we asked if there was a room to store our things while our room was being preparied  They placed our bags in an easy access room which made us feel alittle uneasy but the staff reinsured us that the bags will be fine  Nothing happened to the bags but just wanted to state this just incase you are in our shoes and plan to arrive before the check in 
P => Convenient location but disappointing hotel We stayed at this hotel for two nights as we were going to watch the tennis at Wimbledon  The location is great in terms of convenience for the tube and proximity of restaurants and shops  ie Boots  M amp S  Somerfield  However the hotel itself was disappointing  It was really quite tatty and the cleanliness of the room left a lot to be desired  especially in the bathroom  We were also surprised to find that dinner and room service stopped being served at     pm  The staff weren t overly helpful either  Our room was also very hot and noisy at night but that s to be expected in London during the summer  Overall this hotel was fine as a base in which to sleep and shower and we were glad to be so near to Earl s Court Tube Station but it is let down by its shabby appearence  lack of cleanliness and heat and noise levels  
P =>  Excellent location and very quiet My wife and I stayed at this hotel for two nights in early e       The location  as others have commented  is good and convenient if you travels around by the Underground  The room and washroom are clean and the space is adequate for us  But my room  X    not facing the garden  is really hot  especially in the afternoon  Opening the window widely  all day long  did not help much  and I think it is the major problem  well  in this room you can see the sunset   Remember that the room is not air conditioned  Some of the staff were helpful but others were just okay  
P =>  Perfect jumping off point for touring London After reading some of the more recent reviews here  I decided to book a room in this hotel for my   days of sightseeing around London  I booked directly through the hotel s Web site and got a really good deal that included the continental breakfast  which is nothing impressive but definitely enough food  amp  choices to take you through to lunch   My room was a small single   plenty of room for me and my luggage   with a nice roomy bathroom  It was cheery  clean  and comfortable  but I did lose all hot water during my last shower  My theory is that you may be better off showering at night  opposite of most guests  probably  so there may be more hot water available  My room was very  very warm  so I left the window open day  amp  night  and the problem was solved  I was fortunate that it hardly rained at all   not sure that solution would have worked if rain was being blown in  It s as quiet as everyone else said  so no traffic or people noise to wake you up when the window s open  The garden view is so pretty  It s ridiculously close to Earl s Court tube station   couldn t be more convenient  And that ks  amp  Spencer Simply Food market a block away came in handy many times  Staff were very friendly and helpful  There s a computer with Internet access in a room off the lobby but it s usually busy   but there s also a McDonald s  ugh  I know   with an Internet cafe attached on the way to the tube stop  I recommend this hotel as a comfortable  affordable tourist class hotel  Not many frills but a lot of charm and a very nice neighborhood  
P => Good value but nothing exciting  This hotel had a great location and was a good value for the money  The room was small and a bit worn  but clean  Breakfast was good and the staff were polite and helpful  If you re budget conscious and don t plan to spend a LOT of time hanging around your hotel  the Barkston Gardens is a fine place to stay if you get a reasonable price  
P =>  Fine hotel  This hotel was in a very nice neighbourhood  close to bookstore and drugstores  It was a bit out of the way for me  but I would recommend it if the location is good for you  Very brightly painted walls  
P =>  Barkston Gardens  Okay for Budget Travelers My room was very small  but considering it was just me  it was no big deal  Comfortable bed  bathroom and shower in the room  desk  television  phone  and room service  for an additional cost   Breakfast was included in the price of the room and it was very good  The service was okay  The hotel is located two minutes from the Earl s Court tube station  which is a plus  It s not the Ritz  but good for budget travelers  
P =>  ent great location I stay in London often  You have to understand the baseline hotel there is way below most places  But over the last few years they seem to be trying to improve  The Barkston is one example  This hotel has free wireless access and hair dryers  There is someone at the desk    hours  The breakfast room is large and clean  The breakfast is plenty to eat  with croissants  cheese  ham  yogurt  and canned fruit  A full cooked breakfast is   GBP more  The rooms are en suite  and there is a lift  About half the rooms are large  Ask for Room      which is a large twin with a full bath  Some of the rooms on the first floor are very noisy  Weekdays are downright cheap at about    GBP  weekends are a lot more  The Earl s Court location is the absolute best  as you can catch the Circle  District  or Picadilly lines  The tube from Heathrow goes direct for      and takes    minutes  There are three good pubs  an M  amp  S Food Only shop  and a wine shop within    yards  All in all  not a bad place to stay  
P =>  Good for the price I booked online at a good price  and for the room and location got a good deal  The room was a single en suite and was quite a good size  But this hotel is still in an old shape   creaky floorboards  a bit aged decor    etc you get the picture  The location is great   just around the corner from the tube stop  My room looked out on the gardens which was nice  I think I was on the top floor and if it had been a sweltering day I woul dhave had a problem without air conditioning  Oh and the lift would take ages to come  
P => Gret Value for Money Stayed at the Barkstone Gardens Hotel after attending a concert at Earls Court    what a great idea as        people tried to cram onto the tube afterwards  Id read other reviews of on TripAdvisor and wasnt disappointed  Location wise its    m from the underground and     mins walk from Earls Court exhibition centre on a relatively quiet tree lined square  True its not the flashest of places  especially in the public areas   the carpet was a little worn and some of the paint could have done with attention  but the room was relatively modern  clean  quiet  comfortable and very large for central London  Whats more it comes with duvets on the bed and a television  trouser press  hairdryer and TV that all work  At     for a double on a laterooms I think the place was a bargain  I think the full price is      which in itself isnt unreasonable if you have cause to be in this part of London  Earls Court has so many  quot dumps quot  where you get ripped off that I think the Barkstone Gardens is a real find and wouldnt hesitate to stay here again  
P =>  You can stay at much better places for similar money  Stayed here for one night in       when attending a concert at the nearby Earls Court arena POSITIVES Location     minutes walk to Earls Court tube station    minutes to Earls Court Arena Cleanliness   Both the room and the bed were clean Staff   Friendly and helpful NEGATIVES No Air Conditioning   the room was impossibly hot  What made it worse was the window wouldn t stay open unless I propped it open with the telephone directory Overall condition of Hotel   I think the hotel can be described as a little bit tatty  The marble floor in reception was cracked  The carpet in the corridors was faded and ill fitting  The paintwork and decor was overdue an overhaul  woodchip wall paper for example   this is not the    s anymore      inch gap below room door meant light from the corridor illuminated the room all night OVERALL VERDICT  There are much better hotels in London for this price   I paid    GBP for one night  This is not very expensive for London  but if you shop around you ll find some of the major hotel chains offering genuine    rooms for this price  
P =>  Great for the price I ve stayed at this hotel twice  The rooms are a little older  but were decent for the money paid  The location was perfect  a   min walk to the tube station  Some rooms in the hotel are large  and some are small  All in all  not bad for a tourist class hotel  
P =>  Awful location filthy rooms We stayed at Barkston Gardens in the first week of ust  it was so bad we went looking for an alternative for the next night despite the fact we had prepaid  We had   rooms  for   nights  both were filthy  in one room the toilet wouldn t flush  the noise was incredible  even the kids complained  The street outside was covered in vomit and broken beer bottles my  yo daughter was verbally sexually harassed as we walked passed the pub and was so frightened she wouldn t open the window on her room despite the hot weather  Location might be alright if you re into bars and pubs but not for a family  my biggest gripe was the fact they gave their adddress as Kensington as it is an entirely different type of neighbourhood 
P =>  Great Location Location was truly the best part of this hotel  Earl s court tube station literally right around the corner  The room we had was another story  Great bathroom  large  full tub  great shower w  shower curtain  Rug was stained in multiple places and the beds were the most uncomfortable I have ever slept on  The beds were also very noisy  Walls are paper thin  so if you have a noisy neighbor    we brought earplugs  Continental breakfast was included in our rate  Adequate breakfast  skip the coffee and go for the tea  Waitstaff was mixed  not overly friendly  but good enough  Eating area  lobby  etc were very clean  Local papers provided in the lobby along with a lot of tour papers  and sightseeing booklets  Front desk staff was great  Coffee tea maker is room was nice  They provide you with little packets of tea  coffee  sugar  etc  Skip the coffee here too  Pub at the end of the street was loud and rude people  Waitstaff very unfriendly  Lots of other places to go for food  
P =>  I ve stayed her   times I like it I have stayed here   times in the past   years and I like the hotel staff is nice  breakfast is pretty good  but that isnt the most important thing to me  but the coffee is terrible  we usually walk down the street to Coffee republic or Costa coffee and get some good coffee  We have stayed in   dif kind of rooms  reg double room and family room with   double beds and a fold out couch and liked them both  Bathrooms were large for Europe and I love the Earls Court location  I have stayed at   other hotels in the area  The Burns  The Oxford and the Rushmore and I like this best  Good Restaurants around here also  Try Dinos right next to tube on Earls Ct RD

P => Great Hotel Great Location Really enjoyed our stay  Rooms were a little small  however still big enough  well appointed and extremely clean  Service when required was excellent  Great location only a couple of minutes walk to Earls Court Station  Off Earls Court Road so was very quiet and felt safe at night  I would stay again if I was back in London  
P => Stay here  From the beginning we walked through the door  Base stay was great  The staff are extremely friendly and will go out of their way to help you  The location of the hotel is very central and only a   minute walk from the tube  No taxi s needed  The room was clean and comfortable  It was a modest sized double room and suited our needs as we were out touring during the day  I would suggest looking into a larger room if you plan to spend a lot of time chilling out in your room as the bed takes up the majority of floorspace  with a desk  lounge chair and then the bathroom  However if you are touring London  this would be perfect The bathroom was clean and a generous size compared to many other hotels The staff assisted us with day tours available  offered assistance wherever they could and were very polite  We paid      for   nights and it was worth it  Overall  the hotel is modern  comfortable  centrally located and the staff are great  I would certainly stay here again and strongly recommend it to others  
P =>   My week in London Absolutely loved staying at base stay  the rooms were perfect   contemporary  clean and loved the mini kitchen facility  The location was also ideal  as we were relying entirely on public transport  the station is literally just around the corner  The staff were really helpful  particularly Tony he helped with everything from train timetables to the advising us on the best places to eat around town  It was clear he had great knowledge of the area  Will definitely be staying here next time I come to London  
P =>   Loved it here recommended  Four girlfriends on a weekend getaway  Had a spacious room for four on lower level with one king size bed and a sofabed  Ideally we would have preferred four separate beds or at least two  quot proper quot  doubles  but it worked just fine  The rpom was clean  newly refurbished  like the whole hotel  has a new feel   Subtle  modern and lovely decor  Beautiful bathroom and a practical kitchenette with cooker and cofffee  fridge and cups ect  Really practicle  Just five ten minutes from vibrant Gloucester street with lovely places to have breakfast  for us this was ideal  And after breakfast  just a ten fifteen min  walk to Knightsbridge and Harrods etc  Hotel was very quiet and felt safe with   h receptionservice  Nice and smiling people behind the desk   We liked it a lot and will def  both recommend and come back  
P =>   Great Hotel   A lot of thought has go into place  The hotel is well situated in Earls Court  less than five minutes from Earls Court tube station  bars and resturants  Also not far from the Natural History Museum  V amp A Museum  Earls Court and Royal Albert Hall A lot of thought has gone into the hotel and the first experience of being welcomed by smiling and friendly staff sets the tone  The rooms are well laid out and well appointed and the bed was one of the most comfortable hotel beds i have slept in The information provided in the room was excellent and you can order in drinks or food from the comprehensive lists supplied The hotel staff can recommend resturants etc some of them offering discounts  we had breakfast at the recommended Balens which was excellent plus     off Great place for this end of London with good facilities with a reasonable price for London  We will stay again  
P =>   SMASHIN  Just spent   nights at Base stay and it was great  The location is spot on  Only   minutes from Earls Court tube station and plenty of bars restaurants nearby  The rooms were great   beds were really comfy  free internet on the TV  nicely decorated and very clean  The staff were really helpful with recommendations for places to eat  Hotel has deals with various restaurants in the area for discounts which we made good use of   full english at Balans  burgers at Gourmet Burger Kitchen were superb and the pizzas at Strada couldnt be better Some good pubs in the area  Princess garet  Courtfield  Hansom cab  Prince of Teck to name a few Word of warning though   avoid the Kings Head in Hogarth place   barely change from     for   vodkas and coke   rip off Booking up for next year  
P =>   Modern and Convenient My husband and I stayed at Base Stay for three nights at the end of ober  The room  although small  was extremely well appointed   there was a small kitchenette which included a sink  kettle  microwave and mini refrigerator  and dishes and flatware for two  The bathroom was clean and modern and the bed was one of the most comfortable I ve slept in in a hotel  This hotel is located midway between the Earls Court and Gloucester Road Tube Stations in the Kensington area of London making it very convenient for accessing all areas of London  The staff were extremely friendly and very helpful  We will stay here again  
P =>   Fabulous London Hotel  We LOVED base stay and will be recommending it to all our friends  This is the PERFECT location  walking distance from the Earl s Court Tube station where you may also catch the train to Heathrow  and it was a joy to see a Central London hotel competitively priced that wasn t a tiny dump  Various size rooms are available  You get what you pay for so if you want a big room they are available  Base stay in fact is gorgeous with large welcoming modern rooms and great staff  Suffice it to say we thoroughly enjoyed our five days at the hotel and hope to return in       We must give a huge bouquet to Mr  Potter  the most welcoming hotel staff member we have ever encountered  It is refreshing to see English staff in the hotel rather than unpleasant and rude eastern Europeans who tend to waste space and rebuff guests in many Earls Court area hotels  
P =>   Brilliant location great place to stay  Ok  the single rooms are small   but hey  didn t come to London to hang out in the room and really  big enough for a place to sleep in  Its clean  modern with everything you need  Lovely street  close to Earls Court Station which is on the airport line  Couple of pubs close by was handy but also reccomend the Troubadour cafe nearby for a great feed with a bit of history to it  Staff friendly and polite and free wi fi was great for keeping in touch with friends and family back home  
P =>  Thoroughly enjoyed my stay  Great value for money  I had totally forgotten about the kitchenette  which was quite handy  
P =>   Excellent  Excellent hotel in a great location We had a wonderful time in London and the hotel was one of the reason why Staff is very friendly  rooms are cozy  comfortable  clean and quiet Price was also ok  comparing with other locations in the expensive London Definitively recommended  
P =>   Nice location nice rooms on the tube to anywhere you want to go Location is a really nice area   Hotel is close to the tube  direct on the Heathrow line  and Earls Court Road  lots of places to eat  Stayed with two friends   room had three single beds which is great as often hotels just give a double and a roll out bed  There was a kitchenette in the room too  with kettle  fridge  sink and delf  cutlery  which was great for breakfast  Rooms also had flat screen TV  free wifi  amp  access to games and music  Didn t use them  but it sounded good  Staff were friendly   couldn t really fault the place and I would recommend it again  
P =>   Top notch  No faults what so ever  Would definetly recommend  Stayed at base stay and would rate this as the best hotel we ve ever stayed in  Great location    min walk to closest tube station and high street  Very nice area  The staff were helpfull and informative throughout our stay  The room was well lade out and very clean and modern  Before my visit i thought the room fee was a little expensive but on reflection i feel this was good value  Would highly recommend  
P =>   Nicequietcleancentralconvinient Base   Stay is a small and expensive hotel with no breakfast    minutes walking from the tube you can go everywhere easy and fast  Nearby there are not many things to do  Our room  double with an extra bed  was very small  the self service machine had only water cola and chocolates  Wrong option for a hotel with no breakfast  Tha staff was very friendly and kind  DO NOT GO FROM THE GATWICK AIRPORT  Is really far away  
P =>  Very nice hotel with friendly staff We stayed at the hotel after reading about it on tripadvisor  com Good reviews  and they lived up to it Good service  and very helpful staff Small  but clean and nice rooms free wifi in the room No breakfast served but restaurants near by        rebate when staying at the hotel  
P =>  Best choice in london for that price Very good location in Kensignton  close to the subway  nice rooms design lounge style  friendly staff  I will come back as soon as possible    
P =>  Nice Hotel with very good service A nice quiete Hotel near Earls Court Tube Station  Clean rooms and very kind staff  I had a great stay at base stay Kensington  
P =>  clean friendly and a lovely convenient setting I was first impressed by their website as i found it to be contemporary  and basic but it gave you all the information needed  enough pictures to give you an understanding of a basic room layout  I was traveling with my partner  and he too found this hotel to be the best suited in that area for a young couple  on a budget when we arrived at the hotel we were best please  Its easy to find  and only a   minute walk from the nearest tube station  Earl s Court  We had a feeiling of security in this area and found it no problem to be walking at night  the area had a  quot young quot  feel which we liked  You are also offered discounts in local restraunts which should be accepted The hotel itself had friendly staff  offering us a free map  and pointing out where the main attractions were  which was greatly appreciated  the rooms were cosy  clean  and the beds were very comfortable  The bathroom had a large shower and we were given toiletries that were fairly traded  and smelt lovely  a nice suprise about the rooms also were that there is access to the internet via the television  which comes with digital view  and also you can listen to a variety of music for free also via the TV  I would reccomend this hotel to a young friend  who want to stay in a nice friendly place  and are traveling on a budget  
P =>  Great service good location and well appointed room Great service  good location and well appointed room  Really enjoyed the spacious bathroom  the kitchenette facility  free internet access  quiet location and tasteful  quality decor  A gorgeous  Georgian building transformed into comfortable  high quality accommodation  near the heart of London  Very close to Earls Court Station and amenities  An excellent base for a visit to London   business or pleasure  
P =>  I m A Snob And This Worked For Me  We ve stayed here twice and returning again next month  IDEAL location for exploring all of London  Everything is easy to reach from here  Earl s Court tube a short walk away  good connections to Heathrow  fun bus ride into City central London West End  great neighborhood y vibe  Depending on room type  visitors from the US may be disappointed by space  or lack of it  but you shouldn t be everything you need is in the room and you won t be spending much time in it  Great to be able to buy stuff and keep it in the mini kitchen for breakfast or even a night in  M amp S  Sainsbury s  amp  Tesco all nearby   For solo women travellers safe safe safe  Great fun restaurants nearby   Masala Zone  Wagamamma  Balans  Nothing to complain about in either of the room types we stayed in and even the most expensive are a good deal compared to other similar hotels  small  contemporary and cool   No room service but again  that s part of the fun   buy the stuff for less and have it handy in the room  I feel as if I m coming home when I come here  
P => Can t beat this hotel in London I had read about Base Stay in travel magazines  but it s even better than they described  The hotel service was top notch  and every employee was quick to help with questions  city information and recommendations for restaurants   which turned out to be all great  The rooms are extremely clean and spacious in a great location of Kensington  Tube station is a block and a half away as well as the great restaurants they recommended  They also helped us plan our outings before we arrived in London and while we were there  I will stay here again   the prices are also quite nice for London  Ready to head back across the pond for this jewel of a hotel  
P => Base Stay is a great find  My daughter and I stayed at Base Stay for three nights in ober        It s located on a quiet street in a residential area  The Earl s Court tube station is a block away and connects you with all of London  Not a lot to do within the immediate vicinity but we rarely stick close to our hotel when traveling anyway so that was not a problem for us  I found Base Stay on Trip Advisor  I expected a budget style hotel and was very pleased to discover a modern  nicely appointed property  Our room was one of the larger ones available and was extremely spacious with very comfortable beds and a great bathroom  The free internet available on the in room flat screen tv is a wonderful amenity for those of us who do not travel with laptops  The entire property was very clean and tidy  and the staff is friendly and helpful  This property is a great find and I would absolutely stay there again  
P =>  Perfect location great service We had a wonderful stay at this hotel  It s in a great location   a very short walk from the Earl s Court tube stop which is on the District  Circle and Picadilly tube lines  It s very easy to get anywhere you want to go in London from this hotel  There s also a grocery store nearby as well as several restaurants  pubs  a movie theater and some smaller convenience stores and bakeries The hotel is very clean  new  comfortable and well kept  A friend and I stayed in one of the bunk bed rooms and it was perfect for what we needed  The beds were very comfortable and we were pleasantly surprised to find we had a little outdoor patio with a table and chairs through french doors at the end of our room  It was great to have wi fi access and the bathroom was very nice as well The staff was great the entire time we were there  We were greeted by Tony who was very helpful and friendly and who gave us a map and showed us how to get everywhere we were looking to go  Another night we decided to go to a movie and the girl working at the front desk was so helpful and printed out a listing of all the movies showing at the nearby cinema along with walking directions I would absolutely recommend this hotel and if I ever go back to London  I hope I will  I d certainly stay here again  It s a great value  
P =>  Loved it  base stay far exceeded my expectations and was excellent value for money Hotel and location  located just around the corner from Earl s Court tube station and about five minutes walk from Sainsbury s supermarket  so very convenient  The young staff were unfailingly friendly  professional and very helpful   nothing was too much trouble  I was afraid that for the price the hotel may have been a bit  quot budget quot  but I need not have worried   it s unpretentious but simply stylish Room  I had a standard double which was fine size wise for me  maybe a bit small for two people   Room was on the first floor  ie  floor above ground  facing the street  and apart from a very little noise from the street I was not bothered by noise at all   no sound at all from neighbouring rooms  and I am very sensitive to noise   Very comfortable  with a good bathroom complete with fantastic shower  Loved the dimmer lights that can be controlled from the bed  and the mini kitchen  hidden in a cupboard  is a great idea   saved me money and stress  And all was spotlessly clean  Wouldn t hesitate to recommend or to return  
P =>   Convenient location and quality accommodation for a good price The location was convenient to all of London  The hotel was nicely presented and staff great  The rooms are well fitted out but small  
P =>   Good clean and value for money I had a King room which was spacious  well equipped and very clean  It is located close to Earls Court underground station and a host of discounted restaurants along the Earls Court Road  ask at reception for details   The kitchenette facilities were a real bonus  The only minor niggle was a delay at check in because one of the receptionists was on a meal break  
P =>   So much better than a boring hotel room the well named base stay provided an excellent conveniently located base for a recent business trip to London The single room  whilst small  was very well laid out with a beautiful minature kitchen in a cupboard  complete with microwave  crockery  cutlery  glasses etc and the proverbial kitchen sink  It s only a couple of minutes to M amp S food shop and loads of other similar  as well as being able to order food in   loads better than boring expensive mainstream hotels The flat screen TV provided free internet  free music selection and film selections for only     Will stay again  probably in a double room  
P =>   As advertised I read a very positive review of this hotel in a newspaper  Daily Mail  I think  and so I booked it for a   night stay  It was exactly as advertised on their site and as the review stated  The staff were particularly helpful and pleasant  I reported a malfunction a c and someone took care of it within    minutes I m a retired airline pilot who has lost count of the number of hotels visited  for the price  this was as good as it gets As for the question below  I have already recommended to friends who plan to stay there  
P =>   Good value in a nice location We originally booked the base stay hotel because of its good location near Earls Court tube station  both Heathrow and the city centre are very good to reach from there   The hotel is situated in the quiet and very attractive area of Kensington  Rooms are tiny  but include everything you need for a   days trip to a city  also microwave and a little kitchenette  and the  small  bathroom is neat and modern  The service is great   whenever you need advice or assistance  people are most helpful and friendly  Very good value  
P =>   Fabulous clean courteous and affordable A group of us stayed at the Base stay in late tember  Having traveled extensively in the last    years I have experienced many hotels that charge an arm and a leg but fail to deliver Not base stay    we were welcomed by the courteous staff   which is a feat on it s own in London The rooms  although small by most standards  were clean  pleasant and well appointed  The concept works  No restaurants or room service  Which was just fine  The area around the hotel is peppered with dining establishments and shopping Mini kitchenettes in every room  Very handy Would I stay there again  In a heartbeat I would especially like to commend the front desk staff  Bravo   
P =>   Simply excellent   I will return without hesitation I booked this hotel based upon the good reviews I have read here  I tried to book via booking com   but this site said there s no place available  So I called the hotel directly and I mentioned I really would love to stay there and they arranged me a room for two the first night and a single room the second two nights   that was helpfull  The hotel is located at   min walk from the Earls Court Tube Reception and welcoming in the hotel all went perfect  The room was very nice and the quality of the bed was excellent  I slept very well   You hear only little noice from the corridor and not from the rooms next door  The wifi is free but if you like to have high speed internet by cable  they charge you  I don t understand why     They dispose about an advanced TV system  My room had a modern kitchenette which I appreciated a lot I will certainly go back next time I m in London 
P =>   Very good and affordable hotel at Earl s Court We were very pleased with the staff and the room  Also a few nice pubs and restaurants were near the hotel  I would really recommend the hotel for people who are willing to take care of breakfast themselves Also a very nice bathroom and flat screen TV  
P =>   Perfect choice for London break For a family without a ridiculous amount of money to spend on overnight accommodation in London   but wanting somewhere nice and special Base Stay is a great choice  We stayed for one night with our two teenaged children  there was a slight initial mix up with the beds   however the staff immediately went out of their way to sort this out  The staff were all very professional  efficient and friendly  Our room was a good size and spotlessly clean  The beds are very comfortable  there s free internet connection  a good shower and nice big towels  The temperature control in the rooms is good  we kept it cool which how we wanted it  We were also able to leave our bags early on the day of checking in and until late on the day of checking out which was really useful  We d definitely stay again  it s located really close to Earl s Court tube where there s a good range of restaurants  we ate at Wagamama s with the discount provided by the hotel  Base Stay really contributed towards us having a fun time away for a couple of days in London  
P =>   Excellent  Modernclean top standards mini home with all you need This is the second time we have stayed at base stay and we will be back next year  We have our own lovely modern home and we like our home comforts with style so base stay was perfect  The reception staff are friendly and well organised  The price is very resonable for the quality you get  If you like your own privacy this is perfect as once you are checked in no one bothers you and you can come and go as you please  The appartments are a  min walk from earls court tube station so perfect for visting attractions  shopping and seeing shows  Also having your own mini kitchen means you can chill a bottle of wine and have a glass before going ti see a show  Overall an excellent place to stay  
P =>   Absolutely Fabulous We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of this hotel given our previous experience with British hotels  I loved its modern and minimalist look  The room was well appointed and the bathroom a good size  The high ceilings and large windows  which open  contributed to the feeling of roominess  The staff were extremely efficient and friendly  My teenage daughter  who is very hard to please  was delighted with the room s set up  The location is surprisingly quiet yet so close to all amenities and the tube  Having the free internet access was fantastic for checking up on train timetables and opening hours of some of the sites  It was great to have films for hire for only  GP  We stayed here twice over a two week period and because we had such a good experience the first visit we couldn t wait to get back to our  quot home quot  the second time  We recommend this hotel highly  It contributed to a very memorable holiday  
P =>   Great Our stay was great  The place is clean  quiet and not too expensive  We thought the staff were very helpful   friendly and effecient  We would definitely stay there again  
P =>   beyond expectations We stayed here for a few days  We needed the front desk to arrange an appointment with a chirpracter which they did and gave us   options  The beds were confortable  service was unbelievable  location was great   best hotel i ve stayed at  
P =>   An excellent hotel As a woman travelling alone  I cannot fault the feeling of safety both within the hotel  and walking from the Tube station late at night  The hotel is located in a pleasant and safe area The staff were genuinely friendly and helpful  the room was quiet  immaculate and well appointed  and The Tube and local shopping at an easy distance I would certainly stay at this excellent hotel again  and can highly recommend it  
P =>   Great hotel We stayed here   night in   The front desk personnel were very friendly and helpful  There is no restaurant on site  There are several good restaurants within walking distance  The hotel is a short walk to the Earl s Court tube station  The room was big  The bed was comfy  The view out our window was not great  We overlooked another building  The room and bathroom were very clean  Our bathroom had a huge tube with shower  The flat screen tv on the wall also doubled as a computer monitor  The wireless keyboard was on the desk  but you could move it and sit on the bed and use it  Our room was quite  no hall noise  The hotel has a lift elevator inside  but you must carry your bags up the front steps into the hotel  We would definitely stay here again  
P =>   An outstanding base to stay The Base Stay was a fantastic and well priced hotel in a convenient location  The rooms were very modern and clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful  The ability to use the in room internet via the television and provided keyboard was also a plus for those who don t travel with a laptop  
P =>   Second Stay as Great as First I stayed at base stay for a second time after first visiting in ch       The day I arrived  I realized that my toilet was not working  Within an hour of notifying the front desk  the maintenance crew arrived within the hour and quickly fixed the problem  My room was on the lower level  with the window overlooking the sidewalk  I thought the road noise might bother me  but it actually seemed to be quiter than the first floor room I stayed in previously The single room is the perfect size for someone who won t be spending a lot of time at the hotel  although my    quot  suitcase was a little too large to fit under the bed   The free Wi Fi is definitely a plus  I would stay here a third time  
P =>   Lovely comfortable and friendly  During my recent week long stay in London  I actually stayed in   different hotels  due to limited availability in each  It was an interesting opportunity to compare experiences  Between the two  I preferred base stay  The hotel itself is very attractive and situated in a pretty residential neighborhood only a couple of blocks from the tube  One of the features I liked best about base stay was the staff  They re actually British  It s rare to find that in the hotel business in London these days  and I really appreciated the opportunity to chat and interact with locals  The rooms were quite nice and very up to date  My absolute favorite aspect of my stay there was the bed  It was so comfortable  Unfortunately  the remainder of my trip was spent sleeping on what felt like a slab of cardboard  so I deeply appreciated my quality sleep at base stay  The room was also dark and quiet at night  so the whole experience was restful  All in all  base stay is certainly a great value  though I did pay less at my other location  where breakfast was also included  not so at base stay   Regarding location  I liked the neighborhood very much  but Kensington is a little further out of the way of major attractions and the heart of the city than I d ideally look for in the future  Expect to spend about    minutes on the tube to reach lots of the sights from here  With that said  I m sure the vast majority of visitors to base stay will feel comfortable  well treated  and pennywise  I know I did  
P =>   FANTASTIC value in London  I stayed at Base Stay for two weeks in tember       and have nothing but good things to say about it  Although the room was small by American standards  I travelled alone so I only had a single   it was well appointed with everything I needed  a microwave and fridge  coffe pot  FREE internet  and even a towel warmer  The bathroom was roomy and the bed was comfortable with good  but not excellent  quality sheets and duvet  It is located one block from Earls Court Tube station  which gives you easy access to all locations in London and beyond  Also a block away  by the station  are several fast food restaurants  McDonald s  Burger King  et al   a few pubs  a laundromat  two small groceries  ATMs  and even a post office  While it is not in the heart of the city  transportation to any part of London is quick and easy  and the subruban location provides for a very quiet night Everyone I encountered here was wonderful and very helpful  I wish I could remember the gentleman s name that helped me the most   he was fantastically nice  I travelled to Dublin for two days and left my luggage at the hotel  When I returned  not only was my room ready  but they had already moved my heavy suitcase into the room  WONDERFUL I got a cheeky glance into some of the larger rooms when the housekeeper was cleaning and was really impressed  I highly recommend Base Stay  
P =>   perfect value for money we found the base stay as a perfect place in loondon  it is all you need  very small but very comfortable room in a good area and only   min  walk to the underground  we would definitely come back  
P =>   Very clean excellent service nice location The staff was very helpful and friendly  The place is super clean  The location is very good   close to Earl s Court underground train station and shopping on High Street Kensington  
P =>   We will definitely return Exceeded our expectations  We were impressed by the level of quiet and the feeling of  haven  so close to Earl s Court subway  We felt very safe walking in area  Kensington is posh  and the hotel fits in  It was very well maintained  Some interior noise  i e  loud doors at night  but not bad  Staff were excellent  Kitchenette was small but well equipped  The M amp S is nearby for groceries  but we were disappointed with quality and selection  The Sainsbury s on Cromwell Rd is probably better choice  The restaurants we tried in area weren t great  When we wanted Eastern European food  staff recommended Wodka s at Kensington High Street stop  It was one of best meals on our trip  Tapas restaurant on Old Bromley also excellent  
P =>  Our London home away from home  Stayed here for three nights in London  it was a great base for visiting the city  The neighborhood was quiet and residential but only a couple of minutes from the Earl s Court tube stop  Our  quot local quot  pub The Courtfield was close by for pub lunches and afternoon pints  The room was small by over sized US standards  but cozy and just perfect for London  We loved having a little kitchenette in the room  to store sandwiches and make coffee and tea  Staff was friendly and helpful  had good recommendations for local restaurants  and even stored our luggage for several hours after we checked out prior to our train time  I would definitely stay there again in London  
P =>  Great Experience   Felt Like A True Local  The Base Stay was an absolutely wonderful experience that was not only a great value  but also provided an experience that most hotels can t  living like a local  I booked the Base Stay online about a month in advance  and planned a stay for four nights  As plans changed over the course of that month  my stay was cut down to three days  and a short e mail to the hotel  which came with a quick response  amended the reservation I arrived into London Heathrow around      am the day of my arrival  and took the Heathrow Express from the airport to Paddington Station  From here  it was a short ride on the District line from Paddington Station to Earl s Court station  which was within a   minute walk to the hotel  The walk was in a very well populated area  and included passing quite a few restaurants  pubs  banks  and shops  The Base Stay is in a very unique location  as it is surrounded on one side by a beautiful park and some other small hotels  and surrounded on the other side by some beautiful residential apartments that had to be in the millions Checking in at the Base Stay was a very simple process  Rang the bell on the door  walked in to the check in desk  and just had to show credit card and passport  I was given a room on the Lower level  the  quot L quot  level   which was easily accessible by the elevator or stairs  The room  while not  quot HUGE quot  by any standards  was more than comfortable for myself  It included a bunk bed setup  functional desk  spacious bathroom  with a great shower and heated towel rack   as well as a microwave  small refrigerator  and silverware dishes for eating  Your room key is inserted into a small slot in the wall upon entry to the room  which turns on the electricity  this both ensures you don t leave your lights on while out  and also that you never forget your key   Things like the air conditioning  refrigerator  and power plugs stay active even while the electricity is  quot off  quot Everything in the room was very functional  including free wifi   and a healthy selection of TV channels allowed for plenty of entertainment in the room  I found the air conditioning to work great  and could get very hot or very cold depending on how you set it  My favorite part of the Base Stay was coming back to the property and feeling like I really lived in London  I shopped at the local Whole Foods market  only one tube stop away  and was able to heat up food in the microwave or save groceries in the refrigerator All in all  I would highly recommend this property for its value  great location  and wonderful amenities  
P =>  Best hotel in London      AWESOME      One of the best hotels I ve ever stayed in  The staff are friendly and VERY helpful  Close to the Earl s court subway station and there are many restaurants nearby  The Nando s is good but the food is very spicy and the Gourmet Burger Kitchen  GBK  is also great for good meals  Two laundromats are within a quick walk  The rooms are small but comfortable  There s also a TV you can use as a computer  I m typing this from the tv now  and a small kitchen  
P =>  Great location comfortable rooms relatively inexpensive Base stay is located in South Kensington  a block from the Earl s Court Tube stop  This is on the Piccadilly line which conveniently goes to Heathrow and many of the main tourist attractions  There are lots of restaurants and food markets really close and the room came equipped with a small refrigerator  We saved some money and time by getting cereal and milk at Sainsbury s        minute walk  to eat breakfast in the room as we got ready Base stay even has deals with some of the local restaurants to give their guests discounts  The rooms aren t huge  but if you just need a place to sleep and recharge from busy days  it works great  
P =>  Splendid experience  My parents and I stayed here in mid tember for three nights  We loved having a mini kitchenette in the room with a mini fridge and microwave and saved a lot of money by preparing a light breakfast before we ventured out to go sightseeing  The hotel was walking distance from Earl s Court tube stop and about     minutes by foot from the closest supermarket  The rate was very reasonable  With wireless internet access and a flat screen tv with several entertainment features  my mom loved hearing Vivaldi while she ate breakfast   we couldn t have asked for a better experience  All the staff I interacted with were friendly and very willing to help whenever I had a question   When I asked for more toilet paper in the room  it arrived within   minutes   I loved the decor of the hotel   sleek  minimalist  and modern  The next time I travel to London  I will be sure to stay here  It truly is a hidden gem  
P =>  terrific   was the best find in London Sitting here using the room s free internet with wireless keyboard on the TV  I have to say that this was truly the best choice after hunting on the  net for ages  There are dozens of eateries nearby   take note especially of GBK  but avoid the Nandos  Two laundrettes within minutes walk  several grocery shops  including M  amp  S Simply Food  The kitchenette helped us quite a lot  We got     off GBK and there are similar deals on other restaurants  Our room for the three of us was exceptionally clean and the public areas and hallways show pride in the level of cleanliness as well  Staff are helpful  friendly and courteous  The area itself is very handy to get to Heathrow  as well as the major points of interest in central London  I would highly recommend base stay if you are planning for the Olympics or any other holiday  
P =>  Home Away from Home Base to stay was exactly as it advertised  Clean modern convenient and welcoming  My husband and I had a wonderful stay   great location friemdly and helpful staff clean and modern rooms  Just like home  The complex was well maintained   smely fresh and had all that travellers neede at reasonable price   We wil be back even if its only for the lollies at reception  Thanks Base   stay for making our anniversary a very special one   
P =>  Noisy room no need for an alarm clock  Pros  clean comfortable bed  very close to the aminities and tube station  nice area  fridge and kitchenette in the room Cons  the noise from the road starts from   am  noisy fire door in the corridorThe whole point of getting the room was that I did not have to wake up early to catch the train so that I could be fresh for my business  I got woken up by the noise from the street  cars and people  at   am and it kept going until I left the hotel  My room  single  did not have double glazing or secondary glazing  When I checked out I mentioned about the noise and was told that I should book a room on the top floor or the back  Why do they have those noisy rooms if they are going to tell everyone not to use them    The room and bathroom are clean although the shower cubicle is not spotless  the usual mildew and mould were at the corner of the seals  However  I would say it was totally acceptable It is a shame about the noise  they should get it sorted rather than letting guests find out about it after they have stayed in the room  
P =>  large clean and comfortable rooms No problem accommodating four adults and luggage  Very clean and new  Excellent location  right by Earls Court tube stop  
P =>  Really great stay on my first trip to London  I stayed here twice on my recent trip to London  Initially for   nights on arriving in London and once for   night after I returned from touring around Mainland Europe  Both times I really enjoyed my stay at base stay Firstly its location is great  The nearest tube station is Earl s Court which is on the District and Piccadilly lines  You can catch the Piccadilly line tube service from Heathrow airport in about    minutes   really handy that you don t have to change trains  Secondly Earl s Court is the hub for the District line   the District line goes   different directions and its centre is Earl s Court  So overall I found the location of base stay great considering it is only a few minutes walk from Earl s Court Now hotels in London are not cheap at all   but base stay is really well priced  Don t get me wrong it is not   star but it doesn t need to be  It does everything it claims to   and for me that is perfectly fine The hotel itself must have recently been renovated because everything looked really new  The front desk staff were really great all the time   friendly and professional   and willing to help out if needed  I stayed in a single room both times and they were of a decent size  I didn t feel cramped at all   the bathroom had enough room to move about in without knocking anything  The TV had free internet on it   and whilst the controls were a little fiddly   I still used it each day with no dramas   it came it really handy  One slight gripe I have is with the shower   the temperature seems to vary slightly all the time   it did this in both rooms   not a big deal but did get annoying sometimes Overall a great stay in London at base stay   I ll be back when I return to London  
P =>  Prime location very good concept and great staff  We stayed here for   nights and had a great time  The staff was wonderfull  professional and very friendly  
P =>   Great place to stay and terrrific value   easy access to central London I stayed at Base stay with my mother in ust  after winning a   night overnight stay for two in the hotel s business card competition  I have stayed at the hotel many times before and cannot fault their rooms or service  The hotel is greatly convenient when you are arriving in London late or are leaving early  In addition it is very handy for Central London  via Earl s Court Station  located   stops on the District Line from Victoria train and coach station  Equally you can get to the hotel from Heathrow on the tube in about    mins on the Picadilly line  The staff are always friendly and will go out of their way to help  In addition you can be guaranteed to find a clean room when you arrive  The rooms all have built in kitchen facilities  which is handy  as there are local supremarkets    mins walk  where food can be puchased  The hotel rooms also have listing for local takeaways  who will deliver  and there are vending machines with drinks  sweets and snacks  All in all a great place to stay  gt  gt  gt  gt  AND thanks for a great prize  which my mother and I both enjoyed greatly  
P =>   Super hotel  We had a very good stay at Base Stay  The beds were very comfortable  the rooms clean and the staff very friendly and helpful  I liked the green ethos of the hotel too  Our   young children were well catered for and the ease of having a mini kitchen helped with grabbing a bite to eat and warming things up for them  it had a good microwave   The bathroom was beautifully clean and well equipped for a comfortable stay  It s situation in Kensington near Earl s Court was very handy for both places to eat and travel anywhere around London  Also the proximity of the museums on the Cromwell Road was great for the kids  
P =>   Base stay is a small well located hotel with a friendly staff and nice amenities at a reasonable price  The rooms are small but very comfortable  nicely appointed and immaculate  The ingeniously concealed kitchenette is a wonderful convenience if you don t feel like going out for a meal  There are wonderful markets and gourmet takeaway shops just up the block  Moreover  the staff has a  quot not a problem quot  attitude about taking care of requests or responding to any difficulties  The price is bargain by London standards where even average lodgings can be exorbitant  
P =>  Great location amazing customer service  definitely would stay here again  My Mom  sister and I stayed in the triple for   nights at base stay and we were really pleased  The location is very close to the tube and with great restaurants within walking distance  We have stayed in European hotels before this trip so we were aware of the room size when compared to American hotels but our bathroom was big    The hotel is very clean and new  There also was a sweet patio attached to our room which was a nice place to unwind before dinner  We would definitely stay here again  
P =>   Exceeds Expectations Base Stay turned out to be a great find  Good location midpoint between two Tube stops  Gloucester Road  Picadilly  District  Circle lines  and Earl s court  District   Nice neighborhood  Although there was a small mix up when checking in  it was quickly and graciously rectified and I was given an complimentary upgrade  Although the room I initially was shown   L    looked good too  and had a terrace  My room on the First floor was immaculate  with a small efficiency kitchenette  microwave  sink  fridge  plates  amp  glasses  etc    Quiet and good sized room  Excellent front desk staff who were exceptionally friendly and helpful  Really added to the whole experience  Would definitely stay again and longer than one night  
P =>   Everything you need and more We booked a night at this hotel based on the recommendations seen on trip advisor  and were not disappointed  The room was fairly spacious by London standards  with quite a large bathroom as well  I had asked for a room with bath if possible and this was provided  The small kitchenette with fridge and a small amount of crockery and cutlery allows you to make cereal and coffee in the morning  which is great for people that aren t partial to mammoth english breakfasts  or was tasteful and the furnishings comfortable  My husband loved the large screen internet access in the room  Staff were friendly and helpful  Most importantly it was quiet  with no street noise  and in a pretty street with charming houses just off the main thoroughfare  
P =>   Wonderful My husband and I stayed here two nights and found the hotel to be a perfect way to stay in London comfortably in a nice location  There is no restaurant or room service or massive lobby but that s not what we needed  Our room was very nicely decorated and new and very clean  And I m very picky The free wifi worked well  There was a small kitchenette even  We were on the  th floor facing the street and did not notice any street noise  The staff were very friendly and helpful and even gave us     off at a near by restaurant  The hotel is only a couple of blocks from the underground  The quality for the price was excellent  
P =>   In a class of its own  I stayed    nights in a single room at base stay on my recent London vacation  It met my rather high expectations  based on reviews on TripAdvisor and elsewhere  in most all respects  I already knew and liked the area  and the base stay staff were invariably helpful when I had questions about local shops and restaurants My room was tiny but clean  fresh  and adequate as a base for my vacation  I was rarely there during daytime hours  Its single window was large and looked out over a quiet mews  I never heard any street noise  However  sometimes I heard stomping footsteps on the stairs or creaking floors in adjacent parts of the building  The clothes closet was a pretty good size but the hanging area was a bit too short for a couple of my jackets   and there wasn t a hook in the room on which to hang a coat  not counting the small hook on the inside of the bathroom door   I liked the kitchenette in a cupboard  which allowed me to keep some food on hand and enjoy coffee  tea  and a snack or light meal in the room  The fridge doesn t keep things as cold as my home fridge in the US  a review here mentioned this so I wasn t surprised  and it did keep some cheese and a few bottles of water cool enough for me The bathroom was a winner  with a comfortably sized shower  good sized sink  attractive tiled finishes  a generous ledge for my toiletries  and a wonderful large heated towel rack  Kudos to this hotel s designers  who could probably have fitted in a few more rooms by creating the ridiculously tiny en suite bathrooms found in many a London  quot budget quot  hotel  but did not The front desk staff were always friendly and helpful   Tony in particular  This was great value for the money  the hotel felt upscale  quiet and exclusive  and I was always happy to return to it at the end of the day  It s new  clean  and fresh  The only serious shortcoming  in my opinion  is the lack of a communal sitting room or lobby sitting area  I m sure that omission is part of the concept  but if this hotel s owners ever build another base stay  I hope they revisit this issue  I m already browsing the internet to plan my next trip to London  and although I m finding cheaper room rates  I m not finding any lodging options that really compare to base stay in the same price ranges It s definitely in a class of its own  
P =>   GREAT choice  My husband and I chose base stay based on location  value  room amenities and its high ranking on tripadvisor com We were very happy with our choice  This was our third trip to London together and have stayed nearby previously  base stay was nicer and less expensive  It s a super location just a     minute walk from Earl s Court tube stop which is on the Piccadilly  Circle and District lines for easy access to just about everywhere the usual tourist would want to see  Its location on the Piccadilly line means direct access to Heathrow in about    minutes with no stairs except for the four to the door of the hotel Front desk was very friendly  yet professional  check in and out very quick  As requested  we were given a room with a king bed  two twins  quot zipped quot  together and made up as a king  in a quiet location away from traffic  elevator  etc Room small by US standards which is to be expected just about anywhere in London  Very well set up  clean and comfortable  Tiny  efficient kitchenette with microwave  ref  dishes  cutlery for    Bathroom large by UK standards with a window which I liked for ventilation  Loved the heated towel rack  Big ledge for toiletries Luggage storage space under the bed  ent sized wardrobe for hanging clothes and a couple of shelves and drawers  We re not the types that completely unpack our suitcases into the available drawers  etc so we did notice there is not room to leave your suitcases out without crowding the room and in our case  blocking the kitchenette  Very nice linens and duvet  mattresses okay  but not great  which I mentioned to the hotel  Might be because of no box springs to allow for the storage space Earl s Court area has many eateries we love Nando s for chicken which is just   block west of the tube station  that s to the right as you re facing the station   The hotel does offer laundry service if you re desperate  but there is also a launderette around the corner  One BIG TIP to a happy international vacation is to PACK LIGHT  All in all  a big thumbs up on base stay  Only minor points are the mattresses not being at the same quality level as the rest of the room and the lack of suitcase space  Neither of these would keep us from booking this property again especially since we will NEVER over pack again   Definately check out their website for more details  etc  Note single rooms are tiny by US standards  
P =>   The best service the nicest rooms and a great location base stay is located in a quiet area  yet close to Earl s Court tube and is therefore the perfect starting point for trips to downtown London and the Kensington area  The service is A  and the rooms are high class  especially given the moderate price level  Definately recommendable  
P =>   Good value   but SMALL rooms The location of this hotel is ideal being just   blocks from the tube and close to many restaurants and pubs  The decor is very minimalist chic and the service was very good  The front desk staff was extremely nice  Our only two complaints were that the room was awfully small  but that s understandable given the loc   and that there were no irons in the rooms  If our    yr  old had not been with us  this would likely have been a decent room   especially for the money   but with the third bed in the room  there was hardly anyplace to even put our suitcases  much less walk around one another  When my husband needed an iron  it took thousekeeping over an hour to find one   and then when he plugged it in  it blew a fuse   so that took another    mins  to resolve  Not time you want to spend in the  small  room when there is so much to see in London to see  I do believe the relatively small investment in individual irons ironing boards for each of the rooms is warranted   especially since base stay is advertised as a  quot hotel quot    where hotel like amenities are expected  Overall  I think this is a very nice hotel in an ideal location for seeing all of London   but probably better suited for the single or couple traveling and not planning to spend a lot of time in the room    
P =>   Ideal base stay We stayed here for the second time in y this year  previous visit y       and would agree with the positive reviews posted  This place is ideal for travellers who are out  amp  about each day and simply need an excellent base stay whilst they explore london  The location is great  convenient for the underground but in a quiet road  The staff were very helpful before and during our stays  It is small enough to be friendly and welcoming but with the elegance of a quality hotel  Take time to walk around the Kensington area with its interesting architecture and visit the markets   eg Portobella Road  amp  Camden as well as the busy traditional sights  A visit to the local museums is highly recommended  
P =>  Clean and modern  Well located  Very helpful staff  My wife and   yr old son were very happy with this hotel  Everything was very clean  with a modern aesthetic  The kitchenette was a plus   tucked away nicely  The hotel is well located  Short walk to Earl s Court tube  direct line to Heathrow   or Gloucester tube  District and City lines for the main sights   Good restaurants on Earl s Court  especially the Gourmet Burger place  Walking distance to the excellent Natural History Museum  Victoria and Albert Museum  and Harrods Harvey Nichols a bit further down  Staff were very helpful  Booking activities  recommending restaurants  keeping our luggage after checkout  Would definitely stay here again  
P =>  Great hotel if you are an independent traveller Excellent facilities  very new and high quality  Helpful staff  convenient location in Earl s Court with very easy Tube access  and a quiet street for a good night s sleep  Squeaky clean  Rooms are small  depending on which category you book  but the ceilings are high  The mini kitchens are very handy and the staff are very willing to recommend local restaurants  some of which have negotiated discounts for hotel guests If you would like a good location but not in the thick of Oxford Street  a high service hotel but do not need room service  and are generally pretty independent  then this is a great hotel at a great price  I used to live in the Earl s Court area and I always stay here when visiting London  We have also brought our two year old son there and stayed comfortably  but needed to book one of the larger rooms  
P =>  Posh convenient lovable Base Stay was top notch  The staff was excellent  The hotel itself is very newly remodeled and they ve done an excellent job on it  Absolutely beautiful  The neighborhood is quiet but very close to  attractions  if that s what you re into  If you re just there as a retreat  then you ll enjoy the tucked away location away from busy streets  My single room felt more like an efficiency suite  read   very small  but that s typical in London where real estate is at a premium  The bathroom is nearly the size of the room and all of the fixtures are top quality  You ll want to lounge in the cavernous shower all morning  The bed was very comfortable  dare I say the most comfortable hotel bed I ve slept in  Overall  highly recommended  My last bit of advice  call for the best price  
P =>  Why would you stay anywhere else in London  Great location  tastefully decorated and cosy  comfortable rooms  the matresses are divine   staff were great  in room internet access  Perfect and very secure  A great place to rest after a day of intense sight seeing  And loads of great eating options at your door  from pubs and restaurants to a very handy ks  amp  Spencers supermarket round the corner on Earls Court Road for in room dining  Wouldn t stay anywhere else in London and will definitely be back  
P =>  very nice little hotel in Kensington with free internet flat tv and more     Very nice hotel in south kensington   close to Courtfield road with many restaurants  supermarkets and any kind of shops    minutes to underground station Earls Court  Very attentive staff at the reception highlite  free internet on flat tv in all rooms   free tv and music on demand Good service  
P =>   ideal for staying with children I haven t read previous reviews  so this is based exclusively in my personal experience I stayed for   nights with my family at the end of ust       Two adults and two   year old kids The hotel is very well located  in South Kensington  very close    minutes walking  to Earl s Court metro station  which corresponds to three metro lines  Circle  District and Piccadilly  Reaching any point of central London is therefore very easy  If you fly to Heathrow  it is just    minutes away on the Piccadilly line The area is very pleasant and quiet  no traffic and no night disturbance The hotel is absolutely clean and new  spotless  Not a single complaint in this regard It is not a cheap hotel in general standards  but it is very reasonable considering prices in London  Besides  we got a huge room  and that is definitely a pleasant difference  I have previously stayed in London in hotels costing double for a room which was one third in size The kids got a sofa bed which had almost no difference with the main one  Big and comfortable The bathroom was also big and new  with a really big bathtube  The towels were really plush and we had a lot of them  one and and one bath Service was very good  Fast  attentive and efficient There are only two small downsides  First  the hotel does not have a restaurant and breakfast is not included in the price  In exchange for that  you have a small kitchenette  with microwave  a small fridge and a sink  The idea is that you can buy your breakfast and other meals in one of the nearby supermarkets  there is a Sainsburys at   minutes walking distance which is open   h on weekdays and most of the weekend  and have it there  be it is not a comfortable solution  but at least is a cheap one  Besides  if you go with small kids  which are usually picky with the food they like  this solution is probably better than adapting to normal restaurant menus The other thing we did not like is that they were somewhat mean with the soap and shampoo and we missed other bathroom commodities normally found in hotels  This is certainly no big issue  but it is in contrast with the overall high quality of the rest of the hotel  In summary  I would certainly recommend Base stay to anyone  specially if they are going with small children  It is comfortable  clean  very conveniently communicated and has big family rooms  I will surely repeat in my next visit  There are many restaurants nearby and there 
P =>   Great Hotel We stayed here in tember of       The staff were very helpful  and even let us into our room early at no extra cost  The rooms were spotless  and yes a bit small  but it s London  The rooms looked brand new  and despite being in the basement with a street level window  it was quiet  Loved the internet on the TV too  Would totally stay there again  
P =>   Great service friendly clean modern quiet We stayed for one night  The hotel looks practically new  and the entire place was spotless  Our room was lovely  very comfortable bed  the staff are friendly and eager to please  the hotel location is very convenient  yet on a quiet street  The decoration and furnishings are up to date and tasteful  Mini kitchen is well stocked  In room films are wonderfully priced  only   pounds  With heavy luggage the converted old house style of the hotel is ever so slightly inconvenient since there are     stairs to manoeuver  even with the good lifts  but not much can be done about that  I guess  Staff are the biggest asset  on duty    hours a day and full of wordly advice on local attractions  transportation  restaurants  supermarkets  etc  We walked to the Royal Albert Hall and Kensington Gardens Hyde Park     hour supermarket only   minutes away  We will definitely return  
P =>   Simple but luxurious comfort Base stay have hit on a great idea   If you re happy to look after yourself with just a room  fridge  microwave and ensuite bathroom in a  quot Hotel quot  that has no other facilities like bar  restaurant  lounge etc then this is completely brilliant They ve taken care with the stuff that matters like lovely mattresses  linen and modern simple  quot Farrow and Ball quot  decor and not wasted  your  money on unnecessary frills The bathrooms are simple but good with fantastic power showers and fluffy towels Very central but quiet and lots nice places to eat and drink a short stroll away I ll definitely use it again  as does my fiancee who uses it for business trips a lot Only drawback is no lounging space in your room or anywhere else so will probably only suit if you ll be out most of the time  
P =>   Great place for Mother Daughter weekend After reading the reviews  I chose Base stay for our mother daughter weekend  It is located near the Earl s Court tube station  I didn t have a detailed map or directions  so the first time looking for the place took a few minutes  There were restaurants and fast food nearby  to satisfy both me and my eleven year old  The staff was very helpful and accomodating  They booked our bus tour and were willing to book any other sight seeing or theatre tickets  They gave us directions and recommendations  They were friendly and efficient  The room was the perfect size for the two of us  The shower was large with a glass door  The room and the bathroom were very clean  We were able to check our email from the free internet on the TV  We will stay here again on our next visit  
P =>   Excellent location and friendly staff that helped make our visit a great experience  Base Stay is close to excellent restaurants and the Tube  Hotel staff were very helpful in arranging rail travel to other parts of England  The hotel is on a quiet street  The rooms are a little small but very functional  
P =>   A base stay hotel with a luxury tint I have stayed in the hotel for   days and the overall experience was very positive  The hotel is simple  clean with an effort to balance between business and luxury hotel  The location is perfect    near Earls Court tube station   min on foot  you can reach almost every destination in London    at the same time the road in front of the hotel is really quiet  I have stayed in a single room  Even though I was expecting to see a small room I was surprised by the space provided  It is not big    but it is not small    it is exactly what someone  at least European  needs when booking a single room  I think I have been provided one of the best single rooms because the view was fantastic  One minor issue was the sound insulation of my door as noise was coming into my room  I could listen what was happening in the corridor     but the hotel is not busy so    it was only a couple of times that I heard something loud Concerning the issue of Green tourism and ecology I can say that I am a little bit puzzled merely because I find it as a way to eliminate running cost    but nevertheless that is my opinion In addition Wifi is for free    but sometimes the signal goes off and is not stable    there is also internet TV so someone can read e mails or surf the internet through the TV or even listen to the radio or music via a TV jukebox    all these for free    The hotel does not provide any special amenities such as bar  gym  breakfast but if you ask the friendly and helpful staff    they will be more than happy to serve you  I do mean it  They will do the best possible to satisfy the customers and find a solution  They always smile and they always support In overall I would recommend you to try this hotel    at least once    I am sure that it will become one of your favourite choices    
P =>   Everything you need is here  I stayed at base stay for   nights on my first trip to London  The location was great   about   minute walk from the Earl s Court Underground Station and very easy to get to and from Heathrow Airport  The room was clean and nicely decorated  exactly as depicted on their website  The kitchenette and free internet browsing from the TV were very handy to have  both of which are often lacking in hotel rooms at this price  The staff were friendly and helpful  I appreciate their efforts to make your hotel stay as green as possible  I would definitely stay here again on my next trip to London and would recommend this hotel  
P =>   Bijou experience Nice and very professional staff at reception  nice minimal but confortable decoration  Room too small even for onde person  Enjoyed very much location  
P =>  Funky new hotel   but what s with the doors  Very handy to Earls Court tube station and lots of nearby eateries  The hotel is a modern refurb and there is a lift  For some reason the doors have a really large gap at the bottom  which means that anyone talking in the corridor sounds like they are in the room with you  A rolled towel in the gap helped  
P =>  Two thumbs up    The location is great  the staff is friendly  the rooms are excellent and the price is a bargain  I like it and will stay there next time  too    The rooms are perfect for sightseeing or just getting a good sleep nap   small but stylish  Highly recommended   
P =>  your ideal home away in London I am glad i have decided to book at base stay becuase this hotel is absolutely superbyou feel really like at home and coming back to your room after a day spent walking all over London is so relaxing The room was clean and spacious  you don t have the same unpleasent feelings you have in other hotels of the same price in london i defenitely reccomend itFilippo 
P =>   Great place  Great Service  My wife and I stayed here for   nights of sight seeing in ust  The hotel is in a very good location   you can get anywhere from Earl s Court station  and it s convenient to Heathrow  The rooms are well designed  comfortable  and the bathrooms are wonderful  Excellent service from friendly and helpful staff  The only minor negative was the small fridge   an  quot absorption chiller quot  as we learned that does not get nearly as cold as what we re used to   or even really much colder than the room    Our milk spoiled  According to the staff a proper fridge would be way too loud  So if you re counting on the fridge  be aware  Otherwise great place  
P =>   Nice hotel great value good neighborhood Base stay is an excellent choice for travelers that plan on being active    and only use the hotel room as a place to sleep  The room is very clean  it s in a very nice neighborhood and the service from the staff is excellent The only negative thing I d say about it is the one chair in the room is VERY uncomfortable  
P =>   Great stay Excellent location and room  Very nice to have mini kitchen in London and all the facilities  beds  bath  etc are high quality and comfortable  We would definitely stay here again  Staff very professional and helpful  especially Mr  Potter  Overall excellent quality and value in London  
P =>  Excellent value for money Although the rooms are small  the hotel is very clean  newly decorated and in a convenient location for site seeing  The small kitchenettes are useful for family breakfasts  and there s a k  amp  Spencer food shop within   minutes  The front desk staff is very helful  The cheapest single rooms  which we booked for a teenager  are very small   I wouldn t want to spend more than one jet lagged night in one  We actually upgraded both rooms after we arrived to get a bit more room to move around  
P =>  Fantastic service and cost benefit Great hotel and great deal  rooms are really practical  very good taste in decoration    bed is very very confy  shower is really good  and you can even find a mini kitchen inside the closet  Very clean and a great place to rest after a busy day Sis extreeeeemelly friendly and helpful   they even offered me to print some stuff with no charge  Free wireless  discounts in local restaurants and a very fair priced vending machine at the hall reallu show you the hotel thinks about your convenience Location is great too     min walk from subway station and in a very pleasant neighborhood Will definetly stay there in my next trips  and recommend it to whoever is looking for a convenient and no frills stay  and that doesnt mean poor  old and bad decor and bad service at all here   
P =>  Great little hotel We stayed in a double room for a few nights before we headed off to Bath  It was recommended to me by a friend as being a clean  modern hotel with reasonable rates for London  We agree The hotel is a converted Georgian building located close to the Earls Court tube station      minute walk  but set back from the busy streets in a quiet area  We didn t find a great deal of nice restaurants in that area though the pub on the corner close to Earls Court station was decent  The room was very clean and modern with a little micro kitchenette hidden behind doors which come in handy if you want to keep or prepare food  there is a k s and Spencer s nearby   The bathroom was also very clean and modern  High speed internet and a room safe were also provided The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful and the rates were very reasonable for London  The only small complaint I would have about our room was that it was small  It s just big enough for you to walk around the bed with a bit more space in front of the bathroom and front door  The ceiling seemed to be a little lower than normal too   and we re small people  They do have larger rooms available for a higher rate though I don t know if it is warranted in a city like London where you will be out for most of the day anyway  
P =>  AWESOME TERRIFIC FABULOUS    There were   of us in our travel group from Hawaii and London  UK was the last stop on our European adventure  We were all so happy that we chose to stay at Base Stay   what a way to end our trip  The service was exceptional   ALL the hotel staff went above and beyond for us  They were very knowledgable and friendly  The hotel rooms were just the right size  very clean and modern  Great location  near the Earls Court train station  grocery store and many great restaurants and bakeries nearby  Definitely one of the BEST hotels we stayed at during our trip and we will stay there again in a heartbeat when we visit London again  
P =>  Great hotel Base stay is a lovely  quiet hotel in a great location  Earl s Court is not my favorite part of London  but this hotel is on a quiet street removed from the bustle  yet still close to restaurants  banks  grocery stores  and the many tube lines that serve Earl s Court station   And the elevator to from the Piccadilly line means getting to and from Heathrow with no stairs  The rooms are nicely decorated  with a modern  clean look  and the free wireless is a great bonus  The staff were very friendly and helpful  and the rooms immaculate  My room was so quiet  it was hard to believe that I was in the middle of London  While I never cooked any meals in the kitchenette  it was very handy for breakfast  the hotel doesn t offer any meals  but who wants overpriced hotel food  anyway    
P =>  Clean comfortable and riduculously affordable The hotel itself is located in a quiet neighborhood  only a couple of blocks from Earls Court tube station  The front desk staff  especially Tony  were very helpful and polite  I traveled with a friend but we had separate single rooms  though small the rooms were clean and well set up  each having a little kitchenette  For those hot summer stays  the rooms can be air conditioned to United States standards if desired  
P =>  Good value for moneyneat safe and good location I had been to London several times and I found this hotel by far was the most value for money  I had stayed in other hotels in London earlier costing more than      per single room with less comfort  I payed     for a single room at base stay and my room equipped with a nice and clean kitchenette  There is a nearby bakery round the corner of the street   I chose to eat my breakfast there everyday  The size of the room is small but it was clean and comfortable  
P =>   Clean Comfortable Safe Friendly and Affordable For   women traveling alone  this was a perfect spot  Safe  very close to the Earl s Court Tube Station  clean and the best front desk staff you could ever ask for   knowledgeable and very helpful and all with a sense of humor  rare  anymore   Room wasn t large  but we didn t spend much time in the room  so we didn t mind  Plenty of room under our beds for our suitcases  Beds were very comfortable  the kitchenette was a nice addition  shower was fantastic and it was all we really needed  Quiet location on a side street  but very convenient to restaurants  the Tube  and the supermarket  Plus  the price  made our   night stay very affordable  by London standards  I d stay there again in a heartbeat  Keep up the good work  and the sense of humor   
P =>   Great I ve stayed now several times here in a double occupancy situation  and in different rooms  The place still feels like a great offer for the price range in this area of London  Location is quiet  but just around the corner from Earl s Court Tube station  and so a range of places to eat out  buy food  dry cleaner   laundry  internet cafe etc    Perfect  The style feels still newly renovated and modern  but retains a warm feeling of being well looked after  I mean  rather than that sense walls and railings are painted over ten times already  or carpets cover something up  This is styled in a good way  The details are solid and importantly for me the rooms are quiet  at least inbetween rooms  but like everywhere  it also depends on how loud a guest will be in the hallway too  As a rule though it is quiet  The kitchenette is of course  a small but very adequate unit  the bathrooms always a good size as is the shower  the flatscreen tv big and offerings good  wifi is available for free when I was there  It all works and if there is some issue  as far as I have felt  the staff tries their best to get it right  When I arrived far too early from my flight  they even have rooms to rent reasonably for the hour or so before my room is normally ready  in case I needed to freshen up at least  I never write reviews but I wanted to for base stay  because until now it has been a solid bet  
P =>   Excellent for long term stay I stayed   weeks on business and it was a wonderful hotel for this  The kitchenette was a godsend  the fridge stored plenty of fresh foods and the microwave and teapot were absolutely adequate  As everyone has said  the Earls Court location is ideal  the tube  stores  and many other essentials  e g  post office  were all within   minutes walk  The only slight complaint was that as others said the mattress was too soft  it sagged to the springs in some parts  The twin size bed I had could also be challenging in that it was against the wall  so you couldn t splay out in the bed as you might like  Oh  on the internet  the wifi was perfect on the laptop  but definitely  don t bother with the TV version  The corner room I had was super bright and cheerful and quiet and I would definitely stay there again  
P =>   great for the modern traveller Base Stay is a great find  located in Kensington between Earl s Court and Gloucester Rd  about   minute walk from each   The hotel is  quot noveau basic quot   no frills like a gym or a restaurant  but nice  clean  comfy cozy rooms with flat screen tvs  kitchenettes  good showers and in room internet  Perfect if you re the kind of traveler who wants an affordable place to stay but is past the age where hostels and crappy accommodations are acceptable  The staff are ridiculously nice to boot  The only minor drawback is its location  depending on what kind of nightlife you like  it can be a bit far if you re out past the tube s closing  Nonetheless  I will certainly stay here again if I m in London  
P =>   Great base We had a lovely stay here  Thoroughly updated building with stylish sophisticated decor  Smart bathrooms not cluttered with free samples  NB No hairdryers  Big comfortable bed  Quiet at back of building with pretty view  Rm  Q    Very helpful staff with discount vouchers for many local restaurants  Close to tube  Made everything very easy  would stay here again and recommend to others  
P =>   base stay is best to stay I just completed my third base stay vist in the last    months  As a frequent business traveler who accumulates over         miles  a year  I think this is one of the most unique hotels in the world  Yes  the rooms are small but they are very clean and extremely well appointed  And the staff is always exceptional  If you are looking at probably the best hotel value in all of London and your tastes don t run towards hotels like Clarideg s  look no further  
P =>   a gem of a hotel in London  base stay Kensington was an excellent hotel and we loved staying there y       I traveled with my cousin  This was her first time in London  and my third trip  I wanted a hotel that was out of the bustle of the very center of London  but not so far away that there was no energy  Picking Kensington was the perfect Choice The hotel is located only a block away from Earl s Court tube station  District and Piccadilly lines   The area has a lovely neighborhood feel surrounded by rows of white townhouses  but just a walk away to the tube station is a lively commercial area with restaurants and shops and a convenient super market for supplies Our room was clean and well stocked with the usual simple amenities  The kitchenette was great  It comes complete with mini fridge  microwave  sink  and dishes  Comfy bed  spacious modern shower  plenty of closet space  flat screen TV  and free internet browsing were the highlights  The staff were friendly and professional  They gave great advice for what was located around the neighborhood and provided some discount coupons for some local restaurants  I recommend trying the Gourmet Burger Kitchen and Balans for breakfast  Really a wonderful hotel  Book early to get a good rate  
P =>   Truly great  We stayed at this hotel for three nights in mid y  The staff was very fr endly and helpful  the room great  as well as the area  The free internet was useful when looking up restaurants and other places to go I would really recommend this hotel to anyone  
P =>   Great location small rooms friendly staff some WiFi issues The location within a few minutes  walk of the Earls Court tube station was ideal  from there I got to the airport  national train lines  and every attraction I wanted to see  Although many mention small rooms  be aware that the single rooms are REALLY small  so small I couldn t do some back stretching exercises prone because the walls weren t far enough apart  While the staff were friendly  they did not have the authorization and tools necessary to deal with some WiFi speed and reliability issues I had one day  it was pretty much unusable that day but if you want to pay you can get cabled access that is presumably faster and or more reliable  I didn t use that   The authentication system for WiFi is a bit cumbersome  it requires putting in a code every time you connect  so even if you just take a quick break outside with your iPhone  you need to re authenticate each time you return  Overall from what I ve heard about London hotels  though  on balance this hotel is a very good option  
P =>   Delightful room exceptional service Lovely hotel and a superb room with patio leading to a small private garden  Although just a few minutes stroll to the busy Earls Court Road  with lots of bars and restaurants   the hotel was in such a peaceful location   no noise at all The reception staff were about the best I have ever experienced   friendly  helpful and informative  Nothing was too much trouble  Thank you  
P =>   Nice room great staff relatively convenient location Very nice hotel  I stayed   nights in a single room  There was a nice courtyard view  nice furnishings including a desk and of course the very useful kitchenette  shiny modern bathroom  but little floorspace for my suitcase  I had a minor  minor issue with my shower  but it was fixed without my mentioning it the next time housekeeping serviced the room You can use the internet via the TV  but it s not easy  You can only see a portion of the screen at a time  Good for quick use to check flights or something  but not great for general surfing The staff were extremely friendly and helpful with local info  The Earl s Court area has almost everything you could need   grocery  banks  bakery  restaurants  and of course a Tube station on the District and Piccadilly Lines It was a splurge for my travel budget on this trip  but a welcomed upgrade as the last of   hotels I stayed in around the UK and really quite worth the price  
P =>   Great hotel and excellent location A great hotel with friendly  helpful staff and in a lovely location  Would certainly recommend it to anyone  
P =>   very nice place to stay i ll be back again good location  very clean hotel and rooms  very friendly people 
P =>   I Just Don t Get It  That this property appears as the   th best in all of London is mind boggling Now  there was nothing at all seriously wrong with my stay here  or my room  a double on the ground floor   It was just all so    ordinary  This is really a serviced apartment more than a hotel   you won t find most of the standard services you d expect from a hotel  Even if according to Trip Advisor  it s the   th best hotel in all of London  With virtually no amenities  Go figure   As others have noted  it feels more like a dormitory  okay  a newly renovated dormitory  than a hotel The room was quite small  which was expected   And it s impressive how they ve fit a small kitchen and ample closet space in there  The decor was relatively new  and I suppose if you buy your furniture at Ikea  you ll really love it It s well located if you want to stay somewhere away from the standard tourist areas of London  which I did   in a lovely  peaceful residential neighborhood  The Earl s Court Underground station is about a block away  There are plenty of restaurants and markets within walking distance As others have noted  the soundproofing in the rooms is almost non existent  I could hear every door slamming up and down the hallway  And every step the upstairs neighbors took actually shook the ceiling  Someone from the hotel responded to a similar complaint here by writing something to the effect of   quot the sounds are more noticeable because it s so unusually quite here  quot  It IS a quiet  peaceful neighborhood  but that s a very poor excuse for what to me was a major soundproofing issue  And claiming the building is noisy because it s old is also a cop out  I ve stayed in many old hotels that have somehow successfully managed to deal with this issue  This is the single biggest reason I will not stay here again or recommend it to others But what do I know  Most other Trip Advisor members apparently think this place ranks higher than some of the world s finest hotels  
P =>   base stay worked out very well We rented   rooms  spouse and self  second room for    and    year old sons  Pros  Very good location  minutes from Earl s Court Underground  see tube map  and bus stops and walking distance from many pubs and restaurants  Very nice neighborhood  Desk staff are excellent hosts who were courteous and knowledgeable and accommodating  Management takes cleanliness seriously  has a team approach  Security good  need swipe card to get in front door  Cons  In room internet poor and did not work with AOL but if you bring laptop you will have good internet access  Rooms are a tad small but probably not unusual for London  Small chair and table under wall mounted flat screen TV  Small frig and microwave and pot for boiling water  Outsourced fitness center  Overall we were very pleased and would go back again  
P =>  An excellent base to stay  We stayed at Base stay Kensington for   night y       There were   of us staying in   apartments all going to see Take That at Wembley  All   rooms were excellent  just what we wanted  a bit of luxury for a brilliant price  We had a misunderstanding with   of the rooms which was quickly sorted out by the reception staff  The rooms were clean  modern and fully equipped  we didn t need any thing more  The staff were very helpful  knew the area well and recommended great a cafe for breakfast  All of us would definitely use Base stay again  A modern hotel in a central location for a great price  
P =>   Convenience style fantastic service reasonably priced   what s not to like  This was my second stay at Base Stay  and I d stay there again  What took me there in the first place was the  quot kitchenette quot   really a microwave and fridge  that allows you to prepare meals in your room  But what keeps me going back is the immaculate cleanliness  the friendly and helpful service and the convenience of the location  It s within walking distance of a number of key London attractions  Harrods  the V amp A  the Natural History museum  and a step away from Earl s Court tube station  The rooms are tiny  and I found the arrangement of my first room  where the desk area was right next to my bed  more convenient than this time  where the desk was at the foot of my bed  it s nice to have somewhere to put a glass or a cup beside your bed   but that s a very minor complaint On my last day there  I left my bags behind the counter after I checked out  When I went back to collect them in the late afternoon  the desk clerk earned my undying love by asking me if I needed to use a toilet before I set out  I did    now that s very thoughtful service  
P =>   Wonderful clean great location and helpful staff  The staff at Base Stay made our vacation exceptional  The hotel was friendly  quiet  clean and had exceptional accomodations  The location is superb  We will always go back to Base Stay in London  
P =>   A pleasant hotel at a reasonable price in the heart of London We were greeted promptly by the gentleman on the reception staff and assigned a nice room on the first floor away from the street  The room wasn t overly large  but was very clean with a large comfortable king size bed and a sleeper chair for our teen  Free Wi fi a definite plus  There are ample places to eat  from a quick bite  to pubs  to sit down restaurants  within   minutes walk and the Tube stop  Earl s Court  is only a block and a half away  which is convenient for the Picadilly line for access to Heathrow and the District or Circle lines for the popular tourist sites   A bit pricey      but not out of line for room costs in a large city  
P =>   Excellent modern sympathatic hotel near the tube nice neighboorhood  A very good modern sympathatic hotel with all the things you need  Near the tube  in a nice neighbourhood with all sorts off restaurants and shops  The staff is genuine friendly and not because they have to  Booking com made a mistake with our reservation  so no room at the arrivaldate  No problem  The staff did really everything to give us a base stay  We really got a warm welcome  
P =>   This is a GREAT place to stay  This was our third trip to London in three years  but our first time at base stay  My husband and I stayed here with our two young daughters for    nights from late e into y  We had rooms L  and L   which are on the lower floor and each have a terrace outside  Our girls loved their bunk bed room  It was small  but really well layed out so that they had a comfortable amount of space  My husband and I had a double deluxe which was spacious  All the beds were very comfortable  These two rooms are at the end of a small corridor  so that we locked the door at the end of that and formed a  quot suite quot   It was great  There isn t an actual door that directly connects the two rooms  We were at the back of the hotel and weren t bothered by street noise at all  I don t know how noisy it would be in front  but the hotel is situated off of the main streets  We did occassionally hear people  s footsteps in the room above us  but it was never bothersome The hotel is extremely clean and bright and looks exactly as it does on their website The daily maid sevice kept our rooms spotless  They clean any dishes or utensils that you use from the kitchenette  too  We didn t take full advantage of the kitchenette  but it was really handy to keep a few things in the fridge  The location is not to be beat  It s an easy walk to the tube or bus or to find a taxi  with a Boots  a ks and Spencer s food store  and post office about two minutes away  There are all types of restaurants in the immediate area  The hotel gives you discount cards for some that they recommend and the ones we tried were all wonderful  We ate breakfast at Balan s several times But what makes this hotel stand out is the staff  Without fail  everyone person at the front desk was kind  helpful and genuinely eager to make our stay as pleasant as possible  They responded to any question or request with such thoroughness and willingness it was incredible  My husband was especially impressed with that and said  quot I ve never stayed anywhere with people so truly eager to help quot   We ve stayed in many lovely   many five star  hotels over the years but base stay really has something on them all  Everything our family really needs and actually uses in a hotel is here  if you re looking for a spa and a restaurant and a conference room  etc  it isn t here  But we never use those things anyway  This is a fantastic hotel and we look forward to staying here again  
P =>  Just a perfect stay  We just returned from a wonderful brief visit to London  and Base Stay was one of the best things about our trip  It s exactly what it s billed as  just what you need when traveling  without any unnecessary extras  and an outstanding value in an extremely pricey city  The hotel is centrally located  a block away from the Earls Court tube station  which is right on the Piccadilly line     minute straight shot on the Tube from Heathrow        mins into more central parts of London  and the District line  easy access to Wimbledon  Kew Gardens  the Notting Hill area  and all attractions along the river   We arrived really early on a red eye flight the first day  and were checked in by the very energetic and helpful Tony  who apologized that our room wasn t yet ready  it was  am    and gave us some helpful local breakfast recommendations  Our room  L   was immaculately clean  really clean  like Japanese ryokan clean   with simple  soothing decor  comfortable beds  crisp linens  perfect climate control  it was HOT during our visit   a strong  hot shower  nice toiletries  and a lovely little outdoor patio with a table and chairs  It wasn t huge  but it was substantially larger than far more expensive rooms I ve had in London on prior trips  and it definitely felt larger than its actual size  They had free wifi  a large TV  and a small kitchenette with a microwave  refrigerator  and plates  cups  and utensils that they replaced each day as needed  The neighborhood was really nice  not far from busy streets with restaurants  convenience stores  a branch of ks and Spencer with fresh fruit  produce  and lots of prepared foods  and Sainsburys  grocery   but quiet and residential nonetheless  After long days of walking around London  we were really happy to come back to our lovely room  sit out on our patio  and enjoy the nice London weather  we were lucky  with some seasonal cherries  strawberries  and iced tea  We re fairly independent and didn t need any particular assistance from the staff  but they were extremely friendly and always eager to answer any questions or help with any travel arrangements  I wish more hotels would follow the Base Stay model  We will definitely stay here again when we return to London  
P =>  Bed Bugs We stayed here for   days mixed business and pleasure trip  The first morning  my partner and I woke up with red welts  Theses continued   increased nightly  This only happened at night at the hotel  including on places of the body covered by bed clothes   pajamas  I was disappointed with the response of the staff  though they allowed us to change rooms   I was actually asked if I had ever been to London before and if I wasn t perhaps allergic to London   After the room change  the irritation stopped  The hotel did follow up with a letter  claiming nothing was found  I cannot recommend this hotel  
P =>  Great place stay This is my third time at base stay  room was clean and fresh as always  Staff are always friendly and welcoming  Depending on what your plans are in London depends on whether it s a good location  for us it was perfect  Hotel is clean and new  little kitchenette was well equipped  Definitely would stay here again for business or leisure  
P =>  great hotel I stayed here for   nights with my teenage and twenty something sons It was perfect for us  The hotel is very clean  nicely furnished with beautiful  modern bathroom showers  and convenient to everything  short walk to bus and metro  lots of restaurants  pubs  grocery stores  bakeries and pharmacies  We especially appreciated the beautiful  safe neighborhood  the air conditioning  elevator  wireless internet  mini kitchen  microwave and refrigerator   and very reasonable price  The staff was excellent   very friendly and helpful  I would definitely stay there again  
P =>  Fantastic choice highly recommended for all Loved the hotel  Great location   beautiful  amp  quiet residential neighborhood  immaculately clean and stylish deluxe room with mini kitchen and enough space for our family of    including   teenage boys   terrific and always cheery staff  Sainsbury s and ks  amp  Spencer close by to bring in basic provisions  Easy walk to the museums  V amp A  Science  Natural History  and Harrods  and the tube stop is a   minute stroll  Just a    minute ride to get to Wimbledon  Would recommend base stay in a heartbeat to anyone travelling to London  
P =>  Excellent Thoroughly recommended  nice location   central but on a quiet street  excellent staff  comfy clean room  
P =>  Recommended Very good location  great staff  clean bathroom and bedroom  The only minor negative is the very small bedroom  which I expected  Overall great value 
P =>  Fantastic concept good location great service This is really the way to go for the traveller who does not intend to spend all their time in the room  No room service  no resturants  no fitness centre  no business lounge  no club floor  no breakfast  What they do provide however are spotlessly clean and comfortable rooms  a very clever free interenet service via the TV in each room  a little kitchenette with a microwave where I could heat up food  plates  wines glases and cutlery  a great idea   a kettle and a little vending machine for water and little snacks Location was not smack in the centre of town  but it is in a nice  safe residential district  and close enough to get into the heart of town easily  The hotel is only   minutes from Earl s Court Tube station  which has the benefit of being a terminus for the District Line and being on the Picadilly LIne as well   very easy to get to Soho  West End etc  Earl s Court is also great for the fact that it is one of the few handicap friendly Tube stations  which means easy access to elevators  useful also when you are lugging luggage around  Kudos to the absolutely fantastic staff as well   they were welcoming  helpful and gave the impression that they would do anything to make your stay as comfortable as possible  I was late for a lunch meeting and had to drop my host of rather heavy bags and run without checking in  only returning late in the evening  When I got back  the bags were already neatly in the room  with all the documents ready for a quick check in  Brilliant Finally  another great idea was that they have was the availibility of rooms for booking by the hour after checking out  This is fantastic for travllers  like us  who had a flights in the evening  We could chill out in the room  take a bath  use the facilities  before getting picked up to go to the airport  A great boon  
P => Home away from home  As a frequent taveller to London I have stayed at many hotels  but this definitely it the best  It s  home away from home   The location is perfect  with easy acces to the city and Heathrow Airport  The staff is very friendy and helpful  The rooms are very comfy and have all you need  I especially liked the digital radio with a great selection of music  And the kitchenette is just super  This definitely is the place to stay when visiting London  On business or pleasure Barbara  Bern Switzerland 
P =>   A perfect Base Stay  Previous reviewers have more than covered all of the excellent aspects of Base Stay  however if I could just mention a few of my own     Location   stunning  handy  quiet  beautiful    The Team    absolutely   Star   these folk are genuinely great at prividing hospitality    note to owners   look after them and keep hold of your staff   there are     s of other places in London who  sholud  have staff as good as yours  and who are charging   or   times the rates you do  But your team s pride in their jobs is obvious   well done all     Showers   nothing worse that a bad shower   the Base Stay showers are FAB All in all a great stay   and the Bruce Springsteen concert we attended in Hyde Park was amazing too  
P =>   Hop skip and a jump from Earls Court  The first thing you notice is the security of the Hotel   you need to buzz for reception before you can get into the front door  then use your security key once you have checked in  The second thing is the welcoming friendly staff which never ceased to continue throughout our two day stay at the hotel along with the bright  fresh reception area   the large bowl of sweets offered on the reception desk kept the sugar levels up as you leave for a day out shopping in town   Our ground floor room was very clean with a view over a mews courtyard and the on suite bathroom shower was also very clean  although the shower head had a mind of it s own when it came to getting a shower  it kept tilting forward like a  limp  lettuce and needed to be placed quite firmly into it s holder for it to work correctly  but over all this wasn t a problem  And once mastered  the push button toilet worked very well The TV reception was a little pixelated at times but this could be due to the hot weather     degs  causing a bad signal and reception said they would look at it if it was causing a problem  We didn t watch too much TV for this to be a problem The kitchenette was  compact and bijou  and very cleverly hidden behind closing doors with sufficient  crockery and utensils for anyone s needs  Do take some basic supplies when you stay such as milk and tea bags  although supplied by the Hotel  but were not topped up each day   we understand you can order  Breakfast Boxes  from reception at a reasonable price Base stay is a good place to stay and reflected good value for money compared to other family members who stayed in nearby cheaper Hotels with lower standards and noise from the underground trains  Base stay is just a very short walk from Earls Court Station   no noise from the underground in our room  giving you easy access to the rest of London   we would recommend the  pay as you go  Oystercard for travelling on the Underground and Buses  There are many lovely Coffee shops  pubs and convenience shops also within a short walk  which gives it a  Village  atmosphereKensington  Earls Court has some wonderful streets to wander around with it s whitewashed Georgian houses  Mews that reflected the sun  Where flower baskets hung on almost every Windowsill and Doorway  Where the trees in the nearby private parks provided much needed dapple shade on what was a very hot and sunny two day stay in London  
P =>   Fantastic location great hotel  This is the best hotel in this price range  in this area  The location is very convenient  close to The Tube  use Earls Crt if you have luggage  it has a lift   The offer of a room to use for showering changing is great for early arrivals after an overnight flight  The rooms are very comfortable  All the staff we dealt with were extremely pleasant and helpful  
P =>   Wonderful hotel charming staff spotlessly clean  and green    I shared   rooms with my sister brother in law and nephew for a total of   nights  The hotel was perfect for our stay  Our rooms had wonderful showers  small kitchenettes and a flat panel TV with free WiFi  I think the staff was the best feature of all  Each day they recommended excellent cafes and pubs as well as great trips for sightseeing  The hotel is located just a   minute walk from the tube station at Earls Court  I give Base Stay a   Star rating    
P =>   Charming hotel that worked well for us My wife and I stayed here during a recent trip to London  We had made early booking arrangements for two nights  About a week prior to our trip our plans changed and we realized we actually needed three nights  Upon contacting the staff they were able to help us out  They apologized in advance as we would have to change rooms mid way through our stay  The first room we stayed in had a toilet that didn t always flush at the first push of the button  Nothing happened  Not a big deal as it would flush on the second or third go  The transition from our first room to the next room went very smoothly  The staff moved our bags  and belongings in the fridge  for us and clearly instructed us to check in with them when we left that day  and upon returning  The second room had a glass shower door that opened the wrong way  Apparently a prior guest saw fit to fiddle with it  The door was corrected the next day without me even mentioning it to the staff  I presume they saw this when prepping the room and took corrective action Some of the rooms can be a little snug  however that is not unusual for a building of this vintage  or for European hotel rooms  The mattress in our second room was more than a little worn out  The internet and tele worked well and as expected  they had recently added WiFi however I can t comment on how well it works as I didn t bring any WiFi devices with me on the trip  I gave this hotel a   on the value scale mainly due to the currency conversion rate  While the prices were appropriate based what we saw for other London hotels  it is a bit pricey when converted to USD The staff was easy to work with and friendly  If you are calling them from the US check out their website for a US     number  
P =>   Great concept which works well  We liked this base stay concept  You get a clean comfortable room with some very basic cooking facilities  free internet  nice staff  efficient cleaning services  cheap room movies  air cond  etc  in a great location near a hub tube station in London  What more can anyone want in London  
P =>   warm and friendly Nice staff  clean and comfortable rooms  Close to earl s court undergrond it is a very good place for a city break  
P =>   Perfect  Stayed for one night in to see a play at Royal Albert Hall and everything was perfect  Friendly stuff  great neigborhood  clean and stylish room  good value for money  close to subway  really a perfect find for a city like London  Yes  my room was a bit small  but it made me feel like back in student times      
P =>   NIce modern design excellent friendly service good location Location pleasant and very convenient to the Tube  yet quiet  Very clean room had excellent ventilation  great plumbing  many conveniences  pleasant view and good lighting  Service was excellent   got great guidance and prompt response to anything I needed  I traveled with my two children and it worked out very well for us  Safe area  Mattresses could be firmer  
P =>   Great place to stay with a toddler We travelled with our son  almost    and requested a portacot for the room  This was already set up waiting for us when we arrived  We had one of the larger rooms  Duluxe room I think it is called  and whilst not huge  there was enough space for us  the portacot and toys and books  The kitchen facilities were practical and hidden away in a double cupboard out of our son s reach  The room was very clean and had a great feel about the place and the decor was stylish  The reception staff were really helpful and friendly  We were there whilst the tube strike was on so really appreciated the fact it is an easy walk to the museums  Definitely recommend the place  our only criticism was a slightly hard to use toilet flush which is so trivial it shows how impressed we were during our stay  
P =>   Super Duper  We stayed   Base stay in il    for   days  We must say  that everything was PERFECT  The rooms are trendy  clean  and modern  a little small  but at the end of the day  it is just a  quot Base Stay quot   The Bathroom is amazing  nice limestone tiles and lovely and clean  The shower was brill  lovely and powerful and everything you want in a shower  The Location is excellent  I personally do not think you can find another Hotel closer to a main Underground station  earls Court  and lots of good restaurants in earls court too  but not loud  which makes a good nights sleep  Base Stay is a cheap  quot No Frills quot  hotel  which when you are in London  you won t be spending much time indoors anyway  so if you don t want a hotel restaurant  a swimming pool etc  then Base Stay is the place to be Overall  we recommend Base Stay and wouldn t stay anywhere else when in LondonThank you for the great hopsitality  
P =>   Very clean comfortable affordable My    yo and I stayed at base stay for six nights in e       The staff was very helpful and accomodating  the room and common areas were very clean  and it was affordable in an otherwise fairly expensive city  Very conveniently located one block from Earl s Court tube  too  No room service  but very convenient food delivery options  Overall  it was great  
P =>   great place i only stayed for a night at base stay but I was impressed by the value for money  As I was with my teenage son  we stayed in the bunk room  It was small but had everything we needed and was impeccably clean  The hotel is really stylish and modern and I was impressed by the caring and friendly attitude of the reception staff  it s a lovely area of London and only about    minutes by tube to Victoria  I will certainly stay again  
P =>   brilliant base for sight seeing in london We stayed at base stay for two nights and had a fantastic time  The staff were polite  friendly and helpfull  The room was plenty big enough for the three of us and was lovely  modern and very clean  it basically was everything we needed  The location is great  a few minutes from the tube and and nice area so that you feel comfortable coming back at night I would highly recommend this place to any one looking for good affordable accomodation in a great location and hope to go back one day myself  
P =>   Top quality I just spent eight nights at Base Stay and can only give it the highest of marks The reception   concierge  everyone is extremely polite and eager to help with each and every inquiry  I hope TripAdvisor will allow me to say that Ashley is a real Aussie Doll  She is a true asset to the hotel House keeping is impeccable  Bathrooms are large and well equipped  Free WIFI is a pleasure  We stayed in several rooms during our stay  as we didn t book ahead and they have returning guests requesting specific rooms  Our favorite is L    quiet  spacious and has its own terrace with table and chairs The Deluxe room unfortunately faces the street and gets noisy What a pleasure to find the kitchenette with fridge  micro wave  contemporary dishes and even clean up service Base Stay is an easy     minute walk to Earls Court Tube and lots of bus connection Walking through the residential area is a real eyeopener  This is a very upscale neighborhood  We were very impressed with the large private parks for the individual areas  Lost count of them on our walk to Fulham Rd M amp S Take away has great and varied prepared meals  Boots is close by as are lots of pubs and fast food places If I do have one little complaint  it was the beds  Albeit  they were comfortable enough   I did feel the springs  Down pillows were a compensation   where do you find that  
P =>   Great Hotel met all expectations  I highly recommend to stay here  My wife and I stayed at this hotel based on other reviews from this site and recommendations  We had an excellent stay  The staff is very friendly and accommodating  They helped us with directions  booking attractions  and useful tips about the city  The room was clean  safe  and pleasant  The hotel is very close to the tube stop Earls Court which is very convenient for getting around the city  There are numerous restaurants and pubs within walking distance of the hotel  
P =>   Unbeatable value for money All the good stuff people say about this hotel is absolutely true  We were just passing through London for one night  our normal B amp B was full and we ended up here  It was more expensive        and didn t include breakfast  but this an excellent  spotless and well run place to stay  The room was well planned  had everything you could need  including an excellent shower  and the staff works really hard to make you feel welcome   So  if this is inside your budget  don t hesitate  
P =>   Great concept perfect location excellent value My husband and I stayed here e      largely based on tripadvisor reviews  We couldn t have made a better choice for value  location and service  We stayed in a standard double  directly behind the reception area  We arrived on an early morning flight and took the tube from Heathrow  arriving at base stay about      am  Though the room wasn t ready  they took our luggage and advised us to come back just after     We explored the area on foot  discovering that the Earl s Court tube stop is no more than a   minute  really     walk away  and that there are tons of cafes  restaurants  pubs  and food shops in the immediate area  We picked up a few groceries at Sainsbury s  had coffee in the in store Starbucks  and then headed back to the hotel  to find the room all ready and our bags awaiting us inside  Though the room itself was quite small by American standards  it was well laid out  We stashed our two suitcases under the  wonderfully comfy  bed  and made full use of the closet area  which had several shelves  adequate hangers  and a small safe The built in kitchenette saw lots of use  there is a small fridge  glasses  crockery and cutlery for two  a microwave  immersion kettle and a small sink  As others have mentioned  a toaster would be really helpful  and there seemed to be an electrical outlet which could accommodate one  We had breakfast in the room each day  which was very handy Our bathroom was large  and it seemed equipped for persons with disabilities  as there was NO shower door or stall  as such   just a walk in area with   shower heads  a people car wash  as it were   After a first disastrous shower with water EVERYWHERE  we learned to just use the middle shower head  and all was well  The towels and bath products were wonderful  and there was one large  and a smaller sink in the bathroom  The staff at base stay was terrifically helpful  especially when there was a glitch with the WiFi  which came in wonderfully handy   It was the quietest room we have ever stayed in  and we slept better than we ever have at any hotel  which is saying a lot  as I generally don t sleep very well away from home Take advantage of the often significant discounts offered at local restaurants  we loved As Greek As It Gets  Strada  and Gourmet Burger Kitchen  and the discounts really helped  as food was generally more expensive than I had expected  All in all  an outstanding choice  we would stay there again in a heartbeat  though we might try to spring for the superior double next time  for a bit more room  
P =>   Great for families   none better  This was the perfect base for our family trip to London  It is close to the tube and busses  it was comfortable  modern and clean  and a very good value for London  Instead of paying high prices for restaurant meals that our young children would barely eat  we brought in food from nearby shops  used the kitchenette in the room  and everyone ate well without the high prices  The staff was always helpful  for example they ordered pizza delivery for my son  and gave us travel advice  
P =>  Great Hotel in great location Came to London for the first time with my wife for two nights  The hotel is two blocs from Earl s Court Station and we chose the hotel based on great reviews and were not disappointed  The room was in excellent condition as you can see in the pictures I ve attached  You also have a small kitchen you can use  My wife and I preferred to go to a caf  near the hotel At the front desk you can get coupons for restaurants in the area and recommendations for tours and places to visit  The front desk was really helpful I highly recommend this places to stay  
P =>  recommend base stay hotel Very clean  quite and good staffs  Value for money  
P =>  Perfect base for a visit in London   definitly recomanded  Went to London with   friends for the weekend and stayed at the Base Stay  The hotel is located in a quiet side street and within  min walking distance of Earls Court tube station  Shared the room with   of my friends  The room was small but had everything we needed   small kitchenette  big bathroom etc  Every staff member we met was friendly and helpful  I ll definitely stay again next time I m in London  
P =>  Excellent base in London We have stayed here   or   times over the past   years  Without fail each visit has been positive  The rooms are decent  clean and the hotel is in a good quiet location  The underground connections are good and there are plenty of places nearby for a decent breakfast  which the hotel does not do   The staff are very friendly and prepared to help  
P =>  Clean comfortable  Base Stay is within walking distance of several attractions  including Kensington Gardens  Hyde Park  and the Victoria  amp  Albert Museum  It s also just a few minutes  walk from the Earl s Court station and access to most of London s tube lines  I liked having in room internet access  a heated towel rack  a kitchenette  and plenty of restaurants nearby  some of which offer discounts to Base Stay guests   Every staff member I met was friendly and helpful  I ll definitely stay again next time I m in London  
P =>  The perfect place to stay  I stayed a full week at base stay in il and I couldn t have wished for better accommodation  Stylish  comfortable  clean  safe  with a well equipped kitchenette in the room  base stay was the perfect place to stay  In close proximity to the tube and easy access to central London  with restaurants and shops close by  and with wi fi access  base stay is well located and gives great value for money  The friendly  helpful staff are fantastic and provide exceptional and timely service  Nothing is too much trouble  I am lucky enough to be returning to base stay for a further two weeks and look forward to once again experiencing the wonderful hospitality of the dedicated staff and the comfort of this great hotel  
P =>  The Place Stay I found Base stay during my last stay in London and after reading the TripAdvisor reviews  I decided to give a try  I was not disapointedThe hotel is not located in the Center of London  However  due to its great location on the Picadilly tub line   Earls Court Station   your are    minutes from Westminster Abbey     minutes from King Cross St Pancras Railway station   Eurostar  and    minutes from Heathrow Airport The people are the reception are great  very welcoming  even fluent in FrenchI had the single room  For North American standard  it is small but so well design and cute  that it is not a problem  It is spotlessYou have a small kitchen  You will find food on Earl Court Road   M and S  The bathroom is also very clean  nice hot shower   you push a button  Nice toiletry   same than in the Concierge suites in Club Med Cancun   The bed was one of the most comfy I ever slept in     hours jet lag helped The room was very quiet Plasma TV and Wi fi completed the nice hi tech notes I passed next to a few hotels on Gloucester Road and Barkstons Gardens and they were not as nice I would go back in a heartbeat 
P =>  Just as the name says Base Stay is a clean  comfortable place to stay in London with kitchettes in every room  The ability to eat in and avoid going out for meals three times a day makes travel more relaxing and enjoyable  The staff are polite  helpful and accommodating and the overall value for money is probably the best in the city  
P =>   A great spot to base your self for a london holiday We had a great time at this hotel the staff was friendly   It is two blocks from the Earls Court tube station   This is not in a touristy area   We like that some might not  It is a short walk to Hyde Park  amp  Harrods We would definitely stay here again   
P =>   SUPERB STAFF Hotel   functional affordable and conveniently located  Base  Stay is conveniently located near a major tub station  Earl s Court  and also within walking distance of many attractions  We were able to walk to parks on some days and hop on the tube for sightseeing on other days The room was small but very functional  We were not missing anything  The decor is very smart and clean and the room makes excellent use of space  The WiFi connection came in very handy too  Besides exploring London for the first time  what made our stay excellent is the wonderful  helpful  friendly and experienced staff at Base Stay  You are welcomed immediately and will feel very comfortable to pop your head into the office to say good morning and good night  If you go  make sure to ask for Tony P  Not only was he friendly and knowledgeable  but it was important to him for us to enjoy our stay and for us to experience the best of London  We would definitely stay there again and recommend it to a friend  
P =>   Best cost benefit in London London is not a cheap city  more when you looking for a good hotel andn good location  Usually the prices get higher and service lower  This hotel was an amazing surprise  A friend of mine recommend me and I was trully impress  not only for the service and location  outstanding  but for the size of the room and really afordable price The hotel stays in south Kensignton  a block away from Earls Court subway  From there you can reach almost any place at center London  Around the hotel you find all sort of food stores and pubs  Therefore  the unecessary room service and restaurant that hotel has eliminated does not make any difference  Indeed  could be better  for the flexibility  and also cost Regarding the service  outstanding  Not a word to mention about it  I have travelled a lot on business purpose and stayed in even luxury hotels than this with a pretty worst service The room are recently refurbished spacious  at least the twin that I asked   all of them has kitchens and free internet available and are quiet  in large hotels you often listen doors closings  elevators  etc  This was not the case here Definetelly I will be back to this hotel when I am in London  
P =>   Excellent Service and Low Price  I stayed at this hotel for an entire month on a recent work related trip to London and found it to be excellent  The quality of service  the cleaniness of the room  the Kensington Earl s Court location  and the low price are the reasons I rate this as the NUMBER ONE hotel in London  I loved having my own little  quot kitchen in a closet quot  with a microwave  electric kettle  sink  and ice box  The new flat screen tv and the wifi were additional benefits  Again  I highly recommend this hotel to anyone who is traveling to London  Personally  I have been recommending it to anyone and everyone that I have been meeting on this trip which is work related but includes leisure activities  
P =>   base stay was comfortable  My wife and I checked in at base stay on a week day afternoon in late il  We had made the tube trip from Heathrow and the very easy walk from Earl s Court station to the hotel  Upon arrival we were greeted warmly at the reception desk and were delighted to find that we had been upgraded to a larger room  When asked for my credit card  I realized that it had gone missing  Calming my fatigued panic  we had other cards   I thought it probable that the card had been left at the Heathrow Express desk  A call was placed immediately by the young gentleman  Mr  A  P   at reception and it was there      secure  Normally  that would be the end of the story      nice  concerned service  and I would trek back to Terminal   to retrieve my card  But the attention  at this point  rose above and beyond the call of duty  Mr  A  P  informed me that he needed  for personal reasons  to go later that day to Heathrow and would be happy to retrieve my card for me   I needed only to supply him with an authorization note and a bit of card information for security purposes  The next morning my credit card was slipped under our door       and it was his day off   That is service This wonderful boutique hotel  so convenient  and so quiet  is a perfect location for a London stay       and everything is modern and new  Finally  and this is major       the bed we had was unbelievably comfortable  We don t get to London often  but when we do come it will be base stay for our stay Francis Reed Cutting  blehead  Massachusetts 
P =>  I will stay here again  Without exception  the staff members are unfailingly pleasant and helpful  Proximity to Earl s Court tube makes it easy to get where you want to go  and the local neighbourhood has decent shops and restaurants  You can also get to and from Heathrow by tube  which is quite a saving in cab fares True  the rooms are small by American standards  My daughter and I managed quite well  and were comfortable Give it a try  
P =>   Hidden gem We stayed there for a week end of il      and we were very pleased to have found this lovely hotel  As opposed to many   star London hotels  this one is very clean  on the modern side  no old fashioned stuffy dusty feeling about it We appreciated very much the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff  Congratulations to the owner s  for making sure the employees do not say   no       it is not possible      we don t know   but always try to be of assistance and help  Furthermore  we appreciated the way the room was spotlessly cleaned every day  including the kitchenette and the dirty dishes The hotel has a very good location  within walking distance to the underground station  small shops  supermarkets and an assortment of different restaurants and cafes  Hotel staff happily provides extra info about restaurants and even discount coupons for some of them We also liked and found useful the thick info folder in the room We stayed on the fifth floor in a standard double room  It was medium to small  which is not unusual for London   very efficiently put together and furbished though  We were not so impressed with the shower head   the holes were covered in lime   and with the water pressure at times  These are small little things that could be improved We will definitely return to this hotel for our future trips to London and we warmly recommend it to all those who need a clean  modern and comfortable   star hotel during their stay in London  
P =>   very comfortable stay highly recommended   We stayed at Base stay for   nights in mid       with our   yr old daughter  Knowing how small London hotel rooms usually are  I had concerns before I saw our room  We stayed at Room      which was big enough to accommodate the   of us  the push chair and lots of suitcases  Uncomplicated simple design in the room  amp  bathroom with new furniture  amp  fixtures  The room was properly cleaned everyday  dishes washed and even we found toys  that were scattered around when we left  neatly organised and stacked in the cot  Team at the reception were extremely helpful with everything  Locationwise it is   min walk to Earl s Court tube  which is pram accessible     and from there you can go anywhere in the city  I sincerely believe this is a great hotel to stay if you are visiting London  amp  are interested in museums as it takes    mins tops to walk to the Natural History Science V amp A museums  Also it s close to Waterloo station if you prefer southwest countryside  Lastly  it is a child friendly hotel    no open plugs around in the room  high banisters in stairs  nice lift for kids    very safe  
P =>   The best in London  We recently returned from a six night stay at base stay Kensington with our three children  The service and facilities were so great that we would not consider staying anywhere else next time we go to London  The staff were not only professional and polite  they went out of their way to assist us   and always with such a friendly attitude  The rooms are on the small side  but it s the centre of London so we expected that  My parents spent three nights at London s Waldorf before joining us  and they definitely preferred base stay  The rooms are so clean and the power shower was wonderful  We honestly could not fault this hotel  It s such a great concept  I wish there was one in every city  
P => 	th Birthday Celebrations Three girlfriends and I met in London to celebrate our   th Birthdays  Its the first time we have got together without husbands and children in years   The hotel we found on the internet was superb  We all shared one elegant and well equipped room  Excellent facilties and very attentive staff  I wouldn t hesitate to recommend this hotel  Central location  lovely rooms and reasonable prices  
P =>   Excellent stay This is my second time at base stay and this stay was as good as the first  It is a very comfortable hotel  with excellent service  exceptional value  for London  and a great location walking distance high street kensington and on the District line  I highly recommend it  
P =>   Friendly design new  so clean  practical well located Really friendly receptionist  Modern  amp  Zen attitude design Really good priceWell located  Earls Court on Picadilly lineNo food provided as each room has its small kitchen  quite easy  amp  cheap     Practical  kitchen  wi fi  TV  air conditionning  Laundry less than   hrsQuiet and safe areaMissing  a mirror for shaving or make up  
P =>  Great Hotel I stayed in this hotel for   nights in ruary with work  Its very close to Earls Court tube station  The rooms are spotlessly clean  I stayed in a double room which was fairly small but the ambience and decoration made up for this  The shower room was a good size Be aware that they dont accept Maestro  
P =>  Excellent in all ways Just came back from a   night stay with my husband and   year old daughter at Base stay  It was all that it promises to be on the site  every positive review is true  The reception people are lovely  check in and check out flawless  the area beautiful for first impressions of London The rooms are clean  look brand new with excellent bath facilities and huge fluffy bathtowels  the bed had great linen but the matress was rather on the soft side  Only thing I didn t like   We stayed in room I   which was about     meters below street level   front street   which meant that we had windows in level with the front sidewalk   not to worry  one way glass  one could t look inside from the street   It was kind of fun watching the passers by from your bed in the morning  but  being from a warm country like Greece  it was quite unpleasant that I couldn t open the window in the morning to air the room  felt I would suffocate   Of course the windows were not air tight   some fresh air did enter the room  but still    So  to conclude  I absolutely recommend this hotel  just ask which floor the room is on before you book in case you feel like opening a window now and then   
P =>   Great location price and amenities Clean  efficient  great neighborhood and great price for London  well kept   spent six nights   had three rooms   for my wife  two daughters and their husbands   Staff were extremely helpful at every turn  Toilet facilities superb  great showers   tube stop  Earl s Court  on the line that goes directly to Heathrow  Highly recommend  
P =>   Great medium priced hotel I stayed in a bunk room which was all that was available  By London standards not badly priced at      but this would have been really cheap if there were   in tbhe room Despite being bunk beds they are very comfortable  More like single beds on top of each other than than kid s bunks Room is simply but tastefully appointed  Bathroom is great with quality fittings  nice soap and shampoo and plenty of hot water Room has a  cupboard kitchen which would be a cost saver if you could be bothered Earls Court is a great place to find a reasonably priced meal and only a stones throw from South Kensington where there are also laods of restaurants  It is also well situated for the V   vA and Natural History Museum Only possible downside is that the hotel does nothing other than accomodation  No bar  no dining room  no breakfast etc Book well in advance   it is often full  especially if there is an exhibition at Earls Court or Olympia  
P =>  Honestly the best staff I ve ever encountered and a wonderful experience My mother and I stayed at this hotel for    days and every single day I had a great conversation with someone on staff and I am still amazed at the experience  I can honestly say I ve never encountered such sincere  dedicated  enthusiastic staff in a hotel  Never This hotel honestly deserves a very extensive review and after writing only a little of what I have experienced I ve realized that it needs so much more  therefore I have published a very extensive review of the hotel on my blog  http   artisus wordpress com  and have condensed my review below The Pros  Absolutely AMAZING staff  Vinny  one of the supervisors  and Anthony  one of the evening morning clerks were always particularly accommodating  Staff was open to negotiation  I was able to negotiate a slightly lesser price because of the length of my stay  and Vinny was able to negotiate my mother and I a discount on massages which he booked for us  the discount was small but worth it  Bed was EXTREMELY comfortable  We had a king size bed because any doubles had been previously booked and our second day in London we stayed in bed until   or   because it really was that wonderful  Shower absolutely DIVINE  though if you panic and are turning the right hand knob and wondering why nothing is coming about don t fret and call for the handyman  which is what we did  it s apparently a  quot mixer quot  so all the water is controlled only through the left knob    it was unexpectedly  high tech   and they provided shampoo shower gel  an interesting combo in my opinion  smelled really good   In a really great  quiet location but very close to anything  quot happening quot   Kensington High Street is about a      minute walk  Earl s Court Tube is about     minutes stroll  restaurants are abundant   and to prove myself an honest fanatic  The staff  the staff  the staff  the staff  I can t even describe it properly but I ve stayed in some very expensive  very luxurious places before and have never encountered staff so honestly enthused at the idea of booking me a tour or massage or theatre experience  I give the staff two thumbs WAY up and would say that their gentility was the best thing about my trip The Cons  yes  there were a few but all very  VERY minor  The toilet paper roll  I m sorry to say  was mildly annoying  It is not covered and therefore when you unroll a sheet the entire thing flies across the bathroom There wasn t much hanging space except for in the closet  which probably makes me sound silly but if you have a purse or two  or a coat or sweater that needs to be ready for the parting  you might not find it so silly  The hotel does not provide wash cloths face cloths unless requested and even then they may only give you one as they don t stock many To make for a more impressive and attractive entrance the housekeepers short sheet the side of the bed  at least for a king size  furthest from the door  And I mean SHORT SHEET  there was about a forearm s length of duvet wrapped at the foot of the bed and absolutely NOTHING hanging gracefully off the edge furthest from the door  It may look pretty  but it s annoying if you re on the  wrong side  Recommendations for Eating base stay does have some discounts for nearby restaurants  Our favorites  which we visited several times were Strada  Italian food with a     discount   and Balan s  We did  however  greatly prefer the Balan s on Kensington High Street than the one off of Earl s Court Rd  The one on the High Street had friendlier staff  a cleaner atmosphere  and was much quieter   If you go to Balan s try the  quot Bakewell Cherry Tart quot   I don t know what it was made it so good but it was DELICIOUS If you re looking for some English  quot tea and scones quot   which I noted during my trip is a fading indulgence  try  quot The Muffin Man quot  which is on Walker Street off of Kensington High Street by ks  amp  Spencer s  The scones are absolutely delicious  Also  EMI records has a building just across the street so you may see some celebrities if not their Hummers  a Hummer in London seems so out of place   As for chocolate  which is what my mother and I always indulge in  the best place is Thorton s  in our opinion   We prefer it because they had a greater selection of dark chocolates and let me tell you I bought   bags of their  quot Cherry Almond Fudge quot  to bring back with me because it really is that good  The closest one to the hotel is on Oxford Street  where lots of people go for it s shopping experience  Recommendations for Spa Treatments My mother  who has fibromyalgia  and I inquired at the front desk when we checked in about massages  They have a     discounted partnership with  quot Simply Fab Company quot  which sounded very sketchy to me at first  The perk with this company is that they come to you  We both opted for    minute Swedish massages and the front desk  Vinny specifically  booked it for us and managed to haggle back   pounds for us  which may not seem like a lot but everyone s watching their pennies these days  The masseuse was named Gretchen and she was absolutely AMAZING  I don t like deep tissue things  terribly ticklish  but that was honestly one of the best  if not the best  massages I ve ever had  So I do recommend the peculiarly named Simply Fab Co  www sfcstyle com   In conclusion  I highly recommend this hotel and will definitely be staying there again if the chance arises  I hope that you try it if only to encounter the staff and see how really astounding they are  If you would like further information about my experience  please let me know  
P =>   sleek minimalist central    and affordable   I have stayed at this modern and ultra clean hotel twice since it opened  It is exactly what I am looking for in a London hotel   a clean  no nonsense  well located place which meets my budget  It s perfect for those travelers who dont plan to spend much time lounging in the hotel room for hours on end   but rather are looking for somewhere to leave their suitcases and crash at the end of the day  The beds are very comfortable and all of the facilities still seem brand new  The staff is very friendly and helpful  
P =>   Comfy and full of amenities  I stayed at base stay for five days at the end of a long stay in England  They were wonderful from the moment I arrived  My room was super comfortable  the kitchenette was stylish and well appointed  and the staff couldn t have been more helpful  There were three supermarkets within a two block radius  so I could stock up my fridge and make lovely meals  But there were also tons of pubs and restaurants in the area if I wanted a night out  It s within walking distance to the V amp A and the British Museum and the Museum of Natural History  close to a great gym  and a block from the Tube  And did I mention the post office on the corner  I love this place and its staff  
P =>   BASE TO STAY IS THE PLACE TO STAY I would truly recommend this stylish hotel to anyone going to London on a budget  My husband  daughter and myself had a very pleasant   night stay  il       in this hotel that is exactly as shown in Internet  The elegant d cor  comfortable triple room  spacious bathroom for London standards and well designed mini kitchen made our six night stay a most pleasant one  However  the real asset of Base Stay is a very qualified  efficient and well trained staff always ready to assist us with tourist information  tour bookings and theater tickets among other things  they also did our electronic flight check in  amazing  On top of this  the location is great  a quiet charming neighborhood but at   minute walk from the tube station and a very convenient commercial area with little restaurants  pubs  places to buy food  pharmacy and anything you may need  In sum  a wonderful choice  I would definitely repeat the experience Silvana  Montevideo Uruguay 
P =>   Shhhh   let s keep it our little secret   this place is AWESOME  I loved Base Stay  From the moment I checked in until I picked up my bags to leave I was provided with excellent service from the outstanding staff at this hotel  They are happy to provide helpful information on how to get around London and other tips to make my stay at their hotel more pleasant  I even saw a staff member run a block from the hotel to catch up with two guests because he d heard from another staff member that they were looking for a church to attend Sunday mass  Talk about going above and beyond  HUGE bonus points to the staff for allowing me to print my boarding pass at the reception desk  It s certainly the little things that make a big difference  The hotel is well situated about a two minute walk to the Earl s Court tube and a five minute walk to Gloucester Road tube  I was able to easily navigate my way to the places I needed to go from these tube stations  The rooms were exactly as pictured on the website  I was in a single room  It was smallish but so well designed that you don t feel like you re in a small room  My luggage stowed easily under the bed  There was a desk  closet and completely outfitted kitchenette  Housekeeping even does your dishes for you each day  There are many stores nearby where you can get food items to prepare in the kitchen which helps save money in such an expensive city  The room was clean and the beds were comfy  The bathrooms were large for what I would ve expected for a single small room  I thought the push button shower was very cool and really appreciated the towel warmer  Speaking of towels   what a relief to finally stay in a hotel that provides adult sized towels  The bath sheet sized towels were a nice touch of luxury in what some would call a budget hotel  The hotel provides free wireless internet that was very reliable during my stay  There s a flat screen on the wall where you can also use internet if you didn t bring a laptop and you can get movies for  p  I would ve liked to have been able to adjust the positioning of the TV but  hey  that s my only complaint about the room  I really loved this little hotel  Kudos to the management and staff for providing such excellent service  
P =>   I d like to keep it a secret    but     I would like to keep it a secret  in fear that it may become too popular and create a different hotel  although  if they stick true to their philosophy  it will remain the same    which is WONDERFUL    The location is perfect for anyone loving the central city of London    and extremely perfect for the first time visitor  The convenience to Earl s Court tube as well as the local pubs  cafes  shops  and wonderful  quot community feeling quot  of the area could not be beat The hotel will NOT disappoint you   the rooms are true to the web site   the mini kitchen is perfect and very handy    the beds very comfortable   the bathrooms modern and the showers are like a massage We took out three different rooms for the group who traveled with us      Standand double  a Double King  and a Deluxe  a dream come true for four people  The staff was helpful and fun   we hope to return to London in the near future and will stay no place else but base stay  
P =>   Not in my   s anymore but still want to see the world  Place was perfect for my needs  Pictures posted here by other travels portray the rooms accurately  I had no surprises  I could ve stayed in a hostel or lower end B amp B and dealt with the small inconveniences for a lower price    but I didn t have to  I m a bit older now with some money and willing to spend it for the guarantee of privacy  my own toilet  hot water  Small single room  Clean  modern and tasteful  Stocked the fridge with fruit cups and yogurt from the nearby ks  amp  Spencer for breakfast  Drank the provided tea and coffee in the neat little kitchenette  Then left for the whole day to sightsee and have fun  Came back at night  Watched the tele  Showered  Slept  I did miss after a few days encountering new people at breakfast like you would at other places  
P =>   Great  Base Camp  for seeing London on a budget  We stopped in to Portsmouth for a liberty port with the US Navy and wanted to see London on a short schedule and tight budget  Base Stay proved to fit the bill quite well  We were able to get a room for three of us for a little over      USD each  The location was a little off the beaten path in the middle of a residential area so it was quiet and not overrun by tourists  The good news was that it was within a couple of blocks of a tube station which carried us pretty much anywhere we needed to go with an all day pass After seeing some of the hotels friends were staying in for twice the price in downtown London  we definitely realized we got a great deal on a relatively well appointed room  We would stay here again  
P =>   Clean  modern rooms   large for London standards I stayed in Base stay for   night with friends for a night out  amp  was impressed  Clean spacious rooms  amp  friendly  helpful staff  The rooms are self contained with fridge  microwave  sink  amp  crockery  amp  there is no retaurant or bar  but usually hotel restuarants in London are overpriced  amp  poor quality  so you re better off venturing down the street to one of many restaurants  Within about   mins walk from Earls Court Tube station  off the main street so nice  amp  quiet area  Highly recommended  amp  well definitely go back 
P =>   Very Pleased with Everything I was not familiar with the name  so I based my decision on the website and tripadvisor recommendations alone  I am happy to report that the decision was a great one  My whole family  husband and two children  enjoyed the accomodations and would return in a moment  The location was perfect  just close enough to restaurants  the Tube  etc   but not too close  Our room was spacious and very clean  The staff was very friendly  Our family had the room at the front of the hotel  which was a little noisy because of the street traffic in the morning  but we weren t lounging about anyway  Things to do  places to see  There were many good restaurants right down the street  but after one delicious dinner out  we spent the remainder of the evenings dining on our own creations purchasd at Simply Foods  down from the Tube  It was much more economical and relaxing for the kids  Overall  the hotel was great and I would highly recommend it to any of our friends  
P =>  A great base for a London stay I stayed at base stay for two days for a business trip to London  Overall I m extremely impressed The hotel is located literally a few minutes  walk from Earl s Court station  which makes it very accessible from Heathrow Airport and Kings  Cross St  Pancras station via the Piccadilly line of the London Underground  The vicinity of Earl s Court station has a number of shops and places to eat  While transport links are good  the hotel is located in a very quiet street I stayed in a single room on the lower ground floor  At first I was worried that I ll be below the ground level  but it turned out that this room is at the ground level at the other side of the hotel  The single room is very small  but exceptionally well laid out  It has a very comfortable single bed  a small desk  a wall mounted flat screen TV  a wardrobe  a kitchenette and a bathroom with a huge shower cabin  The design of the room is very elegant and modern  something that I really liked I was particularly impressed by the kitchenette which is hidden next to the wardrobe  It has a full set of plates  cups  glasses and cutlery for two people  a sink  a small fridge and a microwave  All of this make the hotel room seem more like an apartment  There are Sainsbury s and Waitrose supermarkets nearby  so it is extremely convenient to buy food there  heat it up in the microwave and eat in the room There are also a number of options for internet access  If you don t have a laptop with you  it is possible to access the internet via the TV  It s a bit cumbersome to use sometimes  but great to check e mails  With a laptop there are even more options  On arrival you get a code for Wi Fi access  which gives you a limited amount of time  The next day you get another code  Wi Fi access can sometimes be a bit slow  so for heavy duty internet access it is possible to buy access to a wired high speed internet connection  which is indeed fast enough for most purposes The room was exceptionally clean and well maintained  as is the hotel in general  The staff were always very friendly and helpful Overall I had a very enjoyable stay  and will definitely visit again  and would recommend this hotel to anyone  I m giving   stars mainly because this is not a luxury hotel  and the rooms are indeed very small Something else that they could improve are the windows  The hotel strives to be environmentally friendly  but insulating windows a bit better would surely greatly improve their energy efficiency  Otherwise a light draught could be felt through the window  Also since the window is single glazed  when there some people walking outside  everything could be heard clearly from inside the room  
P =>  Will definitely stay there again  Great value  Will definitely stay there again  Great value  I only wish they had shower curtains  
P =>  pleased stay  My husband and I had two four night stays here in ch while traveling in England and Scotland  From start to finish our experience was positive  Reservations were easy to make on their website  We arrived at Heathrow  followed the signs to the Underground  bought an Oyster card and made our way without a hitch to Earl s Court station  where there is a ramp to the street for folks with luggage   From there  it was just a block and a half walk to the hotel We were assigned to room L    which is at street level  two windows face the  mews    a quiet  gated block long street   The queen bed was very comfortable  there were two bedside tables  a good sized closet with shelves  hangers  and safe  a kitchenette with sink  microwave  dishes and glassware  and a mini fridge  move the shelf and you have room for a   gallon of milk  juice  bottle of wine  leftovers  etc   We took advantage of the kettle and ate breakfast in each morning  using the coffee tea they provided  making instant oatmeal or purchasing breakfast goodies from one of the excellent food shops nearby  ks  amp  Spencer  Sainsbury  etc    There is suitcase storage under the bed  but not if you have two     suitcases  as we did  However  this room has lots of nooks and crannies which worked just fine  Air conditioning heat responded promptly and the windows open a little to let in fresh air The wide screen TV with several channels  inc  BBC and Sky News  also offered internet access using a simple to master system with the TV remote and a keyboard   this was a great time saver unless you really needed to listen to voicemail or do a lot of printing  The bathroom in this room was well thought out   a towel warming rack  lots of counter space to spread out toiletries  a shower head that delivers  large towels  and some nice shampoo and soap Our second visit started in room G     which is a little smaller  the closet is narrower  the desk is a little smaller  and you have to walk past the TV screen at the foot of the bed   Also  the bathroom has a large window  so it seemed colder and you couldn t have the shade up  When L   became available  we moved back there  Both rooms are excellent value for the price  and we wouldn t hesitate to recommend base stay or stay there again ourselves Staff at this hotel are first rate  reflecting management s philosophy  see their website   We are grateful to General Manager Nassar Khalil and those we met  including Amie  Ann  Adam  Vinny  Lucy  Jack and Ahlam  as well as the fine housekeeping crew  for helping make our visit to London memorable  
P =>  You get the impossible with base stay  We loved this hotel  I must say when we travel we look for the impossible  or should I say almost the impossible  We wanted an affordable hotel without compromising luxury  It needed to accommodate a family of   to one room and hopefully in local area with great access to all of London  We found this in base stay  The rooms are modern with a luxury feel  They have tall ceilings  flat screen tv with free internet use and wifi  They even come with a very small mini kitchen that proved to be well appointed and efficient  The bathroom was great  the heated towel bar a nice touch  The kids slept in single beds converted out of chairs  a bit small but heck teenagers can sleep anywhere  We stayed in L   that had two doors that led out to a patio  an added bonus  The Kensington location was perfect with very easy access to all of London by way of the tube  It is a upscale residential area filled with great people and local restaurants  Nice to come back to after sight seeing the tourist areas all day  The hotel staff was superb from any guidance we needed to requests that were asked  We like to seek out local restaurants with really good food  the staff recommendations never let us down  During our stay we did experience a power outage that impacted the water system  This was out of the hotels control  but they were very responsive in obtaining a generator and even gave a credit on     the room rate for the day  With the given circumstances  I actually felt bad for the staff  If you want a hotel with pools  restaurants and a fitness center this is not the hotel for you  But  if you want affordable luxury in a great local location with easy access  you will not be disappointed  
P =>   Perfect Very clean and beautiful hotel in a nice neighbourhood Only a few steps away from the tubeof Earl s Court  Friendly and helpful staff Free internet in every room is extremely handy Excellent value for money  
P =>   great weekend The hotel upgraded our room to a superior one for free  The room was nice  elegant and spacious  Very silent and great location  Plenty of good restaurant within     m  We will come back 
P =>   I always stay here in London This place is a gem  Very modern  chic clean  quiet  well equipped  and moderately priced  Kind of a zen feeling to the rooms  And close to Gloucester and Earl s Court underground stations  The rooms are small  but extremely well laid out  
P =>   Stylish little gem near earls court station This    room hotel is stylish  affordable and the perfect base for business or a city break  The interior is done with an eye for detail  unlike the big chain hotels without style  It is just what you need  No breakfast included  but neatly self catering unit in each room  with fridge and microwave  wine opener  cutlery glasses  water boiler and etc  all at no extra cost  Shops nearby to shop for breakfast at your own time and leisure  Wireless internet and digital guide included  Location    minutes walking distance from earls court tube  In    stops you are at heathrow on the picadilly line  Earls court has a lift  so no carrying your luggage up and down stairs or escalator at tube station  Near exhibition centre  Science museum  etc  The staff is always ready to help  just buzz if you need them to help with your luggage up the front stairs  
P =>   The perfect hotel in London A great stylish hotel  Very convenient  walking distance of Earls Court Tube station on both Piccadilly and District lines  and residential location  with many good restaurants nearby  Clean and modern room  immaculate bathroom  convenient mini kitchen  and very friendly and helpful staff  In addition free internet access and a music box of about      tracks This was our  nd stay at base stay  and we will not search for another hotel when in London  
P =>   Clean comfortable  We stayed with our   teenagers and had a brief but very comfortable stay  The rooms were brilliantly equipped  comfortable and clean and the staff very friendly  Will definitely book in again  
P =>   Perfect Location  Great Service I was staying here for three nights recently with a friend  It was our first stay and we were very impressed  The location of the hotel is perfect  near the Earl s Court tube stop on the Picadilly line  which means you can take the tube directly from Heathrow airport  The rooms are very comfy  with microwave and electric kettle  and bath tub  And they also offered discounts at local restaurants  Highly recommended  The only point was the cost  I found it a little on the high side  although we are talking about South Kensington in London  
P =>  Highly Recommend No complaints   Had an enjoyable and comfortable stay at this hotel  It s quiet  clean  new  and modern  The staff was pleasant and helpful with questions  I spent   days in London shopping on Oxford Street and Covent Garden  both areas are easy to get to from the hotel using the tube Getting to the hotel from the airport using the tube was unbelievably easy and cheaper than taking a taxi  The Piccadilly line will take you to the hotel with no transfers  Once you arrive at the Earl s Court tube stop  there is an elevator   a plus with luggage The hotel is a short walk from the tube stop make sure to leave through the Earl s Court exit  the Warick Road exit   On the same street as the tube stop there are numerous restaurants  pubs  food shops markets  pharmacy  post office  internet cafe    anything you need  I stayed in the single room and felt the size was just right for me  Not as small as I expected based on previous reviews  It was very clean and cozy  Loved the mini kitchenette  includes a sink  microwave  fridge  teapot  dishware and utensils  Also loved that I could control the temperature in the room  There is internet access and movies available for   pounds  Nice bathroom  was a good size with a towel warmer I plan on staying here again when I return to London  
P =>  excellent stay we we ll back Very nice hotel  conveniently situated in Kensington  close to lots of restaurant  pub  bakery and mini market and in a   minute walk from Earl s court tube station  The area is safe  so you can move by foot even in the night  In the room there s e little kitchen where you can prepare coffe  tea  or have a fast meal I found the room incredibly clean and I think the price is appropriate for the service the hotel provides  I would absolutely come back  
P =>  Nice but noisy Stayed here for one night in a superior room on the Ground floor  not cheap at over     quid  for an event at the RAH  Agree with other reviewers that the rooms are quite small though well equipped with microwave  tiny fridge that didn t get all that cold   sink and crockery and cutlery  Nice bathroom with a really powerful shower  Location is great    mins away from Earls Court tube station and loads of pubs and restaurants in the vicinity  Staff are really helpful and will recommend eateries  give directions etc  I arrived early and they did all they could to let me occupy my room by    noon   NB  the advertised breakfast boxes are no longer available  nor are many of the money off vouchers they claim to have in the guest directory Two or three niggles  the bed was very soft and the mattress had seen better days as we could feel the springs through it  we found the place very noisy and could hear the footsteps from the room above late at night and early in the morning  which was a pain  we also found that the room got very hot  
P =>   A great base to stay in London We stayed at Base stay for six nights in ruary and it was definitely the cleverest and best hotel we ve stayed in so far in London  this was visit nr     The location was great  It was very easy to get to all central London destinations and there were also great restaurants and supermarkets near by  The street was astonishingly quiet and we couldn t hear the traffic  if there was any on the quiet street  in our room The room was smallish but very well organized  we never travel light and still had room to our two large suitcases and to move around   The mini kitchenette was really useful  We made our own breakfast every morning with food from the supermarket  Hotels with breakfast of the same rating were a lot more expensive and still the breakfast isn t usually that spectacular  The contemporary styled furniture was good and clean and the room was comfortable and exceptionally clean  The shower was also very good  Our sink was blocked when we arrived and it was fixed immediately  The staff was friendly and helpful  It almost felt like you were staying in a flat rather that a hotel since you didn t see a lot of people in the hotel corridors  the lobby etc  But you still got the benefits of a good hotel like you could leave your suitcases at the reception if your flight was later etc One of the best features at Base stay is that you get internet on the tv in the room and it was very easy to use it  The hotel s website was really informative as regards restaurants  shops etc in the area and the internet is almost a must while travelling The staff was really helpful with booking seats on flights etc if you needed help  Base stay is definitely our base when ever we travel to London  Reasonably priced  the rooms include all you need from a fridge to a microwave oven and the internet as well as a comfy bed  What else does a traveller need  
P =>   Excellent value for London Base stay is a modern  clean hotel based in Kensington  We picked the hotel based on price and reviews  we were not disappointed  Check in was easy and quick  the room was small but most rooms in London are  The room was modern with all the essentials  tv  kettle  fridge   etc   The hotel is only   minute walk from the tube station which is fantastic  When staying in London I would not hesitate to book this hotel again  
P =>   great feeling clever solutions  bed kitchenette  I joined my partner who was in London for Business  for the weekend  We knew the vicinity from previous visits  and liked it because of its atmosphere  nice strolls  shopping  dining and picadilly line service  So we searched for another hotel in the same area and thanks to tripadvisor we found base stay  Clean room  small but with clever solutions  high bed with space below  kitchenette including all you need including even microwave  cleaned up by the housekeeping staff every morning   proper desk  TV with radio and movie on demand functions  Everything very clean  modern appeal  state of the art  Only thing I disliked was the window that is   th century   but with blinds and curtains closed it was ok  Staff booked a table in a greek restaurant nearby for us  great experience and we got     discount because being guests of base stay  
P =>   Wonderful caring service I stayed twice at base stay during uary and ruary        I found the customer service attitude from everyone I dealt with to be outstanding  The property is clean  well kept  compact  and easy to stay in  I especially liked the maid service that included washing up the dishes and kitchenette utensils  I recommend this to anyone looking for a very luxurious budget hotel  
P =>   Very happy with base stay My daughter and I stayed at base stay during Thanksgiving week  We were in London to celebrate her   th birthday  I could not have been happier with our accomodation  We stayed in a bunk bed room  I was a bit disappointed at check in to be directed downstairs  Oh no  I thought  a dark basement room  Wrong  The room had French doors at the far end that opend to a tiny courtyard  giving the room natural light and a feeling of space  In nice weather  the table and chairs would be perfect for enjoying a drink or even a meal heated in the in room kitchenette The room was very small  but also very well designed  making the most of the space  Everything was very modern and kept clean  The closet was small  with an area to hang clothes and several shelves since there is not a bureau  There is also a desk and an easy chair  Interestingly for such a small room  the bathroom was a very decent size with attractive fixtures and a great shower  Free internet access is available via the wall mounted flatscreen TV  It was a little difficult to get used to  but it does the trick for checking email or the location of a restaurant  etc  Not as good as one s own laptop  but nice not to have to schlep it along The kitchenette is very convenient  containing a mini fridge  a sink  a micro wave  a wonderful English electric teakettle and a remarkable array of dishes and serving pieces  even including a breadboard and corkscrew  It was great for a light breakfast and snacks  Although everything needed for heating ready made meals is available  there is really no where to eat comfortably unless the weather is pleasant and meals are taken in the courtyard The location couldn t be better  Just a three minute walk from the Earls Court tube station  all of London is an easy tube or bus ride away  Earls Court Road itself is a very  quot real people quot  place  with lots of British chain restaurants  local pubs  a Simply Foods by ks and Spencer as well as more basic grocery stores  a Boots pharmacy  and so on  Even though the area is full of converted mini hotels and B amp Bs  the atmosphere was not really touristy   more like a lot of visitors hanging out in a regular neighborhood  Base stay is located just far enough away from the busy street to be quiet  We felt very safe no matter what time of day or night we were out I paid    pounds per night for our room  which given the price of London hotel rooms was more than fair for the quality of the accomodation  I am never sure how many  quot stars quot  to give a place like this  On one hand  it s not the Ritz  On the other  it doesn t pretend to be  I gave it four because I don t want to be misleading  but it is five in terms of what it claims to be  I can say that I woud happily stay here again on my next trip to London  
P =>   great spot great price great hotel Base to stay is a great concept  Neat  tidy  functional and it looks great  Free internet  little fridge  microwave and kitchinette   Awesome location  All the staff friendly and helpful  It was everthing we needed  in a great location for subway and restaurants and supermarket  Good rates  
P =>   Location price and design Believe the positive reviews  We liked the location  near tube and restaurants   the price and the quiet street  Our modern room  a twin  was tiny  but it didn t make us feel locked up  Well designed  Great power shower  lovely shower soap   Smart kitchenette with a microwave  fridge  sink  kettle  tea and coffee  Good Philips flatscreen tv with internet  New films only   pounds  Will be back in july  
P =>   I d recommend a friend Very pleasant helpful staff  beautifully clean room  quiet  all very acceptable  
P =>   Brilliant Service and Value A series of apartments in a converted Edwardian house  For London the rooms are large and exceptionally well appointed  I have stayed in London hotels for over     nights in the last   years and this place offers excellent quality and value for money Everything was fresh  clean and worked perfectly  The air conditioning was excellent I arrived early and the staff were very helpful ushering me immediately to the room  I didnt use the kitchen facility but it was first class  There are   major food stores within   mins walk  M amp S Sainsbury adn Waitrose  with a range of prepared meals that you could bring back and cook  There are also literally dozens of different restaurants within a   minute walk It has a great AV   TV system  offers free internet avccess and shows Pay as You Go films for    compared to    in most other hotelsMy room cost      That was quite stunning value  
P =>  Time in London Base stay is situated in an excellent location for a short break in London  It is within easy walking distance of underground stations and the museums  The staff are friendly and efficient and sorted us out a room even though we arrived at the hotel early  The accomodation was excellent   a large comfortable bed  a super shower and a mini kitchen that had all you would need to make a snack  The room was immaculately clean and very well presented  I would recommend the hotel to anyone needing a central location in the city  
P =>  Don t hesitate to book if you are in London My wife  son and I arrived in London for the New Year celebrations   the big attraction of Base Stay was that unlike many London Hotels they keep their prices at normal rates which is excellent value normally  but exceptional at that time of the year  The reception staff were very friendly and the room was perfectly clean and decorated to a really high standard  My son had a settee bed  but this was good quality and very comfortable  The room was even cleaned on new Year s day and the staff waited until we went out just before lunchtime to maintain the room  For location it is a five minute walk from Earls Court tube and the links across London from there were great   even on New Years eve we were back at the hotel in    minutes I have used this hotel previously for business and would not hesitate to recommend it for business or leisure   brilliant  
P =>  modern hotel in historic building Great experience at base stay  It s in a nice location    minute s walk from Earl s Court tube station  convenient access to Heathrow      minutes by tube  direct   But it s quiet Pluses  excellent decor  furnishings  Very modern interior  and very well designed  But it s in a historic looking building in a beautiful neighborhood  The rooms feel bigger than they are since everything is so well laid out   no wasted space  Bathroom was excellent   one of the best hotel showers I ve used  Nice complementary toiletries as well  Internet access via wireless or via TV  big  flat screen   Comfy beds  Nice elevator  but there are a few stairs as well  Professional  helpful staff  Efficient check in check out process  didn t seem to have an automated checkout though   Minuses  we had a lousy view  air shaft  corner   but on the plus side  it was super quiet  We didn t spend any daylight hours in the room so didn t care  I don t think they have a restaurant  but the room comes with a kitchenette  There are loads of restaurants and pubs around anyway  including a Wagamama   minutes away  No significant complaints   mainly  pleasant surprises  And I m pretty picky  
P =>   Small hotel off Earl s Court   of us stayed in a triple room in Base Stay for   nights  We paid about GBP     per room per night  which worked out to be about GBP    per person    which was not a bad bargain for central London The hotel is not exactly in Kensington as the name suggested  Granted that it is still in the Borough of Kensington and Chelsea  Base Stay was off Earl s Court road   cross the road from Earl s Court tube  turn right  walk down Earl s Court Gardens and turn left at the first junction  Base Stay is a refurbished series of townhouses  with narrow hallways and a ladyrinth of rooms  But the decor is clean  modern and blended well with the white washed columns and walls on the outside  The room was small and rather cramped for   persons  It would have been just nice for a double  It was evident that the room was designed for a double with there being   standard single beds with a diven and headboards et al and one  foldable   collapsible single bed squeezed between the work desk and the   standard single beds To save space  the small kitechenette is built into the wall like a cupboard and space saving furniture used  e g  wall mounted LCD telly  half size stool in place of a chair or sofa etc The bathroom  thankfully  is a decent size Furnishing is of a good quality and overall  the stay was comfortable  albeit a little cramped at times  Base Stay was very unlike other horror stories of townhouse converted into hotels in other parts of central London where peeling paint  overhanging wires and generally  dingy decor were the order of the day  
P =>   Brilliant Base Stay    We stayed one night at Base Stay whilst visiting the International Horse Show at Olympia  one stop away on the tube from Earls Court  The hotel is about a   min walk from Earls Court Tube and a street full of restaurants  take aways  off licences  supermarkets  really handy if you want something to eat and drink  There is a vending machine at the hotel which has chocolate  crisps  cans of drink etc Check in was the quickest ever  no queues of people  a nice greeting from the receptionist We had a standard double room on the  rd floor  which had everything we needed   lovely comfy bed  nice clean modern bathroom  nice flat screen TV positioned perfectly for watching from bed   mini kitchen with cutlery and plates cups glasses microwave  free internet through the TV  and good storage space The whole hotel was very clean and modern and tastefully decorated  even the christmas wreath on the front door was classy I would def recommend this place if visiting working in places in West London  
P =>   Good Place       but let s keep a level head This was a good place to stay  Very small room  but very clean  Had a fridge and mini kitchenette in a closet  Good location   minutes from Earl s Court tube station  I agree with others that it s a good place but think it may be a little overhyped  There are other places in London cheaper and also quite adequate  The much ballyhooed internet service through the TV set was annoying and practically useless  The pay for internet service worked well  
P =>   Can t beat it for location price and staff We stayed here over a beautiful weekend in ember  The hotels location is great  about   minutes walk from Earls Court station and the tube to most places you d want to go  Within walking distance of Chelsea  Kensington  Hyde park etc  Hotel itself is clean  tidy and reasonably priced I did stay here about three years ago and thought the staff were pretty poor and unhelpful  Now the difference couldnt be more marked   very keen to help  friendly and welcoming Ill stay here every time I go london  
P =>   Seriously good simplicity   We were introduced to Base by the owners and really enjoy the simple  yet comfortable surroundings in a great location  The package is rounded off by the team who are friendly  helpful and accommodating  Altogether a unique experience that we d happily recommend  
P =>  Great value and location   loved it  My friend and I stayed at Base Stay ember      for a girlfriend getaway  and were very pleased with our choice  We were looking for a hotel that was under      per night  on the Piccadilly line  a short walk from the nearest tube stop  had two beds  an in room safe  and a mini kitchen  Base Stay ticked every box and then some We paid      per night for a twin room  and it was a decent size   not large  but there was ample room for the two of us  The room had a clean  modern appearance  think Ikea furniture  and was comfortable and pleasant  The mini kitchen was discretely hidden behind a set of doors  and there was a small desk and flat screen TV with internet  The kitchen was equipped with a microwave  kettle  and mini fridge  and included plates  silverware  and glasses for two  as well as a decent corkscrew  Limited free internet access was provided  but I found the setup to be too slow and cumbersome  My friend has more patience  and used it to send emails on most evenings The room and bathroom were very clean  and the carpet and furniture were all in good condition  The room does not come with an iron  but I requested one and it was delivered promptly along with an ironing board  My only complaint is that the sheets were not changed at all during our six night stay One of the selling points for us was the arrival base   you can rent a room for     an hour upon arrival  which would allow you to freshen up  We didn t need to use it though  since we had only a short wait until our room was ready  despite arriving at      am  Still  I think this is a great option for early morning arrivals We found the staff to be very accommodating and friendly  and they were happy to put half of the bill onto each of our credit cards  The hotel is in a quiet neighborhood  and I didn t hear any street noise or anything from the surrounding rooms I liked the Earls Court area because of the variety of shops and restaurants  It caters to both residents and tourists  and the streets weren t filled with tacky souvenir shops  We had a great meal at It s Greek to Me  and a very overpriced and  quot just OK quot  meal at Mr  Wing s  they could at least serve Chinese mustard with the spring rolls instead of plain old yellow   There were some nice bakeries  a post office  and cheap internet caf  across from the tube stop  The Earls Court Exhibition Center and the Brompton Cemetery are both just about a ten minute walk from the hotel I was really pleased with the accommodations and location  and would highly recommend Base Stay  
P =>   Great Base   Stay Absolutely Loved It  Fantastic location just a short stroll to Earls Court Station  On Picadilly Line with lifts and ramp to road so easy to arrive directly from Heathrow with luggage  Fab resteraunts  Pubs  M  amp  S food supermarket  post office  ATMs and Laundromat all within a very easy walk Queen Bed room and Kitchenette facilities whilst compact were exceptionally well designed and easy to live in  Simple things like space under the bed for suitcases all made  Internet via the TV was useful even though slightly cumbersome  or of the rooms and entire property was very calming  just a fab find  Would highly recomend and definately return  
P =>   An ABSOLUTE must    base stay Kensington  was the BEST hotel apparment i have ever stayed in  it was clean  spacious  nice bathroom  comfortable bed  great kitchenette  what else could you ask for   LOCATION   the location was outstanding  it was close to the supermarket  heaps of restaurants cafes  the underground and the gardens  we shared the biggest room of the whole building with a suite and a big bathroom and a king size bed   a balcony  the t v was awsome too   it was absolutley freezing when we got to london  but when you got into the hotel   our room it was lovely and warm  I RECOMEND IT TO EVERYONE  i was sensational  
P =>   Recommend this one My wife and I used base stay for   nights while we were attending a seminar at the Ibis hotel Earls Court  not a hotel I would recommend  friends also attended and we were able to get   adjoining rooms on the ground floor with a joint terrace with tables and chairs  The seminar finished quite late  and  although there are restaurants around the hotel  they seemed to be mainly the fast food type  so it was great to have a kitchenette in a cupboard in the room with crockery  cutlery and glasses  ks and Spencers food shop is only a few paces away  it stays open quite late  and we were able to buy micowaveable meals of a reasonable quality and cook and eat the meals on the terrace  it was quite sheltered and the weather was not too cold  wouldn t recommend the outdoor meals when it s raining  They do offer a  quot breakfast box quot   but it s full of Kellog s products and long life milk and juice  Buy some stuff at ks and Spencer and use the micowave for food Good bathroom and power shower  TV with internet capability  not tested  Air conditioning and heating worked well  All in all a change from the usual multinational high rise hotels aroud the area  Highly recommended if you a attending anything in and around Earls Court  The reception concierege staff were great  and security is good   the hotel door locks down at   p m  and you need to prove guest I D  to get in  
P =>   Great Hotel  Love the hotel and location  I ve ordered a stay of   night  single room  The stuff is nice and helps were needed  The room was a bit too small but very clean and cozy  The small kitchen is not to useful   there is no really a place to eat in the room   but I did use the fridge  My disappointment was the lack of wi fi for my cell phone  and surfing the web through the TV option is very uncomfortable  Location is gr    very close to Earl s Court tube station  right on the district  circle and Piccadilly lines  all the way to Heathrow   Would love to come back again  
P =>  Great stay My   year old son and I booked a  quot bunk quot  bed room on the main floor It was very nice  but extremely small by western standards  Perhaps next time  we ll book a twin room The bathroom facilities were excellent We paid    GBP including VAT My only complaint was that you could hear some noise and banging from the room above us Overall  I would recommend this hotel for style and cleanliness  
P => base stay Continues to Impress  We saw all the positive reviews on this hotel and decided to spend a little more than we normally would for a night in beautiful Kensington  We are so impressed that we ll probably stay here again when we come back to London It is conveniently located    block walk  by Earl s Court Underground  Tube  station  such that making it to and from Heathrow is a   pound one way fare per adult  If you have lot s of luggage  train taxi might be better We booked a double plus a single sleeper for     pounds        per night  We were so happy with the room and friendly service  This hotel definitely has the priorities right for us  Central  quiet location combined with stylish design made us easily forget about room service and workout room The only tiny gripe is that you can hear people walking around above you  Get a top floor if possible so you can be the one disturbing those below    This place is definitely worth the extra  if you re trying to watch your spending  
P =>   Loved it  Just returned from a three night stay at Base stay in London  The location was a three minute walk to Earl s Court tube and the walk to the hotel was safe  As a single person one could feel comfortable walking there alone in the evening  The room was super clean  great bathroom with shower  the kitchenette was great to have  Easy to pick up breakfast or other foods at ks and Spencers almost right beside the tube station  There a pubs very close  also an Italian a Greek and an Indian resturants within a    minute walk  Great value and trendy type of place  
P =>   Just what we were looking for I booked for the first time Base Stay based on TripAdvisor reviews and I was not disappointed  Small  which I expected of course  but  lt very gt  efficiently laid out room  Great shower  Little kitchenette wonderful  Ability to search web on TV which I wasn t looking for actually turned out to be very useful for checking the status of the Tube in the mornings  booking a show  checking the weather  Very quiet and  lt extremely gt  clean  Pleasant staff at front desk  The key cards had to be recharged at one point  they slowly sort of lost their ability to open the doors  but recharging was no problem  We could feel the springs in the bed somewhat  room     I think   but it really didn t affect our sleep  The location is fantastic   plenty of restaurants nearby  ks  amp  Spencer Simply Food store for groceries  ATMs  bakeries  Earls Court tube  All within     blocks  And trees in the parks  Next time I visit London I don t have to find a place  this is it  One thing that would be good   a little map on the web site to show the actual ocation  The way the streets are labeled in that area is a little confusing  There are   segments of Courtfield Gardens    
P =>   amazing staff Having arrived at  am after a    hour flight from Australia we were thrilled to be able to have use of our room  As mentioned by previous writers the room was very small and we had nowhere to store our luggage so consequently it sat on the floor and we jumped over it  My only complaint was the mattress which was very tired to say the least   we stayed on the fourth floor  The location  cleanliness and helpfulness of the staff made up for the bed and we would definately recommend it  
P =>  Great Base I stayed with my   year old son during Thanksgiving of last year  We stayed in a room with a bunk bed  he loved every minute of sleeping on the top bunk  The kitchenette was great to heat his cereal in the mornings  Nice walk to the Museums and restaurants   My favorite was Nandos great chicken dishes for a good price  Short walk to the tube was fantastic we took the train from Heathrow only glitch was when we got off the train at Earls Court we head in the wrong direction  The shower was fantastic nice TV wish there was cable  Next trip to London I will definitely stay again  
P =>  Base Stay a great place stay  Was very pleased with base stay  The room  though very small  was comfortable  Stayed in   different rooms there  on different legs of the same trip    two of the rooms were very clean and the third  maybe in an older part of the hotel  had had some water damage  but was acceptable The bathrooms  with power showers  were wonderful  And the toiletries provided were very nice  The kitchenettes were helpful and most useful for the budget traveler  like me  Also very much appreciated free web access in the rooms The location  near Earl s Court Tube station  and a ks  amp  Spencer  OddBins  Boots  A couple of good bakeshops and pubs   was great  The staff was exceptionally helpful and friendly  I would definitely stay there again  
P =>   Great Place ided to stay here at the last minute  GBP     for twin double    we were not disappointed   while the room was small  which rooms in London aren t  it meet our needs with faclities to have food in the room to save a few bucks  The service received from the front desk was the best I ve ever had   every question was answered with a smile and when they didn t know it   they looked it up and called back   that s service  It had a great big screen TV which included free access to the internet  provided you used the remote or the keyboard  no mouse  in the room    that was a bonus once one learned how to nagigate without a mouse  you can use your laptop too but there was a charge for that   they said they only charged a small fee for local calls but I don t remember any fees and we used it alot  The area of Earls Court is nice   stayed there on other occasions and have always felt safe and there are lots of people around the main street   this hotel is   minute walk from the tube and trust me     women with   weeks of France London under our belt   it was nice that it was only the   block     There is a lift in the event one needs it  it was a bonus with the luggage  I have pictures which I will post as soon as I get them uploaded  While there are less expensive hotels nearby   but if your looking for a more modern  updated  clean  well taken care of  fridge  mirowave  sink  dishes etc and great service   then stay here   you won t be disappointed  
P =>  fabulous base stay Base Stay was a great place for my son and myself to say while I was working nearby for a week  it was well equipped  clean and nicely furnished  plus it is easily accessible to the city and staff were friendly  We loved the shower   it was by far the best we had in over a month of travelling  
P =>   perfect base to stay I stayed here with a colleague for a week while on a business trip  The location was perfect  only a   minute walk to Earls Court tube  and really safe and quiet but with plenty of amenities near by  The room was small but reasonable for london  The furnishings were modern and the hotel was well presented  The free internet available on the tv took a while to get used to but was great for checking internet banking and other simple tasks  The plug in internet was faster but more expensive  Wireless is not available but would be a great addition  The kitchenette was great for our usually rushed DIY breakfasts  Cleaning was immaculate  Staff were fantastic and very helpful even with unusual requests such as for bandaids and stamps  Overall  this was a perfect base and I will definately stay again as it was great value for money  
P =>   Great small hotel but room for improvement This is my personal choice when staying in London  Small  but efficient rooms with small kitchenette  great location  close to the Tube  quite location  not too expensive  what more could you desire  I stayed here before  just after the grand opening  and noticed two minor glitches  First  the mattress in my room could use replacement  I stayed in room       as I informed the management after the first night  Got no response though  Second  maintenance could do better in bathrooms  as    seconds after you turn on the shower  you find yourself standing in   cm of water  Otherwise  great choice  
P =>   Best Kept Secret     Great modern  amp  chic hotel with excellent location    mins from Earl s Court Tube  with lots of restaurants around   Super friendly staff  Staff went out of their way to make sure they answer your questions  The room was very very clean  Great facility inside the room    flat screen TV  high tech bathroom  and also include a very equiped kitchen  The hotel is very energy saving friendly  which is a total plus   The only suggestion I have is that it will be EVEN better if there is free wireless Internet  
P =>  Fantastic I was actually booked in the BW shaftesbury kensington who were shambolic  However they sent me here  Thankyou    Staff were great  the place was immaculate and quiet  Really handy for the tube and seemed quite safe The room was small but functional and big enough for a short visit  Inside the wardrobe was a surprise as I found a microwave  sink and a fridge  It would be quite handy if you were staying here whilst working for the week I would absolutely stay here again  
P =>   Modern hotel convenient location good value I stayed here for   nights from Sunday to Thursday  Overall I would highly recommend this hotel and I would definitely stay here again Accessibility  Earl s Court tube stop is the nearest one to the hotel  If you are flying in and out of Heathrow  this is ideal as it is on the same line  Piccadilly  and no transfer is needed  Once at Earl s Court  there is an elevator and ramps so very easy with luggage  From there the hotel is about   blocks away  The hotel itself has an elevator as well Facilities  As other reviewers have commented  the hotel and rooms are done up to modern and minimalist standards  and although the room I was in  single room        was small  the space was used efficiently and the layout worked very well  The bathroom was full sized  which I am sure is appreciated by all travelers  The kitchenette came in useful and I saved some money by food shopping and storing breakfast items in the fridge Area  Earl s Court Road  which is the tube stop exit  is full of shops  cafes and restaurants  Somerfield supermarket  ks and Spencer Simply Food  Boots  Starbucks  Coffee Republic  Wagamama  to name a few  The only comments I would make   and this is more so for management than travelers   is to consider changing the mattresses as the one I had felt very worn and is probably due for a replacement  I also noticed that the housekeeping staff replaced my towels everyday even when I hung them  as instructed in order to save on water energy   
P =>  Pretty darn good  The hotel was very clean and the staff very nice  Accomdations were small compared to most American hotels I ve stayed in  but we had the right amount of space  The only complaint I have is that there were crumbs on the plates in the cupboard  Other than that one little item  our stay was superb  staff were helpful and location was great  I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others  
P =>  Great Hotel Great Area of London This is a wonderful hotel  We stayed for   days  two adults  one child  It is clean  ultra modern and comfortable  We had a double with a pull out chair for our daughter  The beds are very comfortable and the airconditioning was used every day during our stay  It was nice to have the option to open the windows during the day and have the air on at night for sleeping  The kitchenette was adqueate  however our rails were missing so we couldn t fill it like we wanted to and there is no toaster or coffee maker  The lift is small but excellent and much appreciated when you have children  Check in and Check out were efficient and fast  The hotel accommodated us for an early check in and tried to accommodate us for one night when the double room was not available by providing two singles  which we should have agreed to instead of moving to another apartment complex for one night    The Hotel staff were very professional and efficient  There was only a slight blip when we went to check in again for the balance of our stay and the room was not available for us as we were told it would be before we left  The staff who were on that day realized we were unhappy and rallied together to get us into a room so we could get over to the theatre district in time for our play The rooms are small but comfortable and the bathroom is larger than you would see in most London hotels  The half shower door is a little perplexing and water will be squirting out the side all over the floor if you aren t careful with the shower head  The heated towel holder is a luxury I wouldn t expect in a small hotel and would have traded it in for a toaster or coffee maker  The maids are excellent and quickly brought items that we needed  iron board  iron  The staff is very attentive and were helpful in picking restaurants  finding transportation  booking venues   The internet is difficult to figure out so if you really want access to all your mail addys   there are lots of little internet cafes close by where you can book venues online   check your mail etc    We used the internet mainly to read mail  check the weather etc  The free TV internet freezes occasionally and is very cumbersome to use as all the mouse features are on the keyboard  The staff did try to help out to show how to use it but it was slow and cumbersome  Keep in mind that you cannot compose on yahoo mail as it uses flash and you cannot open pdf files if you are looking on tourist sites  You can compose mail on facebook so this worked out fine  If you bring a laptop  this would be ideal but keep in mind they charge for that    You are a close proximity to Earls Court Tube    minute walk  and to two really great grocery stores  TESCO and Sainsbury s  The restaurant recommendations are excellent and getting the discount really was appreciated  Go to the Greek restaurant they recommend   it s the best Greek food I have ever eaten anywhere  Wagamama s is fun too    great for kids   and the Italian restaurant was superb You will be pleased with your stay at Base stay   it s a lovely residential area and it s easy to get around using the tube and bus system If we go back to London   we will stay at Base stay    but if the hotel could just bring in a toaster     I can certainly drink tea instead of coffee for my caffeine fix but I really missed having toast or crumpets for breakfast as did my daughter who is used to this as a part of her morning meal I hope this hotel keeps their pricing moderate    it is really on the edge of affordable with the exchange rate to pounds  
P =>   Great place to stay My husband and I recently stayed at this hotel with our three children  We loved this hotel  The location was great and very close to the tube  There were several restaurants in the area and grocery stores  The hotel offers     off coupons for many of the restaurants  The kitchenette was extremely handy  We booked two rooms  one superior for our three children and a king double for my husband and myself  The rooms  although small were very well appointed  The bathroom and shower were great  The beds and linen were also very nice quality  The two rooms were connected by a large patio outside with two tables and plenty of chairs  The weather was great in London  so we took advantage of eating our breakfasts outside  The staff were very friendly  pleasant and helpful  The free internet was also handy  The only problem was that my husband could not connect with his personal e mail account The hotel is very clean and well maintained I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again when I return to London  
P =>   Wonderful Place to Stay  My husband and I stayed at Base stay twice during y  Everything was exactly as described on their website  The hotel is located in a quiet neighborhood    just minutes away from the Earls Court tube station  The rooms are very clean and comfortable  During one stay  we had a little patio outside our room  The staff were very friendly and helpful  In our opinion  base stay rates a  quot perfect     quot  
P =>   Would come back here  Small clean rooms in a perfect location  Located near the Earls Court tube stop   so its easy access anywhere  The very small room had everything you needed  a fridge  tea  microwave  and internet access in the room via a flat screen TV  Very deco in decor  Lots of great restaurants within walking distance and a very safe suburban neighborhood  We would come back here  London was so expensive for American s that this was a nice break for us  
P =>   Great Hotel Definitely coming back  I stayed at Base Stay for four nights last month with my girlfriend while visiting London  The hotel is located right near a major transportation hub that gives you easy access to London s amazing bus and subway systems  so it was incredibly easy for us to get around the city  The hotel was immaculately clean and  although the rooms aren t huge  everything is laid out in a thoughtful manner so the space is far more  functional  than your ordinary hotel room  I loved the modern design and generally appreciated the attention to detail   nice flat screen TV s  outlets for cell phones  computers  etc  a little kitchenette to save money on breakfast  We did a lot of research before choosing this place  and I can t imagine finding a better value for your money  London is getting SO expensive and Base Stay just gives you far more  bang for the buck  than any other hotel  I highly recommend this place and will definitely stay there again when I come back to London  
P =>  More than just a base to stay   I chose to book here for my stay in y    on a recommendation from another trip advisor member  After reviewing all of the positive comments  I really wasn t worried at all and neither should you be  This hotel is everything it says it is and more  I did have one issue and will only point it out since it underscores the helpfulness of the staff  I was under the impression that I could use my own hairdryer and straigtener if i had an adaptor converter since it had worked in Spain  France and Italy  Turns out that with London that isn t the case as I suspect it didn t really have to do with the hotel since I ve heard similar stories from people visiting London from North America  Anyway  my straigtener broke and I blew the fuse in the room  The staff were very attentive to fix the problem and to even direct me to another room that was empty so that I could dry my hair  This time I would use the hairdryer that they supply and its no dinky hairdryer   its quite good for a hotel to provide   it even had a nozzle which makes blowdrying easier I only have a few recommendations for the manager   I notice that the sink in the washroom didn t seem to drain very well so perhaps he might want to check on that  I also noticed that the shower would turn off after a while of using it as would the internet tv  I assume its a conservation mechanism and Im all for that except that when you are in the middle of an email it can be quite annoying especially since the keyboard is quite difficult to use to begin with  I was really just thankful to have free internet so its not a big issue but I figure constructive criticism is good  In sum  if you go to London and want a reasonable place to stay  look no further because I don t believe you will get better value for your money anywhere else  
P =>   Very nice  We stayed at this hotel for four nights  two adults and a small child  We loved it  The hotel is nice  modern  pleasant staff and very convenient  The rooms are small  but that was expected in London  Easy walking distance to the tube and grocery stores coffee shops  We walked to the museums nearby and thought the neighborhood was very pretty and quiet  We had a family room on the ground level and were pleased that it also had a private patio  a nice plus  Would highly recommend this hotel  London was unseasonably hot the week we were in town and I was very happy that I booked a hotel with air conditioning  
P =>   Great Place for a Great Price This is our second stay within   months  The first time  we stayed for   nights in a  quot standard double quot   The room was just the right size for two people  Although  you definitely need the space under the bed for your luggage to have any room to move  During our second stay  we stayed for   nights in a  quot double twin quot  room  The room was almost twice the size of the  quot standard double quot   Place was always immaculately clean  The in room internet access was handy  but it did take some getting used to and you can t view PDF files with it  Location was great as it was a short   min walk to the nearest Tube stop  Earl s Court  and a ton of restaurants  There are also two handy self serve laundry facilities nearby  on the same street as the tube stop  As long as the quality is kept  we don t think we ll be using any other place whenever we visit London One quirky observation  during our first stay we saw the same faces in the front desk and even saw them training a new person upon check in  Six months later  we didn t see any of the same people and this time they were training another new person upon check in  What s with the complete turnover of staff within   months  
P =>   Good place for exploring London I stayed at this hotel for nearly   weeks at the end of   It seems the hotel is run by French speaking people  but they do try to be friendly and helpful  Every thing is clean and not too much the worse for wear  The hotel is very conveniently located to the Earl s Court tube station and there are several supermarkets within a few blocks My room was in the basement  which seems to be the case everywhere for singles  but there was little noise from any of the other rooms or floors  The kitchenette was good for its purpose  although don t count on making any ice in the frige  It would take several days for the water to freeze and they claim to clean out the ice tray after every guest  but the one in my frige looked like it hadn t been cleaned in a very long while  The free internet is on the TV and a little cumbersome to use  but for a small fee there is a direct hook up for laptops  The desk was a little small for its multipurpose intention  desk  nightstand  table   The bathroom was very spacious  but the lighting was a little weird and the layout makes it very difficult to get within more than   feet from the mirror  The shower was great   good pressure and plenty of hot water  The power in the room won t work without the key card in its little slot  but at least it keeps you from losing the card  Infact  the only problem I had was that my key card was consistently inconsistent  I had to have it re keyed about every other day  I know that they reuse these cards  but I do think that there is a limit on how many times a card can be reused  My purpose wasn t to spend a lot of time in my room  and everything worked well while I was there  Overall  a good experience and a good location  
P =>   no regrets      My son and I stayed here in y of this year  We tried   different rooms  One with twin beds and the other being the bunk beds  Both rooms had the same amenities  Given the chance to return to this hotel I would chose to stay my whole time in the bunk bed room  The beds were just as comfortable as the other but the cost would have been less  My son is    and had no problem sleeping or climbing to the top bunk  Other than that I would just like to repeat what others have said in relation to the hotel itself  The staff was helpful  hotel was clean and well care for  location was close to the tube and many nice restaurants nearby  Our favorite was Zizi s just by the Earls Court tube and a   minute walk from the hotel  Best Italian restaurant I ve been to and would definitely return  One suggestion would be that a person should take in the wonderful museums close by and within walking distance  We really enjoyed London and all its charms  
P =>  Nice Amenities   Location is Not Teriffic Ater reading all the raves about Base Stay  we decided to book a few night s stay for part of our month long visit to England this year  As previous guests have stated  the rooms are equipped with modern  clean decor and amenities  such as air conditioning  a kitchenette  and luxurious towels and bed sheets  Our double room was indeed tiny  and after a few nights  we were glad to be departing for larger digs  as we found the room to be too small to stay in for any duration while awake  There s just one chair  so if two people do want to eat in the room  with the microwave  fridge  etc   it seems guests are encouraged to do so     then one person must sit on the bed and squeeze into a tiny space by the desk table The location of the hotel is the factor that will keep us from returning  Yes  it s close to the Earl s Court tube station  and a ks  amp  Spencer mini grocery and a Starbucks  etc   but it isn t really within walking distance of anything besides the retailers on Earls Court Rd  If you enjoy parks  museums  walks with LondonWalks  etc   then you must rely on public transport to get where you want to go  The immediate area around the hotel is residential  so there s nowhere for a hotel guest to be except in their tiny room or in a restaurant Starbucks on Earl s Court Road  As for the Earls Court tube   it s fine as long as it s up and running  We met with delays and suspension of service more than once at this station  which  by the way  requires users to be really clear about the directions they re heading if wanting to travel on the Circle line  We observed perplexed visitors as well as locals at this station  due to unclear directions  Gloucester Road and South Kensington tube stops became our preferred means of transport on the Circle or District lines  
P =>   Best nights sleep EVER in a London Hotel We went to a concert at the O  and were concerned at the suitability of the hotel as regards transport accessibility We needed have no concerns as it is   mins walk from Earls Court tube The room we had was quiet and good  facilities which included fridge microwave etc were excellent Bathroom with powerful shower  great Staff welcoming and profferred advice such nice a change I have stayed in many London hotels with mixed experiences but I can say that THIS was probably the BEST On top of that the concert  Neil Diamond  was fantastic 
P =>   Excellent hotel I have stayed at this hotel twice  and each stay has been faultless  The rooms are clean and modern  and the bathrooms have a real luxurious feel to them  Upon arrival the staff were really efficient and helpful  and I had checked in within   minutes  The air conditioning in the rooms is good  and everything was very clean  The rooms also have microwaves  small kitchenettes  cutlery and sinks  The hotel is well designed  and feels like a    or    place In terms of facilities  the hotel offers free internet through the TVs  which also have    digital channels  music  radio and pay films     each   All in all  everything feels like value for money  The hotel doesn t have a restaurant  but guests can have a decent  breakfast box  delivered to their room in the morning for just under     It was fine  with cereal  fruit  muesli bar and fruit juice  I actually quite liked not having to get dressed before eating The hotel is very close to Earls Court tube  so if you are in town for anything on the Piccadilly or District Lines its well placed Overall  recommended without hesitation  
P =>   A gem of a hotel  I have stayed at this hotel four times on business trips to London and it is consistently excellent  The concept is one of  quot limited luxury quot  which basically means that unnecessary expensive extras are dispensed with in favour of excellent core facilities such as clean and stylish rooms and bathrooms etc  The location is excellent for exploring central London since the Piccadilly Line is only minutes away at either Gloucester Road or Earls Court Tube stations  The surrounding area is packed full of bars and restaurants and the rooms even have galley kitchen facilities if you prefer to cook  I ve stayed in many different London hotels over the years and this is the best by a long way  It would always be my first choice for business or leisure trips due to its unique combination of value for money and comfort  
P =>  Great Choice Our group of   stayed at Base Stay in late e for   nights as part of our European vacation  We had   rooms  triples   One room was on the lower ground and the other on the first floor  The rooms were modern  clean  quiet  and very pleasant  The kitchenette was very convenient  The presence of a small fridge  microwave  kettle  plates  and utensils made our visit to London much easier  since we were able to have breakfast in our rooms  This saved a lot of time in the mornings so we could head out earlier to enjoy London  It also made things easier for evening snacks etc The location of the hotel is very good  It is on the Piccadilly line  direct from Heathrow   so taking the Underground Tube from the airport to the hotel was very easy and economical  The Tube station  quot Earl s Court quot  is a   minute walk  The area felt safe  The hotel is in a mostly residential area with some other hotels and shops mixed in Earl s Court Rd  were you exit from the tube  has many little stores and places to eat  including Subway sandwiches  Baker s oven  and other fast food   ks  amp  Spencer Simply Food was an especially convenient little grocery store  You can purchase items for breakfast the night before  It also has a wide selection of ready to eat meals  not frozen  that can be microwaved in your room is you choose  Barclay s bank ATM machines and a post office are directly across the street from the Earl s Court Tube station  There is coin laundry on a nearby street  This was useful for us as we needed to do laundry before continuing our vacation in Paris The location was great for taking the tube to most of London s biggest attraction sites  This is very important because you can totally eliminate the need for taking expensive taxis  Earl s Court tube station has   key lines  Picadilly and District  and the underground system is extremely easy to use We had   minor incoveniences at this hotel which were corrected during our first evening there  The bathtub shower drains extremely slowly  this was the case in both of our rooms   The staff used a liquid product in the drain to improve this and it was better by the next day  The fridge was unplugged in both rooms  and it took a long time to cool it down  We realized this only after doing our groceries  so check to make sure your fridge is plugged in when you first check in  The plug is behind the garbage can inside the kitchinette closet Overall we were very happy with Base Stay I hope this review is useful  Enjoy your trip  
P =>  Great comfort superb value I recently stayed at Base stay in London for a week and I loved it  I have stayed in many hotels but I have never experienced such a welcoming  accommodating and charming staff  The hotel is also beautiful  very Zen like  My room offered every amenity I needed including a c  a mini kitchen  which is a real bonus in an expensive city like London  a large flat screen TV and easy to connect internet for my notebook  the bed was so comfortable that despite a   hour time difference with the US  I did not feel as jetlagged as I usually do  I travel to London quite often and this was the first time I stayed at Base stay  however  it won t be the last  I truly enjoyed my time there and will  without hesitation  make it my hotel of choice each time I visit this beautiful city  
P =>   What a gem  Spent   nights here in        Took the Tube from Heathrow after a long flight from Australia  Just a short walk up the road to Base Stay  Staff were friendly and helpful  The room on the second floor was smallish but beautifully modern and very smart  The bathroom was superb with modern appliances and all the amenities of a five star hotel  The small kitchen is a huge bonus  If you don t want to eat out in London  and who would  you can buy whatever from the nearby supermarket and do your own in room catering  This place is a gem  I have already recommened it to two other people who have made bookings  
P =>   I can t wait to stay here again  A previous reviewer wrote that  while they enjoyed the hotel  they felt that it was too far  My husband and I chose base stay for our week long stay in ch and felt that the location was superb  For one  the hotel was down the street from the underground station  Since we flew in out of Gatwick  we had a bit of a trip to make  However  we chose to use the tube to Victoria and catch the Gatwick Express to from the airport  This could not have been any quicker or easier  even with suitcases and classic London weather The Kensington area is full of food options  We had no problem with finding breakfast lunch dinner each day of our stay  In addition  because we were so close to the tube  Earls Court   the ride into the city center was quick and painless  Of course  if one is looking for touristy things to do  Kensington might not be the first choice  It s a neighborhood with a quiet and chill vibe  However  my husband and I were specifically looking for a hotel that would be away from the tourist areas and in a quiet  livable area  We certainly were not disappointed The hotel itself was wonderful  Besides the fact that the front desk was really warm and friendly upon our arrival  they always greeted us as we were entering and leaving the building  Additionally  the housekeeping staff was very attentive and nice throughout our stay  I also appreciated the fact that there was a vending machine that was reasonably priced Without a doubt  I will be staying at base stay on my next trip to London  I wish that I could find a few of these over in the States     
P =>   quite happy Based on the hotel s website  and the reviews on TripAdvisor  I chose base stay for my recent visit to London  I was not disappointed  The room was very clean  and while my single was quite snug  it had everything I needed   I especially enjoyed the kitchenette feature  as I could sleep in a bit  and have a late breakfast on my own schedule  The maid would do the washing up every day  I also appreciated the beautiful shower  and the high ceilings  The curtain rods made an excellent place to dry laundry The room comes with a booklet filled with information on how the  quot mod cons quot  work  and also  information on local resources  such as supermarkets  I especially liked the new Sainsbury s  it s huge The hotel is only a block from Earls Court tube stop  and I discovered that there are no stairs walking to the Picadilly platform  which is great if you re toting luggage on your way to Heathrow The keyboard you use to access the internet is a little tricky  but I eventually got the hang of it  I was emailing friends and family almost every day  simply because it was convenient  I also liked listening to the BBC Radio on the telly My room overlooked a mews  and I enjoyed watching the locals come and go from their homes there When I checked into the room  I discovered a window that wouldn t close  and the maintenance man came in quite quickly to fix it  He may have nailed it shut permanently  I just knew I felt safer  I also had some trouble with the card key  and a few times  I had to have it zapped again at the front desk before I could get into the room The hotel was quiet  I could hear people moving and talking sometimes  but nothing loud  There are several restaurants in the neighborhood  and there s another tube stop  Gloucester Road  a few blocks away  I will definitely consider base stay for my next visit to London     
P =>   Perfect price  I stayed at base stay three times in  e and found it to be the perfect London accommodation for many reasons  It s only a a block to the Earl s Court underground station  which is linked directly to Heathrow airport via the Picadilly line  much cheaper than Heathrow Express or a taxi  and there s an elevator at the station so no carrying suitcases up down stairs   There s a ks  amp  Spencer food store  drugstore  laundromat  pubs  restaurants and other stores by the station  Best of all is the hotel itself   the clean rooms and helpful staff  The rooms are small  this is Europe  after all   but everything is pristine white and the windows are huge so there s lots of light  the windows open and they have both heavyweight blinds and curtains   The bathrooms  with large showers  have lots of room for toiletries and the towels are big and thick  There s a compact kitchen in every room with microwave  fridge  sink  dishes  plus a kettle and instant coffee and real milk  The flat screen TV comes with a keyboard and free internet access  my fave    There s a safe  hairdryer  phone and alarm clock  The reception and cleaning staff are friendly  very professional and always ready to help  What s the downside  The rooms are tight for   people with lots of stuff  the closets are small  but there s space under the beds for suitcases   There s no food service  no restaurant or breakfast room   They could use a separate room to hold luggage before after check in out  they do hold it though  in the reception area  I ran into the Manager  a very pleasant  talkative man  and told him how much I liked the hotel  He said it was a new concept and the low prices depended on giving clients the best essentials and cutting out high cost items like food service  It works for me and friends of mine who recommended the hotel to me  We plan on making it our regular  base   stay  in London  
P =>   clean but far far from everything We stayed at the base stay just for   nights in il We lost a lot of time being stuck in traffic because the hotel is off the spot  Theathers and attractions are all at the other end of town  The rooms were clean  nice and quiet  There is a supermarket and Starbucks   min  walking distance from the hotel which is great for breakfast Another thing was that we asked the front desk to call us a cab to go to town before checking out  since we had to carry our luggage with us as the hotel is on the other side of town if you want to go to the airport but instead of a cab they called a private car for us which costed   times more than what a regular cab charges  That was not nice  so beware  
P =>   Highly Recommended    Staying in London has never been so great  The rooms at BASE STAY are wonderfull  stylish furniture  comfortable beds and everything is so clean and tidy  It was a pleasure to stay at this hotel  The POWER SHOWER in my room was excellent after a busy day  I really slept well in my comfortable  quiet room  The staff was very very friendly  too  This hotel is my first choice in London    I can highly recommend this place  FELIX 
P =>   Expectations Exceeded  I monitored the reviews for base stay on TripAdvisor for two months  I give the hotel and staff all the high marks that previous guests provided  Comfort  value  amenities and location      we looked for a quiet property with a lift that had comfortable beds  base stay was our choice  We stayed at the hotel for a total of eight days this month and were very satisfied with the room and the hotel staff  Vinny helped us with our restaurant plans and etc and his follow up to make sure our visit was enjoyable  The other staff were also very professional and responsive  As one who travels alot  I highly recommend base stay to anyone thinking of making their plans to stay in the Kensington area               
P =>   A fantastic hotel My husband and I really enjoyed our time at base stay  We stayed for five nights in a standard double room at the beginning of   Our room was well designed and beautifully decorated in a clean simple way  The size of the room didn t bother us as we expected rooms in London to be small  Our favourite feature was the mini kitchen and the fact that it was cleaned daily  The hotel is in a very convenient area with many restaurants and the Earl s Court tube station down the street  We also found the nearby ks amp Spencer Simply Food and the Boots pharmacy to be really handy The members of the staff were polite  friendly  and helpful  They helped us with understanding train information and how to dial a number in the UK  
P => 
P => Warning     Reception staff where polite  but demoralised by the constant barrage of unhappy customers complaints and demanding there money back The dining room seem to have know training at all  it was like they had all started that morning it was just chaos The location was good local to the bus routes and underground  and a quite square The reception area was clean but needed up dating  however once out of the reception area you where confronted by heavily stained carpets and the very poorly maintained state of the hotel The rooms where very dated and in a poor state  with broken furniture  the door lock was broken as well as number of other things  the linen was clean however because of the general state of the room i cant say felt at home or comfortable in the rooms The worst and most dangerous fault was on opening the draws between the beds dangling in the draws where live electrics  which where uninsulated and a real threat to life Cant say i ever complain about anything but really you will ruin your break if you stay here  this is not a cheap hotel and it just strikes me that the owners of this hotel are taking there guests for a ride and will continue all the time they can get away with it  and clearly dont care They have staffed the hotel with people who have probably never had a days training who they obviously dont care about either  and i think thats who i probably feel sorry for     
P =>   Good location and value Wee rooms and Old but with character Having read the mixed reviews and contacted somebody who gave a favourable review  we went with info and an open mind  First impression  good location easily found following tripadvisor directions and lovely quiet area  Chap on desk helpful when we asked for a twin with a bath  instead of double with shower which was very small  In the basement but lovely and fresh and recently refurbished  Yes breakfast was rolls butter and jam  Hot breakfast could be purchased and alll very cheap  However you can get the usually fruit cheese  yoghurt at Tesco s on the Queensway by the Bayswater tube station  Or lovely Greek deli  The Bayswater Inn  does snacks  lunches and evening meals  never had any but super prices  and the bar is open until midnight unlike the pubs around about that shut at   pm Lovely and warm but might be too hot in the summer probably need a fan  Super value for London  Just a base to see the shows and the tourist stuff  
P =>   Simply somewhere reasonable to get your head down for the night   little else I stayed here after landing at Heathrow and I simply wanted somewhere cheap to sleep to break up my journey   after reading the reviews on here I was not expecting anything special and  inkeeping with that expectation  it was ok  Nothing more nothing less  I paid     which I think was really good value for a central London hotel with breakfast  this was just fresh bread rolls with butter and preserves  juice  coffee  tea  but it filled the gap for me   It had the feel of a youth hostel with people standing outside smoking when I arrived and general basic facilities on offer  The tea and coffee facilities in the room were a bit of a let down with polystyrene cups and sachets of milk creamer but I really appreciate that this sort of cost cutting is the thing that enables them to keep the cost down to their customers so cannot criticize them really  Internet access in foyer small fee payable  The shower was very basic and old fashioned but I would stay again if I was in the same position  Overall this hotel is basic for basic needs and that s not necessarily a bad thing in my opinion  
P =>  It was nice We have been there for three dayes  As a matter of fact  this hotel is fine with respect to the low price    
P =>  Excellent value for what you pay for Not the Hilton but not a dump  If you want a cheap hotel stay that is close to tube station Bayswater    mins walk with no frills then this is your hotel  Stayed there for   nights staff were friendly but if you dont expect a lot then this is where to go  Bed for the night and breakfast the following morning  Breakfast is poor enough so be advised to buy from local Tesco  The literature you are given is photocopied  hotel info table menus  so if your sensitive about these things then its not the place for you  Room is small and there is a TV and tea coffee making facilities  There is towels and soap for your shower  The bar is open till   pm  
P =>   Pluses and minuses Excellent location  Access to two tube lines  Circle and District  Access to two tube stations  Bayswater and Queensway  Nearby ethnic food  Whiteley s Shopping Centre  three groceries  ks  amp  Spencer  plus two Tesco s  Boots Pharmacy  laundry and pubs Downside  bring shampoo  none provided  Breakfast continental  breads and drinks  Buy fresh fruits cheeses from grocery or order eggs ham from hotel  Bring earplugs to dampen street noise  If need internet  go to internet cafe  
P =>   Good value for location basic hotel We stayed at the hotel on a Sunday night and got a fantastic rate of     B amp B  The hotel is   mins walk from the station in a good neighbourhood  safe and quiet with all the bars and restaurants just around the corner  The staff were pleasant enough  thelady in the Bar was friendly  helpful and efficient and deserves a special mention  The public areas are clean and functional  Our room was small  but this is very normal for London hotels and unless you pay for suite in a   star hotel you aren t going to get a lot of square footage  You will need to bring shampoos  shower gel etc as the hotel only provides soap  but our bathroom was clean and no maintenance issues  Unfortunately our mattress was like a trampoline  so I didn t get the best night s sleep  But that is my only complaint  Yes  breakfast was very basic but it fills a gap and the rolls and coffee were fresh  If you want a larger room with fluffy towels  luxury bathroom amentites and   star service  then you need to pay for it  But if you are in London to see the sights  then don t waste it sitting in a hotel room complaining about the choice of tv channels   sit in one of the beautiful parks  see the fabulous historic sights  have a cocktail in a trendy bar  go to a free museum  take a walk along Embankment  
P => That can t be a    hotel On the internet the hotel looks very good and also the woman on the phone was very helpful and answered all my questions  The location of the hotel is very good for a city trip  It s just a few minutes walk to the tube  I booked a special offer rate which was not too bad for a London city hotel  but for the price we would have expected more  Our rooms  we had two  were in the basement  Very dark and not very friendly looking  The bathroom urgently needs refurbishing  it seem that it can t get totally clean anymore  The temperature of the shower seemed to be connected to the force of the water coming out  so showering without washing your hair wasn t possible because warm water ment a flood coming down the showerhead  The breakfast was ridiculous  We had continental breakfast included  What it was  a breadroll  butter and jam  Nothing else  And the coffee and hot chocolate were both not good  We were very disappointed and after the first night we didn t really want to go back there    
P =>   Floods and Famines in London We were a family of four   my parents  myself and my sister  We were assigned a room in basement  The shower floods  The room was boiling   opening the window doesn t help as it is a basement room and all you see is a wall when you open the window  At breakfast it s easily a scene you witness on news report about famine   although with better dressed and healthier looking individuals   hoards of people swarm towards the few bread baskets with bread  If you are lucky you arrive at the breakfast room when they had just refilled the bread baskets and you find bread there  If you don t  you mill around the bread baskets until they refill them  which could be   minutes upwards  d After you d found your bread you repeat the same procedures with orange juices   coffee   tea   hot choc  The breakfast fills you up    by getting you feeling fed up for having to fight for food you had paid for We had stayed in one star hotels in Paris with better services  Enough said  
P =>   Basic   OK Good location near Circle  amp  District tube lines for access to many London sites  Room basic but OK  Continental breakfast lots of bread and rolls  with even more bread and rolls  No cold meats or fruit  Had room on first floor  Guests can leave luggage in luggage room prior to checkin and after checkout  Still had a good time in London  
P =>   Location is the only plus This hotel is unacceptable by most standards  Motel   is luxurious compared to this place  Its only benefit is its location  Accommodations are very basic   a paper mat in the bathroom      the  quot continental breakfast quot  consists of bread and jam  There was no AC and we unfortunately got to London during a heat wave  At least they offered us a fan  The staff does not seem interested in addressing the issues  The price is too high for what is offered  Accross the street my friends stayed at a much better room  
P =>   Cheap and basic average hotel I stayed at the  nd floor  and the room was generally clean and basic  The warm water tap of the shower was defect  Breakfast was sober but ok  Brown or white bread rolls  jam  coffee  tea or chocolate milk  orange juice  The location is just great  Bayswater is certainly the best location in London to stay  and it is also near to   subway stations and shopping malls  Staff was generally helpful and kind  but they seemed somewhat distant  It s an old hotel  so the rooms and corridors are small  This is a good hotel if you need a cheap hotel in the city centre  only to sleep at night  There is a   h desk and it feels secure  This is not a good hotel for elderly or disabled people  or those who like to enjoy some luxury  For younger or not very demanding guests  it is perfect  You get what you pay for  
P =>  Not nearly as bad as the bad reviews describe it  A friend and I booked this hotel as part of a package  and having read the reviews here on Tripadvisor  we were expecting the worst  However  we were pleasantly surprised  Our room and bathroom was clean and perfectly acceptable with absolutely no sign of the mold in the bathrooms and carpets that others have experienced  We had a room on the  th floor   rd floor G B   which had a lovely view of a church  The room was quiet  except for the other people staying in the hotel who allowed their doors to slam shut whenever they came and went  The location was great  it was in a quiet neighborhood and yet a   min  walk from all the wonderful restaurants and cafes of Bayswater and the Bayswater tube stop  I could see how a basement room here could be abyssmal as we had to store our luggage in a tiny room across from the basement rooms    There was not much to the breakfast  tea  coffee  juice  rolls and jam but I was able to supplement with scrambled eggs for   pounds  The staff was on a good day  helpful and cheerful  and on a bad day  just ho hum  I wish there had been a refrigerator and AC in the room  but overall  it was perfectly fine place to stay and a good value for the money  
P =>  nice staff shame about the polystrene cups i booked with a travel agent  cost     pound per night for a room   adults  A   year old and one baby  corridors smealt musty  bathroom had papper bath mat and no safety rails in bath  bathroomed cleaned daily but didnt get fresh towels daily as stayed   days  sheets not changed daily but beds made daily  carpet wasnt hovered daily  but the thing that upset me the most was the tea and coffee faclitites  cheap and no real cups polysterene ones  that leked when you but hot water in   had to buy my own whilst staying  on a good note nice area and reception satff were lovely  the staff make the hotel   
P =>  Cheap and good location Very close to Baywater Tube in a semi touristy area but a couple blocks away so quiet and safe    Lots of cheap eateries nearby  It s inside Zone    which means it s fast to get around london  If you go in expecting hostel type conditions then you ll be pleased with it   Lots of space  good shower pressure  t v  quiet rooms  breakfast included   not sure what though  as never went to it    
P =>   nice and friendly hotel We stayed in room      from       march       I d read the reviews on this site and was very apprehensive  But as it turned out  our stay was wondeful  The hotel is located in Bayswater  just a short stroll from portobello market  and tubestations  The neighbourhood is lively  with lots of restaurants and pubs  The hotel is clean  the staff is friendly and the breakfast is adequate  It wasn t noisy at all  although another family that stayed on our floor made a nuisance of themselves  letting their hyperactive kids play in the hallway   The bed was a little too soft to our liking  but we slept well anyway  Room was cleaned every day  as was the small but functioning bathroom  There are two internet terminals in the lounge    pound for twenty minutes   It s a smoke free hotel  so smokers have to go outside  I used the ashtray that is mounted to the gate  but a lot of guests didn t  cig butts were cleaned off the pavement on a daily basis  Some guests used the stairs to the hotel entrance as their personal smoke lounge  but my swift kicks soon remedied that London is a wonderful city  and you could do much worse than stay in this centrally located and friendly priced hotel  I would recommend it  Will stay there again  
P =>  Hotel with   small stars Hotel with a good location  nice square  good value  clean  but small rooms  In overall I think it should be a   stars Hotel  
P =>   Non existent customer care  reservation not honoured  Don t book this hotel  The hotel dishonoured my laterooms reservation on arrival  very late at night   leaving me without accommodation  The hotel had processed my bank card pre authorisation incorrectly  I checked with my bank   The hotel manager said that they had cancelled the reservation but he would not show me the documentation to support that claim  I checked and Laterooms had not received any cancellation from the hotel   The hotel refused to discuss my complaint with Laterooms when they telephoned The hotel management blamed me  despite all of the evidence showing that they had simply made a series of mistakes themselves  eitful and incompetent   a sure recipe for failure and customer disappointment  
P =>  Convenient location but no wonderlodge What we liked about the Bayswater Inn      blocks from Tube  quiet area  okay price  luggage storage  pharmacy and restaurants of every kind   block away  two blocks from Grayline tour bus stop What we didn t like  beds  breakfast  desk staff  oldness of interior  All in all  okay for us because we don t like to spend too much on lodging  We like to be out and about most of the time  
P =>   what you can get in London for    euro Ok  for this hotel I have not paid too much so if you get really good deal you will have more money to spend on good food London is not inexpensive city and I wanted to save money the shower is very small  when I wanted to open the shower door I had to leave the bathroom and open the door then I came in and can walk into shower Yes  everything is very old  not clean and cheap  and yes  the service is from hell but I can not find any other hotel in London where I pay    euro and there is bed and toilet included in the room rate If I pay    euro I think I will sleep in the park on the bench  
P =>   what a shocking place to stay thanks Flight Centre The hotel where the toilet doesn t flush because the floor slops  The hotel where your feet are higher then your head because the floor slops  A dirty kettle  broken TV remote  The breakfast that is included is a joke  a singe type of bread roll  you must ask if you want toast  the rest is coffee  OJ  and tap water  If you want more you must pay  The best part is we booked a double and received   singles and when we explained that we booked a double they said sorry there is no more rooms left  There are room below the road but don t tell the management that they are in the basement because they aren t they are lower ground  But in the lift you must push the letter B  could that stand for basement  because if it doesn t shouldn t it read LG for lower ground    Don t get fooled by the photos  great Photoshop work  The best room in the hotel is the area just inside the front door but that only because you can turn around and leave  Thanks Flight Centre  Please do not stay here  London is beautiful don t have it upset by staying in a place like this  We did and we where popping sleeping tablets so we could sleep and go exploring around London the next day  This is not a fake review  
P =>  How did they get a single star    Paper bath mats  Yes  that s right   PAPER    Such quality   Rooms are absolutey filthy  Glasses with lipstick stains still clearly on the rim after   DAYS     Breakfast was     help yourself to   baskets full of STALE rolls  tea  amp  coffee with UHT milk     THAT quot S IT   Staff are about as rude as it is physically possible to be  Security is non existent  If you find Youth Hostels luxurious  you ll still think this place is a DUMP     
P =>  Don t go there  Where do I begin  I am fully aware that accommodation in London is outrageously expensive and you get what you pay for  However I have stayed in a range of budget accommodation in London including university student accommodation  youth hostels and B amp Bs and this hotel is by far the worst  My single room was located in the basement and was so small that my two suitcases covered the entire floor  And the shower and toilet were located in a cupboard  The room was also located next to a room full of pipes and I heard evey flush of every toilet and every turn of every tap   all night  I didn t even bother to stay for breakfast as judging by the hygene of the rooms I was certain that I would end up with dysentry if I ate there  The carpet in the room was so dirty that I dared not walk on the carpet bare foot in case my feet stuck to the floor  If you are on a budget I recommend that you look at hostels as an alternative to flushing your money down the toilet by staying at this hotel  
P =>  really good hotel for the money you pay really nice hotel if you want to see the city i think the most important thing to notice is where is this hotel really only   minutes walking from Bayswater underground station   from Queensway underground station and in a really nice area safe and with lot of nice place to eat something good the hotel looks very good when you go in it and i think is defenetly good for the money i ve spent compared to other hotels in london As suggested from other travellers i had a room on the  th floor really quiet maybe the only things that can be improved are dimension of bed and room a little tiny for a doubble breakfast is really basic if you want smt more is better to go out I really enjoied this hotel and i ll reccomend it to anyone who doesn t intend to spend there his whole day or is looking for a   stars the    hours reception was working well enough to allow us to go home at any time without problems hope you ll find this useful have a nice trip 
P =>  A very good hotel This hotel is great  The receptioniste and night receptionist  the waitresses and waiter in the restaurant  the cleaning lady of the room  where very friendly and helpful  Very interrested in what we had done every day  The room was every day very good cleaned and given fresh towels The English Breakfast was made for us every day fresh and very tasti When we go again to London  we surely will stay in this hotel  We thank everyone in the Hotel for a very pleasant and relaxed stay This hotel is wthin    min  walk from Queensway  where are nice shops  restaurants  pubs  supermarkets  internetcafe s and the Tube who brings You easy thtoughout whole London This Hotel is surelly recommandable    
P =>  Cheap Hotel Cheap Service We spent the last three days as a group of    odd school students and staff  The hotel overall treated us quite badly  however we were quite lucky and got a nice triple single bed room on the third floor  however other members of our party complained that they had been given horrific camp beds and bunk beds  On the first night the water went off as of   pm   and the TV reception was incredibly poor  The so called  quot Continental breakfast  quot  which is supposedly included consisted of only a burger bap with a selection of jam and drinks  to be honest you could get a better breakfast at McDonalds  One of the hotel s advantages is it s close proximity to the tube station and shops  Stairwells were very steep and lifts were slow and small  The basement is a maze  and could easily be confusing to anyone  The hotel is in nice surroundings  and first impressions of reception are great  however the corridors and rooms are in dire need or refurbishment  The bathroom was very basic  and had a very strange layout  for example the toilet roll holder being at the opposite end of the room to the toilet itself  The shower was very dangerous as it was slippery  when leaving the shower  The rooms seemed very claustraphobic  and lighting was only at one end of the room  Also  windows were very difficult to open  and there were two large  bulky iron radiators with sharp corners  my friend managed to hit his leg on it while opening the window and was left cut and bruised  These could especially be dangerous for small childern  There was small warning sign  however it was very difficult to read and was at ankle height  All in all  this hotel is not worthy of its three star status as i have been in numerous three star hotels which have much better locations  facilities and services  especially breakfast   The experience was poor and i would definitely not return  i was very glad i only had to endure this terrible ordeal for   nights  
P =>   Nope  Not great  Location is good  short walk to Kensington Palace  and the price is nice  but I got stuck into a basement room   not nice at all  It felt like an old workroom that had been converted to a hotel room  Right next to the building s pipes  so I heard every flush   cracked tile  leaky faucets  stained coverlets  I know  I know  you get what you pay for  but STILL  Perhaps some of the rooms upstairs are nicer  some of the other reviews seem to indicate so  Staff was friendly  I didn t spend much time there anyway  just slept and bathed  
P =>  Great hotel  I stayed with my parents  younger sister and younger brother in this hotel for a few nights  The only problem we faced during our stay was that the room we booked for me and my sister had a double bed that was very slim  Also it had only one big blanket which could be a problem if you re not used to it  With this exception the service was great for such a economically cheap alternative  It was close to great restaurants and a beautiful building  Though the hotel restaurant s food wasn t very good with quite few alternatives I recommend this hotel to those who want a pleasant stay in London without a hotel bill that cost the earth  
P => Nice Hotel Nice Area Nice Price I stayed here for   night sharing a triple room  First impressions were good  The hotel is quite grand in looks and is in a nice area close to shops  restaurants  amp  Hyde Park   Kensington Gdns  I found the lobby to be in keeping with a higher rated hotel Its quite a big hotel and there were a lot of European visitors stayingCar parking is for   hrs max where allowed  although a lot of spaces outside the hotel are for residents only  There is a car park on nearby Queensway    mins walk but its expensive at about     for    hrs The room was pretty standard  The   beds were quite slim but comfortable  There was no view from the room as we were in the basement  The picture on the small TV was a bit dodgy but we were not there to watch TV  There was also a Kettle  amp  Tea   Coffee which was quite handy  The bathroom was not the neatest but functional I did not use the in hotel bar but the prices seemed reasonable for the location at about        per pint The complimentary breakfast which consisted of   different types of rolls  butter  amp  various jams and Tea   Coffee was a bit basic but what do you expect at this price Surprising to get anything at all this cheap  There was a cooked breakfast available for about    but we did not use this The breakfast room was nicely decorated too with original artwork on the walls I found the staff at the reception to be smart and helpful Overall an excellent stay and I would not hesitate to recommend to others 
P =>   Central London For    Quid A Night For   People With Breakfast   Great Value Right people its time to get real here   This hotel ain t the Ritz but it ain t the Pitz either   It is unbelievably cheap    quid off Venere and   pound cheaper on Expedia   this is for   people a night with breakfast and in Central London   Come on   London is the  rd most expensive city in the world for hotels   this place is a bargain   You could live here for     pound a week   sharing with a breaky thrown in and no heating water cable tv bills   Please get a life   the average cost of renting a poky box room in a house in this area is about     quid a month and thats if your lucky  We got a perfectly clean  tidy and comfortable double room with ensuite bathroom   It was reasonably furnished  bit outdated maybe but we had a great nights sleep and breakfast was a bonus   not the worlds best but not the worst either   Eatable and filling  Hotel was in a great location  near shops bars and most important public transport   Would definatly stay here again  If you want luxury then pay luxury prices   Bed and breakfasts all over the uk that are no were near as good as this hotel are charging double its price a night for a room  honestly i thought it were a bargain for what we paid   and the telly worked     
P => Reasonable I looked on tripadvisor prior to booking and was a little concerned by some of the negative reviews  I do agree that this hotel is not  the Ritz  but for the     for a night I paid it represented good value  The room was clean and a reasonable size      even included a basic breakfast I would recommend this hotel if you are looking for somewhere inexpensive to spend a few nights in  It is situated well for all central London transport links   attractions  
P =>   Our introduction to London The Bayswater Inn Princes Square  London This hotel was a disappointment from start to finish Our travel agent assured us that this would be an ideal place to stay even though we made it clear that money was not an issue On our arrival at the Bayswater we were confronted by a sour faced receptiomist who looked like she  d take our heads off if we asked her for assisstance  We were given the wrong kind of room and it couldn t be swapped  even though the requested room had been booked well in advance  The room we received was dingy and small  there wre stains on the carpet and bed linen  The plumbing in the toilet was very rough as was the sealing job done around floors and fixtures  The toilet seat poorly fitted and the hand basin was not sitting straight on the wall The floor mat was a small sheet of paper  Poor drainage left the floor saturated for several hours whie it drained through a tiny hole in the wall The bath towels were not changed until the fourth day  The floor in the main room had a fall of about   cm which meant the you were lying level only when supported by a pillow  There were no spare pillows supplied  TV reception was poor and displayed only a few channels The alarm clock and the bed light were not working Foam cups and a couple of wooden stirrers were issued for making tea or coffee Breakfast consisted of a dry bread roll and a cup of coffee or juice  People who require extra food were greeted by rude  unhelpful waitresses and a chef who lost his temper and refused to cook for people who had ordered food after       even though finishing time is       There were not enough tables and chairs in the eating area and many of us had to wait for a long time  Such a disappointing introduction to such a great city  
P =>  Absolutely Awful  I had the unfortunate experience of staying in this tip of a place in the beginning of ember  The beds are simply the most uncomfortable I have ever stayed on  the  quot continental breakfast quot  is a bread roll  coffee  amp  vile orange juice  When I complained about the mattress on several occasions nothing was changed until my last night where the mattress was turned over  amp  a piece of wood stuck under one of the legs so the mattress didn t appear to be sloping so heavily  I have made a complaint through my travel booking company only to be informed that there are no reports of any complaints being made  I strongly advise everyone NEVER stay in this hotel as it is truly the worst I have ever stayed in  
P =>   Budget hotel no luxuries close to tube stations  We stayed at Bayswater Inn Hotel over Christmas      We arrived at   a m     a m  my own time   so I am sure any room having a bed or a large flat surface to sleep on would have looked lovely  However  I was genuinely pleased with our twin room   in my opinion  the twin rooms are LARGE It was also very pleasant that the windows faced the little garden in Princes Square and we could hear birds singing in the night There was central heating that worked  too  except we turned it off for the whole time and kept a window or two open  as we are used to a colder climate The shower was a bit tricky at first before I got how it worked   When you turned the tap thing  you were changing the water pressure AND the temperature at the same time  so colder water   less water pressure  hot water   higher water pressure    I learned to turn the shower on from BEHIND the shower curtain and fix the temperature  only then did I step in  Must say  the water pressure was the best I ve ever experienced in Great Britain  Also there was no brist of hot water Ok so there was only one towel each  and if you did not leave it on the floor  it was not changed  Yes and the paper  quot bath mat quot  was kind of funny as it did not absorb water   I know  I spilled some while on shower I would have preferred a pump bottle of soap to the small bar soaps  Yes  they were   unpacked small bar soaps  and they were not changed the whole time  Oh and I noticed some really small insects in the bathroom  Very very small and thin  reddish I think  Like miniature  thin ants  But  they did ot bother us and we did not bother them  And  to tell the truth  I think complaining at the fron desk would not have helped  Just a couple of them I THINK  not like it was infested The cleaners came in at   p m  every day  it was nice to come back to a made up room The linens were not changed after our arrival  but we only stayed for   nights  Usually when I have stayed in hotels for a week  they have changed them in the middle of my stay once The beds were large but weird   we were sleeping on the bed springs  In my country  beds consist of   or   mattresses  the top one s  are there for the very purpose of insulating yourself from the springs One thing I did not like was the floor to wall carpeting  which I find unhygienic as it can hide anything  and is certainly not washed as often as other floor materials  hopefully  would be Also  the usual problems with staff in the breakfast room that spoke worse English than I did BTW have a look at the  quot Deals quot  as there is a good permanent one for   nights incl  English Breakfast AND a visit for London Eye or Madam Tussaud s  We used that one  but did not want the tickets  At the time I made my reservations  it made financial sense   saving me money to take the deal and one extra night A couple of days before we went  I noticed they had GREAT deals  just      per night for a double or twin room  Incredible We payed        per night per room  incl  English breakfast The staff seemed tired   fed up   depressed   who knows what  The attitude seemed to be  quot We won t seeing you again anyway so who cares  quot   You know  sighing on your face etc  making us feel we were bothering them when we wanted our key etc  One was outright RUDE on Christmas day  but I did not complain  because    I am a big wussy    I doubt it would have helped The most important thing for us was the closeness of the tube stations   Hubby cannot walk very long  sadly   Also Queensway has lots of stores and Whiteley s shopping centre nearby so you can buy groceries and snacks to your room  Also the wonderful Nandos restaurant is close  Queensway is very lively and feels very safe  bustling with tourists BTW I stayed in this hotel back in the    s and boy was it great then  I am not quite sure it still deserves the   stars it did     or    maybe I think we got what we paid for  Still  next time I think I ll also ask for a couple of recommendations on this helpful forum before making my decision  
P =>   Was ok but won t go back  I booked the Bayswater Inn without looking at the exact location   mad I know but the description of  quot ideal location for Oxford Street quot  sold it to me as the main purpose of my trip was to go Christmas shopping  It took me a good hour from Oxford Street and I m no snail I read some of the reviews on here the night before I came to London and was pretty nervous at what I would find but apart from the location not being as central as I would have liked and the breakfast being exceptionally poor I have no other complaints  The staff were friendly and helpful when asked for directions and our room was clean  This is not a hotel to stay in if you want to be treated as royalty but it is ok for a   star hotel  I won t be going back purely because of the location although I must just add that the breakfast really is a let down and if you like a decent breakfast to set you off for the day then you will be extremely disappointed  Think bread rolls and jam     you may get a slice of toast if you re lucky   
P =>   You get what you pay for A dark basement room  a crunchy plastic matress  mold in the bathroom and an unwelcoming staff  We had to special request toilet paper and the complementary breakfast consisted of hamburger buns and jelly  This hotel was certainly proof of the old adage  quot you get what you pay for quot   Certainly there must be a better way to economize  If you are considering a stay here my strong reccomendation is  keep looking      
P =>  You get what you pay for I was super nervous after coming to this site and reading all the bad reviews after my boyfriend and i booked our stay at the bayswater for   days  I was expecting the worst  I dont know what the fuss is about  The room was clean and the staff were friendly  What else do you people need  Its not like we came to london to hang out in the room  The beds werent very comfortable but its a budget hotel in a great location  I cant believe how many people simply just love to complain  You get what you pay for  We had an amazing trip and simply came back to the hotel for showers and sleep  Anyone looking for luxury at that price in london really needs a wake up call  If you re looking for a small  quaint bed and breakfast  this is the place  Its cheap and got the job done  We drank our coffee and ate our toast in the morning and were on our merry way  We made the best of it and had a great time  No room for complaints while on holiday here  
P =>   Great deal Me and my girlfriend went to London on a romantic getaway  We booked our vacation trough a travelagent website and stayed at Bayswater Inn for   days  After booking the vacation we came across this site and became very nervous about the hotel but desided to give it a chance  We were pleasantly surprised by the standard of the room  the staff and the overall experience The room wasn t that big but provided all the things needed for a great stay  The room was clean  fully functional and quiet The staff was very helpful in all ways  They helped us store our luggaged upon arrivel until the room was ready  They help explain how to get from A to B in London ad so on Overall this is a hotel that we wouldn t mind coming back too The location is great  central but still quiet   the prices are fair and the room was adiquiet  amp  clean We can recommend the hotel too all except perhaps families with small children due to the fact that there are no entertainment facilitiis for kids  
P =>   Don t ever stay here     This hotel was absolutely disgusting  Unfortunately  the bad reviews are all correct so advice to anyone considering staying at this hotel  the reviews are true and take them seriously  I had to see it to believe it  First of all  the whole hotel gives you a feeling of uncleanliness and filth  The staff barely speaks English and no one is willing to answer your questions  and if we asked for something we would get a look and an attitude that we were needlessly occupying their time  The staff in the breakfast room was especially rude  The cleaning ladies WALKED INTO our room without knocking first while we were still in there changing showering getting ready  and one day we were still asleep and had to wake up to find strangers IN THE ROOM  This happened   of the   days we were there  and it also happened to our friends staying there  All the furniture is badly outdated  in horrid conditions  especially the mattresses   and I felt I had to sterilize my hands every time I touched something  We were awakened at   a m  one day by reception because they wanted to know if our bathroom had flooded  I asked for an extra towel  got it  yet the next day it was removed promptly by the cleaning staff  My experience with this hotel was horrible  and I strongly advise anyone against staying there  The only positive for this hotel is its location  but there are tons of other nicer  cleaner hotels for the same or less price in the area  
P =>  No room at the Inn We stayed two nights at the Bayswater Inn last week  booked through a small agent we found on a London website The hotel has a lot of promise  but our room was so pokey that the double  well  a single and a bit  bed was up against a wall  so one of us had to crawl down the bed in the night to get to the loo  avoiding banging our head on the wall mounted TV as we went The room smelt strongly of smoke  the loo was so close to the radiator in the bathroom that you had to sit sideways  too much info I m sure   and there were really thick prison esque bars at the windows The continental breakfast consisted of three types of bread roll  with little portions of jam  and some coffee that made my teeth squeek  I m used to that type of breakfast offering pastries  and often meat and cheese too  At leats there s a Tesco Express opposite Bayswater tube station On the plus side  drinks in the bar were quite reasonably priced We booked on a tight budge due to impending parenthood  but I would recommend spending a little more and picking somewhere different if possible  it certainly isn t the three star we were told it was  
P =>   Don t do this to yourself or family We stayed here from e             The pictures look great but prove that pictures can be deceiving  The double room made a Motel Six look like the Ritz Carlton  The beds looked like they had been used army surplus from WWII  With the exception of the night clerk  David  who was a joy to deal with and quite ebullient   the staff was rather unhelpful and quite dour in their demeanor   quot Amenities quot  were a joke  Can you believe a disposable paper bath mat  good for only one shower  so if more than one is staying here you ll have problems   One towel  no face cloths  no washcloths  per person  Beds were  quot made quot  but sheets were not replaced and when they were  the sheets clearly had large stains on them which looked liked dryed  but washed blood  Further  if you must stay here I would like to point out that this hotel is VERY heterosexual and if you are not you will feel quite uncomfortable and unwelcome  Don t do this to yourself  From my observations while there and since  there are better hotels at more reasonable prices in the area  The area is a good one  close to the Bayswater and Queensway tubes with major bus routes on Bayswater Road  
P =>   Fine hotel I stayed at this hotel in e      with my mother  sister  and grandmother  I disagree with the extremly negative reviews of this hotel  Basically you get what you pay for  This is London  after all  one of the most expensive cities on Earth  And in that respect  this hotel is an excellent deal  I am a travel agent here in the US  and have a reasonable standard of Luxury  I knew before booking this hotel that it wouldn t be luxurious  I wasn t paying for Luxury   I was paying for clean  comfortable  and conviently located  this hotel was all of those things  The Room was small  but that s how nearly all rooms are in London  It was clean at least  There was a wardrobe in our room to hang clothes if you are staying a few days  Bathroom was large by London standards  and clean The staff was very accomodating  my grandmother has to have her diabetic medicine refridgerated  and they put her medicine in their bar fridge every night  and got it out for her every morning with hardly any incident  The breakfast was pretty minimal  rolls  coffee  and OJ  But that s continential breakfast The location is excellent    min  walk to Bayswater or Kensington station     minute walk to Hyde Park  Plenty of restaurants pubs shops around We hardly spent any time in the hotel as we were exploring London  and it s a perfectly fine place to lay your head down at night  
P =>  Much better than expected This is a perfect hotel to stay in if you want to explore the city all the days  It s clean and it is located in a good neighbourhood  The breakfast had no high continental standard  but it was OK  When we arrived at the hotel  we were all worried because of all the bad reviews we had read  but the hotel turned out to be much better  It has a great location with several pubs in the area  two great tube lines and Kensington Gardens which you can reach by only a   minutes walk  If you just want to stay in the hotel all the day long  choose another hotel much more expensive  But if you want to hang around in this beautiful city and just need a place to sleep and rest your feet  this hotel is great  
P =>  previous reveiws do no justice Do you speak English is a commonly used phrase in this Hotel  The staff are mostly european and langauge was a real problem on our stay   having read previous reviews on this hotel we thought we would give it a go as the price and location seemed good   In future I will take more notice of trip reviews  the hotel lived up to the worst of the reviews   We stayed in room      the mattress had collapsed  there was no ventilation  there was a constant smell of mould   the floor had sunk in   causing problems during the night   beds were poorly made up and food was left on the floor for up to   days   The public areas were old and and unclean as were the public toilets  Surprisingly the bread rolls  tea and orange juice for breakfast were quite good as was the location  Next time in London I will stay at the sister hotel Faulty Towers   
P =>   Things you should know Nice clear hotel  That descrides it well enough  Not very expensive tho in the center of the city  Only   mins walk from the nearest subway station It s situated at a quiet neighboorhood that has everything close  From pharmacy to Burger King  for fast cheap food  If you have an option  do not choose the breakfast to be included in the fee  It s nothing special  More than a waste of money  Just bread  butter  jams  You can get a sadwich or croissant in great prices very near Carry your own shampoo and shower gel  The hotel doesn t provide any  And get a smaller towel cause they only provide a body towel If you come from a      or other voltage  country get your adapter or they charge   pounds each Have fun and see as many things as you can in London  don t forget to take a relaxing walk in Hyde Park which is no more than    mins walk from the hotel  
P =>  Great for Budget Shoppers Most reviews we have seen rated this hotel rather poorly but I think it is a great place  for the money  The young ladies on the front desk  a Pole and a Russian  spoke English  were very helpful and were very good at fending off the unhappy customers who thought they made reservations at a three star hotel  I d say they rate right down there with Motel    We checked out just a week ago today  
P => You get what you pay for For     for   night can t really complain  Room was clean enough   th floor  although it did seem to be on a slant   Noisy during the night  due to other guests lack of respect  Bathroom was small  but had amenities thats would expect  Covers on bed had cigarette burns in  Breakfast consisted of bread rolls  jam and butter  Coffee and Orange Juice  We asked for toast and it was brought out to our table very quickly  Full English is available for      Just one thing  we arrived at  pm and were told that we could not go to our room until  pm    Lady on reception suggested that we shouldn t leave our luggage at the hotel  got the impression bags had been stolen plenty of times from there as the information in the rooms  strongly advised about leaving valuables etc in the room Would stay here again if was for just one night as location was ok    mins from Bayswater Tube  Also price was very good for   people to stay in London  
P =>   Neutral Review We stayed at Bayswater Inn for   nights in       This hotel was booked through GATE  Travel as part of our London  Paris  Rome vacation on plan C  I have used Trip Advisor many times in the past so I can expect the best  or at times get ready for the worst  My stay at Bayswater Inn was a neutral average  There were positives and negatives  It turned out more positive than negative  The main thing I can stress is  quot you get what you pay for  quot  This establishment  like many in the area were some type of business structures or maybe apartments that have been turned into hotels  It doesn t appear the Bayswater was built as a hotel   The positives for my stay out weigh the negatives by far  The Bayswater Inn rooms are simple  They had a bed beds  TV  clocks  private bath shower  desk and chair  There is nothing extravagant at all  So if you are like me and only use the hotel to sleep and shower  this is perfect  We get up early in the morning and usually do not make it back to the room until late at night   We arrived from the airport  at least a   min drive  before check in so they allowed us to store our luggage for free  Personnel were very friendly and attempted to assist us as much as possible  They have two lifts  elevators   two sitting area and a restaurant  Their location is perfect  The hotel is  blocks from the subway  many fast food places like KFC  Pizza Hut  also there are plenty of ethnic eateries  and pubs around  There is a laundry mat one block away and a bus stop close by  You are walking distance from ble Arch if you would like  maybe   mins at a leisure pace and     minutes on the bus   There were several money exchange services and a couple of stores  however we didn t go in them  The breakfast  which is my    negative  consisted of   different types of breads  A roll with poppy seed  a roll without poppy seed and another type of bread  They have   or   different type of jams to choose from and butter for the bread  Their beverage choices are orange drink  not juice  water and coffee  THAT IS ALL  When we saw what they had to offer we ordered from the restaurant menu  however that also was poor  We did not participate in breakfast anymore   When on vacation I tend to sway to establishments with a good breakfast  This was not even what I would consider continental breakfast  The second negative  well not really a negative  but unexpected  and not only at this hotel  but every hotel that we stayed in while visiting Europe  no one gives you wash rags  You get a towel and mild soap  So bring your rags  If you asked me would I stay here again  my answer would be yes  I overall enjoyed my stay here   I have included some pictures of my room and the hotel  I hope this review will help you  
P =>  Quality Services The hotel really provides quality services  no matter staff  room and restaurant  Location is also definitely an advantage  I heartfelt recommend to anyone who will travel for any purpose  
P =>   vile tiny rooms  mouldy bathrooms  very uncomfortable camp beds  smells terrible  basement rooms mean you can t leave a window open for fresh air incase someone comes in  unfriendly staff  terrible breakfast  bread rolls  cheap orange juice  and a mild excuse for coffee Need i say more  Spend a few more pounds and have a much better experience Well avoided  
P =>   Hyed Park so close  The Bayswater Inn is a tourist class hotel and you get what you order but since being so close to the Metro and Hyde Park its quite good  The hotel was clean  neat   nothing fancy but ideal for a short stay in London  My only issue was the breakfast which was basic but as we were busy seeing the city it didnt matter  The internet and services are notable and overall it was fine  
P =>  Absolutely poo I was very unhappy with this hotel  and so was Kel  However Igor  the fictitious man who lives in room     provided much entertainment for Robbie K  The hotel staff did not care that a    year old male ran around the corridors for over an hour  displaying his arm pit hair and wearing nothing but boxers  Cripes  A pool of vomit was left undisturbed outside of the lift  and   members of the trip organisation staff were verbally abused by a Russian lady built like a tank  The language skills of the staff were to be commended  it was such a shame that English was not spoken   One night  I approached the desk with my card for room     to get my key  I put it upside down on the desk  only to be told by one of the Scandinavian staff that  quot there was no room      quot However  if you go and stay here  you can look forward to the luxurious breakfasts of bread rolls  Oh and don t bring your children  as the staff are possibly the most anti social people I have ever met  
P => mouldy rolls  Be prepared to have an  extensive  choice of brown or white mouldy rolls for breakfast  and a very lumpy bed  with rock hard pillows  The location was good though  
P => stay away if you want to sleep  We arrived with a school party of    and the room was an average sizeThe huge problem is nobody is fluent in english so this makes things extremely difficult also staff are rude and incompetent Breakfast is a joke we didnt bother the second morning we can eat bread and jam at home  I am sure prison breakfast is of a higher calibre  The beds are so uncomfortable we didnt sleep you can feel every spring in your back and on night number one we wanted to leave  Night number two there was a pool of vomit by the lift and this stank the floor out never again would we return  it isnt suitable for a school party as in no way can corridors be policed with the amount of fire doors and lifts and stairs  It was horrid  i am sure for the same price higher notch accomodation can be found 
P => The worst hotel in london       this review is from pupils of burychurch of england high school we think that this hotel it is a disgrace crap food a stale roll for your breakfast and if u like orange juice you wont like it ever againthe bedsare apsoluly appaling 
P =>  A Disgrace Let s start on a positive note   It was not so difficult to get to  It is only a short distance to the Bayswater underground station  It is located in a neighborhood that is very ethnically diverse and has restaurants from every nationality to match  WARNING  Beds in this hotel are not beds by any reasonable standard  One earlier reviewer called them cots which is actually the truth  They are flimsy  dirty  lumpy  torn  quot mattresses quot  on a wire frame  It is just not fit to sleep on  We were travelling with a party of four other persons and all of the beds were the same  regardless of room location  We had each prepaid      U S for   nights and were stuck  The included  quot breakfast quot  consisted of a stale roll with terrible coffee and worse  quot orange juice  quot  And the staff providing this fare did so with a level of service that would have gotten them fired from a job in a prison inmate cafeteria The bathrooms are so small that it is difficult for an average person to sit on the toilet Beware of basement rooms  Yes  they have basement rooms   and they don t really disclose that you are getting a beasement room  Its like a surprise  The dungeon in the Tower of London must be better That the rooms are small  I can overlook because that is the standard in Europe  But  these rooms are dirty  In fact  everything in the place is dingy  It is a horrible place to stay in a city as classy as London and can really put you in a negative mood during your stay  
P =>  Pleasantly Surprised Our travel agent booked the Bayswater Inn for us because we wanted   star accomodation near the city It wasn t until after we had paid for it thatwe found this website and read these reviews We were therefore filled with great trepidation upon arriving What a pleasant surprise I will start off with listing the  quot cons quot to this l  but believe me  the  quot pro s quot  far outnumber them Firstly  the staff all seem very friendly  but there is a distinct communication barrier  I would suggest  if you have the inniative to figure things out for yourself  don t even bother talking to them  I believe we only came across one lady at the reception desk who spoke passable English and she seemed to be under tremendous pressure Secondly  our plane got in from Sydney at     am  we arrived at the hotel at around  am   only to betold check in wasn t until  pm  We d been on our flight for    hours and we weren t up to sightseeing  There was no negotiation with regards to early check in  so we had no alternative than to leave our luggage at the hotel and find things to do Thirdly  the only bad thing about our room was the bed  Definately NOT a double bed  More like a king SINGLE  And the matress needed replacing at least a year ago That s it for the bad  Now on to the good This hotels location is phenominal  It is only a   mnute walk to Bayswater tube station  which is on the Circle line  a major line  If you walk    more minutes in the opposite direction  you ll get to Nottinghill Gate Tube Station  This one s on the Circle  Distric  amp  Central line  You couldn t ask for a better location Yes    the room was small  but considering we only really used it to sleep in  it didn t bother us at all  The bathroom looked brand new  and the towels and sheets where changed daily  The room also came with a hairdryer and coffee and tea facilities The very best thing about the room was that it was WARM  We would walk around in t shirts and shorts most of the time  The towel rack was heated  which was perfect for hanging went underwear from after washing them You hand your key into reception when leaving the hotel  While some may not like this  we found it very convenient  as there was no fear of losing the key The breakfast is bread rolls  with tea  coffee  orange juice and hot chocolate  Not fancy  but what else would you expect for FREE As the hotel is a converted old Victorian residence  it epitomised the charm and character of London and we would definately stay at the Bayswater Inn again  
P =>  Much better than the reviews  I came on this site before my trip absolutely dreading the hotel given the reviews  However  the Bayswater Inn is the best hotel I ve stayed at in London  The room was clean and spacious and the bathroom was huge  as compared to other European hotels I ve stayed in  The location is great   it s just a short walk to the Baywater tube station and it has everything you could need near by  Breakfast was basically buns  juice  and coffee  but all were delicious My only caution   watch out for the front desk staff  They are a bit rude to say the least  Despite this  however  I would definitely say that the Bayswater is at the top of my list for my next UK visit  
P =>  Not Too Shabby I m back from a    day European  Germany  Holland  Belgium  France  amp  England  tour and this is one of the hotels I stayed at  The Good   Awesome location  You ll be very close to a bunch of cute shops  restaurants  grocery stores and there s a    hour laundromat if you need it  Also  the Bayswater Tube station is a short walk away    There was heat  a working alarm clock radio and tv  People were relatively friendly  Internet    pound    minutes  at least they have it   Safety  You have to be buzzed in so random strangers can come in and try to rob the innThe Bad   Free breakfast is two thumbs down  All they give you is bread  coffee and OJ  They hide the free cereal somewhere in the back  but you can buy a better breakfast if you wish  eggs  ham  etc The Ugly   Shower takes like    minutes to drain  there was no bathroom window and it smelled kind of weird  The mattresses were not good  You can feel all the springs stabbing your back  I was in a room of four so I slept on a thin springy mattress on a piece of cardboard that was suppose to be a cot  Thank goodness I was exhausted every night Overall  this place did its job and was probably cheap because a tour company used it  I would stay there again  or definitely somewhere in the area  
P =>  Fun at Bayswater I just camr back from a seven day tour in England and had the privlige of staying at the Bayswater Inn  Located in a posh district of London  I had the ability to run to Starbucks every morning and have the luxuri of having the Bayswater tube station   min walk away  The bayswater Inn is in a rather quaint district of London in a semi middle  eastern disctric  with many shopes and restaurants to choose from one is never bored in the evenings  With a short hop skip and jump one is able to see Kensington Gardens and the palace  Being there for the week I did have the luck of seeing Prince Charles and Camilla get into their Royal Helicopter in the morning whilst alking in the park ajacent to the back area of Kensington palace  The rooms are rather nice for what one pays for at the Bayswater Inn  The staff are rather graciouse and kurt depending on who you are dealing with at differnent points of day  If one has a chance try speaking with the midnight desk clerk  A fellow from Thailand who is more then happy to help you with any probplems you have  He is very knowledgeable of the area  If one is so lucky enough to get him onto the subject of the many stars and socialittes that populoate the area  One is able to see how lucky and privliged it is to stay in one of the most charming districts in all of London  Breakfst is nothing to exciting  It mostly consisted of buns with an asortment of butter and jams with orangejuice  If one is willing to go the extra mile and pay some   GBP  one is able to have a full english breakfast  The wait staff in the restaurant are polite enough but enlgish can be some what of a barieir  If you can try and dela with a charming young girl named Inga from Lithuania  She is rather polite and willing to help you in any means to make your stay at the bayswater better  All in all  I guess one can say that  quot you do get what you pay for  quot  If one is expecting more then what I have said in the above then maybe it would be wise to go to the Savoy or the Rotz  but if one is interested in the true life and atmosphere of real people who live and breath London everday  Then the Bayswater Inn is the place to be  
P =>  Sometimes you get less than you pay for  This hotel was represented by the agency  quot Gate  Travel quot  as being a three star  It is located in a decent ethnic neighborhood  Greek  amp  Algerian   about     minutes walking time from Bayswater tube station  The location is also convenient to Paddington Station  about       minutes walk  and Hyde Park   Kensington Gardens       minutes walk  When we arrived in the morning we found the lobby and staff to be pleasant enough with good security  but beyond that is where the trouble starts  For starters the luggage room was filthy  Wood chips all over the floor from the cracked and broken racks  It was obvious that it has not been cleaned in a very long time if ever  After a day on the town we returned and were given two rooms in the basement  The first was a small single  The entire room was about six feet wide by ten feet long and the temperature was about    degrees F  The knob on the radiator was broken so it could not be adjusted  The other room was supposed to be a double and it was fairly large with two single beds and a double bed  however the condition of the room was atrocious  The stench of old smoke permeated the room and there was graffiti on some of the walls  The double bed was pushed up against one wall that was covered with scuffs and dirt as if someone had walked on it  The carpet had numerous stains on it and appeared heavily worn  The bed linens were old and worn looking with holes in the bedspreads and there was some kind of stain on one of the sheets that appeared to have chunks of something stuck to it  The bath had cracked and broken tiles on the floor  We returned immediately to the front desk and after considerable debate with the night manager I escorted her to the rooms and pointed out all of the aforementioned flaws  It was only after this and more persistent badgering that she finally agreed to move us  The other rooms were better  but not much  They gave us a double on the second floor and another different single in the basement  The single was no bigger than the first one but had a much better temperature  The only real flaw here other than the size was that the shower head could not be adjusted and in order to get wet  one had to get very close to the shower controls which were positioned such that a slight bump would send the water temperature plummeting or soaring to the point of scalding  There were also guests in the next room who were drunk and very loud when they came in at     AM  The noise continued until   AM when I left the room for the day  I advised the desk clerk who seemed indifferent to the problem  The double room on the second floor was much better if smaller than the one in the basement and other than the fact that everything looked old and worn there were no problems  There are two elevators in the building but one of them was broken for most of our three night stay making the walk to our rooms twice as far a it needed to be  As for the continental breakfast  here is the exact menu  Wheat Roll  White Roll  Poppy Seed Roll  Butter  icot preserve  Strawberry Preserve  Coffee and Orange Juice  From a can   If you want anything else it s extra  I have described this hotel as well as I can  If you are told that this hotel is anything more than a good one star or a poor two star you are being lied to  
P => You get what you pay for Stayed from     till     The rooms are the size of a room on a Cruise  Ample closet space   beds small desk with   chairs nice size bathroom with plenty of hot water and great water pressure  we were on the  nd floor and there was no noise  The room was CLEAN and the beds were made every day and the   towells were replaced  The breakfast was very basic but it was FREE  The staff was polite  Long walk to the TUBE  Plenty of resturants nearby  Was not the RITZ but well worth the price 
P => Never again  Got a small  noisy basement room with hardly any ventilation  Never will I stay in this hotel again  Stay away  
P =>  And they sd it was handicapped friendly  ha ha ha What a joke     I will never stay there again    I could hardly even get through the door I use a wheelchair and before I scheduled my trip I called and spoke with the hotel staff who assured me that there were no stairs and the elevator doors were large enough for a wheelchair  Obviously they were wrong and extremely rude when I talked to them about the problem           
P =>  Never again I stayed at the Bayswater Inn with my wife and will not return  The room was too small  however our room was in a quiet area and the location of the hotel is quite good  Don t expect a courteous frontdesk Quiet neighbourhood  close to Bayswater tube station  nearby at Hereford we found Restaurant Veronica s  it s very good  nice and friendly  
P =>  Never no more     Parasites     No breakfast and dirty   The managers of this hotel should be ashamed   You call this a   star hotel     Let me laugh     Never saw a sad hotel like that in my whole life You people are just parasites   And more customers we spoke had the same reactions Very unsympathetic reception by a Pakistan guy We slept in an old room in the basement  Plenty things broken  old paint  holes everywhere  no outside view from the window  Continental breakfast     Never saw that in my whole life Just a few sandwiches with butter and marmalade and that s it  Nothing salty  no cheese  no bacon  no cereals  nothing    Never no more   This is what people call a one time shot hotel  You go ones and never no more  Just take a look at some pictures you ll know what I mean  Jean c Van RavelsAntwerp Belgium 
P =>  Dirty Bayswater Inn My family and I booked three room at this hotel  It was the worst we have ever encountered  Bathrooms very dirty with broken tiles and dirt coming through the tiles  rooms dusty and filthy  From the moment you walked in this hotel you wonder which HELL I am in  
P =>  horrible hotel This was probably the worst hotel I have ever stayed at  The room was tiny  dirty  in the basement with one window onto an airshaft  The beds were what we describe in the US as cots and the mattresses were lumpy  The carpet was stained  the curtains dirty  The breakfast was rolls and instant coffee with watered orange juice  We only ate there once  On the plus side  the desk staff was friendly and helpful and the location was good  The room was not noisy  but I think we may have been the only guests in that dank basement  Next time I would definitely spring for the extra money for a decent room  
P =>   Good value for money I stayed for two nights in il and received an excellent and reasonable rate through a website  In view of some earlier comments about this hotel  I wanted to record my observations  Although I booked a single room  I was given a triple room on the  nd floor overlooking Princes Square  I checked with reception to make sure they hadn t made a mistake and they assured me that this was the correct room at no extra charge  So maybe I was just lucky  I found the reception staff pleasant  polite and speedy The room was very clean  spacious   compared with what I was expecting   and it proved to be quiet  There were no sounds from neighbouring rooms  and with my windows open at night  all I heard were occasional vehicles driving by  but this was not a problem  The bathroom was newly refurbished with a powerful shower over the bath  Three towels  for the three beds  draped the heated towel rail  The room was adequately equipped for all my needs but storage space may have proved a premium for three persons I didn t take the continental breakfast included in the rate  simply as I didn t have time in the mornings The location is excellent  A couple of hundred metres from Queensway  with its cosmopolitan atmosphere  ethnic restaurants  ranging from Vietnamese to Moroccan   you name it and they are there  Plus Whiteleys shopping centre with more restaurants  a ks and Spencer food store and cinemas  All the leading fast food chains are also located in Queensway plus a couple of Tescos for any quick provisions  The hotel is served by two Underground stations   Queensway  Central Line  and Bayswater  Circle Line   Also buses that take you to ble Arch  Oxford Street  Victoria  Westminster and Notting Hill  Lovely Kensington Gardens is just across Bayswater Road  There are even a choice of churches in the vicinity  including Russian Orthodox  Altogether a very suitable hotel at extremely reasonable rates  given it s location The reception on check out was efficient and courteous  I would not hesitate to stay there again if budget was priority  
P =>  If you can stay somewhere else  I stayed at the Bayswater Inn in il      for a school trip  and found it to be a terrible expirience  Our room was cramped and un inviting  and had an odd smell to it  Our view was non exsistent  even though my room had a window  we were located on the basement floor  and when looking out of our window  all we saw was an air shaft  Most unpleasant  The linens did not feel clean and the towels were small  almost to the point that they became useless  While the rooms have their own bathrooms  they are more like glorified closets  Big enough to stand in  and that s about it  On our second day there  my roomate and I also discovered an entire colony of ants had invaded the room  and we had to go around shaking our clothes and belongings out as the insects were so many  and they had gotten everywhere  The staff is rude and cold  it seems more so to their American tourists  They did not help when asked to  and on the rare occasions that they would aid a customer  it would be done in a begrudging  condescending manner  This offended me particulary  because being only    and staying for my first time abroad AND without my parents  a little help would have been greatly appriciated  The lobby  while the furnishing is nice enough  is just as cramped as the rooms  I also adive to bring your own breakfast  especially if you re not used to eating a roll and water and that s it  for your first meal of the day  because otherwise you ll find yourself exceedingly hungry throughout the rest of the day  The only good thing I can say about this hotel is that it has a nice  central location  and it right across from some rather pretty gardens  However  it is not enough to make me want to stay here again  If you can stay somehwhere  do  The Bayswater Inn in not worth your time or money  
P =>  Cockroaches  need I say more  I stayed at the Bayswater Inn for   nights during the first week of e       The location of the hotel is excellent  It s a short walk to Kensington Park and the nearest tube station is about   minutes away  However  that was almost all that was positive about the hotel  It was cheap  but next time I d spend more money and stay at a better hotel  perferably one without cockroaches  It was disgusting to see them crawling on the floor in the middle of the night  When I woke before the sun came up and went to take a shower I could see them all over the floor The sheets were not changed during the   nights we were there and the material was very thin and had holes in them  This  along with the hot nights  made the sheets unpleasant after a few nights The staff seemed to have difficulties speaking English  which was funny considering it is a British hotel in London  They were friendly enough  but I had difficulty understanding them  The breakfast consisted of rolls  which sometimes were stale  and orange juice  There was a computer in the lobby where you could pay for internet access  The size of the room we had was decent  it was a three person room  on the second floor  
P =>  Very Rude Staff My husband and I stayed here during our second visit to London  The location and the area surrounding the hotel were not bad  I don t mind hotels as long as the room is clean  the linens fresh and the staff friendly  Unfortunately  the biggest complaint we had was with the staff  They are very unfriendly and not helpful at all  Stay away from the breakfast staff especially  They are extremely rude and the breakfast was HORRIBLE  The man in charge was extremely nasty    
P =>  Great Deal for the Money    This hotel is a great value for the money  Based on reviews on this site  I requested a twin room on an upper floor  away from the elevator  Our room was lovely and spacious  The private bathroom included a tub and towel warmer  The hotel has internet access for reasonable rates in the lobby  and the staff was friendly and helpful  I can not imagine getting a better hotel for these prices  
P => Its just your average hotel Stayed in London for   nights Our room was clean  we were on the  th floor It was a average size  One thing is the beds are hard feels like your sleeping a park bench  It was just averageLoved London        
P =>  Average    We are the lucky ones  My family and I stayed in this hotel in il      and we found it fairly good  The room was clean  linen ok  the bathroom decent and the CH worked properly  Besides that  it has an excellent location  The breakfast was rather plain but you will survive  Remember  not only in London but everywhere else you get what you pay   
P =>  Bad Experience The staff at the hotel were pleasant enough  but not helpful  We were shocked because our room was terribly small and hot  no fan or air conditioning  the bed was hard and lumpy  and the sheets extremely scratchy  We had a tiny TV with only about   stations  The noise level in our room was terrible  we could hear every sound outside our room  laughing and doors slamming into the wee hours of the night  We were given only   bath towels  we asked for washcloths or hand towels and were told none were available  There were no amenities  save soap and TP in the bathroom  The Continental breakfast consisted of cold rolls  which were good and they were fresh   with your choice of butter and Jam  the drinks were watered down orange juice and instant coffee   most days we had to go out for breakfast  If ever we were to visit London again  I would certainly stay at a nicer hotel  
P =>  Lumpy beds noisy rooms The hotel was brilliantly located   easy to get to from Heathrow  and then   tube stations down the road were so convenient  The area is lovely and quiet with a vibey main road just down the way  Hotel was OK for the price with a few exceptions   beds were diabolical   full of lumps  The rooms were noisy from the residents    make sure you get a room away from the lifts  The  quot continental breakfast quot  is a bit of a joke   coffee  a bread roll and watered down orange juice  I d definitely stay in the area again  but I d give another establishment a try  
P =>  Great value  The location could not be better  Residential area with great local Pubs and ethnic restaurants and markets  Nice shopping mall and tube stations only blocks away  Room on ground floor was a nice size with   twin beds     windows although they could not be opened  Nice large bathroom with wonderful heated towel bar and deep bathtub  great for soaking tired feet   Very clean  Breakfast was very basic   but optionals are not very expensive  Staff was extremely helpful and friendly  Excellent value for the money  
P =>  Good Enough  I stayed here on a tour with my cousin s college in ember       The rooms were small but clean  I did see ants the one night but I was also on the basement room  The breakfast was not to good  as everyone else said very stale hard rolls  The couple that run the bar with the young bartender were very very nice and sweet  They made the stay bareable when I could nt take all the college kids  I would stay there again with no problems  
P =>  Time for new beds The hotel is conveniently located for its price  However  the beds were really uncomfortable  
P =>  Stayed twice good and bad I stayed in this hotel twice and had both a good and bad experience  My first booking was through lastminute com and I was given an excellent room on the first floor with my own balcony and spacious bathroom  It was quiet and comfortable  The second visit I booked through their website and was given a small basement room  The bathroom smelt like a blocked drain and the shower was like a jet taking off and was so powerful it wet the whole bathroom and carpet everytime  Like any basement room you could hear some noise from upstairs  The breakfast was awful  I only had it once and it was just toast and stale rolls with watered down orange juice  However the staff were lovely to me both times  I would go back only if I didn t get a basement room and only paying their cheapest     a night rate  
P =>  great value stayed there earlier this year  excellant hotel trying to book another break there at the moment  
P => very good value for money I stayed here five days last week  I think it s really good value for money  considering it s London     for a double room which was quite spacious  clean  nice bathroom  TV  phone  radio and hairdrier  ent breakfast  And in such a nice area  very near the tube  in a lovely square   minutes walk from Notting Hill  The view from the window wasn t exceptional  on the roofs  very limited view of the sky  as I said  money well spent  will go back

P =>   Dirty and undriendly I stayed here for a few nights and regretted it  The room was dirty  the tv did not work and even more importantly the staff were the unfriendliest I have ever met  The female  olich girl who works in the breakfast room could not crack a smile and did not know the meaning of customer service  Don t stay here   there are plenty of other hotels in Earls Court 
P =>   Convenient location   affordable prices We have stayed at this hotel on numerous occasions over the last    years   yes it s a budget hotel   but this is central London   what else do you expect for     per night for a double room including breakfast  amp  only    a day for parking  The Hotel is getting a little bit shabby admittedly but the bedding  amp  towels are clean  I ve never had a problem with a room and the breakfast is always enjoyable  I have no problem recommending this hotel to a friend  just not a posh one   amp  as a little extra advice ask for room    or    just for that little bit of extra space     
P =>   Quaint and cosy The location of the Beaver Hotel cannot be beat  About    m down the road is the Earl s Court strip   full of about     INCREDIBLE  restaurants  definitely visit Masala Zone if you stay here  it is the best Indian on Earth I guarantee you  The tube station is also located about halfway down this strip  so anytime we needed to go anywhere  it was just a    m walk and a tube ride away  Travel cost us about     the whole   days we were there  including getting to Heathrow and back  The room itself was very basic   very London  quaint and comfy though  ent bed and bathroom  can t really complain for the price  Breakfast was funny  you could have a bit of bacon  a shriveled little sausage  eggs however you like them  and toast  They make it to order as you arrive in the dining room each morning  It was nice to have that kind of service instead of a germy buffet  and I have no complaints about hot food on a cold English morning  You could also take as many croissants and flavoured yoghurts as you like Staff were friendly enough and helpful when we asked for directions  Another advantage is the massive Tesco directly across the road from the street the hotel is on  Plenty of variety and cheap snacks can be had from there   just a shame we didn t have a kitchen to cook in  that would have been great When it comes to my stay at the Beaver  I have only one regret  that I could only stay for one week  London is an incredible city and if I could afford to go back  I would jump on a plane this second    
P =>   Excellent value for budget travel The good  Earl s Court shops within   minutes walking  supermarket   minutes walking  quiet location  The bad  rooms are quite simple  so don t expect anything fancy  The breakfast was basic  they said full English  what we got was two pieces of toast  one piece of bacon  one sausage       
P =>   As far as London hotels go no complainants  The Beaver was clean  friendly  comfortable  and decently priced for London accommodation  We stayed in a   bedroom with bath and enjoyed our   day stay very much  The location is great  just a block away from the Earls Court tube stop  The breakfast was fantastic  very filling  After long days of sightseeing  it was a great place to come crash  A wonderful hotel for families  backpackers  and everyone in between to take in London  
P =>   We went anyway    It was going to be a night out in London with my wife and bring the car instead of the a train ride  Did not look at any hotel forum prior to booking the Beaver Hotel  After reading the negative comments I was filled with trepidation  I had paid in advance so was committed I judge a hotel by it s cleanliness and its plumbing  All I want is a clean bed and a hot shower  I got both I d read the reports on the breakfast so my expectations were fulfilled  It s all true what the say We had stripped our bed at home and virtually brought it with us in the boot of the car along with my tool kit  Thankfully it all stayed in the car     for the car parking is so small an amount as to be worthless  I think they could have given me that  The building standards years ago were different to today  The plasterboard stud walls offer no sound barrier therefore the hotel is noisy  
P =>  Great Value Hotel B  The Beaver Hotel in Earls Court is really good value for London at     per room including a small but adequate English breakfast It is very clean and the staff are really friendly  We would have liked to see a Tea Coffee tray in the room but there is a    hour Tesco a very short walk from the hotel We walked there to get a drink after a concert at Earls Court which is an equally short walk from the Beaver in the opposite direction  If you want a basic clean comfortable hotel B  amp  B at a reasonable price then you can t really go wrong at the Beaver Hotel  
P =>   There s something better than stay here After looking really last minute for a nice B amp B a friend recommended us the Beaver with the words  quot I liked it quot   So ist was a spontanous decision  particulary all other hotels were already full booked  First I have to say  the website looks better than in reality If you have no requirements than the Beaver is enough for you  Having a adress for getting a little sleep  a warm shower and a unpretentious breakfast   than it will be enogh  Otherwise  no way The rooms and the bathroom are small but tidy if you oversight the dirty cutains  the nasty carpet and coverlets and the need of renovation  especially in the bathroom  Our triple room was in the ground floor opposite the reception  Not hearing anything form there or the stairway but extremly from the obove room  We could sing every song of MTV music clips listening to the TV from above  But after a complaint at the reception it was tolerable  though with earplugs  But getting restorable sleep in those beds feeling every spring of the mattress was impossible The breakfast includes tea or coffee  cornflakes muesli with milk or yoghurt  great choice of different flavours in packages   toast with light salted butter and two sorts of marmelade  If you want you can get two eggs in any form  boiled  scrambled or fried  or sausages and ham  They even have a choice of fruits  apples and tangerines    If you are not an athlet or a greedy pig it will be enough and it is good enough for a breakfast The personal was very friendly and really helpful and the calm location next to the Underground  quot Earls Court quot  for being in the city center in about    minutes is the only advantage  Unfortunatley these facts do not balance the uncomfortable beds and comfortless  loveless atmosphere  
P =>  Clean but pricey The staff are very friendly at the Beaver hotel but the cost of staying here was too much We stayed in a double en suite room which was nice  The room was quite spacey and so was the bathroom We had no problems at all with the room   though the hairdryer didn t work in the bathroom All in all   I would recommend this hotel if you were only staying for one night as it is expensive  
P =>   Pretty ent I found this place pretty decent  Through lastminute com it was    pounds a night for a non ensuite single  which i think is about as cheap as you can get this in London for  I found my bed comfortable and the room clean  The window opened fine and you could get a lot of air  My room had no tv but I would respond to others  comments that if your hotel room tv in England is not cable  it will generally only get about   channels  The sausage at each day s breakfast tasted slightly funny to me  Yogurts and fruit are self service at breakfast so you could just about have   if you wanted  I enjoyed having   yogurts one day  There is a gigantic supermarket about   or   minutes walk away  Tescos  It is a LONG walk from the tube  especially if you want to come out of tube on the Earls Court Road exit  and you will notice the walk if you re lugging heavy luggage or running late  or both   If you suffer from hay fever  I don t  you will pass a ton of trees on way to hotel  I did swallow a lot of pollen running to make plane my last day and was coughing like mad for about    minutes   There are a lot of hotels you ll pass on the way from the tube that are closer  one of which  Great Northern something I think  had the same price rooms  temporarily  posted out front as Beaver cost me  There was   receptionist  a pregnant woman  who seemed to get very slightly hysterical no matter what I asked her and another receptionist  a young man  who was always on the phone  especially at night  so I didnt feel comfortable interrupting to ask non urgent questions  and one very nice and professional middle aged woman receptionist  I was on the  nd floor  American use  rd   the lift always worked with practically no wait  Room phone was very good  you could phone London numbers with no surcharges at all  costing the same or less as a payphone would  phone books were in my bottom desk drawer  There was never any wait for the loo down the hall  I should mention there was some kind of rumbling noise most mornings at roughly the same hours breakfast was served   am to  am  which made it a bit hard to sleep for me  In terms of people talking and doors banging I found this a very quiet hotel  which I valued highly  If you have a choice of rooms  see if there is a banging fire door nearby  I had a choice between   rooms  I asked  and was able to avoid the banging fire door near rooms    and    on  nd floor  by taking room     
P =>  its a hostel I booked this hotel because it was an average price for london and near where my relatives were staying for the trip  Had I known what terrible room conditions and unfriendly staff this hotel had  I would never have stayed here  Room was very small  bedding was old and pillows looked very dirty  rust around bathtub  It was hot in london and when I asked for a fan to help with the unventilated room I was told that all fans had gone out to other quests  I asked for a fan every day  for   dyas and I was always told  quot no  quot  television is tiny tiny with only   stations Not worth your money  
P => Good value hotel in great location We stayed at the Beaver Hotel for several days in early il  The room was clean and adequate and I would definitely stay there again and recommend it to friends Pros     Excellent location near Earl s Court Tube    The price was good for London at only    pounds per night including breakfast    The staff were very helpful and friendly  for the most part   see  quot Cons quot  below     We had no problems with our reservations or payment Cons     The full English breakfast was the worst I ve ever had in London  but again  adequate    We accidentally rang the doorbell after   pm one night as we were coming in and the man who had checked us in earlier that day   and who had been very personable   turned into a bit of a Psycho and was visibly very upset with us making the noise   even after we explained that it was an accident   We avoided him from then on     No tea making facilities in the rooms  but it is available until midnight in the basement  Overall  a good  relatively cheap place to stay in a city where you can sometimes pay a lot for downright scary  dirty rooms  
P =>   The Beaver did not disappoint  I wanted a cheap and clean hotel near to Earls Court tube and the famous Troubadour cafe and music club on the Old Brompton Road  The Beaver did not disappoint My room was basic but quite comfortable  The staff were helpful and the breakfast room welcoming  with newspapers available  The food was fine I would definitely recommend this hotel though it needs some internal re decoration and should do itself justice by adopting a more attractive name  
P =>  Great Hotel Good Value There were   of us girls in a triple room on the ground floor and our room was ready when we arrived at noon  The room was very spacious with   single beds  There was some storage for your clothes but if you re staying for more than a couple of days  you may as well leave your clothes in your suitcase as there isn t a great deal of storage space We were given two keys  cards  which operated the front door as well as the door to our room  so no problem with coming back late The beds were a little hard and we had to ask for extra pillows but this wasn t a problem at all  The top bed spreads were a little stained but the sheets and pillowcases were immaculately clean The room had a TV and the channels all worked fine The bathroom was a decent size and was very clean  There was a bath shower and the shower was very powerful   just what you need after walking around London all day  There is also a hairdryer in the bathroom but it wasn t very powerful so best to take your own  There are complimantary toiletries and ample supply of towels Room was cleaned and beds made every day Breakfast consisted of cereal  cooked breakfast  not very big but consisted of egg   scrambled  fried or poached   sausage  bacon and tomato   as much toast as you want with butter  jam and marmalade  tea or coffee  yoghurt and fruit  It might not look like a lot but when you add it all together it s very filling and sets you up for the day nicely  Breakfast is served in the dining room in the basement where there is also tea and coffee available up until midnight There is no bar but there is a vending machine which has cans of beer  lager  small bottles of spirits and another which has canned soft drinks All of the staff were very helpful and friendly  especially the lady on reception The location of the hotel is ideal  Only a   minute walk from Earls Court tube station  It is on a lovely tree lined street and we felt very safe walking back there late at night  The hotel also has a large car park at the rear  which we didn t need to use as we didn t travel by car   The fee for parking in the hotel car park is paid upfront and you put a sticker on your windscreen  It s ideal to have this car park in this part of London where parking is at a premium Overall  we were very pleased with our choice of hotel and would highly recommend it to others  It only cost us      for the three of us for   nights during Christmas week  Very good value for money We are already planning on returning there next year  maybe for a West End show  
P =>  What I expected Having lived and worked at a hotel a few doors down from this hotel over a decade ago I did not expect much  and I was right  the room was as small as I remembered the rooms from the other hotel  I had a single ensuite and it suited me fine for   days as I was hardly there  I had to go out as the room was so HOT and I couldn t open any windows  that s my only major complaint  The room smelt quite musty but that must be the norm in those type of buildings  the previously mentioned hotel smelt the same  and the fact the windows don t open wouldn t help  The breakfast was fine and at least it was included in the exhorbitant  but normal London  room rate  I wouldn t expect much more from a budget hotel in London  
P =>  OK if you don t have too high expectations I had read these reviews and booked a room with no private facilities for three nights and then again following week for eight nights  I wouldn t have done that if I knew there are no showers in the common bathroom  The idea of waiting the bath to be ready and someone knocking impatiently on the door was so unpleasant I changed for an ensuite room  it was ok  they had that kind of rooms available   I must say I felt quite uneasy to pay    pounds a night for such a small  simple room  But what can you do  The problem is not Beaver Hotel  the problem is the standard and rates London hotels in general  I spent a couple of hours in an internet cafe trying desperately to find a cheaper alternative with the standard  never non ensuites again  but didn t make it There is no reason for you to avoid this particular hotel if you have decided to come to London and not sleep in a dormitory or something  The rooms are small and simple but clean  the plankets and the wallpaper in the room were quite spotty and therefore ugly  though   the Earls Court area is ok and this particular street is quiet  In my opinion the breakfast was good  eggs and becon and toast  but also yoghurts and fruits   The staff is nice and helpful  There is a comfortable lounge to use and free tea available  In my first room the television didn t work  but in the second one it did  The shower worked as well as they ever do in England  The second time I must have had the same room as the previous writer   for some reason  no toilet paper holder  I don t know if you appreciate this little detail or not but in the breakfast room there was old posters with pictures on Earls court area  As a friend of local history I liked them  
P => Pretty good value for money I stayed at the hotel for   nights in il  I had a single ensuite room for     night  The location of the hotel is good near the underground and in a walking distance to many shops  restaurants  museums and parks  The staff was friendly and spoke good English  The room was tidy and the size was OK  The bed was a bit on the hard side and there was some street noise but these things didn t affect my beauty sleep  The bathroom was clean and the shower was OK  For some reason there was no holder for the toilet paper roll  The breakfast was monotonous  mainly bacon  eggs  tiny sausages and toast  but it was included in the room price  All in all pretty good value for money  
P =>  Liked it very much I stayed at the Beaver Hotel last month for   nights  Its a nice hotel    minutes walk from Earls Court underground and the shops on Earls Court Road I had a single basic room  which was small but very clean and value for money  Shared en suite facilities for the basic room were nice Breakfast was served downstairs  staff were very efficent and friendly There is a small lounge area with Satellite tv  nice to chill out there after a long day shopping Am alread planning another stay here in uary  
P =>  Reasonable and a great value  Hotel Beaver is in one of those converted Victorian style houses in Kensington  amp  Chelsea  It s just a stone s throw from a central Underground station  Earls Court   and a block from various shopping  services  and restaurants on Earls Court Road  Very convenient location  especially for the price  The single room I had was pretty small  but had television  en suite facilities  and a phone  Don t show up with a lot of luggage unless you get a bigger room  I d definitely stay here again  
P =>  Basic but adequate  Very affordable accommodation  albeit having fairly basic rooms  Telephone and all the other commodities were supplied  although the reception on the television was aweful  The most important thing about the rooms  which overcomes their basic qualities was the fact that they were perfectly clean Services within the hotel were good  breakfast was avalible in a nice dining room on the sub floor  Staff were very nice and helpful  overall a nice place to stay if you don t mind the simplicity

P =>   Great location and very good value for money The hotel is in a great location  within walking distance to the theatres and with bus stops outside  The staff are very friendly and are most helpful on the front desk with directions  The hotel is a bit dated but is kept clean  We had a room at the back of the hotel over looking the garden  it was quiet and again very clean  the room was reasonably sized for two  with a wardrobe each and a full sized bath  Would recommend asking for a garden room as there is a road at the front of the hotel which is busy  The breakfast was buffet style and was kept well stocked and fresh  was lovely  We would definitely go again a most enjoyable two days  
P =>   warm friendly hotel would certainly go again the hotel is a little dated yes BUT it is clean warm and friendly from front of desk to the catering staff and cleaners  we had a garden room ask for one when booking no noise at all and a lovely outlook   room furnishings bit dated but NO DUST OR GRIME    the bathroom had a full size bath even though room was not large but big enough for anyone  the bed was lovely i suffer with a bad back and woke up well refreshed    the food was off good quality well presented as a buffet  the staff looked after us well giving refills of tea or coffee and checking you were ok the hotel was busy but all was run smoothly     the bedroom itself was large with desk and comfy chairs to sit in and everything you could wish for  we would go again we stayed two days and it was lovely  redruthless 
P =>   good for the price A bit rundown  yes  Spotty internet  yes  Lots of street noise through the window  youbetcha  Indifferent staff  yep  Breakfast  indedible  really  BUT the location is just fabulous   right around the corner from the British Museum  at the heart of the metro system   and it s clean  Beds are comfortable  En suite is small  but clean and functional  For the price  this is a much better location and value than the bargain  quot Bed and Breakfasts quot  over on Gower Street  I d stay there again  and get breakfast elsewhere   
P =>  ent Hotel This hotel is not top price  It has a good location in Russel Square  nice and central  shops and tube station within walking distance The rooms are old fashioned  We had a twin which was acceptable size but all fittings and decor were dated  There was some noise from other rooms  The breakfast was help yourself and was acceptable only  I would recommend this hotel if you would prefer location and price over luxury of room  The staff were helpful and the room was decent  
P =>   decent hotel great location good value Very small single room which was old  but clean  Bathroom was updated and excellent  although very small  but full bath   The bed is quite uncomfortable and is definitely a  quot single quot   Breakfast is very basic and mediocre  The whole hotel is very old and not particularly updated  but clean  Fabulous location  Free wireless  I don t think I d stay there again  but I might recommend it  emphasizing that it is good value for money  
P =>   Great Location We stayed at the Bedford for one night and found it very comfortable  I had booked a Triple room  but it was just a twin room with a roll away bed added  It was fine for the one night  but the room was quite small for   people and would have found it to be to cramped if we had stayed longer  The location was perfect  central to theatres and shopping  The breakfast was very nice and you can eat as much as you like  We had a room overlooking the garden and it was lovely and quiet at night  Overall a very comfortable stay  
P =>  A great little hotel in a central position Stayed at the Bedford twice this summer while visiting London for some shows  We asked for a room on an upper floor facing the back which proved to be quiet and spotlessly clean  This hotel is not total luxury but it has many great features  one of which is the pleasant garden area out the back  The staff where always pleasant and helpful and the breakfast was fine  Perhaps the best thing about the hotel is its position  It is close to Holborn and Russell Sq tubes  although we walked and used buses quite a lot  The british Museum is just round the corner and there are lots of restaurants nearby  A tip for anyone staying for   or more days   invest in an Oyster Card  It s great value and can be used on buses and tubes  
P =>  Great location superstaff I stayed in the Bedford with my daughter  who is a regualr guest of the Bedford   from    th of y The room was booked by a travelagency with a preference for a room on the first floor When I checked in there was no twinroom available on the first floor I was dissapointed but within a couple of minutes another   much bigger  room was arranged for me I was told we could stay there for one night and move to a twinroom the next day The room was wonderful  two little bathrooms and a lot of space  Southamptonrow is a bit noisy but no problem at all The next day I asked at the reception or it was possible we could stay in the room  Ten minutes later it was all arranged without problems and without extra payment  We could stay there all four nights of our stay Really great and very kind and helpfull people there at the Bedford One other wonderful thing about this hotel is the lovely garden where you can sit and have a beer The location is great too  you can walk to all the hotspots London has to offer  Very close to mainstations   Eurostar  and bus  and undergroundstations  The British Museum is round the corner I definitly will book the Bedford again when coming to LondonThe Bedfordhotel gives you value for money  
P =>   A good hotel A good hotel in a good lcationPROLocation   not far from center    near tube station   bus stops just on teh other side of the roadEating and shops very closeCONSThe room on the street   st floor  is very noisy on peak hoursSome smog smell inside the room in peek hours 
P =>   ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL    Great Value and location This hotel is a little gem  The gourmet breakfast    all you can eat   is fabulous  The front desk help was exceptional esp a young girl named Yavonne  The location was super smack in the heart of three main areas on ALL needed bus routes and right near the tube station from LHR  
P =>   Excellent value for money considering location Stayed one night after seeing Warhorse at nearby theatre Room was spacious and clean with very comfy bed  Breakfast pretty good  Reception desk   friendly and efficient Superb value for money for Central London  
P =>   Memorable  for all the wrong reasons  Bedford can be good value for money  very central and not expensive  if you come to this     s style hotel  my room still had two wall mounted speakers with controls near my bed for tuning into their centralized radio programming   with low or no expectations  The housekeeping staff who know English can be friendly  Don t expect too much help from the front desk  one or two staff members excepted  Also know what to avoid  for example eating at their Caf  London which I will always remember for serving the worst salad I have ever eaten my whole life  That must count for something  On check out after three days  they charged me   p  yes   p  to store my bag for a part of the afternoon  I feel sorry for the porter whom I might have otherwise given a    tip  
P =>   No Problems We stayed for two nights  th and  th ch on a deal that included rail travel  B  amp  B and one main meal  The room was clean  well equipped  and very well heated for a   star rating  There was a good choice of hot food at breakfast  and the standard of cookin  food preparation and presentation was surprisingly good at for the one lunch we had in their restaurant  At all times the staff were helpful and particularly pleasant in the breakfast room  restaurant  Also the hotel was quite at night  All of this was in total contrast to the Royal National hotel that the same group ownes just up the road  That definitely is a hotel to avoid  My opinion  for the hotel are based on a   star rating  
P =>   Value for money great location and clean  We stayed in The Bedford hotel for   night as we were at a late theatre showing and didn t want to get a cab all the way home  I wasn t sure what to expect  but was pleasently surprised with this little city hotel  Parking is provided at a small charge  for London prices  underneath the hotel  We had a Double Room on the  th floor  It was small  clean and tidy  Bed was comfortable  bathroom was compact but had a bath shower  basin and toilet  soap and shower gel provided   Tea  amp  coffee making facilities and a TV  The room was a little hot  amp  stuffy but we opened the windows which looked out onto a lovely garden area  We were right next to the lift but heard no noise at all We walked from the hotel to Covent Graden in about       mins for a meal and then on to Leicester Sq for the theatre     and walked back afterwards  It was late so unfortunately the bar was closed but looked very welcoming Breakfast was good  Buffet self service consisting of Full English breakfast  cereals  danish pastries and toast  All served hot and with a smile  The Lounge area looked new and modern  fresh flowers  and had a lovely view out to the garden and pond area  which i imagine is a great place for a drink in the warmer weather The reception staff were polite and friendly I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone who just needs a bed for the night and is in London for the sights shows or shopping  
P =>  Good little hotel for the price I ve stayed at this hotel on four seperate occasions when visiting London OK if you want the  quot lap of luxury quot  then this is not the place for you  However for the price charged the hotel is clean  handily placed  good for the budget minded traveller and let s face it when you are in London you don t spend a lot of time in your room  The price included breakfast and  quot all in all quot  I ve not got any complaints or I wouldn t have had four stays One tip is to try and get a room at the back of the hotel overlooking the garden  Those rooms are much quieter if you have the windows open  which I do  than those facing Southampton Row which can be noisy Overall then I recommend this hotel as being good value for money  
P =>   great hotel will use again i have stayed at the other hotels that this group own imperial hotels  but i must say that this is the nicest yet bear in mind that it is only tourist class and dont expect all the extras and you should enjoy your stay i wonder where all the people that have made petty complaints in some reviews usually stay because i would like to stay in some of them hotels as long as the prices are comparable  you get what you pay for so stop your whinging and enjoy yourselves  
P =>  Good location nice hotel Had   nights   the Bedford Hotel in        Wanted a hotel with parking in city centre without paying through the nose  It seemed to fit the bill and it did  Parked in big underground car park  plenty of room  at Imperial Hotel  sister hotel  across the road  This cost about     for   days  The reception staff were friendly  as we left one helpfully came up the road after us to give us the parking voucher I d absent mindedly left  Room was nicer than expected  It was very quiet for a city centre location  but then we faced the back  where there is a quiet courtyard with trees and shrubs  It s a very good location for the price  within walking distance of a lot of the city centre sights if you don t mind walking  
P =>   Great find  Stayed at two other hotels in the Imperial Hotels group  President  amp  Imperial  and both provided a bad experience  I was expecting the Bedford on Southampton Row to be just as bad but had a pleasant surprise  The hotel has been refurbished  The room I stayed in had a new bathroom  a very comfortable bed  and although the furniture  curtains and bed covers are not new they have clearly been given a deep clean   they smell fresh  My room was at the back of the hotel overlooking the garden and I think it s worth asking for one of these as the main road is very busy day and night  The breakfast is good and the staff both in the restaurant and reception are efficient and friendly  The only slight downside is that the room walls are paper thin but as I sleep with ear plugs this didn t trouble me  I will definitely stay at the Bedford again  
P =>   Good Value Bedford Hotel  London  th ober     th ober     I spent three nights with three friends at this hotel and found it very satisfactory for the price charged  allowing for the fact that it is in London where prices are high   The room was clean  reasonably appointed and the toilet facilities in good condition with plenty of hot water  We had rooms on the third floor at he back overlooking the pleasant little garden so were not disturbed by the traffic noise  which could be a problem at he front of the hotel  The reception staff were very pleasant and helpful  we asked for an extra towel and were given two without delay  The breakfast was better than I had in a four star hotel in London last month and the breakfast room and staff were very efficiently organized by the lady in charge  I would not hesitate to stay here againE Middleton  Edinburgh 
P =>   Sleepless in London As soon as we saw the building we knew it was not going to be a great stay  it looked badly in need of some TLC  However my wife said  quot it s only for one night quot   so we went ahead and checked in  It was one of the few hotels that could get   of us in one room The room itself was straight out of the    s and the beds were on wheels  so every time you sat on one it rolled away  This was funny at first and then very irritating  I noticed how noisy the room was and assumed the window was open  On going to close it I realised that the so called double glazed windows were actually the prototypes  from when window designers were still working on them  Closing them made virtually no difference to the sound levels We went out for a meal and I was careful to drink some very strong beer to help me sleep  This worked for about   hours and then the traffic noise woke me up  I then lay awake for about   more hours  before finally giving up the struggle and getting up  The girl on the desk  whose English was limited  either didn t understand or didn t care  The bill was     UK pounds  When I think that this is double what I pay to stay at the Intercontinental in Toronto I realise what a rip off London hotels are If you are thinking of going there take some good earplugs or book a room at the back of the property  and then don t expect too much  
P =>   Good Value for Money Stayed for one night in e       Location is close to Holborn and Russsell Square tube stations  Room was decent size  staff friendly and helpful  and breakfast was reasonable  Overall good value for the price in central london  
P =>   Great value for money hotel Just come back from spending   nights at the Bedford  We found the hotel to be great value for money in a great location  You are only   minutes from Russell Square tube station  We were in rooms on the  th floor overlooking the lovely garden  a rareity in London   The hotel s public areas have all been recently refurbished and immaculately clean  All staff were friendly and breakfast was good  I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone and would definitely go back  
P =>  Not very good hotel My husband and I stayed   nights at the Bedford in early ch      The only good thing about the hotel is it s location   very close    minutes walking  from the subway station in the Picadilly Line  All other things importante in a hotel are not very good   The cleaness is bad  The size of the bedrooms are ridiculous     sm   During my stay there was no hot water in the bath  When you walk in the hotel reception it has a good design    but the rooms need an imediate refurbushing   The breakfast is horrible and the employees are rude  In the dinning room  there are lack of cleaness  for example in the towels and in the plates and spoons    I find quality price relation very unapropriate  But    we are in London were everything is very expensive My advise  pay a little more but stay in a nice hotel  
P => Not bad excellent location We just came back from a nine day stay at the Bedford  Yes  there are many better hotels in London but for the price of    pounds for a room located just steps from Soho  the Biritish Museum  Aldwych  the river  with a bus stop at the door   can you do better Staff were friendly  breakfast reasonable  water hot  but the bed narrow and only eight channels on the tv or ten if you speak German and French  Restaurants and pubs galore  Sainsbury s nearby   just ask for a room looking to the little garden But when you come to london to see the sites  do you need more  
P =>   Old but clean and staff is friendly I stayed at the Bedford for one night in il and agree with those posters who found the hotel clean and good value for money considering its excellent location  Admittedly  I was lucky being given one of the renovated rooms  a colleague stayed in an unrefurbished room and the difference was   smelly   and therefore have nothing to complain about  The room size was decent  for London   it was clean and I found the breakfast ok  The reason I rated this hotel as  above average  is due to the staff  they were incredibly friendly and helpful  We had an incident of a stolen bag  in the city centre  away from the hotel  and although the hotel had absolutely nothing to do with it the night staff on the reception went out of their way to assist were they could  making phone calls  trying to calm my colleague down etc etc  none of which they had to do  I stayed in London before and always found the polite coldness of hotel staff remarkably uncomfortable  especially when compared to hotels outside the capital I would recommend this hotel for its convenient location and relatively good value for money if you re not looking for something fancy and special  
P =>   Good value in a modest hotel I have very low expectations of UK hotels  They are usually overpriced  undersized and staffed by incompetent and unhelpful people  Someone from the US probably wouldn t grasp what an exception the Bedford is Rooms are a decent size with plenty of closet space  Free wi fi    an almost unheard of treat in the UK  Usually can cost up to     per night Furniture is a little worn  but comfortable and the room was clean Staff were friendly and helpful Location great for central London  close to Tube and bus stops By UK standards  very good value for money  
P =>  central location helpful staff pleasant stay Stayed at the bedford hotel recently when me and my girlfriend spent a couple of days in london to see the tutankumun exhibition and the terracotta warrior exhibition  we were a bit dubious after reading some of the reviews on trip advisor  however on arrival found most of the concerns unwarranted yes the facade is dated  but no more than those around it  Requested a quiet non smoking room and was given a room at the back overlooking the garden  with quite a pleasant outlook staff were polite  friendly and couldnt do enough to help even going out in the rain to hail us a taxi  found the hotel to be clean and not too shaby or dated  the room was spacious and clean altough the beds and pillows were pretty hard and as in most hotels the walls were paper thin But for convienence its hard to beat being close to both holburn and russel square tube stations on a road with plenty of places to eat and close to alot of the major attractions such as the british museum  Was plesantly surprised and would definately go again  
P => Great value A really great little hotel  The location is wonderful with a bus stop right outside the door  The room was very clean and the staff was wonderful  The restuarants in the area are great bargins  
P =>   Horrid place  I honestly could not tell which bothered me more  finding the interior of my room so stinky  dusty and filthy and my bathroom in such an absolutely disgusting state  toilet not even flushed  let alone cleaned  after the previous occupant  or seeing the rudeness and cinism of the staff when I complained  If this hotel were located almost anywhere else in the world they could only dream about charging people    pounds for this disgrace  Hotel Metalurg in war torn Bosnia    years ago is a five star experience compared to this  
P =>  Totally Satisfied Stayed at the Bedford for   nights at the end of tember and for one night a week later in ober  Rooms were small but comfortable  baths were older but clean and plenty of hot water  Staff friendly and accomodating  Had free wireless internet and staff moved me to a room with good internet recpetion when the room I was first given had a weak signal  Both stays I was allowed to check in to my room in the morning  which they do if the room has been cleaned and is available  This is a nice comfort if you have just flown across the Atlantic all night and arrive early in the morning  English Breakfast was included each morning and it was adequate and a nice opportunity to meet others that were staying at the same hotel  Excellent location two blocks from the British Museum  two blocks to the Russell Square tube station and walking distance  on a pleasant day or evening  to Covent Garden and the West End I have stayed in much more expensive hotels in London that I liked less  For a  quot Budget quot  hotel in London the Bedford is quite good and I will gladly stay there again  
P =>  I can t complain for the price and vicinity ideal location Although I had read some negative reports on this hotel  I decided to book anyway as it is so conveniently situated  really near to Leicester Square  Picadilly  etc  The price     for a double room one night with breakfast was not bad and I did not expect any frills for a   star hotel We arrived in the morning at      prepared to leave our luggage and go sightseeing  How surprised we were when they checked us in and we were able to go to our rooms I asked for rooms away from the road side and we were given rooms overlooking the garden without any problem The staff was very efficient  there was never a queue at the desk  they were friendly so we had no problems The price     for a single room     for a double one night with breakfast was not bad and I did not expect any frills for a   star hotel  The room was OK  you could open the windows  depending if there was a party nearby it could get noisy  I knew the bathroom was tiny and that you had to fight with the curtain but these inconveniences were little as long as everything was clean Breakfast was a buffet with a choice of two juices  cornflakes and the usual muesli collection  eggs fried or scrambled  bacon  the usual unhealthy looking white bread and toast and on the second day I saw some soft brown bread  Fruit was the conserved ones  No joghurt or cheese  I was quite content with this as I did not need a big breakfast  The breakfast was airy and bright with a view of the garden  Excellent quality was its vicinity near to everything  The buses stopped almost in front of the hotel  It was between Russell and Holburn station  After a day of touring  we got back about  pm showered had a catnap then we were off again for the evening entertainment  
P =>   Gem for budget travellers  There is not much I can fault the Bedford on  I wasn t expecting luxury for the price and location  but what I did get in return was a comfortable and friendly hotel  The location was brilliant for people who want to explore London s sites  I would recommend www walkit com  which offers great walking guides around the city  You can see on the site just how accessible everything is by foot from the Bedford  My husband and I saved quite a bit of money walking rather then paying for the tube The bedrooms are roomy and comfortable  Contrary to the Gentlemen s comment below I found I had an abundant supply of shampoo and shower gel  I would also have to disagree with this comment concerning the House Red Wine  I m not sure if hefound himself with a bad bottle but we thoroughly enjoyed it  and are quite looking forward to drinking it on our return visit I found also that booking through the hotel directly can also save you money  www imperialhotels co uk  Overall I would not hesitate in recommending the Bedford   It has friendly staff  comfortable rooms  a great location and an even better price  I hope you all enjoy your visits to London as much as my Husband and I did  
P =>  It is Value Location   Five   ten minute walk from Euston   a couple of minutes from Russell Square Tube  amp  on major bus routes to Waterloo  In the evening if you want to make your way to Covent Garden it is about    minutes walk or a    taxi ride  In all a good location Parking Surprisingly for a budget London centre hotel there is underground parking   never used it myself so you had better check if this is important to you  The building    I would say late      s infill block on Southampton Row    The hotel has five floors   on the round there s the reception   bar  amp  lounge  amp  a small conference room  Condition of d cor is OK   but it could do with some updating but it is clean to be fair you would go to the Bedford for value  amp  location rather than architectural beauty  Reception  amp  Public areas   A welcome feature of the Bedford is the rather nice garden to the rear   this opens from the pleasant lounge area  The restaurant is very simple but is roomy   amp  clean  The corridors could do with a re carpet  amp  the d cor is need of lifecycle update  The Bedrooms   Braise yourself   you step into the      s   the single rooms are long  amp  narrow with a  cabin  feel to them  The bedside switchgear controls lights   radio  TV   the speakers are built into the curtain pellet   as I say       I have always found the rooms clean   a couple of colleagues have made negative comment but I would say for a night or two it is fine  The double rooms are a good size   so given the budget price suggest you  treat  yourself  A plus of all rooms I that the windows open  The bathroom   A bit small   but clean  Shower is above the bath  Only soap provided so bring your own shampoo  Food   Only ever had breakfast there  which is good  The lady in charge of the breakfast service is very efficient  amp  her team are walking around all the time clearing tables  amp  filling cups  I have stayed at some of the best hotels in London  amp  I have to say the service in the Bedford Restaurant  for breakfast  would put others to shame  The only negative comment on Food  amp  drink is the quality of the house red wine   it is terrible so stick to he beer Staff   I have been using the Bedford for about a year   staff turnover seems low   the reception people are very helpful  I have already mentioned the restaurant lady The housekeeper I believe has also been there a considerable time  In all you are well looked after  Over all   the Bedford for under     a night is OK for a couple of nights on business   you would not go your honeymoon there  It is part o the Imperial group who have larger hotels in the area   The Imperial   The President  amp  the Royal National  I believe Bedford guests can use all the facilities  including Swimming  of the other operations  I think the Bedford represents excellent value  amp  provides good service at this end of the market  Tip   Book a room at the back over looking the garden   or high up if on the front   bring your own shampoo  amp  don t drink the house red wine  
P =>   What an experience During t      my wife and I visited London for the first time and was a little apprehensive  The flight out of South Africa arrives early in the morning and unfortunately we were not allowed to check in  We stored our luggage  at a fee  and hit the streets  Later on we were given a double room with a garden view  as requested  although it was right next to the elevator and this was very noisy   Fortunately the people above us left their water running  our room was flooded and we were VERY prompted given another room  Here I must compliment the staff at the frontdesk  Our new room was a twin but perfect in all aspects   again with a garden view We never ate anything other than breakfast as there are so many good quality restaurants in short walking distance  The breakfast is to be polite  quot hitting the spot quot   Nothing more and nothing special  We did have a chuckle over the Chinese lady who runs the room like a military bootcamp and the guests are her soldiers  You have to see the humour in this   The front desk staff is very helpful and friendly with the exception of one gentleman who obviously missed his real ambition of an undertaker  The rooms and the general public areas are clean  We had friends who stayed up the road at one of the sister hotels and they complained about the constant noise  The Bedford is quiet except for the one night when the people in the building adjacent had one heck of a party The hotel is very conveniently situated close to the Russel Square tube station  From there no place in London is too far with a day pass on the Underground  Being from South Africa we obviously found walking around at night extremely safe  A number of good quality restaurants in the area and for the traveller there s a Bureau de Change across the street Overall I ll recommend this hotel to anyone not too fussy or used to being in the lap of luxury  It is a good value hotel and it provides everything you want and expect when you are on holiday  In fact this will be the first place I ll consider for my next visit to London  
P =>   Value Stayed at hotel Bedford as part of a  Superbreak  hotel travel theatre package for Sound of Music  you must go if you can  it was fantastic   Hotel fairly good  staff in general fairly good  Breakfast very good  You get what you pay for and I would stay again for a short break  however  my only reservation was the evening meal  The waiter served a bottle of white wine which had never seen any form of cooling  and when asked provided an ice bucket  The food was not good really  my wife s chicken had been cooked for some time and was very dry  My steak which was over cooked was replaced for one that was well done although asked for medium rare  A lady on a nearby table sent her burger back because it was raw in the middle It is a pity that the lady who is in charge of the breakfast operation isn t used in the evening  she runs a very efficient ship I would request a high rear room as the road at the front is fairly busy  Plenty of pubs etc nearby and just a short walk to Holborn or Russell Square underground Overall  fairly satisfied and would stay again but wouldn t eat in the evening  
P => 	 s revival The bedford is a reasonable base in a prime location for public transport  You are   min walking from Russell square tube  and   min from Holborn  The hotels public areas are shiny and modern  The hotel room I stayed in was firmly in the      s  BUT in the classier end of the    s  A few of the reviewers commented on the comedy built in consoles  personally I found speakers built into the pelmets quite amusing  the switch to transfer the radio music to the bathroom highly amusing  the important point to note is that this hotel is dated  not worn out  the maintenance people here must be doing a damn good job  I found the breakfast perfectly ok for a   star hotel  continental do not get croissants  but do get danish  quite a reasonable danish selection  I would avoid the toast it tastes like cardboard  The staff seem curteous and friendly  the hotel room keys are substantial  I can normally wander off with a bit of metal wood  these could be used to build bridges with  The standards of cleanleness are ok  room for some improvement I would say  ie they dust where people would normally look  The hotel locale I would consider safe at night  a fair few restuarants in the area  represents good value for money overall  
P =>  I d go back  Went for weeekend break    feb     feb  On arrival i was greeted with friendly staff  i asked for a room out the back and the receptionist smiled so she must get this often and i m glad i did as i would imagine its quite niosy in the front Double bed room was ok  its a bit old fashioned but who cares when your only going to be there to sleep  Room is not huge but its big enough for   people and the room is clean which is very important  Room was warm but no sign of air conditioning for those going when its really hot Its cheap and cheerful for London as other hotels are very expensive and the location was excellent    mins from metro and very walkable for those who go for a late late drink I would recommend this hotel for people who don t have loads to spend on the top hotels and are going to london to see london and not spend all of it in the room  
P =>  Ok Stayed at the Bedford for   nights from   th    th Really nice   clean   spacious twin room Breakfast was quite good    be careful  you have to pay an extra   pounds for English breakfast  continental breakfast is included  but for some  English isn t  I don t know why  Best to ask first One of the reception staff  a male  wasn t very friendly  but the others were really nice I recommend the Bedford  and great location  Have agreat time  
P =>   Back to the    s Having just stayed at the Bedford  I ve looked at the other reviews and can  t recognise the room I stayed in  It may be that we had single rooms  but they were small  extremly dated with furniture  consoles from the   s  dirty curtains and  being at the front of the hotel very noisy from the traffic on Southampton Row  The bed didn t feel too secure either  The bathroom was a reasonable size  but the shower had an old style mixer tap above the bath and the temperature was difficult to control On the plus side  it is very conveniently located with it s own underground car park and the breakfast was OK Not having stayed in Central London for quite some time I don t know how the alternatives compare  but at     per night it was at least reasonably cheap  
P =>   Simple Friendly Staff Super Location Good Value  Stayed for   nights in t      Pluses   Location location location  Fab part of London   Lobby   airy and lots of glass for people watching   Friendly staff   cheerful and helpful   Breakfast was fine and better than expected  Although a    supplement for Full English   Twin bedroom was spaciousMinuses   Bathroom was basic and could have been a little cleaner        AM checkout  No A C  ok in winter but probably terrible in Summer   False fire alarm at       HRS Overall   I booked this hotel at very short notice and having scoured the tripadvisor pages decided this was the best option available to me  I paid     for a twin room inc breakfast  We were given a lovely room at the front with views up and down Southampton Row  This could work out a bit noisy if you are a light sleeper because it is likely you will have to open the windows most of the night  I loved it because it was all the hustle and bustle of London Directions   from Gatwick get the Gatwick express train into London Victoria      return fare   At victoria buy a day ticket for zone     on the Tube          Catch the tube to Green Park  one stop  and then take the piccadilly line   stops to Holburn  Come out of the station   turn right   cross the road and walk straight ahead along Southampton Row  The hotel is on the left hand side after about   minutes walking Great wee find  
P =>   good for business It was my second stay in Bedford hotel for   nights  It s good for business trip  Central located  Room was clean  But breakfast is poor  like in all english hotels under   star

P =>   Great ValueGood Location My partner booked this hotel for a weekend visit to London  As other s comment the hotel looks nothing from the exterior We were welcomed with a friendly greeting from the receptionist  Our room     was spotlessly clean a little small but perfectly acceptable  The bathroom again was spotlessly clean and well appointed with a lovely shower which feels like a power shower  The bed is very comfy  One word of warning to the ladies  the hairdryer in the room did not work and even though the receptionist gave me access to another room to try theirs that one did not work either  The breakfast is basic but acceptable  The best thing about the hotel is the location      yards to the Oval tube  on the Northern line only   stops from Leicester Square  so you are in central London in    minutes  A great value hotel  We will definitely use again  
P =>   A really good affordable hotel We needed comfortable  quiet  affordable accommodation near to the Oval  and there aren t many options available   but the Belgrave suited us very well It is situated within a few minutes walk of the Oval tube station  The exterior is  shall we say  unpretentious  the interior is a lot smarter I booked online  and check in was quick and stress free  I have to say that all the staff we encountered were charming  helpful and friendly   and very efficient Our room was not enormous  but did not feel cramped  It was spotlessly clean  and comfortably and intelligently furnished and equipped   crisp white bed linen  wool carpet  good mirrors and fittings  lined curtains  flat screen TV  safe  tea  amp  coffee making facilities  hairdryer etc  We had a full bathroom  attractively tiled  with a shower over the bath  huge fluffy white towels  dispensers of shower gel and handwash We were at the front  overlooking Clapham Road  but apart from the occasional emergency vehicle we were not aware of traffic noise The price included a simple Continental buffet breakfast   croissants  toast  cereals  yoghurt  fruit  plus orange juice  tea  but only instant coffee The breakfast room is in the basement  Whereas a lot of money has been spent on refitting the hotel  with marble  pale wood  wool carpets etc  the approach to the breakfast room has been neglected and lets the place down   it is frankly dingy  The breakfast room itself is bright and clean but has the air of a works canteen  plastic chairs  no curtains      As such a lot of money has already been invested  it seems a pity not to complete the job with a few cosmetic improvements in the basement  say pretty curtains  wood tables and chairs  a few pictures We had read up on the place  and seen that it was originally a   star hotel  upgraded to   star after the refit  I feel the classification is over generous  it felt like a standard   star hotel to me   and it probably does the hotel no favours as it raises people s expectations  For   star accommodation I think you expect real coffee  I suspect that some of the unfavourable reviews that appear are from people who have looked at the classification not the prices  which are definitely NOT at   star level Our stay was quiet  comfortable and we will definitely stay there again if we need to visit the area  One important point however to bear in mind  our bath was raised quite high above the floor  and would have been difficult for anyone very elderly or disabled  Worth mentioning any such requirements when booking  
P =>   A great find  We found this hotel when we were looking for an overnight stay and what a find it is  We ve already booked up to go again  We go down to London for a weekend about once a month and this hotel is perfect for us  It s literally   minutes walk from the Underground station so easy to get about London and the value for money is great  The hotel doesn t look much from the outside but is modern and clean inside  The rooms aren t big so if you were there for a longer time then this may be an issue but we find it absolutely fine for a weekend  Free wi fi is a bonus and it works perfectly  The breakfast was fine but the breakfast room is a little small  you may have to wait for a seat  Not really a major problem though  There is a nice restaurant across the road if you don t fancy going into town for dinner  
P =>   It was OK Me and boyfriend decided to stay in this hotel after reading the reviews on this website  Basically you do get what you pay for  The room was clean  and bedding changed every day  Nice bathroom  The look of the hotel  once inside  was really nice  and although the majority of staff were foriegn  some people have moaned about this somewhere  were really nice  The location was very good for getting into london  The problem i had was with the breakfast  and we stayed fro our days and only ate their once  as on the second day there were ants crawling all over the breakfast table  on the food  and up the drinks  I just didnt think this was suitable  But other than that it was fine  
P =>   value for money        we loved it    the belgrave hotel is located across the street    min walking  from the  quot oval quot  tube station which is a part of the northern line   two stations from waterloo  and westminister         min and u are in the middle of everything we  a young couple  stayed at the belgrave between the       of september we found a small hotel that wasn quot t the ritz but did the job the room was small  but very very clean    the bathroom and shower were nice and clean  we got new towels every day  and the room got cleaned daily there was a small LCD television with a lot of british chanels  the room also contained a small kettle with coffee and tea  the room also contained a small safe  without extra chrage   the double bed was clean and very comfortable  the continental breakfes was everything that you need   coffee or tea  cereals  several kinds   pastery  hard cheese  orange juice  jam  butter  and toasts  and again everything was very clean the hotel staff was very usefull and nice   they helped us in everything that we asked  the belgrave hotel is absolutly value for money  we left the hotel very pleased   everything there felt nice and made our london experience fantastic  
P =>   Great cheap hotel Me and my brother stayed in Belgrave Hotel   nights  It is located very closed de OVAL tube station and was fairly easy to find  The neighbourhood was clean  quiet and safe  It s is a chip hotel Staff were very nice and helpful  The rooms were a little small but it was very clean  very nice witht LCD tv and new furniture The continental breakfast also made for a good start to the day 
P => Great little Budget Hotel  We stayed at the Belgrave Hotel in Oval for our   night short break to London  We were looking for accommodation on a budget as we wanted to spend our money on eating out and having a good time  rather than accommodation that we would hardly ever be in The Belgrave Hotel fulfilled all of our requirements for a comfortable stay in Central London  We paid      for the two of us for   nights  which was great value for money considering how central you are  The nearest tube station  Oval  is literally a     minute walk down the road from the hotel  and pretty much every famous attraction  Big Ben  London Eye  Oxford Street  London Dungeon etc  are within a    minute tube ride from the Belgrave The only drawback that I could identify from this hotel was the size  The double rooms are very  quot compact quot  and this would definately be an issue in the summer as the rooms do not have air conditioning  On the other hand  for the amount of time that we were actually in our room  this wasn t too much of an issue The hotel was immaculately clean and tidy  towels and bed linen changed daily  and the continental breakfast comprising of cereal  fruit  croissants  toast  tea  coffee and orange juice was more than adequate to set us up for the tiring sight seeing days ahead All in all a great little hotel  don t think you d find better quality or location for the price  DON T be put off by the non descript exterior of the hotel  as this really isn t reflected inside  
P =>  Great little inexpensive unpretentious place I must say that I ve read the reviews on this site before of going to stay at the Belgrave Hotel and  since not all were positive  I went there with a certain trepidaton I was   instead very pleasantly suprised  especially because I had been staying at couple of equally priced small hotels in the area  and other areas of London  which were a real nightmare The Belgrave is very nice and recently refurbished  Nice Rooms not very large but ok  I stayed in a twin room   the furniture and bathroom fittings were all new and in perfect condition  The reception personell was very kind and competent  the room was clean and comfortable  The Breakfast is continental and a little bit on the unimaginative side  I would have been happy to pay a little bit more and have an English breakfast or at least a bit better variety of it or otherwise  skip it all together and save a couple of quids  All in all not a bad small hotel at all  at this price  hotels in London are way more expensive than almost anywhere else in the world  I would certainly reccommed it and I will be back The convenient position  just a few hundred meters from the tube station at Oval  is very good indeed for the tourist or the business person  you just hop on the tube and for the modest price of a daycard London is open to you all day  well  at night you need a taxi because the tube stops around         Being the hotel on a very busy street  Clapham road  I should have slept in a a room with windows on the back of the building since traffic is very intense at night with the occasional Police car or Ambulance   but I was tired and slept all the same  The car park  I didn t use it but I saw it from the breakfast room in the basement  is indeed very small and provides not the easiest of access  but I never go by car to London  
P =>   No nonsense cheap hotel  I travelled to London with   friends to visit anopther friend who lives on Clapham Common  We chose the Belgrave  two tube stops from Clapham  over closer hotels because the reviews were better  We were not disappointed On arrival we got out of our taxi and looked around for the hotel  It really is an ugly building and if we hadn t seen the interior photos we would have been concerned The lobby is small with a reception desk manned by a single person at all times  There are a few seats but it s not a place to be hanging around for extended periods  The reception staff were always friendly and we had not problems with check in out or access  via intercom  The rooms are small as expected but clean and well equipped for a short stay  The bathrooms are well maintained with good showers  One area for improvement here would be the provision of towels and a shower mat  Be careful getting into the showers because the bath floor is very slippy and there is no mat Breakfast does finish quite early        so we actually didn t make it down after our night on the town  This is something to be aware of if you are on a weekend away Overall this is a clean functional city hotel for a weekend away  it s not the Ritz and he rates reflect that  Don t be expecting anyhting fancy and you will be happy  
P =>  Belgrave is a joke Booked this hotel for new years eve  we rang to confirm that parking was available and were told it was booked and we needed to pay     upon arrival  On arrival parking was not reserved and after a discussion with the manager managed to argue for a space  Access to the parking is via a steep ramp that scraped both the front and rear bumpers of our car while parking involved being given directions by hotel staff that didn t speak a word of english and kept banging on the roof of the car  The hotel claims    parking spaces  there is only room for   and that is with cars jammed on a bitof scrubby ground  departure for some car owners required moving most of the parked cars out onto the main road before they could get out  The web site for the hotel shows a picture of the exterior of a completely different building to the hotel  the hotel exterior in reality is shabby at best  The sign on the front of the hotel indicates that it is   star it s not it is   star  Breakfast was abysmal with bone dry cold croissantswith butter and jam and cereal as the only option As for the room the water temperature is very hot  got scalded in the shower  and at  ft   in the bed was too short for me in the room meaning a bit of discomfort  The only plus side was the room was cleanand the receptionist was good at her job  The only english speaking staff I encountered was the manager and the receptionist  Probably theworst hotel I have stopped in apart from a Manchester Travel Inn If you don t want a breakfast and are not in a car and shorter than memaybe your experience will be better but DON T park your car there  
P =>   You get what you pay for This hotel is perfect for the wallet conscious traveler  The hotel is clean  you get a small room and a tiny bathroom and the hotel is located one block from an underground tube station  Other reviewers mention safety concerns  There were no suspicious types while I was there but hey  you re in a budget hotel so you might not find the most snappy dressers in the lobby  The rooms have locks  there is a safe so there are no security issues as far as I was concerned  If you are afraid of your own shadow  stay home  The front desk staff are of eastern European origin but I think you ll find this is the norm for London s hospitality industry  I found the hotel staff to be competent  helpful and friendly  You want to save some     and don t mind a small room  Stay at the Belgrave Hotel  
P =>  Lovely little place Stayed over at this hotel for   nights at the beginning of  with my boyfriend  We had a lovely time in London and we were more than happy with the hotel It is very good value for money  clean  comfortable and friendly  The continental breakfast also made for a good start to the day  The area is well linked to the city  by bus and tube  and seemed pretty quiet and relaxed  There are a mixture of ethnic groups and ages in this area it would seem and despite what others have previously said on here  we never saw nor heard any trouble and felt safe going about during the day and the evening The staff were friendly and happy to help when asked for assistance  The rooms were well maintained and  for the money  comfortable and spacious  Its simple  clean  safe and close to town without being  in the middle of it all   I would recommend this to those travelling to London and not wishing to pay over the odds  
P =>   Unbeatable value for money I spent    nights in London     single room    double  while attending a course at King s College and  obviously  considering the length of stay accommodation around Park Lane was out of question  After a tiring megasearch in the net I ended up to the Belgrave s web pages and was lured by its clean looks and good basic facilities  Considering the price      for a single     for a double  in central London I was both hopeful and terrified about what to expect True  the first impression from outside is unconvincing but inside it was a different place  The hotel must have been refurbished quite recently  The public areas were clean and tidy  The small reception hall was basic but worked great with current newspapers and LCD TV  and a cute aquarium on the wall   I paid for my single nights on arrival and for the doubles when checking out so I m not sure what the actual policy is  The staff was very friendly and spoke good english  contrary to some previous opinions in this thread  I got my single room from top floor street side  Despite it being one of the smallest I ve ever had I ABSOLUTELY loved it  It was impeccably clean and modern with everything perfectly at hand  LCD  safe  water heater  hair dryer   With ample light from three windows it was the coziest ever and I really felt home  There were a couple of desk drawers  an open closet and a luggage rack but no other storage space  The bed was comfortable with a good pillow  Electric outlets with multipurpose sockets were located in the bathroom  for shavers        V  and within the digital safe  WLAN was available for       h  The bathroom was spotlessly clean and the towels were changed daily  Absolutely no complaints about housekeeping here  The water pressure in shower was great   actually there was only one pressure level  high with adjustable temperature  I would have appreciated a separate handheld sanitary shower by the toilet  however The traffic on Clapham Road is lively  especially during the rush hours but it didn t bother me  When my girlfriend arrived the staff with kind intentions placed us to a big room on the quiet  but a bit junky  backyard side and I requested to get back to the street side which they arranged in a couple of days despite a full house  We stayed in a double room on the first floor which resembled the single I had  The double rooms  being larger  somehow lacked a bit of the cozyness of the single and weren t quite as  quot fresh quot    but very clean and tidy The breakfast  inclusive  was quite basic but gets you started  The small buffet consists of cereals  yogurt  toast  croissants  marmelade  cheese  fruit  juice  tea and coffee  The breakfast room is small but full of natural light  There were also two LCDs for watching morning news  nice feature  The hotel is located on a very spacious streetside in a suburban neighborhood and the locals are a mixture from various ethnic and socioeconomic groups  Every now and then I came back from downtown after midnight and not once did I feel unsafe  The hotel is only     m and one minute walk from the Oval Underground station and several night buses stop right in front of the hotel  There are no dark alleys and the area seems quiet in the night  Right across the street there is an internet cafe  a    h supermarket  a fried chicked takeaway also open till late and a couple of peaceful pubs  I don t know what life is like further down in Stockwell but the area seemed totally ok  to an academic go better like myself  grin   The location was good  Even without a Zone     Travel Card  which is an extremely worthwhile investment if one wants to effortlessly explore the city  one reaches the Thames at Vauxhall bridge easily in    minutes by foot and Westminster   South Bank within half an hour  The tube takes you to from Oval to Waterloo in   min  Charing Cross    min  London Bridge    min  Piccadilly  lt     min  Oxford Street  lt     min  Kensington    min  Greewich    min  In addition the numerous bus connections leave almost from the doorstep All in all  I consider Hotel Belgrave an unbeatable value for money in central London area  It is very clean with modern services and friendly staff  Unless someone treats me with a       per night downtown experience  I will surely be staying in Belgrave again  
P =>  Clean Safe and cheap Having read reviews we were very pleasantly surprised  The place newly done up and the staff very pleasant   Its very cheap for London but much better than travel lodge etc Just for the record   The lift does go to the breakast room   The doors have the usual double locks so no one is likely to break in and there is an in room safe  The breakfast is continental ie some cornflakes and toast but what more do you expect for the money  The place was spotlessly clean   The staff are not English but this is London No one who works in hotels is English     I would recommend to anyone  
P =>   Trust negative reviews I and my niece stayed for several nights at this hotel  We looked for affordable accommodation  but we should have read first the reviews here  It seems all the negative points to be true  It did not seem a secure hotel  with a lot of suspicious people either in the lounge or outside  The staff are entirely of foreign origin  barely understand English  We didn t feel secure and checked out earlier than planned  So trust negative reviews and book another hotel  
P =>   One of the best After reading some of the reviews i was a little bit wary of bokking there  check in was fast and i was shown to my double room by the staff who i found very hepful and willing  i was really impresed and wondered about the validity of the other reviews There is no restaraunt but as i undrstand there are plans for a restarant and bar which would really make this place really lively  There is a lovely italian right across the road and many other restaurants in the local area The hotel is across the road from the Oval tube station and close to waterloo Our double bedroom was spacious  however there was no airconditioning which could get hot in summer  A double room cost    pounds and was more than excellent value for money on par with Confort Inn  holiday inn express  The decor is nice and did not hear any noises in the night or anyone at the door There is a    hour reception which wuld make it ard for any intruders to enter the hotel without purpose  The hotel also has wireles internet access  lcd screens and sky I highly reccommend this hotel and would not stay anywhere else when visiting this area  
P =>   Fantastic Hotel Excellent hotel for the price we payed inclusive of continental breakfast  Hotel has been newly refurbished and at the moment there is no restaurant or bar however as i understand from speaking with the helpful and very friendly staff and management there are plans to develop a restaraunt and bar in the near future  I honestly wouldn t stay anywhere else and would highly reccomend this hotel as it is excellent value for money Rooms have LCD Screens  Rooms Safes  En suite  tea coffee facilities  International sky channels  wired and wireless internet access  
P =>   Great stay for catching Eurostar We needed a hotel for one night before catching the Eurostar early the next morning  This was the perfect stay and very close to the Oval Underground  Tube  stop which is only a few stops from Waterloo station for the Eurostar  Don t be worried from the exterior of the hotel   it s not got much curb appeal  It s located next to the Belgrave Hospital  The inside of the hotel was very nice  The front desk staff was friendly and helped us get settled in  The room was smallish but immaculate  All new furniture and fixtures  Very clean  It s a contemporary style and quite lovely  Nice hair dryer and television Breakfast is included in the hotel price  There was a small continental buffet in the basement  The area of the hotel wasn t really ideal  Clapham   but would be convenient for sights in South London  The hospital noises were slightly distracting and I would suggest getting a room in the back away from the busy street  Anytime we need to catch the Eurostar  we will stay here again  
P =>  Basic clean modern affordable for London This is a fairly new hotel near the Oval Underground station in Lambeth which is in south London  Getting from here to everywhere you might want to go in touristy London is close by via public transportation  It s in a very nondescript modern building  but inside everything looks freshly decorated  The rooms are small  as are most London hotels  but are impeccably clean  Shower pressure is great which is very important  There s wifi or wired internet available for a fee  and limited parking  also for a fee  in the underground secured parking lot  We paid    pounds for a twin bed room  including continental breakfast   hard to beat that rate for a decent hotel in London  The staff is quite friendly and helpful Some minor drawbacks  it s on a very busy road  Clapham Road  so request a room facing the back if street noises bother you  There s no air conditioning  so it could get hot in the summer  Closet space is very limited  And though that shower pressure is great  the shower stalls themselves are so tiny that it s a bit hard to even turn around  All that wouldn t deter us for staying there again though Note  this is NOT the same as the Belgrave House Hotel  for which there are several  mostly negative  reviews here  
P => 
P =>   great location grotty rooms I stayed here for only one night luckely  It location is goord just a very short walk from Victoria station  Its cheap and cheap for a reason  as they do not invest anything in the comfort of the guests  The hotel is a maze of corridors and stair cases which are not suitable for anyone with a disability  I would question the safety of the place  as there was at least   fire extinguisher missing from its location  the cleaning staff left bags of rubbish and dirty laundry at the top and bottom of stairs  a calim waiting to happen  The rooms are poorly decorated and appear dirty  I felt the need to wash my hands before using any of the light switches as they were caked in grime  The shared toilets and shower facilities were dirty  I could go on  but like the cleaners there     I can t be bothered  Would I go back  No  
P => Location and Value Good but what do you expect  I know there are several reviews slagging this place off  but we stayed in a twin room  for        per night per room for   nights in central London  just close to Victoria Coach station and main line station  If you are expecting luxury accomodation for that money go some where else  The outside and reception look nice  but as others have said it is not a true reflection of inside of the public areas and bedrooms  which are very basic  We didnt do breakfast as got allergies etc  so cant comment on that  However there is a microwave and fridge for guests use  and that prooved handy with a Sainsburys just down the road at Victoria Station  If you have ever back packed abroad and stayed in hostel type accomodation  this is what its like  As we we were out for all of the day  this place was purely as a base to sleep  and with clean sheets  and a bed  it served that purpose adequately for     each  If you want something a bit more than that  then you are going to have to pay more  or compromise on position and extra costs and time in travelling to central London  its thats simple  For the price and location its hard to beat  just dont set your expectations that high for that price  
P =>   DON T SAY YOU HAVEN T BEEN WARNED     Only two pictures on here respresent the hotel  The picture of the outside and the lobby    the bedrooms look nothing like the clean spacious ones in the pictures  The truth is the the bedrooms are filthy  Fitting hnging off the wall and the wash basin in the room hadn t seen a cleaner in weeks  A dirty foot mark on the wall next to the wash basin  I came to London last week for a meeting and decided to travel the day before in order to be fresh for a  pm meeting  I really wish I had not bothered  The bed was so uncomfortable that it was easier to sleep on the chair and from the moment you step out of the lobby your feet stick to the filthy carpets  The shared bathroom left much to the imagination and as for breakfast   toast and cereal  but again I did not eat in the breakfast room because the tables and place mats were all coffee  tea stained  The staff what I did see of them everythiong appeared to be too much trouble for them  I could not honestly recommend this hotel  even though it was cheap it still was not worth the money  however the location was brilliant  I think with a bottle of disinfectant  new carpets  new bedding to replace the old ripped stuf and plenty of staff training this hotel may warrent it s one star   DON T SAY YOU HAVE NOT BEEN WARNED    
P =>  Convenient  Cheap  Friendly  Given my budget and my requirement to be close to the tube station  this place was perfect  If you re looking for the Ritz  dont  stay here  If you re looking for affordable accomodations in the heart of Central London  this is your place  Staying here allowed me to spend money on other stuff  London s expensive enough as it is  I don t need to drop      night just so I the tiles in my bathroom are of the highest quality  
P =>  Clean Room Good Service Perfect Location Great Value Booked a room for my parents coming from Australia  I coudn t complain about the hotel  You get a Clean room for Great Value  all serviced included like Wifi  breakfast    and don t forget the Location  it s perfect I will certainely recommand this hotel  
P =>  Best bang for your buck in London  Me and my friends were backpacking through Europe and came across this place in Central London  A   minute walk from the Victoria station tha takes you everywhere in London and close enough to Buckingham Palace and Picadily Circus where we could just walk if we wanted  Service was great  And the place was SUPER cheap  You can t even tell it s a   star hotel when you walk in  Would stay there again given its location  service  and price  
P =>  Great value for a great price I was in London this past weekend for a conference  This hotel was in a PERFECT location   right next to Victoria station  The service was great  the rooms were great  and I had access to wi fi internet which was a huge bonus  And above all  the price was very  very reasonable  Other visitors for the conference were paying a lot more and didn t get the   on   service  had to pay extra for the internet  and were not as close to a tube station  Definetely great value for the price  Will stay here again next time I m in town  
P =>  It IS possible to have quality and affordability  I was in London for a week this past ust with some friends  We stayed at the Belgrave House Hotel and it was great  Friendly service  perfect location  clean rooms  and very affordable   Will certainly stay here next time I m in London  They served breakfast every morning and provided Wi Fi access to internet  
P =>  Use comforter under the sheet to cushion from the bed springs The room was incredibly cheap  GBP    night  The value was incredibly good for this area of London  but it s a shame that they didn t spend the    pounds or so for a mattress pad to take some of the bite out of the crummy mattresses  That said  with the bed comfort being my only complaint  it wasn t a bad place I have stayed in two other budget hotels in this area  and I would recommend one of the two over this one Recommending this hotel solely on the rock bottom prices for the rooms  
P =>  Give it a try I stayed here last month  and after reading the reviews before I booked  i thought that this place would be a modern day  quot Fawlty Towers quot   I only booked because of how cheap the place was  and was pretty chuffed at the end of my stay  The rooms are really basic and lack alot of amenities  But then again  this is a budget bdget hotel  and they dont make any claims to be anything other than  Its location is faultless  the hotel is clean  and the service is pretty standard   no concierge here    I would definitely stay again  and would recomend this place if you are after a few nights of cheap sleep  and not much else  
P =>   not bad at all We book the hotel from their website at a very cheap prices  Quite Surprise for what you get when you come  Everything is included included the breakfast  For        i could not expect more  I have to say  the hotel is very basic and Public bathroom need to be redone  Room were clean and this is what is the most important  
P =>  Yucks  DISGUSTING  Please do not be tricked by the photos on the website  It is totally a fraud  And the receptionist is so unfriendly and demands payment the moment I came without even stepping into the room  Somehow I felt that they were afraid that the moment I stepped into the room  I might run away from the hotel  it s like a very lousy hostel with the price of a budget hotel  
P =>   Borat s Brothel    This should definately be in the Top    Worst Hotels in Europe   Its an experience one can only describe as shocking and unreal  My room was basically up   flights of narrow stairs  no lift  and on entrance to my abode I witnessed pure horror  celiing covered in crap  a smell in the air that can only be descibed as dust mixed with sweat plus guests in the shape of bedbugs  It also had a square box with visible springs which must have been the bed  the window was single glazed and filled with muck and fossilised animals  the lock on the door was flimsy and falling apart  the bathroom looked like something out of a third world country and the staff were definately illegal immigrants   which is surprising as the UK Passport Office was only over the road  I think this is definately not a  hotel   but more a  half way house  for illegal immigrants that are trying to get UK Residency  My company booked for me to stay there    suffice to say I no longer work for that company no more    Its definately BORATS BROTHEL   
P =>   dont call the police if ur room when ransacked they not interested take heed from the advice here   we stopped here due to working close by  its not a hotel  its a bedsit for eastern europeans   no disrespect to eastern europeans people live there u have to share bathrooms with people that live here  their shower gel  shaving and toothpaste are all lined up in the bathrooms dont not use room  aits a basement room next to the resturant      haha resturant  ok woteva     ours got broken into  no body could speak english  the police didnt care and the cctv only works in reception when u have   very upset and angry guests who shout at the receptionist     per room is     for a reason    ask to see ur room b  u take it    i promise u   its so worth it   dont waste ur time asking for an upgrade either    rooms are all the sametake care please   learn by other peoples mistakes 
P =>  Not a nice hotel they trick you I feel tricked  the pictures shown a their website only show the best parts of the hotel  The lobby looked very nice but you got a terrible shock when entering your room  The bathroom was really disgusting  looked like it had never been cleaned  The people who worked there didn t act very friendly  The TV didn t work so I was told that someone would come and fix it but nobody bothered to turn up The money spent on the big TV in the lobby could maybe have been spent on some good beds and cleaning instead 
P =>   Grave House I stayed in the hotel with my wife from      nd         The front reception is the only good looking place in this so called hotel  They decieve people with a large screen tv that never works  The rooms are so small and with spring beds   There was no toilet roll in my toilet  They did not put on the heater despite their promises that the boiler would switch on at      pm daily  On our last night  it was horrible  There was blood all over the hotel bathroom and the hotel staff were alerted in the night but nothing was done to clean it until about      am in the morning For any complaint  the answer is that the place is for only bed and breakfast and they should not be bothered The breakfast was basic with unfriendly staff at work  
P =>   Exactly what you expect As others have stated the staff aren t particularly friendly  but if you are looking for somewhere cheap and easy to stay in a convenient location  then this hotel will certainly meet your requirements  
P =>   you get what you pay for this hotel needs a good clean and the staff need to learn some manners electric sockets hanging of walls mould in bathroom pigeon muck on window sills  inside the room  toilet rocking while you sat on it dirty linen never changed in the   days we were there light kept flickering on and off good points the reception and dining room was nice as was the front of the hotel we had a lovely time in london and only used the hotel to sleep in if the cleaners and maintenise people done there job properly this would be a lovely hotel would i stay here again maybe as it was cheap and in a grat location  
P =>   This place in infested with bugs   do not stay here I stayed here at the weekend  After the first night I awoke covered in bites   at least    of them all over my body so the place must be infested  You wouldn t get that many bites from one or two bugs  I asked to change rooms but was told none were available  I asked for a refund so I could go and stay elsewhere but I was told by the receptionist that only the manager could issue refunds and that they didn t know when he would be in  I wrote down the complaint and left it at the reception along with photographic evidence  I have not heard anything yet regarding the refund  I had more bites after the  nd night and they actually turned very nasty  amp  inflammed  amp  I had to go to hospital  I am a budget traveller and used to roughing it  amp  staying in hostels but I have NEVER experienced this before  My friend didn t get a single bite but regardless there are bugs of sorts in this hotel  The blankets on the bed were very old  amp  dirty  The hotel looked nice enough from the outside but inside is a different story  Please heed my advise and don t stay here  
P =>  Loved the Belgrave House I had a great time at the BHH  The room was cozy  small   I received fresh linens everyday  had a shared bath  but never waited to use it  The price was right  cheaper than any other place near where I wanted to stay in London  The people at the front desk were very polite and helpful  The breakfast was a little on the weak side  Toast  coffee  and cereal were all I needed to start the day  The layout of the hotel was a little strange  no elevator and narrow staircases  but after a full day in London  a few more steps were not a problem I would gladly stay there again  The price along with the location made this a good value  If you are looking for a safe and affordable place to stay in London  near a transportation hub Victoria Station is less than a   minute walk  you will not be disappointed  
P =>  Mixed experience To start with the good points  It is cheap and the location is excellent  just a few steps from Victoria station We were three persons in one room  Old beds  cheap mattress  The ensuite was a joke  more a shower cabin with an included toilet and sink  All on   sqm   A breakfast with cereals and toast was included  I will not stay there again altough the price of     for three persons per night incl breakfast was ok  But consider cheap price  cheap accomodation  You get what you pay for The next time I would look for a B amp B nearby  
P =>  Never again  Just got back from staying in the Belgrave House Hotel You walk into the reception and think  quot  well yes this looks fine quot   Leave your aspirations there because it just went down hill FAST  Opened the door to the room and thought  quot Oh my God quot  Forget the pictures on the website  Was met with a view of filthy windows which looked out into the rear paintwork was so badly neglected the wood was bare and lifted Bed looked ok  with a cobbled together sink unit in the corner an open box which was supposed to be a wardrobe and a separate loo in which the tiles were broken anydwas minute Thought ok it was only for one night  Returned to hotel after midnight and went to bed   of the thinnest pillows and   blankets on bed AND NO HEATING  Put excuse for a heater on and ended up putting our coats on the bed to try and get warm   It was too cold to go and complain   Breakfast consisted of orange juice cornflakes and toast   no choices of juice or cereal  Luckily the rest of our short trip to London was fantastic and would recommend the show Buddy and a restaurant on Buckingham Palace Rd called Bumbles top notch   course meal for         
P =>  Never Stay Here Me and   friends stayed in this hotel for the weekend  and the hotel was basic and a bit dirty  but I was bitten by bed bugs and ended up bringing them home with me  I have contacted the hotel several times to complain and I have never received any acknowledgement nor any apology  This hotel is cheap for a reason    The area was good and there is an easy hotel a couple of doors down  STAY THERE   
P =>   Underwhelmed by Belgrave House Hotel Do not stay at this hotel if comfort is of any importance to you  The mattresses were old  thin  and comprised of nothing but springs covered by some fabric  Consequently  you can feel every spring on your back  In three nights  I did not get a single good night s sleep because every time I would move  the springs rudely reasserted their presence abruptly waking me from my slumber  Additionally  the  quot double bed quot  my companion and I requested was two single beds pushed together  which is okay  but the configuration only added to the discomfort  They really shouldn t have bothered with the pillows considering they were about as thin as the sheet  At a minimum  this hotel should invest in some decent pillows to improve the service to their guests  Although  the rooms are non smoking  a subtle but unpleasant odor of cigarette smoke permeated the room  We had an ensuite room  but the bathroom was so small  it was difficult to even turn around in it  It looked like one of those prefabricated bathrooms made for RVs  which was stuck into a corner in the hotel room  We had a TV  but one day it didn t work at all  and the other days  it received only four channels with pretty poor reception  two of which seemed to be airing darts tournaments      Beyond the lobby  the corridors and rooms look run down   do not believe the photos on the hotel website  which make it look modern and minimalist  Breakfast was spartan   choice of brown flakes or cornflakes  coffee or tea  and white toast with butter and jam  but I suppose that is to be expected with the cheap rate  Despite its numerous shortcomings  this hotel has two things going for it  Location  and cleanliness  as far as I could tell   So if you are on a budget and don t mind discomfort  this may be the place for you  
P =>   Would look elsewhere next time Accidently booked this hotel thinking it was the Belgrave Hotel in Oval oops  As it was for only one night it didnt really matter though  however from the reviews Ive read I think that hotel is of a superior standard  Our room was small barely room for a double bed and a wardrobe  containing a safe   A portable tv was provided with terrestrial  We saw a cupboard door in the wall that in fact turned out to be our en suite  it was very much like a train toilet which caused us some amusement  It was moulded out of plastic and somehow contained and toilet and a shower  Toiletries were provided and the the shower was very powerful and water hot The room was clean  apart from the blanket on our bed which had some cigarette holes in   Luckily we didnt need it as the room was very warm  One thing I noticed was that as our room was on the the ground floor it would be very easy for someone to come in the window if we had had it open and this would be a concern in summer  It didnt seem the most secure of hotels  The breakfast was included very basic tea coffee  cereal and toast in what seemed like a newly decorated dining room Location is excellent literally round the corner from Victoria Station  Overall I would say you get what you pay for      inc b fast  but I dont think I could stay here more than a couple of nights as I found the room quite bland and depressing  Also I would have been concerned about leaving valubles there  despite the safe  but that just a personal opinion and I could ve asked to change rooms  Its a bed for the night and not much more  
P =>  Terrible beds Although this place is convenient  cheap  and fairly clean  if you don t like springs piercing your body all night this is not the place for you  We spent   nights there   nights in one room and   nights in another room  We shared our room with friends and between all of these beds and rooms we did not get one remotely comfortable bed  It literally hurt to sleep due to the springs poking through and jabbing your body  Very uncomfortable  I have spent many nights camping and slept in various cheap youth hostels  but these beds take the prize for worst ever  Breakfast was also less than desirable  
P => Nice hotel very good prices Belgrave House Hotel has an excellent location with walking distances to a lot of places  Victoria St  is just around the corner The hotel has a friendly staff  which is very helpful  I upgraded myself to a nice doubleroom with shower for at few extra pounds a day  The included breakfast with toast  coffee tea and cereals is a fine start each day The small  goodlooking lobby is wellprovided with brochures  maps and leaflets for all the sights and museums in London and area  The lobby has also automats in which you can buy soft drinks  beer  chips and chocolate Some of the rooms are a bit worn out  but they are clean and good I will properly stay here again  
P => Not as bad as people Say This hotel is clean  and don t expect the Ritz  but the staff are friendly  its a chance for you to experience the real  quot london quot  and not the cookie cutter hotel experience  depends on what you like  I guess   There are shared bathroom facilities  and some rooms have their own shower inside  and when I stayed    nights in total  the bathrooms were always kept nice and clean  the beds were comfy with clean sheets  and I felt safe  Might I mention as well LOCATION  Its is just seconds away  on foot  from Victoria Station  shopping malls  bars pubs  coffee shops  restaurants  theatre  for musicals  etc    etc  etc  etc  Also close by  like a five minute walk or so  is Buckingham Palace and the Queens Gallery  please go see this Art work its AMAZING   So  for younger travelers or couples  this is a bargin and not only will you save money on your accomodations  you will save money on transportation too  PS Although we didn t get up early enough   breakfast is included in your stay at the Belgrave House Hotel too  That also saves some money  So  if you are wanting to go to London on a budget  this is the place for you  I ve stayed at   star resorts in Jamaica before and at the best hotels  and really  as long as the bed is clean room is clean  its safe  and in a GREAT spot  you can t go wrong  I gave the Belgrave an above average because you can t beat friendly service and a great location  The staff there let us stow our luggage and took it to our rooms for us  we arrived very early in the morning  so we could go site seeing and not miss a day waiting around or dragging heavy luggage about  They offer any help they can give  and are very friendly and accomodating  The hotel is actually a large house manner rennovated into a hotel  and lots of floors  no elevator  but not hard to find way around  Hope this review helps  PS go see the musical  quot Chicago quot  you won t regret it    
P =>   No Frills Concept Hotel gets basics wrong We stayed here for   nights in ember  We were attracted by the good location and the no frills concept  Why pay more for all the friperies  Unfortunately  this hotel has got the basics wrong For me  the minimum requirement is a comfortable and warm bed     However  the bed frame screeched with every move  the matress had seen better days and I could feel the individual springs in my back  the pillow was approx  cm thick giving my husband neck problems  and the sheet and blanket were insufficient to keep us warm through the night After three sleepless nights  we were extremely happy to get back to our own bed The rest of the hotel is fine   clean  but tired in some areas   very new in others  Breakfast was basic but sufficient But I would not stay here again  
P =>   Typical  get what you pay for  hotel  I booked a triple room for one night for     through last minute  Don t be fooled by the lovely reception area  Me and my two friends kept saying to ourselves  it s just somewhere to sleep for one night   however  the beds are like metal camp beds  The mattresses are thin and wires poking out everywhere   so uncomfortable  The pillows are so thin it wouldn t have made much difference if we were just led on an empty pillowcase  Breakfast is toast  white bread only  plonked down in front of you  And basic ceral if you help yourself  You have to ask for a drink  which is ONLY tea or coffee  The staff did not speak to us at all  I do not know if this is because they are all foreign or because they are just plain rude The only good thing about this hotel is that it is a      min walk from Victoria stations  
P =>  Not bad if you just need a bed I had to go to London twice in a month for one night stays so I was on a budget The location is brilliant  it s a short walk from the coach and train station with a bus station and tube station within a   minute walk  I booked twice without checking it out first  but I was happy enough with the hotel not to cancel after the first visit  Although English is not the first language of the staff  I had no communication problems  and I was given all information on arrival from very friendly staff  The room was clean  small but not cramped  The first stay was just a bed and sink but the next time  for the same price I got two beds and a shower Although it was a communal toilet  it was clean  with plenty of paper  but they could do with putting a towel and some soap in there as I had to go back to my room with wet hands and wash them again properly with soap The mattresses could do with replacing  as they re a little worn  but the sheets were clean  even though you didn t get a duvet  just a sheet with a fleece throw over  which reminded me of a youth hostel  But it was quiet  and you get a peaceful nights sleep  The room also had a TV but it had poor reception  although it was still watchable  The room also had an interesting smell of cheap tortilla chips  sort of  corn and salt and some kind of cooking oil  Open a window and it s fine though Breakfast is from           am  the first stay I went for breakfast I had a    minute wait for a table  but this was partly because a couple kept asking for more toast and coffee  They must have gone through a whole loaf  but this meant I was rushed  It was only toast and coffee and cereal if you wanted  and it s so close to food establishments the second time I stayed I went elsewhere for breakfast Overall  it s not the best hotel  really it s almost a hostel  but for one or two nights it great  why spend more money when you just need a bed  I would definately go again but if I was staying in London for longer than a weekend I would go to a more upmarket hotel  because I can imagine it may get a bit depressing after a while  
P =>   Not bad  Not great  Just okay  This Hotels location is very good  quiet  central  clean  respectable  The reception is well kept and presented  and staff reassuringly friendly and generous with a smile  no complaint whatsoever  only some broken English  Beyond the reception area the decor is very basic and possibly in need of being retouched in places  however  everywhere was clean and tidy  The reasonably spacious room resembled an inexpensive bed  amp  breakfast  just meeting my basic requirements but rarely surpassing them  A sparsely furnished room with sink and colour television provided a functional rather than comfortable feel and meant   night was probably sufficiently bareable on my own  This is the kind of accomodation you would welcome a place to rest and could enjoy London  but little else  The mattress needed replacing but was okay  I slept well  Considering the price and the location I think it is pretty unfair to expect anything more realistically  If on a tight budget and not too fussy  probably worth considering  
P =>  No problems   perfectly adequate for the price  Some of the other reviews are harsh  What do you expect for       a   star hotel  Agreed it is not the most up to date decor  the carpets are a bit tatty and there are cracks on tiles in the bathrooms etc but so what  I found it to be perfectly adequate and exactly what I expected for the value   a clean and reasonably comfortable bed in a safe hotel and  contrary to other reviews  I found the staff to be helpful and perfectly friendly as long as you are courteous to them as well  There aren t many showers if you don t have en suite but they are absolutely fine and clean enough I have stayed in better but not for     in the centre of London  I would stay there again if I was looking for cheap accommodation  
P =>  Stay Away  This place is horrible  I booked a room with a double bed  I got there and it was two single beds pushed together  and the bathroom smelt like something had died  I complained at the front desk  The desk manager yelled at me  He was very rude  He ended up shoving me  My poor husband had to step in  It was an insane experience  My advice   there are a lot of hotels in London  Skip this one  
P => Beware  Didn t actually stay in this hotel   despite making a phone booking  because I found the Reception staff very rude and unhelpful  A great location and very reasonable rates  but one to avoid if you prefer a bit of friendliness and a helpful manner  
P =>   Frozen feet and Icy staff My girlfirend a I stayed in the hotel between   st december a  nd of uary on order to see the newyear fireworks  The Hotel iswithin walking distance of victoria station   which is the best thing I can say about it as at least you have a quick route of escape   The reception area is plush  with marbe flooring and modern decor  giving you an impression this is a clssy establishment     BIG MISTAKE    We checked in  my girlfriend making the arrangements as the staff virtually ignored me  We were then directed to our room  next to the kitchen area and smelling of bacon and sauags constantly due to the paper thin doors   The bed was of campbed standard  and the decor was falling apart The shower cubicle had mildew  and the last guest had left us a  quot present quot  in the toilet      obviously hant been cleaned prior to our arrival  The first night we hardly got any sleep as the room was freezing  The radiators were turned off with the dial missing  I reported this to the reception  and was shouted at for not reporting it sooner  I asked if we could have an extra blanket  and was told no  I asked for someone to look at the radiator  and they told me the would bring down an electric heater  This took   days and   requests  and when it arried it was brand new   me thinks they had gone out and bought it that day   We had also paid for breakfast with our room  but did not use this until our final morning  Breakfast finished at  am  and we arrived at       Breakfast was a bowl of cereal and coffee  but I had the bowl wrestled from my hands by staff who told me  quot the other guests have eaten     why sould you be special   quot Cheap       but certainly not cheerful

P =>   OK for   night Our family of   stayed at the Astoria for   night on y   th  The reception was very polite and there were no problems with the reservation  We had booked a room for   and that is just what we got  The check in is at       and we showed up about       and the room was not ready  We just left our bags and came back     hour later and it was ready  Going into this hotel we expected very little for the price and that is what we got but the room was clean and the shower worked great  Make sure you pack shampoo because they only supply a small bar of soap  The breakfast was served next door in the basement of the Belmont and it was suprisingly good  It would have cost our family of   close to    pounds to eat out but this was included in the    pound rate we booked through EasyToBook com  The checkout was at       a m  also but the reception allowed us to leave our bags so we could spend the day in London w o lugging them around  The location is only about   blocks from Paddington train staion and tube which is great  There are plenty of places to eat w in waking distance and the Cad bar just around the corner has probably the least expensive drinks in London  I would sugest that if you stay more than   night to find something better but for   night it works fine  
P =>   WORST hotel EVER      MAYBE IT S A LONG DESCRIPTION  BUT PLEASE READ IT  THIS IS THE WORST HOTEL EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD The room was older then me  Needs a totally makeover  the curtains stays to fall  the double bed is one a half close to the wall so you won t fall off or because the room is so small  the ancient doors reminds me of the comunist east  the windows hardly open and they are also as old as the room is  the view is       walls and nothing else  the windows were not washed since the falling of the Berlin wall seams like  the furniture is falling apart  so i was afraid to use it  there was a water cooker and some coffe and milk  but the cooker was never cleaned inside i guess  and the   cups on the table you can still see the rest of the previous lipstick or coffe in it  the tv was small and dark  maybe because the dust is everywhere or because of the smoke before the smokink law  anyway  the only   chanels it s enough if you manage to switch on  because the remote control was broken and taped with tape so it bearly hold togeter  we got no shampoo  no shower gel  just   small pieces of soap of the lowest quality possible  we asked for shampoo  they dont have it  The bathroom was very small  you bearly manage to sit on the toilet seat because the sink it s right onto it  and the shower curtain is old and almost rotten  you can also see rust on the floor and door  well that was the room The included breakfast it s no more then english breakfast wich is served along with a very small glass of orange juice and   toast for two   try and ask for more  the RUDE personell working there might give you more  but not be pleased that you asked for more  you can get coffer but only if you are there in time  half an hour before closing they stop cooking coffe so you might not get one  the cereals are on a table and nothing else  you get butter and the same   kinds of jam every day  i want to repeat myself so you can get the picture  The personell working in the breakfast room are RUDE  they don t smile  bearly say good morning or speak properly english  they get almost angry if you ask for something more or else to variate  They start cleaning the tables and remove the plates while you are still eating or holding your toast  maybe because right away they start cleaning the room and running to the next hotel  cleaning the room  you are asked to leave the room so they cand clean  they DON T came again later  and about cleanig  they just fill for coffe and milk and arrange the bed  they dont change the sheets every day  we got new sheets because i insisted after   night  The ONLY positive thing was the all right one smile personell at the reception  but no  they didn t have a map of the city and one evening at   pm we had to wait    min outside because it was closed  and this is a    hours reception hotel All in all  expensive  dirty  rude stuff  no internet  not so great area and not good breakfast  
P =>   Pay some extra pounds and choose a other hotel Very small room  Sleep   nights on same sheets  get clean towles not until ask  twice  If you like bacon and beans       after all don t choose this hotel  Pay some extra pounds and choose a other hotel 
P =>   Nice staff serving breakfast really friendly people My experience was generally good  rooms were clean  clean toilets sheets and towells  there was a cleaner keeping the room clean and tidy every day  the breakfast was reall nice  and the staff was really friendly I don t know if the rooms in Belmont building are diferent  but I went to the astoria  allthough the main reception and breakfast was served in the belmont  it s the next door if you are in the astoria   The only reason I am not rating as an excelent is because of the receptionist that received me and my friends  the only staff member that wasn t friendly at all  
P => disgusted anglesey stayed in the belmont part of this hotel   the photos for this must be from the astoria or another hotel  we booked for our visit to the hyde park calling concert  would rather have camped out in the park in the pouring rain  tiny rooms musty smell  with very narrow stairs leading down to the cellar I think   when we woke in the morning hundreds of ants crawling all over the place coming in from a hole by the door and walking along the dado rail  did pass a comment to the staff but were not interested  couldn t get out of there fast enough  never again   
P =>  Clean and comfortable The location can t be beaten  within walking distance of Paddington Station and Hyde Park  Front desk is open    hours which helped when we checked in at midnight  We stayed in the Astoria which two doors away from the Belmont  Our quad had a small bath en suite  Room was clean and tidy  Tea and coffee provided in the room  Breakfast is served in the Belmont and was proper English fare  Room had little character and no pictures on the wall which was not important but noticible  Staff was helpful and friendly and very nice to our young children  I would return to this hotel 
P =>   Don t go there  This hotel is not at all as the photos from the website and from the internet  They have very small horrible rooms  with VERY narrow stairs  and the windows can t be opened  The furniture looks as from the communist schools  and believe me i know what i am talking about  because i am from an ex communist country  They have no fridgeas they say  no mirror as in the photos  the tv was not working  no towels when we checked in  we had a horible twin in the top of the building  and the guy from the reception charged me before seeing the room  Then he told is not his fault they are not towels  and the photos are different  He promised to give us another room which he never did and when i was asking him why happens all this he simply played he doesn t hear  Finally  he changed the tv with one which was working The only quality this hotel has was the position and that it was clean  Sussex Gardens street is full with hotels  so choose another  They are planty of them  all loooking better

P =>  bareable for the price Well for the price paid this was a fairly standard hotel  it was a little taty in places but our room was ok  the bed was fine and the building was quite grand  just in need of some tlc The area was very nice and it was close to a tube station  about what you would expect for this price in London If you are delicate about your surroundings then perhaps not for you but about the standard you would expect from an older hostel  Bareable really  
P =>  Don t know what all the fuss is about   Perfectly aceptable I stayed here with a few friends from Uni at the beginning of il    th and   th and I found it to be good value for money  OK its not the Ritz but what can you expect for the Money particularly given that breakfast was included in the price  Its also located in a really nice park of London  Which is unusual as most budget Hotels tend to be located in less affluent areas  Anyway  i would stay here again  Its clean  ok its basic but its worth more than I paid any day  
P =>   disgusting As you can see in the candid photo  it s just a broken house with rooms for travellers  The reception counter is just a small table  There were painting dropping off from the wall in the reception area  You can see electric cables coming out from the wall  There were nothing in the room except your bed  an old TV and a broken wardrobe  There was only   soaps provided in the toilet  The breakfast was cold and no one was going to refill if the trays were empty  The tea was cold as well  The staff were not friendly  I just felt like being in a haunted house there  
P =>  Belzise Park Hotel was very good value for money Excellent   Got a quad room  which they specially organised for us   usualy quad rooms have   double beds  and   lads dont want that   Rooms were simple  but adequet for us as we just wanted a base camp to rest in while we went around Camden  a short busride away   The breakfast was very good  good quality self service full english with tea  cofee and orange juice  Between   of us it was        a night  and for anywhere that is extremely good value  never mind London  Very good value for money  
P =>   Avoid this hotel like the plague Avoid this hotel like the plague  Run down   there were holes in the stairs on the way to the upper floor on which I stayed  the curtain on the windows was too small to cover the area  there were disgusting stains on the carpet  hairs on the bath  bathroom and bedroom were very spacious for London   no bedside lamp  no tea coffee facilities  television only had one channel and was snowy  very very basic pay the extra and get somewhere decent  
P =>   All you need from a hotel  except new furniture  We stayed in a double at the Belsize Park Hotel during the Bank Holiday weekend and found it altogether appropriate for the price  At     night for the double room and a location in Zone   North West London  this is a decent budget hotel It looks like some decoration work was going on during our stay  with a few carpets having been taken off the stairs and a smell of paint all over the corridors  The interior of the hotel is reasonably old with torn stained carpets and shabby furniture  The room was basic  with no view  actually it looked onto another window in the alleyway   no TV  phone and not even the  quot tea making facilities quot  so loved by the English  However  the ensuite bathroom was clean  the shower was warm and had good pressure and the bed was comfy  So altogether  an ugly room which performed all of its basic functions perfectly The staff were all absolutely lovely  smiled a lot  were ready to chat and kept our bags safe when we turned up too early for check in  The   most surprising good points  and turners for my review  were these   Room Service  I wasn t expecting any  but while we were out the staff made our beds and brought fresh towels   The Breakfast  Even though we turned up way late for breakfast on the Sunday  I m sure they told me a different time       we were immediately offered cooked breakfast  It s nothing spectacular  vegetarians get beans and scrambled egg   but still a surprise at that budget  They also have cornflakes and toast with butter  margarine  jam and honey All in all  I would be happy to stay at the Belsize Park Hotel again when on a tight budget

P =>   some one should phone the RSPCA      this place is not fit for dogs   my friend and i booked this hotel through active hotels  the photos on the web site look light and airy  on approach to the hotel we could see this was not going to be good as the net curtains were black  on entering the hotel we were hit by the smell of greasy cooking and nicotine  NICE    the room was worse      the paint was peeling  the carpet was dirty the bedspreads had ciggarette burns in them and the shower was mouldy   how this place has never been condemmed is beyond me  it s a health hazard   we only stayed five minutes  when we checked out and said why we were leaving she said no one had ever complained before       as for other hotels  we got into the holiday inn just around the corner for the same price   
P =>  To be avoided     Bentinck St  London W  is to be avoided  The hotel bears no relationship to the facilities  service and food advertised on their website  No coffee tea in rooms  only toast or cereal for breakfast  Dingy rooms and scruffy   mould in the tiles   bathrooms with no soap and only handtowels  The only saving grace was that the beds were clean  
P =>   different hotel Bentincks  one is great There is a Hotel Bentinck aka bedstink  and the very pleasant Bentinck House hotel  Do not confuse the two  the one by Oxford Street is very nice  
P =>  Bed Stink We stayed in a hotel that was oppodite the main train station in Nottingham It was called Hotel Bentinck  we renamed it hotel Bedstink  It was awful  Four single beds crammed into a dbl room and a charge of      The brochure looks magnificent   the reality is a huge disappointment  The  en suite  bathroom looked like a prefab built into a shabby bedroom and I was afraid of what may be sharing the bed with me   Be he alive or be he dead   The bar below was the kind of watering hole you wouldn t dare to frequent even if DYING of thirst  Everything looked discoloured  dirty and dishevelled  Stay there at your own risk  
P => 
P =>   Quick Overview Location is good  but transportation with underground from Victoria station is not so fast  Room is not very small  but there is not enough free space for two people  Bathroom is extreme cold and tiny  Stuff are Ok   
P =>   Great location small rooms The location was great  We could walk to the tube in less than   minutes  There were plenty of small stores  gift shops  restaurants  pubs  and fast food places just around the corner  The price was very affordable too  The rooms were very small though  The hallways were tight and only   people could fit in the lift  The lift didn t always work either  I got lost using the stairs  The hotel seems to be a bunch of old row houses put together  It is like a little maze  Our first room had a shower that I could not fit in  It was very uncomfortable  I asked to have my room changed and the new room was much better  Also  the toilets didn t flush that well  I asked the manager if they could have some vegan food available for us in the restaurant for breakfast  He said that he would  The first morning they had nothing but toast  We asked him again later that day and he said they would have soy milk for us the next morning and that the fruit they provided was vegan  The next morning came and they had no soy milk  The fruit looked like it came out of a can  I think the price for the breakfast is not worth it anyway  Go out for breakfast  You ll do better  Also  there is a great panini shop around the corner  Get an iced tea there  It is the only place that seems to have them  
P =>   Great Value for money   Staying again next year   We stayed here for two nights at the start of the trip and couldnt believe the location  wow its amazing its a short walk to the tube  parks and internet access  We found the serivce accommodating  and helpful  The hall ways are a little narrow and long  but the rooms are newly renovated  ours was   The room was clean  comfortable  and the bathroom was lovely   There was a litlle noise outside in the evening  but when u have been travelling for ages you become quite exhusted quickly and dont notice it   Breakfast was amazing so much food  its a great start to the day   We are staying here again next year  we really loved it  
P =>   Worn out Hotel but great location and reasonable price Stayed for two nights at this hotel  Was thrilled with the location as it was literally minutes from two tube stations making getting around London very easy  Lots of nice restaurants and cafes within steps of the hotel  The hotel itself is nothing to write home about  The outside of the hotel is very pleasant but the rooms do not reflect the same  We stayed with our   kids   two teenagers  two younger   with two hotel rooms  They kindly upgraded us free of charge upon arrival and thank goodness they did because the  suite room  we were given was just a larger size regular room  Our teenage boys rooms was very small and stinking of smoke but we didn t want to move their room as they were located near our room on the same floor  The rooms were tidy but also smelled damp  Bathrooms were clean  DO NOT EAT THE BREAKFAST   total rip off and lousy  go to the small italian cafe attached to the back of the hotel for a great and reasonable breakfast  Overall  I would stay at this hotel for the convenient location and reasonable cost if you are just needing a place to put your head for the night  If you are looking for something special or to spend more time in your room then don t recommend to stay here  
P =>   good location nice room gd location  near   tube lines  room i got was new and nice  got free upgrade to superior room  downside was that it has no a c and cld get warm at nite during summer   opening the windows don t help much too  another downside was dat it was noisy at nite coz there is a bar below and i was woken up a few times coz of high revving vehicles  my check out receptionists weren t friendly too  no  quot thank you quot  or  quot see you again quot  from her  
P =>   Excellent value for money You can literally fall out of Bayswater tube station into this hotel it is so close  Upon arrival we were upgraded to a superior room as ours was still being cleaned  Room was very nice and plenty of room for the two of us  Bathroom was clean and tidy and the shower was really big  We saw the standard rooms as well and I can see why people moan about them  We have booked the superior room again for a few weeks time at just   GBP per night  Really nothing to complain about at all at those prices  
P =>  Clean and well located   that s all The hotel was clean and in prety good decorative order  It is very well situated within    yards of Bayswater Undergorund and     yards of Queensway underground  Their rack rates look horrendous but Internet prices seem just about ok for what you get  The staff seemed friendly enough and efficient  The room was tiny with a tiny shower room   no bath  How two people could fit into this double room I have no idea  The room  like  I think  very many of the hotel s rooms  was at basement level  with a rather insecure window into an area  and reached by a labarynthine series of steps  doors and corridors   luckily  on arrival you get a guide  The room was quiet until anyone in an adjoing room talked loudly or flushed the lavatory  The hot water was only luke warm and the radiator was stone cold  I did not try room service or the restaurant   there didn t seem much point with a cosmopolitan array of eateries just    yards away on Queensway  
P =>   Walls made of paper The foyer is deceptive  the rooms are quite buget  run down  Beds are hard  pillows thin and old and the walls are made of paper  could hear everyword of the TV in the next room  Staff were helpful  the problem is with the hotel itself  I would have rated this hotel average instead of poor if I had been able to get some sleep  
P => 	   very amusing experience It s been my first trip to London for a week  I payed     DM a night  an increadable price  about     bp that time  The staff tried to give me the smallest room on  nd floor with the smallest door  to reach with the smallest lift   I could enter the room only one shoulder in front         no place for my suit case    After a lot of theatre they gave me a  possibly maidens   room under the roof  with view over chimneys of the neighbourhood   qm I think including the smallest bathroom   shower   x  cm  all the bathroom about    x   m  I had to clean my feet separtely         The curtain always sticked on my body  lol     Breakfast after waiting in a queue  directed by lots of employees  not neccessary to take it there    Nice bedlinen from Laura Ashley  allways extremly cleared up    Good environment  tube  shops  park  restaurants  Knowing all this  would I stay there again   be  After beeing cured from claustrophobia              
P =>  Small and loud but good location I didn t directly pay for this room  so I do not know how much it cost I stayed in two different rooms here and both were very small  One was very awkwardly arranged  There was no room in either room for our luggage  The bathrooms were also tiny  and one of our bathrooms had a leaky ceiling  This hotel was extremely noisy in the early mornings  One maid actually knocked on our door at  am and asked if she could clean the room  She woke us up  Starting at  am every morning we could hear the maids in the hallway talking quite loudly  Also  if you get a room near the elevator you ought to ask to be moved  You will not be able to sleep it s so loud  The breakfast was alright  over priced  Internet was over priced as well  Both of these things could be found right around the corner on Queensway for much much cheaper  The location and proximity to Hyde Park and two Tube stations is perfect  The neighborhood is great as well with many dining options and some cheaply priced tourist shops The hall ways also stunk very terribly of cigarette smoke  the entire time I was there  This is difficult to deal with when you huff your way up four flights of stairs to get to your room and you can t get a breath of fresh air  
P =>  Good quality price I found this big deal with my travel agency and I have to admit that     per night  Breakfast included  across New Year s day  usually this hotel is cheaper   was brilliant  I was in a single room  really small  with a tiny toilet  but was really clean and comfortable  with TV and everything  The breakfast was really good with a huge variety of stuff  e g  croissants  muffins  cereals  jam  toast  white and brown bread  ham  cheese  yogurt etc     and if you want the English breakfast  it s just   quid more  The location is great  just    m off Bayswater station with every amenity just a pace away  shopping centre  Tesco  shops  every kind of restaurant etc    I really recommend this hotel for your short and long stay in the  Big Smoke     
P =>  Smallest Room i ever been We stayed at the Hotel for the Christmas Holidays  Bathroom is the smallest i ever seen in my life  I can t even shower without bumping my legs to the toilet bowl  Doors are noisy and room outdated  They also have the smallest Lift i ever encountered  Not recommended for people who have claustrophobia   You might get claustrophobia here  Ha   
P =>   Great Breakfast  We stayed at this hotel as we were going to the Notting Hill Carnival and it was absolutely fine  Perfect location for the tube and all the bars and restaurants We paid a very good price which included full english breakfast which was soooo good  Very surprised actually  Yes the hotel was a little tired looking and the bathroom was tiny but we did have a fairly spacious room with a nice view so we really couldn t complain at all All in all I would stay here again  
P =>   Good location but wouldn t stay again As heading to Wimbledon for the tennis I picked this hotel for its location with easy access from Euston and also to the championships via district line  The hotel is  quot budget quot  standard  however I certainly didn t pay budget prices  even for London The rooms are tiny and very much a squash for   people  the beds are falling apart with old mattress covers being stapled onto wooden bed frames  Mattress itself must be    years old and you re likely to have a better nights sleep on a railway sleeper Bathroom small as per other reviews with another point too  that if you do stay here then get up early before all the hot water goes  Avoid if at all possible  There s better than this in Bayswater   
P =>   Nice hotel in Bayswater I ve stayed in Berjaya Eden Park Hotel several times  and every time I had a great time there  The rooms are clean and nice  and my only complaint about the room is that they have a very small bathroom There is also a continental breakfast included  and while it s nothing special  it s decent enough The hotel is located in Bayswater  which is a nice place with several restaurants  pubs and smaller shops  and it s not far away from Oxford Street with the tube I travelled to London to see a Chelsea match at Stamford Bridge  and while it s not near the stadium  travelling to the stadium goes fairly quickly as you can take District Line directly to Fulham Broadway Station  
P =>  Great Location and friendly staff Great location  The staff was very friendly and the local area has great Labenese and Cinese restaurants  As a business traveller coming from LHR to Paddington the hotel was ideally located  American beware the hotel does not have cable but does have HSIA but is slow  
P => Not for the faint of heart This place if you are looking for a big  plush room  It is extremely small  I am a small person myself and do not take up much room  but it was small for me  You can t shut the door to go potty  if you re doing     and the shower is so small that I couldn t move   cm without having the curtain clinging to my backside  Also  the bed is horrible  It felt like the     lb man had been sleeping in it for all the nights before I arrived  The pillow  well  I basically slept on my arm I will say it was reasonably clean and the people seemed to be friendly and well  you get what you pay for  but in London  you still have to pay out the wazoo for even this low class hotel Definately for the budget traveler  but if you are passing through I d suggest staying at the Yotel in the airport  which is very clean  very small  but you expect it   
P =>   small and run down    My fiancee and I stayed here two months ago We found the reception area to be not overly friendly  In fact I feltmore of a nuisance being there The room is approximately    m x    m   ft x   ft  and that includes a bathroom and unneccessary cupboards which were run down and just took up space We asked for a double room and recieved a twin room The bathroom is pretty run down and the shower curtain is terrible  We couldn t have a shower with out the bathroom being flooded The location is ok  Its close to Bayswater Road and you can catch the tube or the bus to major sights  Or stroll through Hyde Park to your destination  The next street is Queensway road with restaurants and a mall  But the area is dirty and loud at night as there is a hostel up the road and its a lively night spot The breakfast is average  Not bad not great but oh well I would not recommend this hotel  If you have a booking try and change it  I understand that its only a place to sleep  but its so hard to relax when its loud and your not comfortable  It wasn t dirty  I will give them that  
P =>   Nice and excellent location for   stars hotel The hotel room is average for a three stars standard  But I do came accross some rooms which are smaller  Probably the reviewer in this forum is frequent travellers  So they tend to expect more for a three stars hotel  Would recommend this hotel for people who only treat hotel as  quot a place to sleep quot   as its centrally located near a few underground  And near to a lots of tourist attraction  Since I only paid around    pounds  try search in ebay co uk  for a double room  I cant complaint much  Overrall its a good stay  but definetely not for ppl who look for luxury hotel  
P =>  a rip off first  this is the second time i check in to this hotel  i didn t have any problem last year this year i made the reservation then i went directly to the hotel  it s in a nice location and near to two underground stations and tons of restaurants and shops  a stone through from the hydepark well   the trouble started when i talked to my wife from the hotel phone on two times  total    minutes  and when i wanted to check out i was surprised that women behind the disk gave me this yellow smile and said  we will charge you an extra     pounds for your long distance call   was i calling mars or something   after arguing her claims i asked for the manager who then came and started to tell me that the blame is on the phone company and bla bla bla then he promised me to email the phone company to get a discount which he never did and they charged my credit card one day after i left them believe it or not  the hotel refused to give me the bill cause they don t know how much exactly they would charge me until they settle it with the phone company people    this hotel is nice if u look at it as a sleep nest   BUT THAT S IT  never use any of their services  
P =>   No complaints here We visited London to celebrate our first wedding anniversary  and stayed a Saturday night here in a double room  costing      booked in a panic at the last minute  including breakfasts  After booking  we read through these reviews and our hearts sank  Too late to cancel through the agent website we checked into the hotel expecting the worst  and I have to say  either we got very lucky or there are a lot of very particular hotel reviewers out there Our room was fantastic   very spacious  on the first floor  with a huge comfy bed  a sofa  large windows onto the street and a perfectly adequate bathroom with a superbly powerful shower  although there was no ventilation   The location is great  if a little noisy at night  but you can t exactly blame the hotel for that  Staff were perfectly approachable  and the continental breakfast buffet was second to none  
P =>  Depends on what you re looking for If you re looking for a bed for the night in a good location  i e  next to Hyde Park   tube stations  Quensway and Bayswater  with minimal time spent in the room then this is the place However  if you re looking for a hotel with atmosphere  facilities  space  decor  amp  views then this is NOT the place Our rooms were in the basement backing onto a restaurant with its associated kitchen noises  clanging pans  shouting staff   The staff and location just about compensated for the small and noisy rooms One other thing   it s within the Congestion Charge zone and the nearest multi storey car park charges       day  Attempt to park on the street if you can legally find a space  There are traffic wardens  and tow trucks  constantly on the prowl  
P =>   Great location I booked this hotel with a Berjaya Membership and was given a  hostel  room  It was EXTREMELY tiny with a smelly shower curtain  I couldn t sleep that first night  With the help of an angel who worked there  I was  upgraded  to the  other  building with a  normal  room  It felt like a presidential suite compared to the other room  I was happier and more comfortable  Luckily the weather was cold that we didn t need the non exisiting air cond   Yes   there are no A C in all the rooms  And there are no mini refrigerators either   I had to throw out my delicious chocolate cake  All in all  I was satsified with this hotel  I can t expect a  star service when this place is clearly rated with   stars  You get what you pay for Other positive points  Location IS great  Next block is Queensway which comes alive at night  Lots of restaurants  gift shops  money changer  cafes  etc  
P =>   IdanClaes A typical old english hotel with very narrow corridors and stairs  The room was small  The bathroom was tiny  But the bed was ok  you could have a good night sleep in it  it was fine for us because we were mostly out and came back to the room for showers and sleeping  we found that the location of this hotel to be just perfect  It s just a less than   minutes walk from the bayswater and queensway tube station  which is very convenient  lots of affordable shopping and dining around  The staff were very helpful in giving directions and making bookings for us Ida and Claes 
P =>   Horrible Without doubt  this is the worst  hotel  I have ever had the misfortune to enter  We had booked for two nights but only stayed an hour                  that s the length of time it took us to find alternate accommodation  Tiny  dark  damp  smelly rooms with an ensuite the Borrowers would struggle to make use of  Park benches and shop doorways would be infinitely more welcoming than the rooms and staff at this sorry excuse for an hotel  Berjaya Hotels  amp  Resorts  you should be ashamed  
P =>  Very Nice Having just spent Valentine s evening staying at the Eden Suite in this hotel I would like to share my experience Our suite wasn t the biggest I d ever seen but there was plenty of space for two people and featured a  quot livingroom quot  area with TV  sofas  minibar fridge etc  plus a small dining table with   tub chairs   all the furniture looked new and good quality  In the bedroom area we had a spacious  comfortable double bed    wardrobes and a dressing table   again all good quality and attractive dark wood  We also had our own private patio which we didn t use due to the wet weather but it looked very nice The bathroom was well fitted and spacious with marble tiles and white fittings  The complimentary toiletries were also very nice The decor of the room was very nice with a dark green wallpaper accented with red and gold accessories The hotel staff were friendly and efficient  plus the bar and dining room were very nice  The continental breakfast was plentiful and of good quality Only minor criticisms would be the lifts are tiny and the corridors are very narrow too but this is a general feature of Victorian London buildings in the city centre  Living in London myself I know about small spaces in buildings All in all my partner and I enjoyed our experience at the Eden Park Hotel  
P =>   Worst hotel ever  This is the worst hotel for the price that I have ever stayed in  We had booked a few days there either side of further travels in Europe and when we arrived for our first visit we were given a twin  rather than a double  Upon request we were then moved to a double room in the basement  The bed occupied most of the floor space and was reminiscent of our broom cupboard at home  We requested that we be assured a double room for our return  we had already paid for both visists before leaving home  and were informed that this would be possible When we returned we were once again given a twin  The desk manager  arrogant and dismissive like most of his staff  blamed the wholesaler and then told me that as there were no patrons either leaving or arriving in the next few days  he could not move us  He had no record of our previous request As I sat in the foyer the next morning I witnessed a procession of arrivals and departures If you enjoy being lied to and paying exhorbitant rates for the priviledge  sobeit  Otherwise  don t go there  
P =>  Mediocre hotel excellent location My wife and I spent a week at this hotel recently  The best part about the hotel is obviously its location  It is literally around the corner from the Bayswater tube station  and a short walk to the Queensway tube station  Banks  restaurants  pubs  shops  malls and laundrettes are all within easy walking distance  and Kensington High Street and Portobello Road are slightly further  As for the room  we were in a basement room which was very noisy  no double glazing and very thin walls and floorboards    However  we got used to the noise by the  nd night and thereafter it didn t really trouble us that much  The room and bathroom sizes were OK and not as small as I had expected based on other reviews on this site  although I also saw another room that resembled a broom closet  The bed and pillows were not great  but the room and bathroom were always clean The hotel was almost full throughout our stay  and is obviously popular notwithstanding its deficiencies  Practically  I suggest that anyone intending to stay at this hotel uses it merely as a place to bathe and sleep  and a well situated base to explore the wonders of London  By minimizing time spent in the hotel  and maximizing its excellent location  the hotel is worth the money spent  
P => Loved It so cute    Great place to stay  I m pretty sure there are small rooms everywhere in London  It was very clean and there was enough room for my mother and I to move around in if we positioned our luggage  which was abundant  in the corners or armoir  We had a very pretty view out of our window  a little garden and a nice church   I believe the rooms may be larger in the back of the hotel  which is where we stayed   The bathroom  which had a very deep bathtub  was big enough to get ready for the day in  even with the door closed   The lounge was very pretty  just like the pictures  and there were nice views out of the breakfast room as well  I thought the free continental breakfast was very tasty too  More selection than I expected  If they ran out of something they refilled it within minutes  There are two VERY close tube stations  big plus  and Kensington Gardens is right around the corner  The front desk arranged a private car for us at the end of our stay which saved us about      Our only complaints were that the elevator was rediculously small  which is simple enough to work around  and that the beds were not too comfortable  
P =>   Memorable time  certainly for the wrong reasons   of us stayed there a couple of memorable nights  Memorable for the wrong reasons  The rooms are small but certainly big enough for Hobbits  The lifts are the thinnest and slimmest I have ever come across  One of the receptionists was unfriendly and had a row with her  It was a great relief to get out of her depressing sight  Value for money  Cetrainly not  
P =>  Are they kidding  Three stars  I don t think so  This hotel is terrible  the worlds smallest rooms  The only word to describe the bathroom is  ridiculous   I am very slim and had great difficulty squeezing into the shower  i could not even fit one hand in the basin and smashed my elbows on the walls when using the toilet  It s like a rabbit warren  I had to go up and down in two lifts and drag my suitcase on it s side down the narrowest corridors in the western world to find my room  There does not appear to be any heating and my window overlooks the pleasent vista of rubbish  rooftops  crack addicts and dead pigeons  Of an evening the sounds of swearing and smashing of pots and pans enters your room from somewhere as you sink into a sagging bed  possibly manufactured in       
P =>  it s not worth it  Stayed in the smallest room in the world  shower was absolutely ridiculous  so small had to constantly peel the curtain off myself  and water went al over the floor The bed   where to begin  Tiny  squashed against the wall  and so so so uncomfortable  Slept on the floor for part of the night Oh  and the temperature   boiling hot  even with the radiator turned off  Opening the window sorted out the stuffiness  but then had to contend with constant traffic noise Sure  the location is great  but that s not enough Avoid this place  
P =>  I am glad I am a Berjaya Vacation Club Member of Malaysia I never expect I could have a good comfortable hotel in the heart of London for absolutely free    Simply because I am a Berjaya Vacation Club Member from Malaysia  sort of Time Sharing programme which I can sell my rooms at any time convenient to me Faridah Malaysiafarrz     yahoo com 
P =>  Great Value in London Bayswater Getting value for money in London is not easy  I stayed at the Malaysian owned Eden garden Hotel just before Christmas  my third time to stay here  If you are just looking for a clean bed to sleep in and your time in the hotel is minimal   and you want to save your money for shopping or taxis   then the Berjaya Eden Park Hotel is the place to stay  One constraint is that the hallways are narrow and the lift very small   a potential irritant if you have lots of luggage  But staff are efficient and courteous  There s wireless internet available through t mobile  A continental breakfast that includes great ham and bread  And my single room had a bathtub long enough to soak in comfortably Location   just around the corner from Bayswater tube station   which is just one stop away from Paddington Station and the Heathrow Express  Hyde Park is just a block away  For GBP   night  I ll stay here again  
P =>  Fantastic Location   Tiny Rooms The hotel is really just around the corner from the Bayswater station  you only have to cross the street with all its great food places and shops  We were extremely pleased with the location  Be advised that the Queensway station is closed until       but there are buses to Lancaster Gate nearby The reception staff was friendly enough  even sent somebody with us to find our room  From the entrance hall you look in to the bar where the fireplace was in use   very cosy  The tiny hallways and rooms have been described in detail before   they actually made us laugh  Since we were only there for a weekend and had only one small bag  the room size didn t bother us too much  There was a coffee maker in the room  a trouser press  soap  shampoo  body lotion  shower cap  The beds were a little soft and there was a constant draft from the window  Didn t see how the temperature could be regulated Continental breakfast was included  They offered coffee and black tea  no decaf  no herbal teas  and juice  different breads  croissants  sausages  fruit  jams  cereals  Although it was very busy  they filled up missing items quickly  but didn t have time to be friendly  The price was very reasonable     pounds for a clean  star hotel in the middle of London  breakfast buffet included  However  if you want to spend several nights in London and have big suitcases with you  the miniscule rooms will probably make you crazy  Because of its great location I would still recommend it for an overnight stay  
P => great location   terrible hotel Not a good first impression of London  The staff were not friendly  or helpful  the rooms were so tiny and always too hot  Our room had a view of the kitch exhaust fan which went on at   am scaring the pigeons away  it was like sleeping under the flight path at Heathrow Our room had the lift right outside the door so all night it went thump or crash  we did havefun scaring Japanese tourist who would press the lift button and while waiting we would open our room door and tell them the lift was full and wait for the other one    The breakfast was ok but the staff were rude in the dining room and for that matter reception  Some people skills are needed  The only good thing about this hotel was leaving it  
P =>  Relatively good value for the advantage of location The location is very good   steps from the  quot Tube quot    many good ethnic restaurants nearby  But the rooms  especially the bathrooms  are small  amp  old  but clean  Breakfast is average  The Staff is helpful  BUT constrained by the realities of high priced low quality hotel space in London  
P => The hotel rate and location offsets the shortcomings  My husband and I stayed in this hotel during our short holiday in London  The room was a bit small but who cares     we were out most of the time and only returned in the evenings  The location is fantastic with the nearby Bayswater and Queensway tube stations  Also there s plenty of restaurants within the area  The rooms were clean and staff at the reception counter were all friendly   thumps up  Berjaya Eden Park     I will definately go there again 
P => Small Small Small Well the internet photos for this hotels website are deceiving aren t they  Small is the word for the rooms in this hotel  During our stay we stayed in   different rooms and they were all very much the same  You have trouble fitting two people in the room with their luggage  Walls are paper thin  Had a cold shower one night and no hot water the next morning  If you are slightly overweight you won t fit in the very small showers and in some rooms if you are tall you won t be able to sit on the toilet because of the gap between the toilet and the wall being so small you won t be able to fit The twin rooms have narrow single bed mattresses that if you turn over you may fall out Booked through a travel agent for various nights  Couldn t stay the whole twelve nights lost our money for   nights but who cares  Our new hotel leaves it for dead  Breakfast at the hotel is quite pathetic and not worth what they would charge if it wasn t included      pounds Another   pounds for English Breakfast Other hotels we stayed at in our travels were far superior  We booked these ourselves from the internet after reading reviews on tripadvisor Other comments on this site about the staff being rude and unfriendly are true The hallways are small narrow and quite a lot of turns  reminds me of a maze or as they say a rabbit warren  and the stories about the lifts are so true They charge   p a day to store your luggage for the day and   pound if overnight  Other hotels do it for nothing If you want comfortable rooms then my opinion is stay away from this place  There is better value for money if you reseach  
P =>  Hmmm   a Mixed Bag My wife and I went to London in early ember      for our honeymoon  Upon arrival at the hotel and after checking in  we discovered the tiny lifts   that s OK though as we discovered our room was in the annexe of the building and therefore no lifts for us  We had to lug our bags up a flight of stairs  we did not want to tip anyone  and down the  st floor annexe into traipsed into possibly the smallest hotel room in the world  It was unbelievably cramped  The width would have been just on   metres with   single bunks  despite having requested several times prior for a double bed   There was no room for   large bags so one bag had to remain closed at all times  And then the shocker  the bathroom    you couldn t sit on the throne without your knees clasing with the shower panelling  And speaking of the shower  there is no way anyone over   foot can comfortably use the shower as you can t bend down while in it We tolerated this for   nights when on the  rd night  the power went off in our room and the room next door  Mysteriously all the other rooms in the corridor still had power  We advised management several times of the blackout and it was on the  rd attempt that they came and saw us  So there we were  sitting in the corridor  as it was too hot in the room  and we eventually waited about an hour and a half before management begrudgingly upgraded us to a larger room  with double bed  on the  th floor  Worryingly when this happened  a Sunday night   the hotel employees advised that they could find no one to fix the blackout that night and that they were not trained to attend to a fire in the annex part of the hotel   How reassuring Our new room was much better and larger and we could finally scrub our backs in the shower  My advice to anyone going to this hotel is to refuse all single rooms in the annexe of the building and ask for a room in the main part of the hotel  
P =>  Excellent Value  LOCATION   Excellent  If you ve read the other reviews  you ll know it s very near to Bayswater on the Circle line and Queensway on the Central line     secs and   min walk away respectively  If you don t like being underground all the time  there s a bus stop directly across the road   secs walk away and busier bus stops to more destinations about    secs walk away  NEIGHBOURHOOD   Fantastic eating places nearby  Personally recommend Mr Wu s Chinese restaurant which offers buffet lunch   dinner for GBP     per person   absolutely value for money  Japanese  Italian  Chinese  Vietnamese  Mexican  fusion and all are a min s walk away  On the same row you have all kinds of fast food  Boots pharmacy  grocery stores  bookshops  Starbucks  internet cafes  courier service  money changer  souvenir shops  and even Whiteley s shopping complex which houses ks  amp  Spencer  cinemas and is a pretty decent shopping place  Couldn t have asked for a better hotel location HOTEL FACILITIES   Because I was in a timeshare unit  I didn t have breakfast allocated  so can t comment on it  Concierge was wonderfully helpful   especially in helping me carry my heavy luggage when checking in and out  They also provide facilities to store your luggage  Reception was very helpful as well  Beautiful and clean environment  My room was serviced every morning without fail by this sweet and well mannered lady  even when I forgot to put out the sign to clean it  Very clean  they change your towels everyday  no problems with my bed or bathroom  Except the bathroom was quite small  so you re bound to wet the entire bathroom when you shower  Also  the walls are quite thin  so you can hear noises in the corridor or even your neighbour s TV if it s switched on too loud SUGGESTIONS TO POTENTIAL GUESTS   No air conditioning or fans  so I d advise guests not to return to their rooms on summer afternoons because it d be blazing hot and uncomfortable  Also  try to get the single rooms  because you d be more comfortable  The double rooms are almost the same size as the single rooms  so if you insist on staying in a double room  be prepared to know that you won t be able to find space to open your luggage bag  Overall  I had a wonderful stay   thanks to the reviews on this website  I went with minimal expectations and came home a very happy person  Would definitely stay there again the next time I m in London as it has an excellent location with excellent staff and a clean comfortable room  
P =>  If room size isn t a concern    this place is a good value Very nice and clean accomodations  Best thing is location     seconds from Bayswater tube station  Rooms are extremely small and the bathroom s shower was about   square feet  If you re looking for decent accommodations and the size doesn t bother  you  the Eden Park is a great value  
P =>  Pass this one up My husband and I were really disappointed with this hotel  We were unprepared for the size of the elevators  corridors and hotel room  but I would have overlooked that if not for some of the other negative qualities of this hotel  The bed had an old stinky foam mattress that gave us a backache every morning  and we re in our    s   Our room was lower than street level and we had a window view of people s feet walking by directly ouside of our window  We were also visited by black bugs skittering around on the bathroom floor every morning  The room needed a serious airing out  The location was good  as previously mentioned  and near some v  good restaurants  I would advise staying somewhere else next time  I know we will  
P =>  Berjaya Eden Park   Cannot get much better This hotel was great  You cannot beat the location  being almost across the street from the Bayswater Tube station  Circle  amp  District lines  and a minutes walk from the Queensway Tube station  Central line   Also  a   minutes walk from Whitleys Shopping Center and Kensington Palace  The rooms are a little on the small side  but are very comfortable and have all the amenities  The elevator lift is the only thing that could possibly need improving  It is tiny  think broom closet  The staff at the Berjaya Eden Park are wonderful  We booked through an online company to get a sizeable discount  but the hotel has a website that also offers discounts  The next time we are in London  we will definitely consider staying here again  
P =>  Go for the Misery

P =>  the best price off dirty hotel in town if there is an price for the dirtiest hotel in the EU THEY GET IT  the room was dusty the blanket was dusty the will no clean it for me  so i got a astma attack  
P =>   The crummiest dump I have ever stayed in I wish that I had read the reviews here before checking into this sorry excuse for a hotel  from which I am typing this review  It is laughable that they charge people money to stay in this dump   guests should be paid for actually staying here I had originally been booked into the Ivanhoe Suite through our corporate travel agent  I now understand that place is  or was  just as bad  As it would appear to be in common ownership  I have no doubt that was the case On arrival at the Ivanhoe Suite  I found it to be closed down  A notice on the door asked guests to phone an     number  After doing so  I was told to go to the Berkeley Court hotel where I would be checked in and would receive credit for the taxi fare over How I wish I had refused this offer   It is truly dire  I should have been suspicious when I was asked to pay for the room before I even got to see it  It s the  quot policy of the hotel that all accounts are settled on arrival quot   according to notices in  reception   I can well understand why  To say that the place is the crummiest dump that I have ever stayed in is a huge understatement In summary   The bed is unmade and looks like it has probably been slept in by about six guests before me  Used  damp towels remained in the bathroom and on the floor of the bathroom  I asked for fresh towels and was handed one bath towel of dubious quality  There is no wardrobe  There is uncollected rubbish in the room  The room does not look it has been cleaned  well  ever   Paint is flaking from the ceiling  etc  I would not be surprised to come across rats  The bathroom floor houses a collection of interesting bugsThe staff seem unconcerned about any of this Unfortunately  this stay in on my employer and I have paid upfront  Even though I wouldn t be able to recoup any additional expenditure on an alternative hotel  I have looked around seriously and am dismayed that nothing else is available in the area with a rack rate of less than       Even at that rate  serious consideration has been given to leaving early If I had a dog  I wouldn t board it here  Truly shocking  
P =>   Probably dirtiest hotel I have ever stayed Probably the Dirtiest hotel I have ever stayed since my Inter rail backpacking days is Berkeley Court Hotel in London Although the hotel is newly furnished  a couple of years ago  I do not think the bathroom has ever been cleaned  I had to ask for the sheets to be replaced as there were hair on them and the new ones had stains as well The staff was not helpful at all  I had to carry   suitcases myself to the  rd floor room via very narrow and steep steps The stairs had a leak and it was smelling disgusting  
P =>   worst hotel experience EVER  Booked for   nights but left after one night  The room is dirty  everything is dirty  No clean sheets  Even as dirty tissue on the table  It is worse than youth hostel  The toilet is extremely dirty with stain all over and no toilet paper  Really noisy at night as it s located next to a bar cafe  STAY AWAY  
P =>  BED BUGS    BED BUGS      I stayed overnight here for   night and woke up with hundreds of swells and bites all over my body from Bed Bugs  They do not clean the sheets or change the sheets for that matter  Do not stay here  Disgusting  
P =>   Brilliant Location  Three friends and I stayed at this hotel in january      and found the location perfect for what we came to london to do shop    The hotel is situated at the top of oxford street less than   minute walk to the shops  The nearest tube station is marbel arch and is extremely useful to explore london   The hotel itself is very basic and the staff are fine  One of our rooms was an okay size but the other was very small and after a days shopping it becomes increasingly smaller with the bags clothes etc        All in all this hotel is perfect for those wanting to shop and to spend the minimum amount of money on accomodation  
P =>   Terribile  
P =>  Widerlicher Ort  Keine volle R ckerstattung der Kosten Betr ger   ekelhaft   
P => 
P =>   Best apartment hotel I know I stayed here for   weeks while doing business in the area and I can only recommend this place  Staff were incredibly friendly and helpful and the apartment was clean and to a very good standard  The convenience of Berkeley Park Apartments cannot be matched in my opinion  
P => 
P => We loved Berners For the price we paid Berners was above average  The hotel is in a great location  walking distance to Bond  Regent and Carnaby Sts and Piccidilly Circus  Oxford Street is     m away   The foyer and restaurant are lovely and breakfast is a must  The room was small but adequate  The service was definately better than most places we stayed  the staff were attentive and helpful with every request  We will definately stay there again  
P =>   Faded but nice foyer small rooms This is okay as london hotels go  IF  and a big IF  you get a deal on the rooms  The lobby is quite grand but it is a bit shabby  Similarly the dining room has a great ceiling and just average food  The staff are mostly eastern european and are actually much nicer than a lot of hotels Ive been in recently  The rooms are just about ok  Dont pay more than      a night and it is a good enough deal  
P =>   OK for business My boyfriend and I are staying here on business for a week  We didn t choose the hotel ourselves  Overall  I am surprised it has   star rating  but it is convenient for working  and the location is handy for entertainment in the evening The decor is very dated  The room is not huge but has the necessities and a bit more  desk area  two arm chairs and a coffee table   The bathroom is very old and crumbling in places  It is not the most  lively  of hotels but the one thing that stood out for me is the customer service  The bar staff are warm and friendly  even though the Happy Hour prices are very misleading   make sure you check before ordering because they overcharged on one occasion   Room service was  pricey but  prompt  The maid was very efficient and helpful towards my needing to work in the room and  can you come back later  etc  The breakfast service is good with a wide choice of cold and cooked dishes  The only down side was a member of staff removing the teaspoon from my saucer when I took my coffee to the lobby to smoke   I think she thought I was going to steal it  Overall this hotel is okay for basic business tourist needs if you want to feel looked after and if you can overlook the basic shabbiness of the interior  
P =>  Lovely Hotel I stayed in this hotel with my boyfriend on a romantic weekend away and was not disappointed  We booked this hotel through Superbreaks and we got a very reasonable rate The bedrooms were average size  with an ample sized bathroom The bed was most comfy and we could not complain with the room service Excellent The lifts were fine too  not noisy or slow  the location of this hotel is fantastic too  as you are just off Oxford Street so you avoid a lot of the street noise  but close enough to all the shops and theatre district We drank in the bar a couple of times and the bar staff were lovely  although the price of the drinks and food were quite expensive  but this is London afterall  Mini Bar expensive too Was very impressed with this hotel  and would definatly stay again  
P =>   Good  Stayed here in       on business so got put here rather than chose it myself but was happy enough it  As a  corporate  customer  I was automatically upgraded to an executive room which surprised me but I didn t complain about it of course     The plus points were the location of the hotel  the grand reception areas  the service and  in my case  my room  as a whole  including the cpmfort of the bed which was lovely although the negative points were the size of the room  very small   the size of the  double  bed  more like a big single   the creaking floorboards and the tiny and slow lifts  Overall though  I would stay here again but there is so much choice in London  would probably have a look around first to see what else was on offer  
P =>  Terrible Lovely lobby with very fadded funiture  Terrible room bath towels with LARGE holes  torn sheets thread bare carpeting  Elevtors with very worn carpeting and brass that had not been cleaned for along time  It was rated a   star hotel and I think it should have been more like a   star  
P => It knew better times The common places are beautiful and charmed but I stayed at an executive room and it was old small noisy and poor Very good situation between Oxford Circus and Totemham road but I expected something better beacuse the high price  
P =>   Dont do it  Good points  Great location just off Oxford Street but I would have to say that is the only good point or of the lobby may be good if you could see through the cigar smoke  The room was horrific  Black ring around the bath  peeling paint  broken furniture  lumpy bed with one old blanket  When I asked for another the porter returned saying there weren t any more left  Guess the other cold guests got in before me My booking told me that my room overlooked the courtyard   try litter strewn firestairs I am amazed that this hotel is allowed to call itself a four star hotel  do yourself a favour and do NOT stay at this hotel  
P =>   What a waste of money I regularly stay in London on business   usually staying in the White House less than a five minute walk away  Berners looks beautiful from the outside but the inside feels tatty and old  The room was horrible  Old  poorly decorated  old saggy bed  noisy    the list could go on and on  I will not stay here again and I would never recommend it  
P =>  Very Nice stay I picked this hotel through an expedia package deal and was pleased by both the location  the hotel itself and the staff  If you are traveling in the cooler months  this hotel is a great one  There is only air conditioning on the club floors  but as I was just there in uary  that wasn t an issue  Though the room was a little on the small side  as most London hotel rooms are  it was more than adequate  with a large bathroom and nice amenities in the room It s a lovely hotel  has attentive staff  is easily accessible to the Tube  the West End theatres and the shopping on Carnaby and Regents Streets  It s definitely a place I ll visit again on my next trip to London  
P =>  Un buen hotel Nice hotel in a excellent place  Staff very helpful and they could speack spanish  Very good breakfast  
P =>  Shocked Oh my goodness  Never did I expect a   star hotel in such a prime location to look so bad  Fair dues  the lobby area is grand and elegant  But the rooms  THE ROOMS  A room so small that you had to walk around the bed to go anywhere  A double bed more like the size of   and a half single beds and a mattress so soft you felt like you were going to fall through it  But the worst   the bathrooms  Broken taps  cracked washbasin  tiles missing  mould all round the edge of bathtub and where the tile grouting should have been  Just horrible  And all for the bargain price of     GBP  If it wasn t for the great location of being just off Oxford Street Tottenham Court Road this property would get no stars from me  A real disappointment  
P =>  Not to Bad Long weekend and show in il       the hotel is in a great location just off Oxford St  looks a little run down and threadbare but the staff were very nice and helpful  the shower got stuck on in our room and maintenance were there in less than   mins  Breakfast was excellent and as much as you want buffet all in all good value  
P =>  Wonderful decor Having dined a number of times in the atmospheric restaurant we stayed overnight on the    ch       The hotel lived up to our expectations  apart from creaky floorboards  it is a living tribute to a past era  The Reception area is just magnificient  I would love to paint the plasterwork  Staff are also pleasant and interested  
P =>  Bad time at the Berners We booked the Berner s online based on the pictures  They were grossly inaccurate  From the pealing paint in the lobby to the mold in our shower  The hotel is in desperate need of a good scrub  The floorboards squeek so terribly you can hear others guest move about  The bed felt as if it was a old as the hotel  There werefood stains on the bed spreed  When we ordered room service  the dirty dishes stayed in the hall for over    hours  The location in no way makes up for this poorly kept hotel  
P => Enjoyed our stay   The hotel was all I expected it to be  The location is just great     sec from Oxford street and only a   min walk to two metrostations  The rooms are good clean  have anything you want  they re not the biggest in town but who wants to be in his room when you re staying in London     The breakfast is very good   nice service  good and plenty of food served in a classy restaurant The hotel also has an impressive lounge where you can enjoy your afternoon thea  just great In general  it s a good hotel with great service and a perfect location   They will be seeing us back next year  
P => Location is good    I would recommend this hotel for location  Its about    sec walk from Oxford Street and about a   minute walk to the restaurants in Soho As for the rooms    very small  shower dripped all night  cracks in bath tub  amp  tiles missing from the walls in the bathroom  The towels we were given had stains on them Breakfast was included in the rate  and it was okay  Nothing spectacular but it was fine Bottom line   location makes up for the below average room  
P => Second Time Lucky  er  We were staying in town for a night as a friend from NY was having a get together  and my wife recommended this hotel on the basis that her trendy brother stayed there from time to time  I asked her if she was sure   having seen their web site I couldn t see her brother being particularly impressed by this chintzy affair Bottom line was she got confused between the Berners Hotel and the Sanderson Hotel  also in Berners Street   Oops OK  so by London standards it s pretty cheap  especially bearing in mind the excellent location      including breakfast for    although my wife took one look at the room and entirely justifiably demanded an upgrade to the Club floor  another       The first room was small and dingy with a barely adequate  quot double quot  bed The second room was larger and dingy with the same barely adequate bed  We ordered sparkling mineral water  and it came in refillable bottles suggesting that it was in all probability London Tap with a bit of added CO   but at only about       a litre bottle that was pretty good for hotel prices  and there s nothing wrong with London tap   However  serving tap water as mineral water is something that s guaranteed to get my back up   The water pressure was feeble  the breakfast was adequate to reasonable  as usual  juice was served in shot glasses  It wasn t appalling  but next time I ll definitely be paying twice the amount and staying at the Sanderson     Andrew

P =>   Quite adequate for a weekend stay We stayed at the Bromley for the weekend as we were attending a relatives wedding  On first impression I was very disappointed as the reception carpet was very stained and grubby  However we were impressed with cleanliness of the room and the Garden Restaurant where we had breakfast  The staff were extremely friendly  amp  helpful and nothing was too much trouble  The gardens are a credit to the gardeners they are beautifully designed and well kept  I would certainly recommend it if anybody was thinking of holding a wedding reception there  Providing they changed the stained reception carpet  
P =>  Stunningly unfriendly staff I stayed here as part of an overnight  quot awayday quot  with work colleagues  The hotel is a pleasant enough place  the facilities are all good and it is set in lovely grounds  The restaurant is situated in a massive convervatory and was a really nice place to have our evening meal The food was perfectly acceptable  the conference facilites were fine and my bedroom though average  was of a perfectly good standard  Service was what you would expect but with a big  big catch  Why  why  why are the staff in this place so miserable and unfriendly  Is it a management issue I wonder  I stay in quite a few hotels and from the biggest chains to the smallest guest house pretty well all staff will acknowledge you with a greeting  I like this and to me it is part of the deal when you part with chunks of cash for an over night stay  But at the Bromley Court the best I can say is that the staff did their job and that was it   no more  No smiles  no cheery words  nothing This one thing means that I won t be going there again and neither will my company  
P =>  Clean friendly hotel We are currently staying at the Bromley Court Hotel for one month due to sale of our house and not having found another one we like enough to want to buy  The room is on the top floor in the new wing and one of the larger rooms on offer with a dividing wall between the bedroom and the dressing study area  The staff are extremely helpful and polite  They are happy to cook anything for you for breakfast if you ask them  The quality of the food is good  The bed is      quot  which is small for us but there are plenty of rooms with queen and king size beds  We chose our room because of the quiet situation and made a compromise on the bed which only took a couple of nights to get used to  The rooms are cleaned well each day with the beds changed every other day  Towels are changed daily  There is an ironing room with non steam irons which is a bit difficult but okay in an emergency The hotel has grounds of about   acres which makes a feeling of spaciousness and of course there is somewhere to walk on a fine day  It is unusual to find a hotel with such helpful  kind staff who are eager to please in London  
P =>   Basic chain hotel I stay here several times a year as my company is based in Bromley  I have looked for decent accomodation in the area but have not yet found anything good  So I end up at the Bromley CourtThis hotel is in a residential area so a taxi is advisable at night from the town centre  This usually means that meals need to be taken in the hotel  They are quite expensive and very average  Room service is good   decent sandwiches nicely presented  Breakfast is better   usual buffet with a reasonable selection The rooms are generally small in the newer section and large in the old section  The bathrooms are OK  Beds are soft and have the usual brown blankets  ugh   and no duvets  No wi fi but an internet connection is provided at a priceReception staff generally helpful   booking taxis etc The hotel is OK but nothing to write home about  
P =>   Small room small bed    We stayed in this hotel for a weekend with   kids  The rooms in the newest wing a really small  but the beds are small too  We had a bed of approx    X    cm  Too small for large europeans    Ask always for the large rooms and the large beds Hotels is very clean  helpful staff  It s OK for a couple of nights  In the weekend there are often parties at the hotel  
P =>  Really enjoyed our stay at the Bromley Court  Only stayed the one night on a Saturday as we were at a family party in the area  but really enjoyed our stay  Staff were polite  friendly and obliging  Our double room with air con was clean comfortable and spacious with a nice view over the gardens  We paid     inc  breakfast and booked direct with the hotel  Breakfast was busy  pleasant  plentiful and buffet style  but don t be late as they clear away promptly  in the huge garden restaurant and afterwards we enjoyed sitting out by the fountain on the terrace in the lovely gardens  Having usually stayed in travel inns in London for roughly the same price it was nice to enjoy some outside gardens for a change  Wouldn t hesitate to stay again when next in the area  
P =>   Very pleasant but expensive The room was quite small but very clean and bright  The window was just a slit and overlooked a rubbish bin  The room was well equiped with tea and coffee making facilities  TV  trouser press  fan and internet connection We did have the opportunity to upgrade but only to a smoking room so we didn t bother  The bathroom was similarly small but spotless and the shower worked OK once I d woked out how to use it without my glasses The bed was very comfortable but a bit squeaky and we had a great night s sleep  The room rate included a fine and extensive breakfast  a mixture of hot dishes   eggs  sausages  black pudding  hash browns etc   and the continental style options   rolls  cereals  yogurts  danishes etc  There was also lashings of toast and coffee served at the table  The breakfast is served in the beautiful Garden Restaurant on the first floor  The hotel is located halfway between Downham  down the hill  and Bromley  uphill  and the     bus is the only public transport that stops nearby so unless you have a car or a love of buses  I would not recommend it for access to London  In all we had a very pleasant one night stay  a wedding gift  but it was rather expensive for the level of luxury on offer  
P =>  My  nd home   But then i have no other options     I stay at the Bromley Court with work at least   or   times a year and often for a week at a time  It s always nice and clean but could do with a spruce up Yak blankets anyone   The facilities are OK  and the food is pretty good  for the price  but town is only a    minute walk so you do have other options  OK  so walking might sound like an odd option but parking is a nightmare so if you ve got a spot   keep it Air conditioning is only currently in some rooms  although i think they are sorting this  If it s summer you ll ned it Mixed opinion on this one  I have to stay there  no option really as there s no other hotels nearby and the business I work for has a  nd office in that area so it s just something i have to do  I wouldn t go there for personal visit but for work it ll do  One word of warning   I usually stay Mondays to Thursdays and all is fine  however the   times i have stopped on a Friday night it has been an absolute zoo  Couples screaming at one another at     in the morning both times  
P =>   Small and smelly I was in Bromley as I was working in the area and had to dine out to cement the business relationship and had been invited to stay by the client  as our meetings continued the next day  It saved me an hour and a half each way but I still wished I d gone home  I couldn t work out how a hotel so far from the centre of London needed to have rooms quite so charmlessly minute  I haven t stayed anywhere with so little personal space since I was a student  There were two single beds but they were so close together  that you could almost imagine you were in a double  until you fell down the gap  and the walls were so close that a fertile imagination could easily imagine that you were in a cupboard  The window  small  of course  was open when I arrived   and stayed open throughout my short stay  At least when I mentioned this the staff didn t question me and even deducted     from the     bill I had stayed on a Saturday  when there had been a large and drunken wedding in progress  and Sunday breakfast was the traditional English buffet   sausage  bacon  egg etc  great if you like that sort of institutional thing  The setting was a touch institutional too  a large dining room  echoing to the sound of chewing food  rustling newspapers and people trying to  enjoy  themselves  Breakfast in bed is sadly not an option as the room is so small it would either be you or the tray On the plus side there is a pretty garden and the smelly room had views to a distant London  through that little window  
P =>  Classique   l Anglaise  
P => 
P =>   really small rooms good location  ok if u don t want to spend a lot of time in your room  which is good only for shower and sleep   very good connections by public transport  only   min walk to earls court underground  yet on a quiet street  
P =>   Fine if you re on a budget I stayed here for   nights earlier this month as our favourite Earl s Court hotel was full  Location wise  it was a   minute walk to Earl s Court tube station and perfect for my colleagues and I Whilst perfectly clean   dated  and a little  shabby  come to mind when describing the decor of my room  The tv is also very small  and you don t have a fridge  Noise carries from rooms above below and next door too  though I have to say that whilst it was noisy up to about   pm  it was then dead quiet until about  am  The bathroom was fine   again  it could do with an update but was perfectly serviceable  Breakfast was ok   the continental side wasn t very inspiring but you wouldn t leave hungry  I didn t eat here at night All in all  I would stay here again as for     a night it is good value in this location and you do get what you pay for  However  if I had the choice I d stay at our usual Earl s Court hotel which is the K amp K George round the corner  
P =>   Would not recommend this hotel The Burns Hotel is in a great location and that is this only positive quality of this hotel  My friend and I were traveling together and we asked for   beds  They put us on the first floor  The room was very small and the beds were awful  When trying to sit on the bed  it would roll away from me  We found earring parts in the sheets  The sheets were scratchy and old  The springs of the mattress were poking us all night  We asked for a different room and they told us nothing was available and they were pretty rude about it  I felt like we were in the dungeon  We could not stay there for   nights so we checked out after one night and went elsewhere  
P =>  Great Location Would Stay Again   Stayed at this hotel at the end of ust and although it did have its drawbacks I would stay here again  I arrived in London at      am and was extremely tired  thankful when I arrived at the Best Western Burn hotel at about      am I was able to check in and they had a room available for me     I was also informed that I had been upgraded from a single room to a double room and now had a full breakfast included  News like that was reason enough to recommend this hotel  However on the negative my room was in basement  and in the mornings it did get rather loud  I think some of the housekeeping facilities were down there and lets be honest no one really wants to be stuck in the basement  The Burns Hotel is well located less than a   minute walk south from Earls Court underground station  In the Earls Court area there is no shortage of restaurants  mostly chains like Nandos  McDonalds  Masala Zone and Starbucks   a Boots Drug Store is near by and even a ks and Spencers food outlet for groceries is in the neighborhood  Kensington Palace  Hyde Park is walk able as well as the natural History Museum  Overall good stay at Burns Hotel  
P =>   friendly the staff was outstanding quite possibly the best of my entire trip  Friendly  polite  ect  ect  
P =>   value for money clean hotel rooms are small but ok for a short stay staff very helpful no air conditioning which is needed in a hot august beside earls court tube safe in room is very handy but it costs    a day  
P =>  Fantstic little hotel great location helpfull satff We stayed here in march       Top little hotel in a great location  Close to shops  cafes  and a short walk to Hyde Park  We would return again  
P =>   No Complaints would agree with whats been said  we stayed for a night whilst at wimbledon  half an hour or so from euston handy for all tube lines    mins walk from Earls Court tube station Rooms are small but for a night or   it was fine  bathroom was fine and very clean I would suggest in summer ask for room at the back  as our room was at the front and had the sun on it all afternoon  the lack of air con meant it was like sleeping in an oven  
P =>  Small rooms but fab location A group of us stayed in this hotel in e      for   nights  It was a charity trip so our room prices were heavily discounted but the prices advertised in reception started from      per night which even for London  and I am a Londoner   seemed high  The room I had was on the  nd floor  The twin room was pretty small  and the bathrom even smaller  If both of us were moving around it worked better if one of us sat still on a bed till the other one finished moving  The bathroom had the loo alongside the bath  which I have never liked in a bathroom  and the gap was very tight  Anyone bigger than a size    would be in trouble  The bath had an overhead shower which worked well  though the step out of the bath was fairly high  The room was clean  with freebie soaps  tea  amp  coffee  etc  We were able to open the window partially for air in the hot weather which lets in some noise so if you are not used to trains or traffic be aware  The beds were tidy and clean  The hotel offered room service which we did not use though the restaurant was used and the food was good  The breakfast is sufficient with a good selection of continental food   cheese  ham  yoghurt  fruit  bread  croissants  jams  etc  The English breakfast was tasty and well cooked  though one morning it arrived cold and had to be sent back  Occasional wait for items to be replenished  The restaurant is fairly large and could seat a number of guests so space was not too bad  The bar was OK but had a limited range of drinks  and the wine was VERY expensive for the cheap brand they offered  TIP  Go to Threshers round the corner and stay in the room  The staff were all generally polite  efficient and friendly  The best thing about the hotel is the location very near Earls Court tube and the range of eating places   everything from pubs  subway and macdonalds  to zizzis and an excellent italian place past the station  Bistro Benito  It is in a quiet residential area with a private garden for locals  though on one evening there was a very noisy BBQ happening which did disturb some guests on that side of the building  We enjoyed our stay for the short time period and I would use it again  AR 
P =>   great value for the price I stayed in this hotel on my first trip to London in late ember        early uary       The rooms were a bit small  but no smaller than I had expected to find in London  It s in a great location  literally a few hundred feet from the Earl s Court tube stop  There s a    hour newsstand nearby  a Post Office  a Boots  A Sainsbury s  plenty of great pubs and even fast food for those whose tastes run in that direction  All within a couple of blocks of the hotel The staff was helpful and friendly and even offered a relatively inexpensive upgrade halfway through my    day stay  
P =>  Good Hotel   Great Location I am a regular at this hotel since several years despite the small room  amp  bathroom sizes Just a few steps away from Earls Court Tube station  Very handy as it is on the Piccadilly line  amp  convenient to  amp  fro Heathrow  No change of stations required with luggage Free wifi very useful  The Breakfst room sometimes gets busy  amp  items on the breakfast buffet take very long to replenish  
P =>   Good location nice hotel but since we stayed free it s hard to be objective  As everyone has said  the best part is the close location to the Earls Court tube station  and the Blackbird pub on the corner  try their specialty meat pie   definitely the best unless you re a veggie   The rooms are small but not that bad and the bathroom adequate  We had a room at the back and you could hear the trains a bit if the window was open  but not at all bad for the city  We had two free nights included with a BA flight from the USA  so it s hard to judge the value  but the prices didn t seem out of line for London  Although none of the staff were native Engllsh speakers  they all spoke and understood it well  Extremely helpful and friendly  Breakfast was very crowded  so leave enough time  The food was good  The bar is small and not atmospheric in any way  but if you just want a quick drink without heading to the Blackbird  it s adequate  There s a small patio at the back that could be lovely  but it s where the smokers have to go and the ashtrays needed emptying  
P =>   value for money just come back from a stay at this hotel  it is definitely value for money  great location and clean   the   most important things  space is limited and i am sure there are a couple of other small irritating things that niggle but to be honest if i travel to london i want cheap and clean and i use my hotel to sleep and relax after many hours out in town     this hotel is more than adequate for that  i would stay there again  
P =>   Great central location shame about the lack of heating in room We stayed at the Burns Hotel for   nights  Before choosing to book this hotel I read the reviews on trip advisor in which most stated the tiny bathrooms and unpleasent stay  however I decided to gamble and book twin share  I must admit I was quite surprised from first impressions  our room was quite spacious and clean  we had tea and coffee making facilities  The only downside was the view  there wasnt one being on the first floor  The bathroom I thought was not small at all  it was a comfortable size with amenities provided  The only problem I had with this hotel was the heating  there wasnt any  It turns on automatically but at a low speed so it was very cold  The breakfast was good  we had continental breakfast but they do offer English Breakfast  Continental breakfast consisted of toast  yoghurt  cereal  fruit  ham etc with tea and coffee available  The location of the hotel was fantastic  Only several minutes away from Earls Court Station and at walkable distance to Hyde Park  Plenty of restaurants  cafes etc to choose from Overall the hotel was reasonably priced and very clean  Again the only issue I had was the lack of heating  I would consider going to this hotel again for short stays 
P =>  Small room and not worth it   Un Veggie friendly This hotel was the only bad thing about my London stay The room was small and filled with furniture you could not use due to the size  A dressing table with a chair that was blocked by a wardrobe and a chair next to the bed that stopped you walking round the bed Paint peeling off walls  Radiators had clearly been painted hundreds of times with the bubbling paint Bathrrom and linen was clean though Woken up at  am and   am by a large group who had decided to set off the fire alarm Woken up at     am by scaffolding being errected in the back garden of the house next door Breakfast was my main issue  I ordered a vegetarian sausage breakfast for me and a normal breakfast for my husband  After half an hour I chased it up  They had forgotten us When it arrived it was meat  Why  Because they had run out of vegetarian sausages  When I explained I had ordered it due to not eating meat she said she would have still given me the bacon with my sausage anyway as I had not told her I didn t want it  It s a veggie breakfast  why would I want bacon  Apparently a lot of people like this and could I not just eat the egg  beans and mushrooms anyway     minutes after entering the breakfast room I left angry and empty Also I did no meet one member of english staff  I understand they have to have foreign speaking staff due to the large number of international visitors but we had to explain things three or four times before people understood us Also the barman is periodic  I only found him in the bar for   mins and after that he dissapeared and did not come back and we had to go to a nearby pub for our next drink  
P =>   Loved the location but yet another small room I stayed at this hotel with my partner for   nights  Basically I have the same comments as everybody else  Excellent location in a quiet side street   minutes walk from restaurants  pubs and Earls Court Tube Station  The staff were very friendly and helpful apart from one slightly miserable breakfast waitress who we nicknamed Wednesday from the Addams family  Buffet breakfast was very good although the room and staff did struggle at the occasional busy times  Because of comments on this site we asked Alpharooms to book us a large double room  Unfortunately the floor planned showed we had the smallest room on the floor        Nice enough  view of the garden  comfortable bed and the fastest filling bath I have ever seen  But so small the only way to open our suitcases was to put them on the bed Minor problem really and we would stop at this hotel again  
P =>   Basic but adequate  I have stayed here a few times now  and been very satisfied with it  The location is very convenient  only a couple of minutes walk from Earl s Court tube station  with several shops and restaurants nearby  The rooms themselves are clean and adequate for my needs  although the bathrooms were small and a little cramped  Some of the floorboards creak a lot though Staff were very pleasant  and spoke enough English to be able to deal with me TV only has the five normal channels  along with Sky News and Nickelodeon  but that s all I needed  I would certainly consider staying here again A word of warning   the free WiFi does NOT let you access any streaming video sites  such as Youtube  or the iTunes Store  
P =>  small room Good clean hotel booked with expedia and we got the smallest room in the place  I dont know if this is because we booked with expedia or just bad luck  Nice area close to transport  
P =>   Nice hotel no problems Just back from here after overnight stay and have to say pleasantly surprised after some of the comments on this page  Yes the rooms are intimate wouldn t want to stay here for longer than a couple of nights perhaps but they are spotlessly clean and well kept  Ours overlooked the back which had a view of a lovely garden area  room       The room was nicely decorated with lovely wood panelling and subtle mirrors as was the rest of the hotel  Very nice  modern and tasteful public areas and the staff were really helpful  Lovely big vase of lilies in the reception area nice touch Ellen Terry used to live here the famous actress and there is a blue plaque on the front of the building for her and pictures of her inside in the lounge bar area with other notables The breakfast area is very clean and comfortable too with leather seats   wood panelling very modern and overlooking a lovely decked garden area with green patio umbrellas  Really couldn t fault it for the money we paid      for twin room   and for a   star hotel it was great and will definitely go back Minor gripe was the poor lack of fruit at breakfast only grapefruit and prunes  Location wise if you want a hotel for Earl s court arena it is literally   mins walk from both the arena and the tube   There are also a good selection of eateries on Earl s court road can recommend Bistro Benito a little family trattorio which is also   mins walk on the same side as the tube to the left as you come out of the tube  But get there early as it is popular   
P =>   not for claustrophobics dity bathroom  rigid staff  small and I mean small  rooms TV set from     s good for Harry Potter  
P =>   Loved it anyway I was nervous about staying at the Burns for a holiday  following some earlier TripAdvisor postings  but we were pleasantly surprised by how much we enjoyed our stay  Remember that you are staying in a Victorian building  on a beautiful and quiet side street in Earls Court  and go with it  The location was absolutely perfect  near Earls Court Tube  and some fantastic pubs right around the corner  Since our stay was broken up by a day away from London  we had the chance to see what booking a  quot double quot  could result in  as the first room was absolutely tiny with a double bed  but crisp and clean  overlooking a quiet courtyard  Our second  quot double quot  was much bigger with a king size bed and a full size bathroom  Same great courtyard view  The staff was most helpful  the included breakfasts were delicious  and the ambience was perfect for a first trip to London  
P =>  Fantastic location lovely experience My husband and I had   nights at this hotel at the very start of our   month european holiday  and what a great way to start our holiday  Fabulous location  great room overlooking the courtyard  lovely garden across the road from the hotel  and wonderful vibe on Earls Court Rd  Hotel staff were very helpful  internet access was cheap and the breakfast was plentiful  Easy walk to tube and shops  Rooms could do with a small fridge but other than that it was great  Other travellers have mentioned the rooms were small but we found ours to be fine  Recommend this hotel to anyone  
P =>   great value great location My sister and I have just returned from a   night stay at this hotel  We had read the reviews and were somewhat prepared for the small rooms  although most of them were written by Americans who are used to much bigger rooms  The room      was even smaller than expected and the bathroom smaller still  However there were a lot of pluses  The location was excellent   only   mins walk from Earl s Court tube station  The street was a lovely quiet street with a beautiful railed garden just accross the road from the hotel  We woke to the sound of bird song each morning All of the staff we met were extremely pleasant  especially the breakfast staff  The entrance to the hotel was very welcoming  Our room was quite clean The breakfast was adequate Not a lot of fresh fruit  only apples  and the breads were of the industrial variety  But there was plenty of juice cereal  cold meats  cheese  yogurt etc  and the dining area looked onto a small courtyard with seats and some nice shrubbery On the downside  there was no air conditioning and we were reluctant to leave the window open as it opened directly onto the fire escape so it would have been very easy for an intruder to gain access  Beds were so close together that one could not walk between them  The bathroom was tiny and we had no bath However it was great value for money    euro per room per night to include breakfast I would not hesitate to stay there again but would insist on seeing the size of the room beforehand  
P =>   Great location compact rooms I recently stayed at the Burns hotel for a function in earls court  The location is superb for any functions there  and is easliy walkable    mins away   The location of the hotel is lovely as it is just off the main highstreet looking onto some gardens I stayed in a single room which was quite small  even by london standards  The service however was great   i asked for an ironing board at a very busy time of day and it arrived within    minutes If you re looking for a hotel close to kensington  the tube or earls court arena which does what it says on the tin this is fine  There is a small bar at the hotel and the breakfast is continental as standard but you could pay extra for full cooked  
P =>   Value for Money The hotel was clean and well presented  The staff were all friendly and helpful  Our twin was room was of adequate size  probably above average for London   this was a pleasant surprise as it was a last minute cheap deal and they do tend to give you the worst rooms  Only minor gripe about the room was that the bathroom door couldn t be opened very far as it hit the end of one of the beds  We had the continental breakfast   plenty of choice  the full English also looked very good  Even though the breakfast room was busy at times the staff cleared tables quickly and there never seemed to be anyone kept waiting  The buffet was also checked and replenished regularly Hotel is a two minute walk to Earls Court Road for the Tube  buses  shops  pubs and eateries  and less than ten minutes to the Earls Court Exhibition Centre Would certainly stay there again 
P =>  Wonderful Location   Adorable Hotel I stayed here last winter with my best friend on our first trip to London  We LOVED it  Overall  the best thing about this hotel is the location  It is close to all the conveniences  There were several grocery stores close by and that s where I bought almost all my food  Sommerfield was my favorite and it had lots of yummy ready made sandwiches and crisps and candies and yogurt  I enjoyed trying the different food and the prices were actually not bad  I had brought a bunch of food with me thinking that everything was going to cost an arm and a leg  but I was pleasantly surprised to find better food prices than Chicago  where I was living at the time   Bottled water is especailly cheap in London  My roommate enjoyed the fact that there was a McDonald s close by as well  There were several other fast food places but we pretty much stuck to Sommerfield and McDonald s  There is also a Barclays  bank  right there and I believe that they do not charge a service fee  Yay  And then of course  the location is prime because of the Earl s Court tube stop  just a few minutes from the hotel  It was a quick ride into the main tourist spots        mintues probably  and SO easy to use The hotel itself was also quite adorable  It s true that the rooms are small  but you are in Europe  We expected small and were actually surprised at how big our room was  Not big by American standards but bigger than what we were expecting  We had a bathroom  two twin beds  a TV  desk  and still some room to walk around  I can t say that the beds were especially comfortable  but they did the job  And the best part was that we had the cutest little balcony that looked out onto a large lawn and what looked like beautiful brick apartments  It was ruary when we were there so we didn t spend a lot of time on the balcony but it was nice knowing it was there and it also doubled as a fridge at night and we could put our goodies from Sommerfield out there to stay cold  The only negative I can say about this hotel is that the staff was not the most friendly  They were pretty snappy with us when we checked in and we were put off trying to talk to them the rest of our vacation  But this wasn t a big deal  It s nice if they are nice  but I don t usually ask many questions of hotel staff anyway  
P =>  good place to stay have just returned from a   night stay at the burns very easy to get to as is just across the road from earls court tube a zone   travel card will get you there on the underground the staff at check in were friendly and most efficient our room was on the front of the hotel and had a queen size bed loads of pillows cushions and spotless if you really looked the room was getting a little tired and will be in need of a refit in a couple of years search the internet for deals with breakfast  continental      full english       as the walk through the door rate is     pounds and we paid    pounds with continental breaky the only word of warning is if you have a dash of lemonade in your malibu at the bar be prepared to part with     all round a good hotel for the money and in a great location for access and dining  
P =>   Great Hotel in London I just got back from London and enjoyed my stay at this hotel  I have traveled to London quite a bit in the last couple of years and this was one of the most pleasant hotels I have stayed in The location in Earl s Court is great  and is a two minute walk to the tube station Our room was a good size for London and was very clean  Breakfast was included in our stay and was very good  The staff was very pleasant and helpful I would certainly recommend his to anyone traveling to London  
P =>  Sweet little Hotel The hotel is close to the Tube  subway that is about   blocks away   We bought a weekly pass on The Tube and it was awesome  We traveled all over London this way because taxi s cost so much  The hotel was super small  The lobby was little and the hallway to the elevator was narrow  After we checked in we wheeled our luggage to the elevator to get on only to find out it is a one man elevator if you have luggage  I m from Texas where everything is big so this was just too funny  Anyway  my husband went up first and the elevator came back for me  When I got off of the elevator he was waiting for me with this huge grin and said  quot You aren t going to belive this  quot  I walked in and the room is probably     x     with a huge window  There are two twin beds up against one wall and a dresser and a tall wardrobe on the other wall  There is a small bathroom big enough for one person at a time with another huge window  There is no air conditioning  I ve never been anywhere with out A C  We both laughed until we were crying  I was thinking there is no way I will be staying here  But we opened up the windows and the best breeze blew through the room and we called room service for a fan which they immediately brought up to us  After the initial shock of the room being so tiny  I fell completely in love with it  The beds are very comfortable  it is very clean  it has a TV that works  and the shower is powerful   what else do you need  There is a park across the street and you could watch the children play and it is just so beautiful  There are no screens on the windows so you could actually sit in the window and watch the world go by  The entire time we were in London I saw one gnat  In my town the mosquitos are so big they can carry you away  One block away is a busier street with restaurants and all kinds of stores  We went to the small grocery store every day and bought drinks and fruit  The food in London is nothing like in the states  Our favorite restaurant was The Republic of Texas and we ate there   times  Everything is VERY expensive  We saw the changing of the guards at      am  When the flag is flying on top of the palace that means that the Queen is there  She was there when we were there and that was kind of neat to know  We went on the London Eye  saw castles  Big Ben  London Bridge  museums  and so much more  We took the Eurostar to Paris and another train to Scotland for day trips  Scotland was very interesting and cold  Paris was okay and we saw the Eiffel Tower and cruised on the Seine River but eveyone in Paris kind of snobby  Overall  I would go back to London in a heart beat and stay at this hotel again  I fell in love with everything  
P =>   Convenient Hotel When booking a hotel in London its hard to find a place that quot  has it all quot We stayed here for two nights when visitng some one We found the hotel very conveniently placed  Just out of Earls Court Station across the road turn right then left about   mins walk The room was on the back of the hotel and was very quiet and clean There is a small bar with relaxng tables and chairs and internet access Breakfast was self service  a small queue some times as tables were cleared Plenty of food and a bright room Outside and turn left you can easily walk into South Kensington a pleasant strollIn all no real problems and would stay againErin 
P =>   Only for minimalists    We booked this hotel for one night  as we were only transiting through London and wanted to catch a few of the major sites  The good reviews I read did not seem to hold up at all    reception was rude and unhelpful  and the rooms are the size of most hotels  closets  We shared a double bed  but had to sidestep around the bed to navigate the room at all  Bathroom is incredibly small  and the shower is up on a step that some people might not be able to climb  It also runs the risk of slipping on the shower floor and falling out onto the bed    yes  it s that small  Breakfast was decent  but it leaves a big appetite afterward  Location is great  but that s the only perk I can fathom about this hotel  
P =>   Central  We stayed in The Best Western Burns Hotel in e and were happy with the convenient location near Earls Court Tube   which is an easy haul from Heathrow with lifts  amp  ramps at the tube station   ROOMS   Smallish but adequate  no aircon fan  small  oldish  bathroom  Comfy beds  VERY SQUEEKY FLOORS   BREAKFAST   adequate continental but staff come in at       and scavenge around for left overs CLEANLINESS   ExcellentLIFT   Yes  small but it works well COST   Well priced onlineI would stay there again but I have found a better hotel for slightly more which has aircon and more spacious rooms   Copthorne Tara in High Street Kensington  But if you cannot afford the GBP   extra per night  this is a great choice  
P =>  perfect for me I chose this hotel because of the location and I like the nearby Earls Court Road where there are fabulous restaurants at reasonable prices   No air con and it is hot at the moment but my room overlooked the back garden and the window can be opened  It s a single room I had  it was fine  comfy bed  great hot shower  nice view   quiet really    excellent service at breakfast too  this impressed me a lot  The English breakfast was good  not greasy as one usually has  The staff were helpful and friendly  I will stay here again  Oh  the free wifi is a real advantage too  
P =>  A serviceable spot with a great location My son and I stayed at the Burns e    e     Booked the reservation through Expedia and had no problems on check in  Only a bit of a snafu  I thought for sure our reservation included a continental breakfast  but upon checking in found that it did not  We were able to purchase a voucher    the night before    for a discounted breakfast tho  The breakfast was the basics but it was very serviceable and filling with eggs  breads  meats  yogurt  and some cold cereals We had a twin room    it was small but clean  The bathroom was always kept spotless and the shower was great  Not sure that housekeeping ever ran a vacuum the   nights we were there  tho  The rugs were a bit dirty and needed replacing Biggest complaint about our room was that it was in the lower level and on the Barkston Gardens side of the hotel  It was a bit noisy with people passing by  and there was some kind of access door just outside our window    possibly from the kitchen    below street level  On the   mornings we weren t out of our room by    a ish we heard fairly loud talking and people were smoking just outside the window  So be careful of room    The folks at the front desk ranged from very helpful to a bit prickly at times  They did point us in the direction of some nice restaurants in the area The location is a huge selling point  We were at Earl s Court  and only about a   minute walk from the front door  Very convenient when lugging luggage  The neighborhood had plenty of food choices  ATM terminals  convenience stores  grocery stores I d definitely stay there again    from earlier reviews I had read it sounds like they are putting money into the hotel to update it  I feel like the neutral   average rating is too low  but the above average is too high  So I d probably give it     stars  
P =>   Okay in a pinch Very small rooms  On a fairly quiet street  but make sure you don t get a room near elevator or lobby  Located near the Earls Court tube stop  about a    minute ride to the heart of London  We booked directly on the Best Western web site and paid      night including full breakfast  However  London is really expensive  so I don t know if a better deal is available 
P =>    days in London We stayed   nights at the Burns Hotel  Although the room was very small it was very clean and comfortable  The hotel is in an excellent location very close to Earls Court tube station and lots of restaurants and pubs  It was very quiet at night which was a bonus  We found it very easy walk to many of the places we wished to visit   Harrods  shops  museums etc  We ate breakfast each morning in the hotel  Most mornings we were down in the restaurant about         am and had no problems with seating or service though later on it did get very busy  As indicated already by another review the wait staff s english was not great but they all did their best  The desk staff were courteous and helpful with giving us directions and assisted us in booking a coach tour for one of the days  We were very pleased with our stay at the Burns Hotel and would stay there again if we came back to London  
P =>   Handy for Earls Court I had a single room at the Burns Hotel  staying overnight for a concert at Earls Court  The single room that I had was of a reasonable size for a single room  it had a bed  wardrobe  two chairs  chest of drawers  bed side table and dressing table  which is more than one frequently gets in a single room  There were also a large number of mirrors on the wall to try to make the room seem bigger  i woudl not hesitate to stay here again if I was attending an event at Earls Court  
P =>   Exactly as expected Most reviews on this site are spot on  This is a no frills hotel  The rooms are small but clean  We stayed           During our stay  they started replacing the old  worn out carpet that is mentioned in so many other reviews  The chemical like smell of the new carpet was overwhelming but how can you complain when they are updating something that clearly needs attention  The breakfast is adequate but I found the wait staff to be rather hard to communicate with  It was odd to me that most of the wait staff did not speak fluent English  Conveying your wishes was often difficult  The convenience of the breakfast certainly outweighed any negatives I would certainly stay here again  The location is superb  
P =>   Great stay   Stayed at the Best Western Burn s hotel this weekend as we were going to the Babylon restaurant on Kensington High Street  The hotel was a  min walk from Earls Court Tube station  well situated down a quiet side street which faced a lovely garden surrounded by huge victoria houses  We had a very easy check in by polite hotel staff  The room was on the smallish size but that was our only qualm  The room was quite warm but there was a nice big window which could be opened   Small bathroom with bath and shower  The bath could be filled in about   seconds  no word of a lie   There was also a t v and tea coffee making facilities  There are plenty of shops  restaurants and bars situated only   minutes away from the hotel  Breakfast either continental or full english  Unfortunately we had to wait a bit to be seated for breakfast and then had to sit with a lot of sales people who were staying at the hotel because of the Ideal Home Exhibition  It did ruin our quiet breakfast as they were very noisy and rude  We paid        for the room with breakfast which we thought was very reasonable  We did enjoy the stay and the next time we need to stay over in the city  we will definitely be staying here  
P =>   Great Value and Location   Small Single Rooms Booked a single room through London Hotel Site    night weekend stay for    GBP per night which included Breakfast  Hotel is less than   mins walk from Earl s Court tube station which is really convenient for either Gatwick Victoria or Heathrow Paddington  Staff very friendly and their English was fine  Full English Breakfast was good and I recommend pre paying  Had a  th floor room with a single bed which I found rather small but it was clean  No tub just a shower  Neighbourhood is very safe and there is a good selection of shops and pubs nearby  
P =>  excellent location My partner and I booked one night at this hotel as we were attending a concert at Earls Court  The location was ideal  just a few minutes walk from the tube station and five mintures to the Exhibition Centre The room was really small  and very tired  The loo seat was broken and the tiles grout needed redoing  Having said that the bed was comfortable and the shower worked so what else really do you need  Do not stay in room     unless you are a heavy sleeper  This is on a half landing and on the main route to most of the rooms so everyone walks past  We were woken at     am by the cleaners starting work in reception with hoovers and floor polishers  Would stay here again if visiting Earls Court just for where the hotel is  but would ask for a different room next time  
P =>   Worth it for the location I stayed here in ober    so the heat was not a problem Me and my girlfriend had booked a double room and were given a twin  In fairness it wasn t the hotel s fault  The receptionist showed me her booking slip   Damn internet company   She did move us for one night and tried to let us stay but eventually we had to move back to the twin The rooms are small so if you are spending anytime in your room you d better avoid it But any drawbacks are solved by its location  Facing a nice park it takes literally five minutes to walk to Earl s Court Tube station and all shops are on the way  Handy for picking up a few things on the way home Leaving the hotel you can be in Picadilly Circus within    minutes  Don t have huge expectations and you ll be willing to return  
P =>  A bit vague  Like everyone else  I agree that the rooms are small  I was here on business  so most of the time I was in the room I was asleep  and it was fine for that  Also  everything was well laid out and worked well  I ve been in smaller rooms in Europe which were much less comfortable Except that the staff were a bit vague   one morning I asked for an iron and ironing board     and ended up having to go down to reception   it turns out they d forgotten which room had asked for it  I had tried phoning reception  but I think they d also forgotten to turn their phones onto  quot day quot  or something   either way  it just rang out  At  am  this really wasn t great Proximity to Earl s Court meant that there was heaps happening on the doorstep  or High Street Kensington was only a short walk away  I would recommend this hotel  
P =>   Good value for money I stayed here for three nights in mid ober  took a trip to the north of England for two nights  and returned for one night before flying home  The Earl s Court location is not elegant  but it s very convenient to central London  and the hotel s location on Barkston Gardens made it more pleasant than if it were on a busy street  I arrived direct from the airport and was able to check into my room at about       a m   rather than having to wander about London for several hours  The single was small but not desperately so  the housekeeping was decent  the TV had a range of channels including Sky Sports  and the bath was new  I got continental breakfast with my rate  This included a range of cold cuts and cheeses  hard boiled eggs  yogurt  cereals  and decent rolls and croissants  along with coffee or tea and toast if desired  It was served in a very nice lower level dining room looking out on city gardens  Upon returning  my room was identical to the first one  but the bathroom was not as new  There were a few signs of mildew around the bathtub  This  and the tea tray not being restocked before my last night  are the only reason my review is not higher  I would stay here again  There is no A C  but in mid ober it wasn t a problem  
P => Convenient and Above Average Just got back from staying at the Best Western Burns Hotel in Barkston Gardens  Kensington  London  right in Earls Court   ALL I CAN SAY IS   GREAT  The location was a two minute walk to the Earls Court Tube station and the area is filled with some good little caf s and pubs We found the hotel to be very accommodating  we arrived at Heathrow at    am on an overnight flight from Canada  from the airport  the tube ride to the Earls Court station was about    minutes  The front desk person was very helpful  she requested that housekeeping clean a room for us right away b c she knew we d come in on the red eye   we were in our room and taking a nap within the hour  The room itself was fine  if a bit crowded  but not uncomfortably so   It was tidy  quiet and clean  we had no complaints We didn t opt to eat in the hotel as the breakfast prices seemed a bit high  but we found great places on the high street in front of the tube station where we bought coffees and breakfast buns to go I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a convenient and reasonably priced location within a few minutes  tube ride to all the areas around London  you can walk too  of course  but those maps are deceptive sometimes and what looks to be a few stations away is actually an hour by foot   The tube line from Heathrow stops at Earls Court and if you need to get to Gatwick  it s a   station stop to the Gatwick Airport train at Victoria  is that right   Station  Now I m rambling so I ll stop  but I do recommend this hotel highly  as does my husband  
P =>   A nice hotel I found this hotel to be pretty good  Probably the only real downside was the size of the room  My friend and booked a twin room and we could reach out and touch each other from any point in the room  and we re only     girls so the room was pretty small   Apart from this the beds were comfortable and clean and the cleaners were efficient  The bathroom was small but clean and adequate  The TV had a good range of channels The best thing about the hotel was the location  It was a   minute walk from the tube station and there were plently of cafes  pubs  restaurants  convenience store and a post office   minute away on earls court road  We found plenty of restaurants close by that were cheap  within a student budget  that werent mentioned in the guidebooks The continental breakfast was good and the wait staff were lovely All in all I would stay here again  
P =>   Good value We stayed at this Hotel from e  th for six nights and did some sightseeing in London  When I made the reservation via internet  Best Western reservation system  I asked for  quot best price quot  and so I think that s the reason they gave us a tiny double room on the  th floor  right under the roof   We asked for a non smoking room which was granted  The room was very small but clean  The bathroom was ridiculously small with no real ventilation   so one could see a mouldy ceiling  The towels were changed every day  There is no air condition and it was getting quite hot in the afternoon but we could leave the window open during the night so it was bearable The English breakfast was superb and the continental breakfast buffet well equiped  the staff were very friendly both in the restaurant and at the front desk Although it s just a short walk down to Earl s Court station the hotel is located in a very quiet neighbourhood  And there are plenty of shops and restaurants around  even a   h Sainsbury s supermarket We would stay at this hotel again but next time we would choose a bigger room   not on the top floor  
P =>  Great for the price Have just returned from a theatre break  Stayed at this hotel  including full English breakfast  which was cokked fresh to order   so was all piping hot  and good tickets to Whistle Down the Wind   paid a total of         for two adults  Which i think is excellent value  Had a twin room   yes it was hot but opened the window beforewe went out so was fairly cool when we came back in the evening  The room was equipped with fresh towels  coffee and tea making facilites  so no real complaints  Staff were friendly  The tube station is a couple of minutes walk away  The show is excellent  All in all a good trip for a very reasonable rate  
P =>  Not a good value The hotel has a great location  Although it is so close to the tube station you can hear them in your room  We stayed for three nights and our family shared two rooms  Both rooms were tiny and had poor air circulation  It was unbearably hot  There was no air conditioning or fans  The hotel is clean but a little worn  There were holes in our curtains and duck tape on the carpet in the halls  The hall smelled of the cigarette ashtrays  I don t recommend this hotel  
P =>   Well located but small rooms and so hot in the summer I attended a   day exhibition at Earls Court so being as this hotel was   minutes down the road  it was very useful  The hotel and the rooms were clean which I would expect from a Best Western hotel  There were problems however  Firstly there is no air conditioning in any of the rooms  In a hot e  this was unbearable  The windows only open a couple of inches  so no fresh air could get into the room  Getting a good night sleep was almost impossible  Several of my work collegues who were also staying at the hotel had similar problems with the heat  so it wasnt just a problem with one room  Also the rooms were very small  I had a single room  so I wasnt expecting it to be large but this was tiny Also  the phone didnt work in my room  Overall a unpleasant experience  Avoid 
P =>  Excellent Value This hotel is everything you can need if you are staying in London for sightseeing or taking in a show  The hotel is very clean  my room which was a single was big enough for me and very clean  The staff are excellent and nothing is too much trouble for them  The full breakfast is more than enough to keep you going to lunchtime and the fact it was available up until       meant that if you wanted a long lie you would not miss out  The hotel is literally round the corner from the tube and you are in the centre of London in minutes  The setting in a residential square meant that at night it was nice and quite with no worries about safety The only problem I had was the squeaky floorboards but as it is an old building you must expect this  I had read the reviews of the hotel after booking and was concerned about some of the negative reviews  they could not be more wrong and I can only assume they were looking for a   star hotel at   star prices  
P =>  Not so great   although staff is friendly We stayed   days at this hotel and was impressed by the staff  but not by the hotel  Beds were uncomfortable  lumpy and very hard   hallway carpeting very shabby  buffet breakfast was average at best  The single and double rooms are VERY VERY small  think large walk in closet with a tiny bathroom attached   If you can afford to upgrade to a triple  do it  The triple room is MUCH bigger  more than double the size  I think   Also  the bathrooms in the triple rooms are a bit larger  Given it s draw backs  the staff was very friendly   they upgraded us to a triple room free of charge  and the room was clean  As for location  it is fantastic  Very close to the Earl s Court tube station  but it is on a quieter street   not a busy thorough fare  The neighborhood felt very safe  as well  even for a woman traveling alone   I was there a couple of nights without my husband and still felt quite safe   I would recommend the hotel  but with severe reservations  If you can t afford the upgrade to a triple   don t stay here   You cannot believe how small the rooms are  worse than I had seen anywhere else in England and Scotland   and I ve stayed in several hotels   If you are staying in a triple room  you will probably be satified with your stay at this hotel  
P =>  Good Value My husband and I stayed here as part of theatre package at a cost of      inc breakfast Although our room was tiny and somewhat warm due to a lack of air conditioning it was however very clean and adequate for an overnight stay  The breakfast was very good and the staff more than helpful As our theatre tickets alone would have cost in the region of     this hotel represented excellent value for money 
P =>  More than two stars  I stayed there for a whole week including a weekend  I took a bed  amp  breakfast promotion by internet  great price  I had a small but more than comfortable bedroom  and had it all  enough for one person and spacious bathroom  tv  coffee maker  Everything so neat and clean  The breakfast of course was included and it was more than I expected  more than a  quot continental breakfast quot   The staff all of young and nice friendly people  The location of the hotel is more than convinient  A few steps from Barkston Gardens to your right it s Earl s Court and aproximately two blocks from that corner ther s the tube station and many bus stops  ATM machines  internet caf s  stores  drugstores  restaurants and there s even a typical british pub in the corner of Earl s Court and the street of the Barkston Gardens  Upfront there s a k  amp  Spencer food store  Although a bit far from Picadilly  Oxford Circus  Covent Garden  
P =>  great  This hotel was pretty good   The positive The location is great  It has some really good restaurauts by it  and The Earl s Court Tube Station is about a block away  The hotel staff was very nice and always helped  The hotel in general was in very nice shape  espcially for its price  the negative The worst complaint was how hot the room was  It was like summer in our room  We tried to adjust to heater  there is no AC  to be cooler but it was still really hot The faucet water smells like its from a well  So obviously brushing your teeth was not very fun  tips There is a ks and Spencers  grocery store  which is great to pick up some stuff  Also there is a GREAT pizza restauraunt near the Earl s Court Station  it s great for dinner Try not to go in ch  because its cold and most things are outside  
P =>  Great stay at the Burns We have just spent a couple of nights at the Burns and found it very convenient just a   minute walk from Earls Court underground station  It is in a quiet spot and the staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly  It is not a modern hotel   which suits us   and if I had any complaint it would be squeaky floorboards   so no big problem really  The bar was pleasant and the bar meals reasonable  the full restaurant evening menu was not available on the weekend we stayed so I can t comment on that  The breakfast included in our package was great   plenty of it  freshly cooked  and very tasty  the continental looked good too   plenty of choice The main thing for me was good location  warm rooms with good facilities for tea coffee a lovely bathroom  all cleaned daily to a high standard and most of all the excellent staff  helpful  friendly  efficient and courteous  
P => Good value excellent location This is a good value hotel in an excellent location  We had a quiet room at the back  and friends at the front also enjoyed a quiet couple of nights  as the hotel is off the main road in a residential area  Very small room at the back but clean  All we needed for a couple of nights as we were out all day  The prices in the bar were shocking   walk   minutes down the road to Earls Court Road for better value refreshments  
P => nice place The hotel is nice  very good service  We stayed on the first level in small but clean and very conforable room  with twin bed  a desk two armchairs and table  coff  and tea  Nice buffet breakfast with a discrete chioce   minutes walking from Earls Court Tube Station Paid for a last minute offer  excellent value  Overall a nice hotel and will probably book again in the future  
P =>  Cheep and cheerful  The room was small and basic  but perfect for a night s sleep after a long day on the town  Not the sort of room you d want to spend hours in relaxing   but you are coming to London to see the sights  aren t you  not the inside of a hotel room The location is a huge plus   on a relatively quiet  I said  quot relatively quot    this is London  If you want quiet go to the countryside  side street just around the corner from Earls Court tube station and with lots of eating and drinking options nearby I got a rate of    pounds including breakfast by booking online  which is as close as you can get to a bargain for central London I d definitely stop there again for a leisure trip to London  For business  I d stop elsewhere   but I wouldn t be spending my own money  
P =>  Good and Cheap Good location  a   min walk from Earls Court  I paid     for room for Friday before Xmas from Lastminute which inc  full english breakfast  Our room was small but clean and comfortable and at the back of the hotel so was extremely quiet If you are quite a large person you will struggle to fit into the bathroom as very small  Ideal for a night away in the city  
P =>  great hotel great location definately come back I stayed at the Burns Hotel last week and I can truly say that I was pleasantly surprised by the hotel and the location  I had not stayed in the Earls court Kensington area before  The nearest underground station is a   minute walk from the hotel and you can get to piccadilly circus or covent garden in    mins  My room was small  but all London hotel rooms are  but very comfortable  It was great to be able to have room service when I returned late at night  I arrived too late for breakfast  but the staff were very friendly and still let me have some continetal breakfast from the buffet  I will recommend this hotel to my friends and will certainly stay again  
P =>  The horror    The heat and street noise    In Canada I read there was a sale at the Burns and stayed one night  all I could take  for    pounds  The street noise was hellish  The room was stifling and it was impossible to open the window  The room was extremely small with a hostel  sized bed  I could not put the chain on the door because it was broken  One light didn t work  The reception people were lovely  It was the hotel itself that was a big disappointment  I would never stay there again  I fled in the morning  
P =>  Great location shabby interior Stayed hear for one night on        Location was great  we were at Earls Court for a concert  The reception is very nice  unfortunately the corridors and room we stayed in wasnt as good  carpets worn and torn  stuck down with tape  and the room was smelly   ok maybe my fault for booking a smoking room but it was quite bad  the bathroom was reasonably clean but lacking in space and needs a good scrub in places  Breakfast was very nice and reception staff friendly  Cant help but think maybe could have got better for     a night 
P =>  Good price and location We stayed in a twin room        for three nights  The hotel rate was pretty good      pounds a night including a full breakfast  The hotel is in a convenient location   a short walk from the Earl s Court Underground station as well as a short walk from some pubs and food stores  We really only used the room to sleep and shower  It was an average room by European standards   pretty small  but perfectly functional  The bathroom was tiny  but again  functional  The room was clean and tidy and the beds were comfortable  The hotel itself is run by what I believe is a foreign company   most of the staff were friendly  with the exception of some restaurant staff who were a bit surly   The lifts are very small   we fit two small women and two small suitcases  On departure  I had additional bags and we couldn t fit everything into the lift  But if you ve traveled to the UK before and you ve stayed in an older hotel  you know this is normal  One of the problems that bothered me was the floor noise   the floors creaked in the hallway so you could hear everyone walk by  It wasn t such a big deal for us since we were at the end of the hallway  but you could hear the next room over creaking as well as the shower running  A big thanks to the folks staying across the hall   we loved hearing you shouting as you arrived back to your room at     am   not the hotel s fault of course   Another problem was that our room faced the street  It s a residential street  but you can still hear noises like car alarms  which went off the first night   sirens  the trash pickups  etc  I d recommend asking for a room facing the back of the hotel if possible  Also  be sure to check the number on the info book in the room   I gave my husband the phone number listed on the book and it was for some other hotel in Westminster  Apparently they get a lot of calls for people staying at the Best Western Burns Kensington  In all  it was an okay stay  We were pleased to have a comfy place to sleep for a decent price  by London s standards   
P =>  good triple room  I stayed   nights with   adult daughters in a room with   single beds   it was on the lower level at the front of the hotel  so the foot traffic along the sidewalk was a bit noisy late in the evening as the windows were open for air as there is no central air  amp  it was a warm week   but other than that it was clean  large bathroom  comfortable  pleasant safe area  we took cabs everywhere as we weren t comfortable with the tube so soon after the trouble they d had  we d stay here again happily  didn t use the food services at the hotel  there is internet available until about midnight about   blocks away   we felt fine as   women walking together along the main streets in the evening  staff was pleasant  elevator tiny  
P =>   Good value hotel We stayed at the Burns hotel for two nights while attending an exhibition  as it is very handily situated for both Earls Court and Olympia Exhibition Centres  and is also just around the corner from Earls Court tube  The hotel is on a quiet side street  overlooking Barkston Gardens  and there is a good selection of pubs and restaurants nearby for dining out Our room was at the back  and was blissfully quiet  Although the room was a little on the small side  it was pleasantly decorated  the beds were comfortable and the bathroom clean and tidy with nice soft towels  The complimentary toiletries are good quality  with shampoo  conditioner  body wash and body lotion supplied  and these are replaced daily Breakfast was a bit of a let down  They d run out of half of the ingredients for the  quot full english quot   and what was available arrived tepid Check in staff were pleasant and helpful  although the servers in the dining room could do with a few days at  quot smile school quot    they were a little surly All in all  a good hotel for the money  and we d go back if we needed to be in that part of London again  
P =>  Small Small Small Rooms We have stayed at the Burns Hotel several times and so have other members of our family  The staff  breakfast  dinning room  bar and location are some of best in London for a    hotel  HOWEVER  beware that the rooms are very small  If you can touch   of the   walls in room from the bed  the room is too small  Additionally the decor of the rooms has suffered over the years and is in need of fresh paint and furnishing  Our room was particularly bad as it was directly over the kitchen and the staff starts every morning at      a m  The clanking of dishes  the smell of frying bacon and the chopping of whatever meant little sleep after      a m  If the Burns is to continue to attract guests  they need to knock down some walls  enlarge and redecorate the rooms and buy some air conditioners  
P =>   Not worth it for the price I paid    I suppose the value of this hotel depends on what you end up paying for it  Having paid the same price I paid for the Holiday Inn Forum  there was simply NO COMPARISON   the same goes for the Cumberland  and many other London hotels that can be had for a price similar to this one s through priceline  The staff here is very nice and helpful  the breakfast is good  and the location is great   just a block away from the Earl s Court station and many shops and restaurants  The rooms  however  are not    by any means   and the no air conditioning  plus creaky floors  tight hallways and miniscule bathrooms make it not so great I would stay here if I had to  but certainly wont  choose it if given other options  If you get a cheap cheap deal on this  under        then its ok   but in the U S   this would be a     room  
P =>  Nice Hotel Staff Location I stayed there for   nights                     What a nice little hotel  The room was small  but  clean and nicely decorated  I believe the room had recently been refurbished because the bed was firm and the furniture carpet bath were in excellent condition  The breakfast was delicious and filling  I tried both the contintental and English ones   The staff was very helpful  Earlier in the week I was staying at a nearby hotel that was not as good in quality and at nearly the same price  The Burns was a much better value  I got a good rate via the internet   Yes  the floors creak  there s no A C and the lift is small  But  this is a very fine budget hotel in a city notoriously known for lousy inexpensive accommodations  The location is excellent  on a quite sidestreet just off the busy Earl s Court Rd and tube stop  I could get to anywhere in central London in about   mins by tube  I would definitely stay there again  Nice job  BW Burns Hotel  
P => Got Roaches  If Not You Can Find Them Here  For such a crappy hotel  I can say honestly that the staff were very attentive and professional  Also  the location is great  just off the Earl s Court tube stop and very easy to get to pretty much everything  But that s about all I can say that is positive about this hotel  We arrived on one of the hottest days on record in years in London  only to find that the  quot air conditioning quot  the hotel claims to have is only in the hallways  that is  of course  on the rare occasions when they didn t have the heat on   They did provide us with a tiny fan  but it didn t help much  The room was exceedingly small  but we expected that because most European hotels are like that  Be prepared for your feet to hang over the edge of the bed  I m only     quot  and mine did      The beds were also quite lumpy and uncomfortable  On night two  we found a roach practically the size of a car roaming about our room  To be fair  they credited us a few pounds at checkout for that  but that courtesy was later overshadowed by the huge annoyance I experienced as a result of them screwing up the charges on my credit card  see below  On night three  the room reeked of raw sewage  At first we thought it was coming from outside  but it was actually coming from the bathroom  Needless to say  the fan didn t help THAT much  either Over a week after checkout  I discovered that the hotel had failed to release the hold they placed on my credit card when I checked in  even though they had also charged me THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE STAY when I checked out  thereby taking up double the room on my credit card   Apparently  as I found out after paying for several international calls  the hold is not released until    days after they authorize it   which means that this hold will have been on my credit card a total of    days by the time it is actually released  They failed to mention that little tidbit when I checked in  My advice  steer clear of the roaches and raw sewage and head for another hotel  
P =>  Perfect for short breaks The Burns Hotel Kensington is a lovely Edwardian mansion that has been converted into a hotel  a heritage plaque on the front of the building notes that it was once the home of the Victorian actress Ellen Terry   Although it is part of the Best Western chain  don t let that put you off   the hotel retains its own distinct character and personality and there is nothing synthetic or  quot chain quot  about it The hotel is located on a safe and picturesque square less than a block away from the Earl s Court tube stop  Next to the Tube exit you ll find yourself on a street of  quot real quot  shops like ks  amp  Spencer Food and Boots  not tourist shops or overpriced city grocers  This helps you save a fortune on food and amenities  and allows you to travel light as well As a converted residence  the scale of the hotel is a bit small  The lift is barely large enough to hold you and your luggage  the hallways are almost comical with their multiple sets of steps and interior doors  and the rooms were perhaps half the size of other London hotel rooms  Then again  why pay a lot of a money for a huge room that s mostly decorative space  The important thing is that the rooms at the Burns Hotel do have all the necessary amenities   wardrobe  TV  desk  tasteful decor  etc   that you can count on with the Best Western chain  My only complaint was that it the room was roasting hot  to the point where I had to open up the window to get air  That said  this was during a heat wave of    degrees with high humidity  the sort of weather which Britain rarely experiences  so my discomfort was not really the hotel s fault Although my room rate included breakfast  a full English buffet is utterly unappealing in a heat wave  so I can t comment on the food It s not palatial or fancy  but the Burns Hotel Kensington meets all your needs in a clean  safe  and well serviced setting  Although it might be a bit claustrophobic for longer trips or visits with children in tow  it s perfect for short breaks or for independent travelers Highly recommended  
P =>  Good Location  Stayed here in       before heading to Normandy  France with my dad and uncle  D Day vets   Good location  near the Earls Court Tube Station  also an internet cafe just around the corner  Could easily get here from Heathrow airport by subway and avoid expense taxis transfers  my brother  dad   amp  uncle did without any trouble   Stayed in the basement area  rooms were nice   no A C but didn t need it  Breakfast was good  Would stay again  
P =>  Good Value Date of stay   ruary     One of the best features of this hotel is its proximity to the tube station  Earl s Court   which is just around the corner  The hotel is located on a quiet residential street  but close to lots of restraints  pubs and convenience stores  I was prepared for it  but the room  a single  was indeed small  However  it was comfortable  reasonably clean and had all that I required  I asked for and received a nonsmoking room  which seemed to be one of many  The bilingual staff was helpful and friendly  they even made a reservation for my hotel shuttle  The breakfast  full and continental  was nothing fancy  but just fine and included quite a bit of variety  While you may not choose this hotel for a special trip  it definitely meets the needs of the tourist and is a very good monetary value by London standards  
P => value for money stayed here over a weekend  family room a bit small but adequate  location excellent    mins walk to tube station and    mins by tube to central london  parking a nightmare  traffic wardens everywhere  just off the A    M   paid     per night for family room sleeping three  including full breakfast which I thought was good value  clean and tidy  Oh and the fire alarm system works   the alarm went off at midnight and the staff were competent in getting everyone out and the rooms searched  false alarm  definately stay again  
P =>  Warm and comfortable Stayed at the end of ember for   nights  We got a smoking room on the  nd floor at the back  as non smoking rooms were not available  but were astonished as neither the room nor the corridor smelled at all  The room was small but cleaned and super quiet  Didn t hear a thing during the whole stay  The radiator in the room was very efficient  We could switch it on and off and regulate the temperature at our convenience  The bathroom was a mini sauna as the towel rail was always boiling hot  but at   degrees C outside that wasn t a problem  specially in the morning Breakfast was very pleasant  with bread  preserves  croissants  fresh fruit juices  yogurt  boiled eggs and cold meats  Staff efficient and attentive Overall  a comfortable unpretentious hotel with charm  Very convenient for Heathrow airport by tube  At   GBP per night  we found it good value  
P =>  Great Value Great Location I am rating the Burns  quot Above Average quot  based on the value you get for your    The hotel is clean  the staff extremely pleasant and helpful  Internet special rates start at     per night  and INCLUDES a FULL English breakfast each day  Rooms are small but adequate and clean  Location is superb  only     short blocks to the Earls Court Tube Station There is internet access in the lobby  and the restaurant and bar are of better than average quality  Lift can only accomodate   people with little baggage  On a scale of       the Best Western Burns is definitely an  or   when considering the value  I would highly recommend the Burns to the budget conscious traveller  
P =>  Good location  Stayed here for   nights in november  Great location  just around the corner from the Earls Court tube  Quiet street  Floors and walls are paper thin  so didnt appreciate the people tap dancing in the room above us  Smallish rooms  but coming from Europe  we expected it About average  
P =>  not recommended Best Western  Worst Western is more like it  though it pains me to say it  Do yourself a favor and don t even consider this place  Here s why  I stayed at the Best Western Burns in Kensington for two nights in tember       The single room was very  very small  but that s to be expected   The bathroom was so small  in fact  that they couldn t fit the hair drier inside  It was fixed to the wall of the main room directly above the desk   The hotel was an easy  though not entirely obvious  walk from the tube and far enough off of busy Earl s Court Road not to have the traffic noise  The staff was quite friendly and front rooms overlook a park  which can be quite pleasant at least when screaming children are not in it However  my non smoking room smelled strongly of smoke   or maybe it was dust  Frankly  my sense of smell has deteriorated quite a bit and I have a hard time distinguishing the two  Nonetheless  the odor was strong enough to cause my eyes to burn and give me a headache within    minutes of checking in  Other problems   no in room air conditioning  grease stained and crumb filled seats in the breakfast area  an uncomfortably hard mattress that left me with a stiff back each morning  a poisoned  Predator pest control  trap  for mice   between the bed and the wall just a foot or so below where I lay my head at night  extremely squeaky floorboards both in the halls and in the rooms  minor chipping and pealing of the paint and wall paper  a half used cake of soap leftover in the shower from a previous guest  and someone else s nail clippings  yuck   on the stained  faded  threadbare carpet  If you want to stay in this general area of London  I d recommend the Holiday Inn  Hilton Olympia  or Hilton Kensington at Holland Park   the latter of which I checked into when I fled the Burns two days into my five day stay  
P =>  The Burns Hotel is a Good Buy My father and I stayed at the Burns Hotel for two nights in early ust  We both had single rooms which were well furnished and of satisfactory size  The bathrooms were roomy and equipped with bath tubs  Since this was at a hot time of the year  we requested rooms in the back that didn t get the morning sun  In addition the staff provided fans that were a big help  The breakfast with our room rate was the full English breakfast which was very filling and served in the cheerful air conditioned diningroom  We booked the hotel through Best Western International and for    pounds per room per night with full English breakfast this was a real bargain  The hotel is well located near the Earl s Court tube in addition to being close to many inexpensive eateries  
P => Okay  but not in the summer i stayed at the burns this spring  early may  for   nights  unfortunately the strength of the pound did not make this a deal  the hotel was a close to the tube and on a nice block  the room was a decent size by european standards but the beds were a terrible  you could feel the cross bars in the mattress  however  the staff was very nice and on the   night i was given an extra comforter that was a nice cushion for the bad mattress  fortunately the weather was still very nice  but with no a c i could not image staying here in warmer weather  the breakfast buffet is pretty good  i don t think i would return  
P =>  Great Stay at the Burns Hotel  We stayed at the Burns Hotel for six nights in late  early e and really liked this hotel  We even started calling it  quot home  quot  A brief warning    not all rooms are equal size   we had to play  quot room roulette quot  for awhile and finally they found us a suitable room  The first one we were shown was the size of a closet  I m not kidding   The breakfast was outstanding   in fact  any meals we ate at the hotel were delicious  Loved the quaint bar at the end of the day   only one night was it crowded  well  they need to make money  too    Yes  the floors creak   not a big problem  The street is quiet and the park across the street made for a pleasant location  Earls Court tube stop just down the street and around the corner  The location had lots of shops and restaurants    Zizzi  sp   was great for Italian  Try it  Neighborhood is not an  quot upscale quot  area  but a REALLY nice area to stay  I would highly recommend the Burns Hotel and would definitely stay there again  and probably will

P =>  Comfortable hotel We spent   nights at the Best Western Chiswick on a recent trip to London  Clean and comfortable  close to restaurants and station  Good value for money by London standards  
P =>   lovely hotel in lovely chiswick we stayed here for my husbands birthday its was a very clean and well maintained hotel good service and i felt safe here   chiswick is a atmospheric town with very friendly locals we were very happy with our stay here and will stay here in the future   
P =>    A very pleasant stay  Everything about my stay was enjoyable  From the moment I arrived to the moment I left  When I first arrived  about       a m    heavily laden with bags and tired from my tube journey  they let me check in early  about         I stayed in a single room on the first  second  if you re American  floor with a lovely view of the back garden  I had a choice of using A C or opening the window slightly for fresh air  Lovely to hear blackbirds singing in the morning  The twin bed was very comfortable  and clean  The warddrobe was large and quality made  The included buffet breakfast was great and generous  except for slight xtra chg for sausage bacon   there s a beautiful back enclosed breakfast dining deck for garden viewing  The communal computer with limited internet access served me fine  the staff were exceedingly helpful  e g   helping me get my flight confirmation printed   the room was kept clean  well serviced  Also  my room was quiet  though I realize this could differ from room to room and stay to stay  and the bath was HUGE and luxurious  even by American standards   and everything worked as expected   NOTE  some rooms obviously are closer to the traffic side of the hotel and may not be as quiet   The tea coffee and biscuits  etc replenished every day were most appreciated  I loved the handy little water boiler  so cute  My room also had a very handy and easy to use safe  Everything was so easy and convenient  The hotel is within      minutes walk to a choice of two separate tube stops in a safe and semi residential neighborhood overall  with plenty of shopping and dining choices as well  The whole stay was great    I was sorry to leave  I was easily able to pre check out the night before my flight left  early in the morning   This was one of the best hotel stays I ve ever had in my life  for the price   and I ve been to LOTS of hotels  I especially appreciated the one female desk attendant  She was so helpful  kind and friendly  yet professional  I may be wrong but the only drawback for others may be that I did not notice a lift  elevator  anywhere  This did not bother me personally though   My  only personal complaint  and this is Best Western s fault in general  I think  not this hotel in particular  is their flimsy metal toilet and towel holders  They tend to come apart at the slightest pull and then crash to the floor noisily  Bottomline  I do hope the Chiswick Palace  amp  Suites manages to keep up its high standards and keeps up the good work  because I will definitely choose it again if I m fortunate enough to visit Britain again any time soon  
P =>   excellent   in parts I recently stayed at the Chiswick Palace twice  on both occasions for one night stopovers What I liked  adequate breakfast  free wi fi  in theory   see below   v  friendly front desk staff  clean and newly decorated rooms  Safe in room  Quiet location  in the sense that I heard little noise from outside  What I loved  the location  Reasonably close to Heathrow on the tube  if you calculate a journey time of approx        minutes  Short walk to Turnham Green station  Chiswick High Road has many good restaurants  bars and caf s  an M amp S  food only  and Sainsburys supermarket  Waterstones bookshop  several charity shops and many independent stores selling virtually everything  Being away from the obvious tourist spots means less risk of tourist traps  It is also leafy   less concrete  more trees  Low rates  a room for around    quid including breakfast in a nice part of London is not to be sneezed at  What I disliked  on my first visit there was no Internet in the rooms  I stayed in the building at the back   On my second visit I had no hot water one day  The reason why I had no hot water was because there was work going on outside and  despite phone calls down to reception  no one told me to leave the taps on for five minutes  in the land of hosepipe bans  or more in order to  quot bleed quot  the cold water OK these things happen  but no Internet service for several days in one part of the hotel should not happen when this amenity was advertised  Size of room and room proximity  For my first stay I stayed in what must be the smallest  single  room I have ever slept in  albeit strangely comfortable  I was next to a room which I believe to have been used by a member of staff on night duty  this is the only explanation I can find for constant to ing and fro ing at all times  The second room was larger and had aircon  unlike the first  However the room rate  with or without aircon  was the same  This I find a tad irritating  As for the proximity to other rooms  my single in the main building was perilously close to two other rooms and their slamming doors  Plus the fact that this is an oldish building with creeking floorboards and I was woken at      a m  by someone s early start to the day  Would I stay there again  Yes indeedy  given the location  low rates  reasonable comfort and friendly staff  
P =>   Lovely hotel The hotel is situated on the busy Chiswick High street and does not look very inviting from the outside but once inside the hotel and the ensuite rooms it was definately worth every penny of the        per night for the two of us  The area has good transport links and lots of places to eat and drink on your doorstep  The staff we re friendly the breakfast good and would definately go back again  
P =>  Suites are good value Overall very happy with the Suites side of the hotel  A tip if you book via laterooms com   Hotel thought we had booked a hotel room not a suite  I took the hotel room to throw my bags in and then the manager gave me their internet terminal so I could check my booking  He showed me the fax through from Laterooms and it did look like the std hotel room  Showed the manager the web page I booked from and we managed to decipher from the website and the fax via a few key words on the fax that I should be in a suite  They immediately moved me into a suite Standard suite is small but nice modern decor and very clean  Bed comfortable  air cond worked  Bathroom small but ok  Free toiletries included     hr reception  Wake calls booked daily and were actioned  Room was cleaned to a high standard everyday and toiletries and coffee etc were always replenished  New towels everyday  Big bath sheet towels provided  Kitchenette was useful  Broadband LAN internet access provided free  TV and TV Internet free  Swipe cards to enter suites building and the room so very secure  Safe provided  No problem with valuables not in safe  We paid   GPB per night  If you want a big room expect to pay a lot more in London We stayed for a week    adults   Room is small but that s London  Good location   mins walk to Paddington Underground and trains  Reception staff were helpful and professional  Only issue during our stay was a loss of Broadband internet for a few days to all their hotels due to their ISP  Wireless still available  Staff let me use their back office internet which was direct line from a different ISP  Also as I got to see their Hotel standard room for about half an hour I can attest that it was clean but small We were on the ground floor towards the back and never had any noise issues  We would happily stay here again  Clearly from the reviews people are assessing two different products hotel and suites  I would recommend paying a little extra and booking a suite  
P =>  Cheap Sleep but with a Price After years of staying at affordable  cheap  hotels in London I consider myself an expert  This hotel goes at the bottom of my list  I booked a single room for   nights which turned out to be down a maze of very narrow hallways and questionable stairs The room turned out to  ft by   ft   I measured it   I think this is about the size of a prison cell  However  compared to the bathroom  the sleeping area was a suite   At          US a bench in nearby Hyde Park would be an improvement I have not slept in such a small space since I drank too much wine one night and fell asleep on my bathroom floor Now the bath    one small bar of soap for   days  one plastic drinking glass which unfortunately I tossed and was not replaced Now the bed    ok  if you like sleeping with a depression in the middle OK so at least the room was reasonably clean  that is if you immediately remove the bed spread and stuff it under the bed In short  I have stayed at some reallly  quot quaint quot  places all over the world but this was even too much for me FYI   looking for an affordable sleep in London try the Phoenix Hotel nearby  I have been there many times and was never disappointed LDF 
P =>  Very enjoyable stay My family and I stayed at the Best Western Paddington Court Hotel a couple of weeks ago and we had a great stay There were   of us altogether and we had three nicely furnished  well equipped rooms  i would recommend to anyone  families or business folk to stay here  we came from the US  and found the location to be a major bonus  it was a primary reason for staying here  plus the rates we got were good  Paddinton station is about   blocks from the hotel  all in all the journey from heathrow to the hotel took around    minutes  just great for a large group  especially with the kids  The facade of the hotel is just beautiful  as is most of paddington  I think they recently did some refurb work as the floor we were on was very modern and fresh looking  the reception is bright and spacious and very welcoming  we went down for breakfast one morning and there was a good selection fo hot and cold food  the bar seemed quiet though in the evening  cant have it all i guess  Highly recommended  very pleasant stay  
P =>  Feels Like Home Honestly  I d give it four stars and a half  I spent around a month at this hotel with my friend and the service was really nice  smiley faces were there to greet you every morning  We booked for a studio with a microwave  air condition  and shower power  The air condition did not work the first day but they apologized and moved us to a brighter room after two days with the same price  The room had all we needed and the best thing was the excellent use of free internet       The only thing that was annoying was finding a cockroach almost one per day because our room was in the basement  but beside that the room was cleaned everyday and nice flowers were arranged  The price we got through booking online was also great and they gave us a special offer when we wanted to extend our stay one more week  We would definitely book there again if we went to London  The area seemed very safe and quite  Close to the hotel were mini supermarkets  restaurants  Hyde Park and Oxford Street  The close Paddington Bus Station and Underground Station made it easy for us to move around form area to area  
P =>   Excellent Customer Service I stayed in the first week of ust for   nights at the Best Western Paddington Court hotel on a business trip Impressed with the customer focussed staff  their attention to details and above all the willingness to go that extra bit  Surprisingly after just   day everyone from restaurant staff to the manager knew me by my name and greeted me Rooms are very well equipped with the modern facilities like free broadband internet and interactive television  Lounge and bar are equipped with free wi fi internet access which made my business meetings very feasible Location is great  just about   minutes walk from the Paddington train station  Queensway underground station  many restaurants and the Hyde Park   STAR HOTEL WITH   STAR CUSTOMER SERVICEI 
P =>   Too Expensive for such a Small Room Stayed there for   nights in  of     Stayed in a Single room  I could stand in the middle of the room and touch both walls  Window would not open  to let out the heat  I could hear people in the rooms next to me talking  Front Deskstaff not very friendly and over worked The location is great near paddington  Lots of Stores and restraunts in the area  I would stand in the Paddington area again  just not at this hotel 
P =>  Great find Stayed at this hotel over the ust Bank Holiday and couldn t really fault it  Pleasant hotel with nice staff who were glad to help us with everything  Rooms were clean  bright and comfortable  The hotel was also in a great location and only minutes from Paddington station which was a god send after the day shopping Would definately recommend this hotel for a nice relaxing city break 
P =>   Cockroach in the night  I have returned home from a lovely trip to London despite trying to rid myself of the memory of finding a huge cockroach in my bathroom in the middle of the night and having been provided with a cot with shakey wooden supports for my daughter in a musty basement suite  Needlessless to say  my wife and I slept poorly that first night as did my daughter who slept with us I will definitely consider getting something more for the money next time I am in town  
P =>  Great Hotel    I stayeed there in il and the hotel was sooooo nice  The staff were great and breakfast was perfect  There was free broadband and interactive TV  Room was great  only problem was the bar only opening at  pm but overall a great hotel  
P =>  My home away from home I live in Washington  DC and travel to London on average once every month or two and stay anywhere from        days each trip  I have tried them ALL  I did some research to find one place that I could continue to return to and I decided to try this hotel despite the reviews  Well  I have stayed in the Suites part of the hotel about   times so far since Spring and it is the cleanest  brightest  friendliest  most reasonably priced hotel in West London  Other hotels make all of these promises regarding their  suite   but they never meet expectations  This place does Since I stay so often now I have my favorite room and it has become my home away from home  It never disappoints  On the occasion that there is some reason I need to deal with the hotel staff for a problem  it is handled promptly and with great customer service  The Management is the best and I have heard other customers mention this as well   they want people to enjoy their stay  plan to return and tell others to do the same because they are proud of their hotel  I have referred associates here who usually stay at one of the large chain hotels and they prefer the suites here to those monstrosities  The street and the area are both clean and quiet with the conveniences of stores and restaurants right around the corner and Paddington station within   blocks walk  This is a great hotel  Just don t ask for my room    
P =>   They cancelled me rerservation without informing me  We booked to stay with Best Western Paddington Court Hotel and Suites through hotels     for our stay in London  for the Live   concert  I rang the hotel the previous night to confirm my reservation and to my horror our reservation had been cancelled  which my partner or I never did  I contacted hotels     and they said my reservation had not been cancelled through them or myself  Personally I believe as it was a busy weekend the hotel over booked or somebody offered over the odds rather than booking in advance and paying the going rate as I did  I never got an apology from the hotel and if I had turned up without confirming my reservation I would have been extremely upset had I turned up and they told me this  However I spent the night before my trip to London on the phone for hours and worrying that I wouldn t have anywhere to stay  Fortunately hotels     arranged for us to stay in a far better hotel   the   star Great Eastern at the same price I paid for the   star Best Western Paddington Court Hotel  This made our stay   what a fabulous hotel  So glad the Best Western Paddington cancelled our reservation in the end   would have appreciated them telling us though   
P =>  If Booked Through British Air Stay Away  Dirty room  rusty razorblade and discarded cigarette butts on the balcony  filthy windowsills  unresponsive staff  etc  Shouldn t a three star hotel at least be clean and safe Given the wonderful reviews that this hotel has received from other guests  is it possible that only the rooms unfit for occupancy are set aside for British Air British Air  please stop recommending this hotel to your customers  They deserve much better than this  
P =>   Disappointed I am a very frequent traveller  both on business and for pleasure  and know what you can and cannot expect from various classes of hotels  My verdict  you can be better off at other hotels Rooms were clean and nice so if you are lucky and go without a hitch  should be OK  It is when there is an issue that the hotel apparently has difficulty addressing it  My initial room was in the basement   yuck  but not unacceptable  except that I found  very late at night  that the plug for the bathtub was missing  which made it unable to take a bath  Unfortunately  it was in the hours that maintenance was not in  so I had to make do with a shower after alerting reception  although it wasn t really what I deserved after    hours in the plane  I made sure they can follow up on it by also leaving a note in the room as well as at the reception as I left the hotel the next day  However  when I came back in the afternoon  although the room was already made and maintenance must have been in from     am  the plug was still not there and no indication of replacement  I talked to reception  and after some conversation got another room which was much nicer and had a perfectly working bath  They helped me move  so I was almost about to forget about the not so nice night before The next day I was attending a wedding and therefore spent time in the room until  pm preparing  Housekeeping ladies came and asked when I wanted the room made  so I said  quot After  pm  please  quot  They were having some difficulty with English  but pointed at their wristwatch so I pointed at  pm and they appeared to have understood  Then another man came and asked the same question  so I told him the same thing  His English sounded natural  and I assumed the ladies sent him to confirm my instructions  However  upon returning to my room late at night  I found my room un made  with a note stuck under the door saying  quot did not clean because you instructed us not to disturb  quot  Again  it was late at night so I had to make do by getting someone deliver clean towels etc  I made it clear about my displeasure  but there was no follow up when I checked out the day after and I was past the point of caring anyway  just happy to leave Nothing critically wrong  but not the level of service I would expect from the rates  
P =>  Gets my Vote Stayed at this hotel in  for   nights  provided as a freebie from British Airways when we booked our tickets from Vancouver  The walk from the Paddington station may only be a few blocks  but with luggage it s a bit of a haul  The area the hotel is located in is beautiful  Gorgeous white cream buildings all around  good pubs restaurants within walking distance and a couple little corner stores within a block  The rooms are pretty small  which was fine by us as we weren t there other than to sleep  There is so much to see and do in London and it is so easy to get around on the tube  Only complaints are that the walls are thin   noisy neighbours can be a little bothersome if you re a light sleeper   and the free internet they provide is through the TV and it was hard to navigate and slow  compared to what we re used to in Canada   There isn t an elevator either  so be warned if you have trouble coping with stairs  Overall  a very decent hotel and enjoyable stay  On a separate note  I would definitely recommend taking the Paddington Express to the Paddington Station from Heathrow  Only takes    minutes   but it s nearly    pounds   worth the cost for the convenience  The walk to the hotel is less than    minutes  
P =>   Paddington court  clean nice quiet and good situation Coming to London for professional reasons  I am very disappointed about the general level of the hotels in London  I found with the  Paddington Court  amp  Suites hotel  the place where I return regularly   I benefit from a room at the  nd or  rd floor very luminous  vast and clean  with a large and beautiful bathroom  and internet broadband access included  The continental breakfast and  English breakfast  are varied and served by a smiling team  The situation of the hotel is ideal between the Paddington station and a large range of buses  taxis  and tube stations  and   minutes walk to Hyde Park  The building of the hotel very pretty and is well maintained  clean  with flowers changed everyday  and well provided in daily newspapers  The management team is directed by a very dynamic director  professional  and with the listening of the requests of the customers  Coming regularly to London for professional reasons  I booked to come also on holiday with my family in this hotel  for its quiet  its cleanliness  its situation  and its personalized reception  
P =>  higher rates and poorer service I ve stayed at this hotel for a number of years now  The level of service has deteriorated over this time and the place is now quite poor  I m a British reviewer  it takes a lot for us Brits to winge    The internet did not work  It was an extremely hot day and night and the air conditioning did not work  My room was on the  rd floor and as warm air rises the lack of air conditioning made for a very uncomfortable experience  The iron had exposed live wire which could have proved highly dangerous  I left a note for them to kindly remove and replace this but this was not done  The very basic fan that was provided could not be held in one position and it made an annoying clicking noise  The staff are no longer as friendly as they once were and do not seem happy to be there  The rates for the hotel have increased in the last year but the level of service has deteriorated  I have seen much better days  One good thing was it is quite clean and the location is very safe  pleasant  quiet and ideal for local amenities and transport links  I don t think the price is now worth it and will try elsewhere next time  
P =>  Great value hotel I always stay here when I m in London  This is a very pleasant medium sized hotel situated in a quiet neighbourhood next to Hyde Park but still only a few minutes walk from central London and the West End  The tube and Paddington Station are   minutes walk away  it is this station that provides a service to from Heathrow  I have stayed here many times and always found that the staff are courteous and helpful  The rooms are clean and comfortable and exactly what I d expect from a   star hotel  I have read some other reports where people say this hasn t been so and can only say they must have been incredibly unlucky or had quite extravagant expectations  The rooms are reasonably priced and I have very rarely had a problem and when I have it has either been fixed immediately or I ve been offered another room  The free broadband internet is a real bonus and has proved invaluable  In summary a great moderately priced hotel in a great location  
P =>  Good location basement rooms nasty We arrived here after first checking out of the Lincln House B and B  that was a nightmare to begin with  we reserved online quickly same day and arrived one hour later  I am a travel agent and told this to the front desk when we arrived  they were only able to accomodate us the first night in the lower floor room which smelled terrible and had a curtin covering the windows  I looked outside and saw that the window could stay open however there is a chance someone could reach the room  YIKES  the botton of the window was like a sliding door and covered in filth  Basically we spent the one night in this horrible room and the next day were moved to a better room on the first floor in the new wing  Internet never worked  but we were mostly sightseeing so we did not bother again to change rooms after that  I would not stay again at this hotel  and would opt to pay more and try a Thistle hotel or another upscale brand I would lastly say the location to the Paddington stations was perfect  easy in and out with the National Rail to Windsor and London Underground  
P =>  Give me a Break      We arrived at the Best Western to be told they were having  quot problems quot  with the air conditioner and would be putting us up in a sister hotel a few blocks down  The sister hotel turned out to be a building of new corporate apartments that had just been completed  You would think this a plus  but it sucked  It meant you were on your own  no concierge  no attendant at a front desk  in fact  no front desk   a hot towel heater that burned your leg every time you sat on the toilet  a bed the that was basically a futon for one on a wooden frame  Hated it     
P =>  false advertising The photos online do not represent the rooms or quality of what you actually get  Standard dorm room would be more appropriate  as the double bed took up half the square footage of the room  without exagerration  Harried front desk staff do their best to keep unhappy clients at bay  
P => Quite simply  A DUMP Reviews don t lie  this place is a class a  quot dump quot   Staff is simply  quot lost quot  and shouldn t be working in the hotel industry  Elevators not big enough for luggage   hallways are a never ending maze and a classic fire hazard  no emergency exits    rooms are beyond small and beyond dirty   I didn t even feel ok showering in there  I arrived on a business trip with a colleague and they fumbled the reservation causing us to only have ONE room and even better ONE bed  After arguing for an hour and stating the obvious  I was not going to share a bed when we booked months ago they found me a room at   am     they basically had the room all along but made me wait   hours to get it  The breakfast area has CONSTANT line ups     down the hall way   PLEASE   do yourself a favor  stay away  
P =>  Give it a chance for the right price I read all the reviews and I see the experience somewhere in between them all  We got the   free nights from BA and paid an ave  of     for the   nights including the freeby  That s about where I see it as a value budget hotel  Not the      Rack rate  Just as advertised  very small room with a small bath  Low water pressure  Much like a dorm room  It was clean and if you only plan to sleep  why pay big bucks  TV adequete with local channels  internet did not work  Continental breakfast was good  Location is fine with Paddington Station a few blocks away  Quite neiborhood with a mix of restaurants and shops  We made it all around London from here no problem  Staff was a bit trying when my non ba reservation not showing  I had to fix myself with phone call to Orbitz  We knew London would be expensive and did not want to pay for a Hilton  As I stated  set your sights lower and you will sleep well here  
P =>  Just about OK but wouldn t pay full price We stayed here for one night only      a night B amp B via the Nectar card hotel offer  The hotel is reasonably close to Paddington Tube in a decent area and from the outside appears promising  However  whilst checking in we found that the staff spoke poor English and were not friendly  We noticed several bare pipes and taped up wires hanging from the ceilings en route to our basement room  Our room was tiny and in need of refurbishment but it was clean  The internet TV  heating and shower were faulty  Breakfast was poor and again the staff were unhelpful Overall  for what we paid the hotel was OK for a one night stay but we would not recommend it for a longer stay or at full price  
P =>  Great location My daughter and I stayed in this hotel for   nights in uary  We found the staff to be very helpful and courteous and always available to answer questions  The room was small but comfortable  very clean  excellent bathroom facilities and the usual English continental breakfast was included  The price we paid was a great value for the location and accomodations in this part of London  We found the location to be great because bus service and tube stops were a short walk away  It is also a short walk from Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens  I would not hesitate to stay here again anytime in the future  
P => What a Dive  Unfortunately I read the review of this hotel after I booked it and I wouldn t have been able to get a refund  All I can say is what a dive  The rooms are very small  admittedly ours seems to have been one of the bigger ones when you read some of the comments on here   The sound insulation is APPALLING  You can hear the people in the room next door having a quiet conversation and unfortunately the people next us were shouting instead   The free internet on the TV is useless  it doesn t work properly and they switch it off on the morning that you re leaving   not good when you want to find some info out about the museums and stuff  The bathroom was clean and the hot water seemed constant  Also  the tea and coffee making facilities were OK   it makes a change for a hotel to leave you a pint of UHT milk instead of those little pots that always run out The only other complaint I have is that whilst there is a key entry lock on the main entrance door  the suites are actually across the road from the hotel    the lock appears to have been turned off or is broken so the main entrance is never locked overnight   I was expecting to see a tramp in the hallway in the morning I would never ever stay there again  
P =>  Thriller We spend   nights in this terrible hotel in ruary      The staff is unpolite and unhelpfull The hotel room is dirty  dark  smell and windy old windows  The breakfast is a tipical english breakfast  nothing special The only think wich is good  the area  This is a quiet district of London  appr    min  walk from the City Center and   minutes from the Hyde park   You can find     differents hotel here in Paddington  so try to find another one  not this hotel 
P =>   Be Afraid be very afraid I stayed at this Hotel on a business trip  booked last minute at a rate of      per night  This is without doubt the biggest dump I have had the misfortune to not sleep for quite so time  The rooms are small  dirty and smelly  The bar and resturant arent much better  Dont do it 
P =>  Nice Very Clean  Just returned from   free night with BA staying at the Paddington Court After reading all the reviews for this hotel it was exactly as decribed Friendly front staff  very very small rooms much to small for two people staying longer than   days we had carry on luggage only but still there is no room to put anything The rooms are very hot we eventually the second day managed to turn of the radiator Very nice breakfast included lots of choice nice staff and a nice dining room This hotel great for free and would be OK if you paid the discounted rate of approx    pounds Good location      buy a daily bus pass for      pounds and just jump the busses lots of them go through Paddington 
P =>  A total gem This hotel is situated in Bayswater which is an ideal location for business and pleasure as it takes less than    minutes to get to the heart of London  We booked a standard double room and the rooms don t do too badly for space and luxury considering that this is a London hotel  The service was excellent right from the word go  The staff were friendly and very professional  One evening we had guests over for dinner in the hotel restaurant  We were all very impressed with the quality of the food and the variety to choose from  This hotel is truly a gem and worth every penny  I will definitely be staying there on my next trip to London  
P =>  Lovely Hotel The hotel was charming along with the staff  I found all members of staff to be friendly and professional and helpful at all time  the rooms are quaint and comfortable and I will definately recommend this hotel to friends and family and friends 
P =>  Paddinggton Court Hotel  Hands on charming manager  looking after our every day needs and always attending to requests immediately  Polite and courteous staff  both in the reception and in the restaurant  Very clean and well decorated suites and rooms  Excellently located    min walk from underground  Great value for money  Highly recommended  
P =>   decent digs for a decent price As a regular traveller to London and having tried numerous hotels in the capital over the past few years I can honestly recommend this hotel to any one  It is clean and tidy  situated in a good location and the staff are always willing to please  If you are fortunate and get a special deal  it makes your stay even more cost effective  
P =>   Slightly Dissapointing for a   Star  I stayed in a single room on the ground floor of this hotel for   nights  I paid approx     per night  This didnt include breakfast so I cant comment on their restaurant I found both the room and its ensuite to be on the small and cramped side but for the price for this hotel in Central London   I cant complain  However what disappointed me and what I found to be inexcusable for a   star was the fact that the carpet in the room looked very old and dirty  i e rotten   and the wall that the side of the bed was against was gruby  It much needed a coat of white paint  instead i had a gruby off white wall with black marks and stains on it The general standard of the furnishing and lighting in the room was above average and it came with the standard colour tv with remote  coffee tea kettle and telephone  Also a trouser press  hair dryer  alarm clock and Internet point  which I didnt use  The small ensuite bathroom was furnished well but the shower hose and head was a toy  Room cleaned and new towels punctual during my stay The quiet ish area that the hotel is in has wide roads around it and I wouldnt bet on  quot dead silence quot  not untill after midnight  Also Im fairly certain I heard the rumblings of the underground trains directly below  personally thou this didnt bother me and I found the general noise levels at night to be acceptable  also my room was on the ground floor which I would beleive to be the least quiet Hotel staff seemed very ready to help and friendly  Also they were well presented and smart in appearance  The highly polished floors and corridors of the ground floors look great  its a shame that things like blankets on the floor  just outside my door  and dirty plates on a dining tray seemed to be left around the corridor all day  presumably awaiting the next shift The reason why I chose this hotel is beacuse Ive had reason to stay in the area before and having walked passed I noticed its very impressive looking entrance and reception area I now believe this to be a  quot honey trap quot  of sorts as the standard of the room I stayed in did not reflect the standard of the reception and entrance area I would possibly stay in this hotel again because of its cheap rates and convenient location  especially for Paddington Station which is about   minutes walk away  Id also like to point out at this stage that some older people may find the walk to Lancaster Gate tube a bit of a drag  especially if they are doing it twice plus daily I am giving this hotel   stars out of      stars is a little harsh  but I beleive i am being generous  
P =>  Review The hotel is well furnished  provides good value for money  especially if you can get a discounted rate  and the staff are very helpful  A full English or lighter Continental breakfast can be taken  Light snacks are available throughout the day and a bar menu is provided in the evening  Alternatively  if you want to vary your dining there are many relatively inexpensive bars and restaurants nearby  The hotel is well located for seeing London   it is only   minutes walk from both Paddington and Lancaster Gate stations  Additionally  you are able to leave luggage before check in after check out so that you don t need to carry it around with you  In summary  the hotel provides a good base from which to see the city  
P => Great Service  I found the staff at this hotel to be thoroughly professional and always very helpful  My room was clean and quiet  The hotel is well located  being a short walk to Paddington Railway Station  I booked the room through an internet site at a very reasonable rate and found it to be great value for money  
P =>  Do Not Stay Here If You Can Help It  I booked the hotel before I read the comments  The comments and reviews about this hotel are very true  and mostly they are bad  Take heed    there are many other choices in London that are not that much more expensive and you will be very sorry if you waste your money  however little of it  on this hotel  It would be like just throwing money out on the sidewalk to doss down with the bums in the street Ok  so maybe not that bad   but Best Western really ought to look at this hotel and considering pulling its franchise  Don t let this bad hotel put you off of Best Western entirely  I stayed at a perfectly nice Best Western in Paris Here was what happened to us    we arrived early in the day and waited in a long line to check in  Their staff is all Indian and we could hardly understand a word they said   and their systems seem to be mostly manual  I didn t expect the rooms to be ready  and they weren t but the hotel did offer to store the luggage in a secure room  So far so good   except for the garbled language problems Then when we came back after dinner for our room we collected our bags    we had to get them  by ourselves  out of the little room    and went up to our rooms  On first glance they weren t too bad  We had two twin rooms and they put us at least on the same floor  When I sat down on the bed I almost went down to the floor  The mattress was up against the wall  so the side of the bed to sit on was completely sprung  When I say that the springs were sticking up  it s an understatement  There was absolutely no padding on the mattress and it seemed as if I was just sleeping straight on the springs  It was late  I was tired   so I toughed it out for the night The bathroom    ha ha ha  The shower    ha ha ha The next day we asked if the bed could be changed  but they made us change rooms  This couldn t be done immediately  fair enough  but I had to come back to the room to change clothes after lunch and they didn t have my luggage moved so I had to do that myself  The new room   no better  The bed was extremely bad and uncomfortable  I didn t get any sleep at all The neighborhood  by the way  is very nice  Paddington is close by and there are other tube stops nearby  Hyde Park is just down the street and if you like to walk you can include Hyde Park in your stroll  There are some excellent pubs and restaurants and a couple of internet cafes nearby too  Breakfast  Don t bother with the hotel breakfast  If you can book room only it s worth it to find breakfast elsewhere  Theirs is rubbish Bottom line   don t stay at this hotel  If you must  ask to see the room first  and try the bed  before you commit to a room  If the first one they give you isn t any good then leave yourself some time to find another or get another hotel  There are hundreds in this neighborhood Beware of the cheap price  you get exactly what you pay for  
P =>   Nothing like the pictures Recently stayed at the hotel   booked a suite  It was a bedroom with a stainless steel kitchen unit  Television didn t work  couldn t open window  no bath only a shower cubicle with broken shutter door and cubicle built for a dwarf  When you book a suite you actually expect space I have stayed in bigger single hotel rooms  Very disappointed as it did not match the description shown on website  
P => It will do First off  thanks for all the previous reviews  Reading them helped me choose this hotel and give me a realistic view of what to expect  The hotel is  ok   I would be a little peeved if I had paid the full price though We stayed in the old wing and contrary to the magnificent frontage and reception the room was pretty dated  Enough room for   to sleep  if you don t mind crawling over one person to get to your side of the bed  Not enough room for   to get dressed whilst standing and trying to get things from the wardrobe Water was hot as described  along with lacking in pressure  Bed was comfortable and clean  With some engineering the window stopped rattling through the night The location turned out to be great for our visit and there are plenty of great places to eat very nearby  If you are using the new oyster card  dont keep your room key with it as I did for a day  it becomes de magnetised and needs to be sorted at reception conclusion    get it cheap and dont expect much but the somewhere to lay your head and get washed and you wont go far wrong  
P =>  Average I stayed here for a night in ember whilst visiting London for the day  Its well located and good value but only really worth staying if its at a discounted rate  I couldnt really argue with the    quid that it cost  You couldnt swing a cat in the room  the shower was rubbish and the bathroom dated  Having said that  the staff were helpful  despite not having knowledge of my booking   the communal areas were pleasant and above all its cheap  
P =>  Good value clean and lots nearby I stayed here mid         For most people taking overnight flights  the hotel will store your luggage for free until your room is ready  I had a double bed in the newer section  There is no lift service to the newer section and I was on the third floor  great for exercise  but if stairs are an issue  this could be a problem  the older section has a lift   The room wasn t as small as I feared from reading about London hotel room sizes  KEEP IN MIND if you see the pictures of this place on expedia or other web sites  the rooms shown are for the upscale studios  not the standard rooms  The room is fine though  comfortable and clean  and includes tea maker  full wardrobe with shelving  nightstand with   empty drawers  and iron and ironing board  The two windows near the bed opened up fully onto the nice residential street  which was a great way to start the morning with fresh air  The bathroom was awesome  very large  as big as the bedroom almost   very clean  with a high tub and shower  Only complaint was there was VERY LITTLE water pressure  but the water was very hot  so I got used to it  The towels were awesome  big and fluffy  felt good after the shower  The Front Desk staff  while very professional  were not very responsive  requests for extra pillows  etc  were forgotten  Walk to Paddington station in only    minutes  or walk to Lancaster Gate    minutes  This hotel is short walk to Kensington Park and Hyde Park  near Lancaster Gate Tube   Nice quiet enough street  There s   convenient stores right across the street  plenty of pubs and souvenir shops  and a GREAT DELI across the street next to the medical office and NISA store that has high speed internet for only   GBP for an hour s time  The food is outstanding  the staff friendly  the deli is small but you can sit outside at the tables or inside  The hotel offers free internet in all rooms VIA THE TV  it SUCKED  The graphics are not the same as via the web  there is no back feature  it was time consuming and frustrating  so don t rely on this as a benefit  I would just go across the street to the deli and use the internet there  or there are plenty of internet cafes all over London  The breakfast buffet is very good  but b c of my low rate  wasn t included  it was      GBP  unlimited English breakfast delicious  The cocktail bar is small but nice and the the common lounge next to reception is very spacious and comfortable  great for reading or watching TV  I got this for    GBP night w o breakfast  a great deal for this place  Would stay here again  but realize it s further west than many of the attractions  
P =>   Good Hotel Great Value for money I am currently staying at this hotel and have always booked with the paddington court hotelon my frequent visits to london in the last   years  The staff have changed but are more friendlier and the hotel is refurbished quite well  Free Broadband is great as well All in all no complains especailly if you are paying     for a double room and the hotel is really close to hyde park  amp  the paddington station for the Heathrow Express  They serve dinner but there are lots of Chinese  Italian  amp  Indian restaurant round the corner plus Whitleys Shopping centre is just round the corner as well for lastminute shopping Have been staying there will be staying there again  
P =>  Stolen Goods A colleague and myself had booked to stay at the Hyde Park Paddington hotel  Upon arrival at      pm  we were informed that there were no rooms available due to renovations and were being moved to the Best Western Paddington Suites around the corner  Our room was the only room on the floor and could only be accessed by going through two fire doors and up two flights of stairs After returning from a day of sightseeing  we found our room had been robbed  with gifts  watches and passports stolen  There was no sign of forced entry  which alludes to an inside job  Management were most unhelpful with resolving the issue Never a judge a book by its cover applies to these hotels  
P =>  Good Value After reading some very negative reviews about his place i was expecting the worst  But the staff were efficient and friendly and the location was great just   mins from Paddington  The room was small but clean  I think the bed was less than a double   and the continental breakfast that the price included was ample  Full English could be purchased at a suppliment of       but didn t look worth it  For     a night and just a short walk through Hyde Park to the Natural History museum  it was just what we were looking for  for a budget short stay to London  
P => Pictures on the website are very deceiving I saw pictures of it online before booking and the hotel looked modern and up to date  Plus  the website stated that the hotel had undergone remodelling which coincided with the more modern look  When we got there  the carpet was stained  one wall had been painted blue  and there were   strange looking stains on the bed cover  The room was extremely small  which is fine since most european hotels have small rooms but the bathroom was smaller than a cruise ship s bathroom AND it was dirty  grout stained yellow and black and a yellow stained shower curtain   For the amount of money one would pay for this room  it is so NOT worth it to stay here  Look elsewhere  We were so disappointed with our room and we will never stay here again  
P => Makes  Fawlty Towers  look like paradise I recently stayed in this hotel for   nights  I paid    pound for a single room and received a room the size of a dorm  I could only get my large suitcase through the door sideways  The following two mornings  there was no hot water  Finally  on my second last day  I complained  and was upgraded to a double size room  still small by international standards   The breakfast also was horrible    very poor selection and the eggs were stone cold if you arrived after    am  In fact the maitre d and a guest were having a very loud fight over the breakfast  which ended with a demand by the guest to  quot meet him outside to sort things out  quot   The Manager of the Hotel and the reception staff were friendly  but I do pity them  as this hotel is an overpriced disaster zone  It s a shame  as the location is terrifc  but you dont get much  if anything for your money  
P => Not a bad hotel We spent   weeks at the Best Western Paddington Court in late e and early y  We found the hotel to be very pleasant  We stayed in a suite room across the street from the main hotel  The room was small but very well maintained  clean with a great bathroom  The room had a refrigerator  micorwave  and A C  We found the staff to be very friendly and helpfull  The location is great  close to Paddington Train and Tube Stations and Lancaster Gate Tube station  The hotel is only a few blocks away from Hyde Park  There are alot of local pubs and resturants in the area  This was our  th trip to London and our  nd time at this hotel  This is not a bad hotel  
P => Do your homework and avoid places like this   Stayed at the BW Paddington for one night          Check in was fairly prompt   however when we got to our room  it was already occupied    You can just imagine the look on the gent s face as we strolled into  quot his quot  room I went back to the desk  and the reservation clerk actually told be  quot that s not possible quot     quot the system shows the room is empty quot    He at first would not believe me    I told him to call the room and see  We were then assigned a room SO small that we could barely move in it at all  with half of a window   This is NOT an exaggeration  I have NEVER seen a double room so small  The map on the back of the door that shows the floor room map   our room was actually pencilled in carved out of another room    Now I have read the reviews that say    quot it s a small room  but it is London quot    That is a bunch of B S     Only people who have never been to London before or never stayed in decent reasonably sized priced accommodations allow for such crap    Never again       Spend just a few pounds more and stay at the Millenium Gloucester   GBP avg  or the Saint Georges Hotel    GBP inc VAT  especially if you dont get to London often      
P =>  Disappointed Don t impress yourself with the pics on the website  The rooms are very very small with no place to move  The smallest I ever been  Top sheets of beds were dirty   never seen washing in my opinion  The staff at reception were helpful and nice but considering the price per night I don t think I visit this hotel again  
P =>  Tatty A dump Don t be fooled by the pics  They look great   when you get there you can t believe it It wasn t all that clean The bathrooms have chipped tiles and bits of mould  Havent been decorated since the eightiesThe handyman in the hotel wants sacking  Taps are loose   the overflow in the bathroom wasn t connected and caused a flood  Loose fitting everywhere  wonky shelves and towel rails hanging off The carpets are worn and badly fitted   the lift looks like a goods lift is tiny and very very old They cocked up my room key for my original room and when the moved me after the flood Internet didnt work in either room and wasn t fixed when I complained either time  they sent the handyman who said he knew nothing about it   Telly reception was bad Made me wait til  pm to check in  Staff thick and rude  Its not as near to the tube as they make out either  
P => OK for the price For    Pounds per night one could not complain about the location of this hotel  Clean and centrally located  Staff was ok  The single room re defines SMALL in London   extremely tight as I could hardly turn or move in the shower I wonder about accessibility for disabled guests in this hotel   way too many stairs and just bear in mind if you are placed in the  new wing  on the first floor  you will have close to    miles to walk and a multitude of stairs to climb and NO ELEVATOR   despite the clerk told me first set of stairs through the lounge  up another set of stairs   but she forgot the other long corridor and almost   flight of stairs with my bag   Area is nice and quaint  For this price  a good deal   anything more  look elsewhere  
P =>  could not complain Booked a triple room thru Londonnights com for this hotel and got it for     cheaper than going thru the hotel itself  When we checked in the room was  out of commission  and they gave us   single rooms instead  Better again for three blokes after a day and night on the town   Single room was small but clean and had all the amenities required  towels  soaps  iron  etc   It even had Internet access in the room  Great value for money compared to some of the joints I ve stayed in for a few quid less   I highly recommend this place and will be back again  
P => Stylish hotel with friendly staff I ve stayed in this hotel four or five times over the past few years and have always found it a very pleasant experience  Why  The rooms are modern and clean  the location is excellent for public transport and the buffet breakfast is ample  I have no complaints  The negative comments I ve seen elsewhere on this site surprise me since the hotel has given me no cause for complaint over a number of years and my partner and I are very particular over where we stay  I regard this hotel as a  safe bet  when booking accommodation in London and would unreservedly recommend it   in fact I have just booked it for short break having stayed several times before  I seriously doubt that you will find somewhere superior at this price  Don t let the complaints of a few disgruntled customers put you off  
P => Pleasant stay and good locale Having read other reviews on this forum re Best Western Paddington Court Hotel  BWPCH  and after having already booked a   night stay            I was a terribly worried about staying there but maybe that was good because in the end we were very satisfied with the place  All in all the place was perfect for a couple of heavyset middle aged North Americans on a first time trip and a budget We had a room on the  st floor overlooking Devonshire Terrace  General Comments  No bugs in evidence anywhere  Pleasant and quite helpful staff Safe neighborhood  Minimal  if any  noise from other rms or street  Rms numbers and locations clearly signposted  Great location for accessing public transport and airport transfers     pounds for one way Heathrow to Paddington trip on Heathrow Express train      minute trip exactly     minute walk to Paddington from BWPCH    minute walk to Lancaster Gate stn    minute walk to Hyde park  Small rms but what do you expect in London without paying a fortune  Beds were quite broken in and much too soft for our liking  Bathroom size was fine and shower curtain complaints were a bit exaggerated I think and I m     lbs  Lots of restaurants nearby   Braza s  Italian  was probably the best value   Nobody in the neighbourhood had heard of Brazza s because the name in the window is Fontana di Trevi and I only eventually discovered it was Brazza s because of the name appearing on the receipt  It is about   minutes down the road at    Craven Terrace  Bizarrio s on Praed St was ok as well  For economy  breakfast was best dealt with at Paddington stn  Simple breakfast for   at Garfunkels on Praed St was  gulp       pounds   Didn t use the BWPCH restaurant so no comment there  Several small grocery convenience stores within   minute walk of hotel open until       pm  Moore s pharmacy on the opposite corner from BWPCH was quite handy for medicinal needs as well  
P =>  Not good enough for american standard but their suite is cool The room is so small for   person and I book for double  No aircon  you can smell the diesel fume if you open the window  What we did is  we transfer to their suite which is across the street and just add    pounds per night with small kitchen  brighter color  with aircon and bath tub but still small  The receptionist and all other staff are all very polite and helpful  
P =>  Surprised after all the negative reviews Okay  I had read all the reviews here before my first trip to London this month  I was fully prepared to have a horrible experience based on what I saw here  but the reservations were made and could not be changed  Was going there for a friend s military retirement ceremony Took the  quot Black Cab quot  in from Heathrow because I wasn t sure how to manage the tube  Also  tired and wanted to get straight to the hotel  The cost of that was about    pounds  with tip When I arrived at noon  my room was ready and I was able to proceed there  I found the staff friendly  competent  and helpful  There was no bellman available so I had to take my rather heavy luggage myself up the stairs and through the maze to find my room  That was really the worst part of my stay  The winding corridors  very small  and multiple stairs to manage  And  I have a heart condition   That part was exhausting after a long day  You definitely want to get a room toward the front of the hotel and on a lower floor  Request to be as close to the lifts as possible  otherwise prepare yourself for a tedious hike I had read about so many nightmares here regarding the rooms  but mine  albeit small  was remodeled  clean  and a window that opened onto the cross street  Craven Road  I read the guest book rightaway and found that they had a small number of fans available for the rooms  I went right back down and got one  which was a great help in keeping the air circulating  and cool for sleeping  The bathroom was small  as was the shower stall  but adequate and clean  If you have been on a cruise  imagine the bathroom in an inside cabin  That will give you an idea  I am a large man  but managed to work out a  quot deal quot  with the shower curtain so it didn t stick to my body the whole time I was bathing The bed was okay  Not a great mattress  but I was only there to sleep I had the continental breakfast included and so partook of that each morning  with the option to expand into a full breakfast at a minimal charge  It too was adequate  and there was one server that I saw continually that greeted me each morning and as I left wished me a great day  I REALLY found all the staff courteous and very willing to help out  Most all of the staff except the front desk are there around the clock it seems Had dinner in the restaurant the first evening  but found the outside restaurants more appealing  BTW  there is a new restaurant down the block from the hotel called Brazas that is outstanding   If you stay there  don t miss it         especially the homemade pate   There is also a Chinese restaurant around the corner that is quite good I usually came back to the hotel lounge to have a brandy in the evening before retiring I never used the underground  but took taxis  the Black Cabs  everywhere to save time  I didn t have many days to explore after my friend s ceremony so time was of the essence  A bit pricey  but worth it  But then everything in London is double what we pay in the States  Although  when I asked the hotel to arrange for a taxi for the airport return  I got a brand new Mercedes with AC  a wonderful driver  and great conversation on the way back  This is a company the hotel contracts with and was only    pounds  A bargain for the convenience and comfort I took the  quot Original London Bus Tour quot  and that gave me a quick overall look at what I wanted to go back to to explore  Very helpful in getting myself oriented to the city  It was only    pounds and the ticket was good for    hours  You could get off and on at will  I even got a free river cruise as part of the deal Across the street from the hotel are their suites  I did not see them and only heard one upset family about the size of the accommodations  Other than that  I really didn t hear any complaining  And  there was a wide range of people staying there from business people to tourists All in all  I had a good experience and would stay there again  although I found it a bit removed from the rest of the  quot action quot  in the city  I think probably most people would go there to be close to the Paddington Station  which I never saw  I also felt very safe in this neighborhood I went with a lot of aprehension about staying here  but decided I would make it a  quot good stay  quot  I spoke to say  quot hello quot  when I encountered any staff and they responded warmly  I think for the most part the staff don t speak unless spoken to because they don t want to disturb you  be a London thing        I thought more courteous than removed So  that is my experience and I wanted to come back to add this review  be all the bad ones were brought to their attention because I saw remodeling going on everywhere  and found the staff delightful I guess it sometimes boils down to  quot it is what you decide to make it  quot  Yes  it wasn t what we are used to in the U S               but this isn t the U S Hope this helps  
P =>  You Get What You Pay For   hmmm Reception Desk Staff  LOVELY  HELPFUL  KIND  Room  Triple  Three twin beds  One was broken mix and match blankets  aged bedspreads  heat by radiator   no thermostat  If the maintenance staff turns the radiator on   beware   you ll roast and you have no way of adjusting the temp  other than to have the staff turn the rad  off Telephone  COULD NOT make calls  Could ONLY call Reception Desk NOISE  UNBELIEVABLY NOISEY  Doors slam  Walls as thin as tissue paper  You CAN hear your neighbors  The door to your room will rattle if another door closes  BATHROOM  shower rediculously small  UNbelievably inefficient  NO room to move AT ALL Sink  NOT a mixing faucet   ONE HOT   ONE COLDOUTDATED  The shower is about  ft by  ft if that  Hair dryer is nailed down INSIDE the top drawer of the dresser  Hmmm    It s a good price but be prepared for noise and more noise  NOT lovely in anyway but served the purpose for sleeping on a bed  Don t expect any luxuries at all  It s plain and loud and inefficient  The computer for  rent  does not work  Date of our travel   e   th e          Think twice before you choose to stay here   Beware  You get what you pay for It is located in a nice area  
P =>   Did the job These critical reviews are completely unfair  I spent   days staying here while working in London and the hotel was absolutely fine  It was warm  quiet  comfortable and above all   clean  Many hotels in London keep you awake with constant traffic and sirens all night long  It was peaceful here  The stations are nearby  There are lots of restaurants nearby  The area is pleasant and safe  The staff are friendly and helpful  The restaurant serves reasonable food and is cheap  If you want a big room and lots of grovelling personal attention then pay   times as much and go elsewhere  but if you want a reasonable and perfectly decent deal  this hotel is absolutely fine  I have been in really nasty flea pits that cost much more  This hotel is a pleasant place to go with nice friendly staff  Don t take any notice of the carping arrogant whining Americans   this hotel is civilised  
P =>  Do not stay here whatever you do       The Best Western Paddington needs to have any association with Best Western terminated at everyones convenience  The hotel has a wonderful location that suited my girlfriend and I quite well because we are avid runners  Hyde Park is just a short walk down the street and perfect for running  The Hotel is quite repulsive to the eye once a guest darkens the doorstep of this quagmire  The desk staff speaks little English and seems more inconvenienced by a guests presence than anything  The first room we received was a smoking room  not what was reserved  and the evidence of smoking was ripe in the air  carpet  comforter  curtains  and anything that could hold a scent  The comforter had burn holes all over it and was complete with a permanent depression from the last bed smoking beheamoth  Upon bringing this to the attention of the desk staff they suggested another room  Alas perhaps something good can come about this  No chance however  room   fared somewhat better though despite it s immensely tiny size  The entire stay we had to yield and signal our intentions as we moved around the room  It was much like living in a doll house I imagine  The light fixtures must have been hung with the cheapest hardware imaginable because their collosal weight stripped them right from the wall and consequently dangled precariously above the bed by the remaining screw  The bathroom was good except for the shower which was so small it was like taking a shower in a phone booth  The shower curtain would cling to your back like a vinyl skin the entire time one was in the shower  The heater was stuck on and the only relief was from a window that could only be opened   inches to let air in  The hotel decided to screw the windows shut at this height so there would be no escaping to more comfortable lodging in the area  The dilemma of a fire presents the most challenging moment for a guest because this hotel is quite literally a rat maze  The fifth day of our stay marked a moment in trip milestones because I had finally remembered how to find the exit to the street  It is this bad  if a fire were to happen guests would never find their way out  The Paddington is a converted rowhouse which presents navigation problems even without smoke  confusion  and panic  This hotel is OK for those wishing to spend as little time as possible in it  perhaps even sleeping there  The first night we spent sleeping in our running clothes so that no exposed skin would come in contact with the bed  blankets  comforter  or pillows  
P =>  Minimalist Hotels Incorporated This being my first trip to London  I had no initial basis of comparison on choosing a hotel to stay at  but because of Best Western s price and quality here in the states I assumed things were the same overseas  And that s what I get for assuming  I am      and     pounds  so it shouldn t be a problem for me to navigate from point A to point B in any situation  even a cramped one  but the traffic areas of the hotel were downright unsurmountable  Comments about the shower were primarily true from my experience save for the flooding issues  However  I did have an extremely intimate relationship with the shower curtain by the end of my stay as it insisted on clinging to my body every five seconds  Channel lineup on televisions is basic but understandably so  if I recall correctly  we had a total of    options including cable radio broadcasts Location is a definite benefit for this hotel  walking to the tube station took less than    minutes and there were more than enough ATMs and restaraunts as well as one breakfast stop that made one killer Peppermint tea  located along the main road connecting hotel to Paddington tube station   I chose to eat breakfast outside of the hotel after I realized that the concept of  quot continental breakfast quot  consisted of nothing more than microscopic pastries  dried cereal  milk  and juice  Any additional options must be ordered from the waiter waitress at cost  Portions are meager at best and for the price  the external breakfast eatery made several quality English breakfasts with faster  friendlier service and bigger portions Along the lines of service  guests at this hotel can safely assume they will not maintain a first name basis with anybody working  For personal reasons  I detest their night crew simply on the premise that I had mistakenly taken a wrong bus and wound up all the way out in Chiswick at  AM and upon calling the hotel in pursuit of a cab  none were to be found in sight   I was simply shrugged off and left to my own devices   dress shoes and a minimum of four miles  walk  When my guardians who were positively grief stricken over my absence at such a late hour confronted the front desk  they appeared unfazed  Maid service appears to disregard our preference of a different location for the wastecans as each time we returned to the room the wastebaskest were reset to their default location In short  there are far better places you can room at if only for a smaller amount more  but the quality is exponentially different  Upon return from Munich to London  we changed our stay to the Millenium Gloucester and were positively blown away by the difference  Our shower was no longer a cubicle  beds were comfortable  even the cot they had brought in for me considering the only non smoking room they had left was a double was easy to sleep in   TV listings were far more expansive and distance to the tube was more than cut in half  Also  they had a fitness center  EXTREMELY expansive continental breakfast and very friendly staff  I don t recall a time I had to open the front doors or walk into the hotel unassisted  For those who still yearn for American food  there s a Burger King less than five minutes away  All these reasons added up make it unmistakably obvious that the Best Western Paddington Court does not even possess the ability of gaining a two star review  Websites meant for planning trips should update their four star rating accordingly  
P => Get what you pay for     Having booked this hotel before I had read the review page  I nearly changed the booking  the hotel is ideally situated near Paddington  so easy access to Underground  however that is all it is convenient for The room was tiny  and us British are used to smallish rooms   the bed uncomfortable  no bath in en suite  the shower ran like a tap and flooded the bathroom  they did change it    the bathroom itself you had to side step into as door was so narrow Breakfast   had to pay extra for a hot breakfast  not worth the         was served  quot cups of tea quot   no pots of anything  very basic Not one member of staff ever said  quot good morning or good evening quot  apart from a laundry boy on the final morning Next time we re staying at the Hilton  Paddington  
P =>  Don t believe the  Best  in the title    Without a doubt  this is one to avoid  The only saving grace it offers is some proximity to Paddington Station and nice  cheap adjacent eats  but there were a lot of hotels in the area closer than this one   Stayed for a weekend in tember  I had  quot confirmed quot  a reservation while in the UK by phone  that had been botched up upon arrival  It took the staff    minutes to put me in a single room  Felt sorry for the people in front of me  their reservation through hotels was apparently NO GOOD and the staff did nothing to help them find other lodging    Rude staff throughout stay  most were non Brits  Would agree w previous comments that the rooms were very small  even for European standards  approx   x    in single room   If you re over    and     lbs  you won t fit in the shower and don t leave anything on the floors  due to flooding   Pipes leaked  beds were as hard as the floor and walls were thin  It s a shame because other BW affiliated properties in Europe have been moderately nice hotels especially in Austria Germany  Key drop off was a bit childish  was a little leary of this considering not all rooms have safes   Don t let the pictures fool you on other sites  I can t remember the one website but it listed this property as a   star hotel  Don t think so  
P =>  Modest accommodation I test stayed at these after reading the multiple and fairly poor reviews in tripadvisor com  Comparing these to my thoughts as I left  the rooms are small  minimally functional  the beds are springy and make a crunchy springy sound when you press them  other furniture is light weight  the colour scheme is mid green  mid wine  mid blue  There was no kitchen in the hotel rooms so I need to go back and check whether the suites across the road are better  I would have stayed there when I was young and naive but not now   why go on a holiday and stay in a place that s less comfortable than home  One reviewer on tripadvisor said   quot I d recommend staying as close to Paddington as possible  or better yet  staying in an area that is closer to more active streetlife  pubs  shopping   I d rather be able to step outside of a hotel  and be in the thick of things  quot  A Londoner giving advice to a tourist would say   quot What can you expect from accommodation near Paddington  This is how it works  many people stay at Paddington as it is a direct route to Heathrow  that leads to competition between accommodation providers  which leads to lower profit margins  which leads to smaller  units  and less expensive staff  So all the complaints about low staff levels  shortage of service  low quality furniture  etc are just inevitably typical of the basic choice to stay in a tourist trap  And I am not sure there is just one  thick of things  in London  there are several  thick of things  which are not within walking distance of each other  I think this reviewer wanted to stay in Soho or perhaps Kensington  which has more cappuccino bars than you really need  You can t really swallow London in one gulp  Stay near the Jubilee Line  which has a north west to south east axis  and you will get to most places of interest with one train ride  It is the best line in London  and takes in Baker Street and the north west for Regents Park  London Zoo etc  the West End via Green Park and Westminster stops  the South Bank via Waterloo and London Bridge  Canary Wharf via     Canary Wharf  Lancaster Gate is on the Central Line   this mainly goes to Oxford Circus  which is a stroll from the West End   and Paddington is on the Circle Line  which does what is says  quot  When I was the staff were surrounded by people and lots of others waiting around  You know there are smarter ways to stay in London  
P =>  Creaky Charmless Hotel Recently returned from a five night stay at this hotel  We chose this property online from Hotels com  as we needed a room for three people  We also made much use of tripadvisor com  and were a bit scared by all the comments being made here  but decided to go for it anyway The hotel itself is      not unpleasant  blocks down from Paddington Station  The area appears mostly safe and residential with several small groceries  delis  coffee shops and pubs along Craven Road  the main road from Paddington to Devonshire Terrace   I ll admit  more than once we gazed longingly at the Hilton Paddington  perched seductively smack dab above the rail and Tube stations  as we trudged back to the BW Paddington Court after each day s sightseeing  Near the end of the trip  alas  we discovered that Lancaster Gate tube station was a wee bit shorter to this hotel than Paddington  The triple room appeared just as in photos on various web sites  three very  quot springy quot  single beds arranged parallel with three nightstands in between  with a dresser at the foot of the beds  That meant a surprising amount of drawer space  but the smallish room felt somewhat crowded with all three people in at the same time  Either the floors were slanted or the beds were  as I listed to the right every time I laid down in bed  The tv was a small remote controlled     inch color with    cable satellite channels  plus   radio stations  Worked fine  if placed a bit high  hospital style at the corner of the room You could really tell this wasn t a new building by the creakiness of the floors  and the numerous steps going up down every which way  There is a lift in the building  but nearly useless as there are always half flights of steps leading everywhere  Trust me  you ll always have to take steps somewhere  Definitely NOT for wheelchair bound patrons I did notice that the room  beds  and carpeting were very clean  which helped tolerate other idiosyncracies  Such as  Well  the shower for one thing  A typical London shower I guess    it was basically a   foot square corner of the bathroom with     inch raised barrier at the bottom  The flimsy shower curtain hung loose  and you couldn t help but get caught up in it bathing  We joked that we were always so intimate with the shower curtain  that we needed a cigarette afterwards Naturally the bathroom floor would get drenched  no matter how hard we tried  Perhaps that s why it was always so clean  We also had difficulty with the controls of the shower  The left side controlled the flow of the water  but the right side controlled the temperature  and was hellishly difficult to turn  And it was stuck on HOT  Finally required getting a hand towel and lots of strength to turn it down  One night we came back  and there was a nice letter explaining that today was wash day  so they took everyone s shower curtain down  You know how this story ends    the next morning the bathroom floor was practically a lake We only called the office the first night for a wake up call the next morning  The phones are  quot hotel phones quot   i e  they have push buttons reading  quot Wake Up Call quot  and  quot Front Desk  quot  We couldn t get thru either  but no problem as we had an alarm clock in the room  But they really need to work on this aspect of service  What if somebody really has an emergency Overall the front desk staff would smile when you smiled first at them  but otherwise were cool  Perhaps it s a European thing  as most of them were from Western and Eastern European countries  although they all understood and spoke English well   The Polish guy at the door was the friendliest of the lot  Every time we exited the hotel  there was always someone cleaning the lobby  the waiting lounge or the sidewalks outside  Cleanliness was definitely not a problem here  Leaving the key at the front desk didn t bother us either  I d rather do that than keep up with it So what s the verdict  I can t really give this hotel     stars  like several sites do  It has a certain worn charm to it  but isn t quirky or personable enough to overcome its flaws  There are several other hotels that we passed from Paddington  other than the Hilton  which I recognized from this site  I d recommend staying as close to Paddington as possible  or better yet  staying in an area that is closer to more active streetlife  pubs  shopping   I d rather be able to step outside of a hotel  and be in the thick of things

P =>   Worth to stay in The room is cozy and comfortable with just the right amount of space for the   of us  It is within     minutes of walking distance to Paddington Tube Station  also about    minutes to Bayswater Station  plus it is easy to find halal food around the area  Subway Kebab and Chicken Cote   I still remember my partner went to Bayswater while we had  cat fight  and it was easy to find her around the area  after searching for her around   hour at Paddington and Bayswater   My point is  the place of the hotel is well located We only had one problem with the air conditioning  its leaking     The bathroom is small but we still managed to take shower together  It was really fun and thanks a lot to Paddington Court Room for the wonderful stay  I will definitely stay at this hotel again  Thanks to my partner for choosing this hotel  Love you forever  
P =>  Very sad  There is no Allandale Hotel anymore I loved my stay at the Allandale Hotel  nice  very clean room  charming atmosphere and friendly  caring hotel staff    the first part of it anyway  Because during my stay  there was a change of management  The Allandale was bought by Best Western  I learned about this when I came   loaded with christmas shopping   back to the hotel one afternoon and workers were removing the  quot Allandale quot  signs at the doors  My nice room  quot Italy quot  was suddenly number     and there was a note on my bed  that the Allandale now belongs to the Best Western chain  They also changed the very nice duvet to a simple woolen blanket  Best Western standard    After a horrible night  I was so cold under the thin blanket I even got the towels from the bathroom to wrap me up in  I went for breakfast in the Best Western Hotel opposite the street as I was supposed to do according to the note on my bed  It was a very different experience form the nice breakfasts at the Allandale Hotel I have had the days before  It was busy and chaotic  I waited ages for my tea  it really took me    minutes to get the attention of a staff member to order some tea   and then again    minutes to get some milk   The buffet was out of plates so people put there toasts in bowls  Also the qualtity of the food was very low  I mean  Yes  the breakfast selection at the Allandale was limited  but the eggs were fresh and cooked to your order and the jam tasted lovely  At the best western the eggs tasted dry and old  having been standing on the buffet for hours probpably  and the jam was very artifical  I very much liked the atmosphere at the Allandale breakfast  linen table cloth  lovely decoration etc     at the Best Western everything was just cheap and hectic  It is very sad  but under the new management of the Best Western Paddington Court the Allandale will become a part of a chain hotel with no indivdual charm at all  And I have only seen the first signs of it  At check out  now at the Paddington Court hotel opposite the street  they ask for my room number and when I said  quot Italy quot  they looked at me like I just landed on the moon  And then they wanted to charged me a night to much  No problem here   mistakes happen   we sorted that out after a few minutes  But the way I was treated was not very polite or friendly  I am very sad  that just when I found this charming  affordable hotel with personal and caring service it is took over by a hotel chain  which is at the moment errating all indvidual touches   
P => 	  
P =>   Tres petit et tres cherer  
P => 	  
P =>  Tr s mauvaise exp rience  
P => 
P =>   Excellent location The hotel is a good value for London  It is close to   underground metro stops and the Portobello ket was right around the corner  There are lots of restaurants and shops close by as well as laundry and postal facilities  The room we had was very reasonably sized and the bathroom was also bigger and more modern than expected  The hotel is clean  It is a hit and miss with the hotel reception employees  Some are great  others are not so nice and helpful  We did try the breakfast once or twice  Not very good  nothing what we expected  We are vegetarian and it really makes it hard to have a good breakfast when all you can eat is bread  Overall  I would probably stay at this hotel again  
P =>   Great Stay Recently stayed at The Best Weestern Phoenix Hotel because its sister hotel the John Howward was full  No worries since the Phoenix is also very well situated on the other side of Kensington Gardens Hyde Park  Queensway has the great shopping mecca  quot  The Whitelys quot  and a host of restaurants to chose from in the area  Queensway is always bustling and has a livelier atmosphere to the location of the John Howard  The rooms are smaller than the John Howard but they are extremely clean and well cared for  I found the rates extremely reasonable for London Great friendly staff who are always so eager to assist and give you directions around London Absolutely a wonderful gem in London  
P =>   good hotel for london I booked a single room  quite small  but ok for one person  good position    undergroung station nearby  lots of places to eat  most of them fast food   breakfast decent and good  the bathroom much more modern than the room  
P =>  Great value Second stay here  good experience both times  Clean  great location  good size room  Comfortable bed  Check in out can be busy  Breakfast is good  lots of choice  Close to both Bayswater and Queensway tube stations  Great shopping and restaurants nearby  Will always try to get a room at this hotel when visiting London  Great value  
P =>   Fantastic Location Great rooms and the friendliest staff I have every experienced I don t normally write reviews  but I ve just returned from a weekend in London with three cousins  all girls   We stayed in a family room at the Phoenix which had   single beds    in a really large room  with tea coffee free wifi and a really spacious bathroom    perfect for   girls getting ready to go out  The hotel staff were so nice and spent lots of time recommending things for us to do  There is also a really cute wood pannelled bar  although not that busy was great for a little drink before going out and when we returned  Breakfast was a real suprise as there was so much choice on the buffet  although it was the same both days but really set you up for the day  The area is great and only minutes walking from two tube stations but loads of resturants within walking distance if you did not want to travel  I would definately stay here again  
P =>   Great location Location   The location of Phoenix is great  While we got around the city by Tour Bus and Cabs  the Queensway  which is just around the block is a great late evening shopping location  Kensington Palace  Portbello Road  Hyde Park are all within walking distance Rooms   The hotel is an aggregation of double storied buildings  which have rooms laid along connected corridors  We got a room for   which was large by London standards  with a picture window on the road Service   The service was good  save that some staff had some problems with English   Breakfast was good  Be careful  though  as the eggs to order are not included and are billed as extra  
P =>   tiny but worth it I stayed here for   nights in early ober  I had a single room on the  rd floor facing the street The hotel is nice  quaint could be used very easily  Starting off from the moment I got there things went well  The front desk checked me in  gave me my room key  an actual key  not a card  and the info so I could use the hotel s free wifi  When I got to the room it was tiny  I m a big guy so it felt very tiny  I could easily touch two opposite walls standing in the middle of the room  The bed was a single but fairly comfortable  There is a small desk  tv and armoire in the room  The bathroom was just as tiny with a shower stall  Housekeeping did a good job keeping my room in order The ladies at the front desk were helpful  some more than others  At the worst they were disinterested  they helped you if you asked for something but no friendliness  Most of the ladies were not like this  After the  nd day I pretty much didn t have to tell them my room number  they would just hand me my key  Patricia in the office helped me out with my reservation and let me use the office computer to print off something Breakfast  boring but plenty of it  I stuck with the continental breakfast and it was the same every morning  The ladies that worked down there were always polite My only piece of advive is try to get a room that doesn t face the street  the hotel can t do anything about it but peopel are very loud as they go by and there is roadwork being done at the moment and I think they start about  am  I would stay there again  
P =>  Back again and still ok Had not been to the BW Phoenix   Bayswater  London for over a year  Found it  s still ok for me  Furniture may be dated to you taste  Carpet of my room       was showing wear tear as did wallpaper  Shower toilet room small  Room came with tv  hair dryer  coffe tea making facilities  Breakfast still ok  Staff still very helpful  amp  kind  If unfamiliar with the hotel  breakfast room can be full if you re not early  There s only   elevator so between say       and       when breakfast is served  guests are checking out  and rooms start to be cleaned  you may opt for the stairs  If you don t mind trafic noice go for a front room with view of the private garden park  I loved waking up in the morning hearing wind in the trees  amp  birds singing  Hotel is within walking distance of Hyde Park  Queensway  plenty restaurants   Whiteleys shopping centre  small   Queensway tube station of the Central Line and Bayswater tube station  Circle  amp  District   I d checked the hotel s rates on Tripadvisor in euros using the currency selection field on the left side of Tripadvisor screen to see if a stay was affordable  The price shown on the screen while selecting the hotel  amp  booking it through fastbookings com  definitely did not tally with the bill I had to pay at the end of my stay  What was supposed to be the amount in euros turned out the be the amount in UK pounds  So travellers beware  
P =>   Average hotel in a good location you won t be dissapointed  if you don t expect much from this hotel the rooms are small and noisy but clean and have free wlan  the breakfast is poor and the breakfast room is often cramped  the front desk staff could be friendlier  the location is good though  
P =>   Great location We stayed in a tiny  tiny room with great views  Apparently rooms in London are notoriously small so I wasn t that surprised when we found that you could only walk around two sides of the bed and the bathroom door couldn t open all the way as it hit the bed  The bed was comfortable enough  the breakfast was very good and the service friendly  so a great for the price  
P =>  An avaerage and old hotel Stayed for   nights in ember       very small room  very old and squeaky bed  Nothing special about this hotel but good location and very good and stylish bar  Next time would spend   pounds more and stay in more comfortable clean Ibis  
P =>   The service and hotel was good great location and decent price I chose this hotel mainly because the reviews were so consistent  This hotel is very conveniently located in Bayswater  near two subway lines and lots of shops and places to eat   Avoid the nearby Pizza Hut  it s dreadful   The staff was very helpful and the rooms were adequate  NOTE   if it is hot  you will suffer as the rooms are small and there is no air con  The service at breakfast was quick  the breakfast itself was good  Single rooms are VERY small  but overall the price is right  the place is clean and it is  most importantly  as described in most of the other reviews  No surprises  which is very important to me when I pay in advance for a room  I too had a multi level single room  but given how small the room was  it was actually nice to have the bed on a second level  The rooms on the bottom floors are probably even warmer  so request an upper floor would be my suggestion  This hotel is about a   pound taxi ride from Paddington  which is where the Heathrow Express brings you in from the main international airport  so that makes this even cheaper for those of us with too much luggage to take the tube  
P =>   GREAT VALUE HOTEL FOR LONDON STANDARTS I ve stayed at phoenix hotel in november      The location is great   metro stations   min walk Bayswater green and yellow line and Queensway red line  The hotel was very clean with descent breakfast and the staff was very helpfull Rooms were well heated very clean but a little bit small as the most hotel rooms in London The area near the hotel Bayswater  is very safe  quiet with a lot of restaurants and shops I definetly suggest it for great budget SAFE stay in london 
P =>   Stay away from this hotel staying in the below hotel last month for a business trip  Despite their describtion   it is a dreadful hotel  The staff were extremely rude to me  I checked in late  it may have been night staff  and the room was without doubt the worst I have ever stayed in I spend a lot of time in London  and have stayed at various locations  this is without doubt  the worst hotel room I have ever seen  and absolutely not as described in any of their advertisments It was not fit for purpose  the bed linen was old and dirty  my single room was so small there was barely room for my luggage  The decor and furnishings were old and shabby beyond belief Do yourself a favour and stay away from it  
P =>  Great Value My mother and I stayed at this hotel  We had separate single rooms  We checked in on   th and checked out on    th  We paid about    Pounds per night for each room  We booked the room on the Best Western site in the beginning of ch  Overall I was very pleased with this hotel  The room is small but it was bigger than my room in Paris last year  The bed was surprisingly comfortable  The room was clean  The bathroom is pretty small  We were in rooms     and      The staff is fine  They are neither rude nor very nice  There is a computer next to the lobby that you can use for     Pounds for    minutes  There is a complimentary Continental Breakfast  It consists of croissants  toast  fruit  apples and oranges   cereal and yogurt  The breakfast was okay  The hotel is close to Kensington Gardens  Here are a couple of little things that bothered me about the hotel     The walls are pretty thin so you can hear quite a bit from the rooms next to you  I wore ear plugs when I went to sleep so it was fine     There was a stain on the comforter  the main thing is that the sheets were clean  Here are exact instructions on getting from Heathrow Airport to the hotel  it is only   Pounds   it takes about an hour     After you leave the Arrivals area at Heathrow  walk to the right and go down to the Underground  The walkway down is located by the bathrooms  The subway in London is called Underground  It is also known as the The Tube    We purchased a ticket from the person at the counter for   Pounds to get to the Bayswater station   You will be getting on the Picadilly Line at Heathrow  You will get off at the Earl s Court station    At the Earl s Court station  you will take the District Line to the Bayswater station  You will want a District Line train that is going to Edgware Road    When you leave the Bayswater station  you will be on Queensway Road  Take a left    You will walk about a block or so to Porchester Gardens Road  Take a left  At this intersection  there is a Whiteley s on the other side of the street    Walk about a block and the Phoenix Hotel will be on the left side of the street  
P =>  Great choice We have stayed at Best Western Phoenix from the   th of ember until the  nd of uary  The breakfast was decent and the staff really helpfull  The unique advatage of this hotel is its location  Two metro stations in a   minute walk  Also  the area is quiet  something that we really liked  Many stores are around the hotel and that was very good for the days that we didn t want to go downtown  The room was heated very well and the bathroom was good enough  
P =>   Comfortable and convenient I stayed at the Phoenix hotel for   nights  and would have to be nit picking to find things to complain about  I had a double room  which was certainly spacious enough  and the bed was extremely comfortable  The bathroom had a great shower and the bath towels are large  Wash cloths are not in the bathroom  but are available at the front desk The hotel was very clean  and the free wi fi was great  The free continental breakfast was nothing spectacular  but certainly served its purpose  Location was terrific  very near the Bayswater and Queensway underground stations  so its easy to get anywhere from those stations  I had read a few reviews that mentioned the staff was not friendly  but of the   or   people that manned the front desk  most were very nice I stayed on the  rd floor facing the street  so it could get a bit noisy outside at times  but luckily I was too tired from walking all over the city to mind There are certainly cheaper places to stay  but I m sure you would sacrifice some things to stay at one of the less expensive hotels Overall  I would heartily recommend the Best Western Phoenix Hotel  
P =>   Excellent value for money We stayed four nights last week end  The hotel is perfectly located  the area is full of ethnic restaurants  and several shops  Bayswater and Queensway tube stations are quite close to the hotel  and Hyde Park   Kensington gdns  are an easy stroll  The room  on the  nd floor  was basic but larger than you may expect at a tourist hotel in London  very clean and quiet  our room had the window on the square but we never had any noise   maybe no one was in the rooms next to our  but we hardly could hear any voice or noise from other guests  and the hotel looked pretty full The bathroom was big enough  and completely refurbished  very good shower flow  only inconvenience there was no bidet  but that s the rule in the U K  The TV channel choice was limited  but this did not represent a problem  wi fi web connection is not always at full speed  but is free and  in any case  good enough for a web browsing e mail use The continental breakfast was OK  not too much variety but always plenty of food  The personnel of the hotel was kind and attentive  and any request we had was answered quickly  We had no problem with their english and  in any case  they did not have to keep a conference on us   In a nutshell  a good hotel and a very good value for our money  much better than others hotels in the area  if this will be the standard even for the future  for sure we ll come back  
P =>   Some flaws but a descent experience I stayed here for six nights  The room was tiny  about   x    but I guess that s pretty common for a single in London  The room was clean and despite leaving the  quot do not disturb quot  sign up  there were clean towels waiting outside my door everyday when I returned  The free wireless Internet was perfectly serviceable  even with the low signal strength I was getting The free continental breakfast was very good with a nice assortment of breads  rolls  cereals  croissants  fruit  yogurt and juices  and the waitstaff was very polite  Its a very short walk from both the Bayswater and Queensway tube stations  so that was convenient  and the nearby street had a wide variety of useful shops and economical ethnic cuisine and fast food Now the flaws  Despite the cool ch nights  the room was quite warm and I had to sleep with my window open to be comfortable  The problem with that is the hotel is adjacent to a very busy street  so loud passersby from the nearby pubs  bars and restaurants were quite annoying at all hours of the night  forcing me to sleep with earplugs  Also  they were renovating the room next to mine  and the work started at   A M   As that is when I was getting up anyways  it didn t present an issue  but someone that wanted to sleep in would have been disturbed For what I paid   less than     night  I would say it was a pretty good deal  but would be concerned about re booking a room in warmer weather  
P =>   Excellent value for money Came as part of a group  Can t fault the service or hotel  The staff were really friendly and helpful  the location was superb  a good area and lots of good restaurants within a minute s walk  The bathroom was good size  and the room was immaculately clean  Breakfast self service continental but fine  For value for money can t fault  Another plus point is the bar  large glass red wine only         Look forward to returning soon  
P =>   Great hotel great location This hotel was great    I have stayed at many hotels and this one was the cleanest by far  The location was extremely convenient  i went with my sister and brother in law who live in Endland as well as a friend  We were within easy walking distance to two different tube stops as well as bus stops  Queensway was up the block with great souvenier stores  Tescos  Boots and many different places to eat  The complimentary breakfast had more than enough variety to keep us satisfied and full  The staff was very helpful as well  I had left my adapter at my sisters house and couldn t charge either my phone or camera  but the front desk loaned me one for the duration of my stay  I am planning on going back in ruary and have no hesitation about staying here again  
P =>  Great hotel  My boyfriend and I stayed at the Best Western Phoenix hotel when we were in London for New Years Eve      and were really pleased with our stay  I go to London quite often so I have stayed in several hotels over the years  but for it s pricerange this is the best  The staff were extremely helpful and serviceminded  the room was clean and ok size and the location is great  Plus the price of the room was more than exeptable  I would absolutely recomend this hotel to others travelling to London  
P =>   Cheap but better around Paddington for a little more cash Its clean  small  cheapish  good breakfast  quiet street  old and creaky  has internet PC at small charge  short stays on budget only  Night shift staff a little grumpy but who wouldnt be at night  Can really complain too much so gave it above average for the price  
P =>   Great Location and Fair Price Just got back from a   day    night stay at the Phoenix  In a word  the hotel and the rooms  we stayed in a room for   that included a queen bed and a single on the other side of the room  are basic  The rooms are relatively small and the hotel amenities are few  However  the rates are reasonable by London standards  the place is clean  and the included continental breakfast is decent  A recent addition is free wireless internet access throughout the hotel  you have to obtain a code and password from the front desk   Our bathroom also appeared to have been recently done over  A couple of negatives were the one very small elevator that seemed to have a mind of its own  the inside temperature of our room  it was always very warm and you can only open the windows about     inches   and the difficult time you have getting ice  you go to the bar and get a small cup filled  The biggest positive of this place is its location  It is very close to two tube stops  Bayswater and Queensway   which makes it very easy to get to many attractions such as the houses of parliment  big ben  the london eye  Thames River cruises  the Tate Modern  Buckingham Palace  the Tower of London  London Bridge  St  Paul s Cathedral  and more  you can get to most of these through the Bayswater stop on the  quot Circle Line quot  tube line   The hotel is also within walking distance to the Notting Hill area and Kensington Park and Palace  The Bayswater area also has many nice and reasonably priced ethnic restaurants and there is a shopping center just down the street where you can buy food  wine  beer  that s why we were looking for ice   snacks  and more  In all  I would stay there again and I recommend this place to anyone who values price and convenience over elegance and prestige  
P =>   good location fair price I stayed there   nights in september in a single room  as I wanted to visit London   perfect location  you have shops and restaurants just around the corner  and the tube is only     m away  As I will have to get used to  rooms in London are just as small as a closet  but the bathroom is clean and new  what is important for me  Be early and go and have breakfeast before      AM or you will have to queue  I would return to this hotel if I get a good price  I paid        night  
P =>   Great location good value As many others have described  the hotel is very close to   tube stations  Bayswater stop is closest which gives you access to the Circle and District lines  Queensway tube is a bit farther and that gets you access to the Central line  There are restaurants  pubs  and shopping right down the street from the hotel  Hyde Park and the Notting Hill area are just a short walk  Room  Small but clean  Comparable to other European hotels I ve stayed in  No air conditioning  but the hotel did provide a fan  No mini bar fridge  A continental breakfast was included  toast  juice  cereal  etc    nothing fancy   
P =>   Good Location The Hotel is situated in Bayswater   min walk is located underground station  The room was big enough  if you compare it with rooms from other hotels The negative was that it was no fridge in the room Very clean with good heating The service of the personnel was very good and especially from the reception  A girl from Spain  Very close is Pharmacy  Restaurants and mini markets and shopping center It was great and definitely I would choose this Hotel again     
P =>  Superb location great affordable hotel This hotel represents exactly what the other reviewers say  which is an affordable  clean hotel in a perfect location Pros  Location    minutes from Bayswater station    minutes from Queensway station   walking   Restaurants are numerous   maybe         between the Queensway station and the hotel  Internet computer in lobby  usually busy though   Internet cafe across the street at Whiteley s  a small mall   Free breakfast which met our needs  coffee tea  bread croissants  jams  ham  yogurt  cereals milk  canned fruit   Staff was friendly  although we never asked for much  Safe area  The area felt good and we stuck to the major streets  No problems  The hotel also has a safe downstairs at checkin that you can use for your time  for free  and you keep the key to your box   Pubs are down the street   maybe a     minute walk at most Cons  No AC  Even when it s cool outside  those who need quiet to sleep will have to shut the windows and tough it out  It s warm  but they do have portable fans As you can see  the pros outweigh the cons  and although it was warm in our room  the location and affordability more than made up for it  Book this hotel with ease and enjoy your stay  
P =>  Great value family room Great location close to Bayswater tube  Booked on the morning of my stay with LateRooms and got a room for   people for well under       Ideal for our family   breakfast was better than expected as well  Great places to eat in Queensway  so altogether a great location  
P =>   Nice  The staff is really nice  The room was clean and most of all small but that s typical for London  The location was great  really near to hyde park and one of the biggest underground tube place  Breakfast wasn t that great but yeah   it s London   
P =>   Good small hotel Got a free night here with my british airways ticket  Nice small hotel in historic neighborhood in central London around the corner from the Bayswater underground station  Near many restaurants and Whitley s shopping center and short walk to Hyde ParkVery clean though small single room with a tiny bathroom  Friendly staff  nice lobby with sofas  a bar  and internet access for a fee  wi fi for free if the signal is good  They also have travel adapters for electrical outlets for you to borrow  Nice continental breakfast usually included  full hot breakfast for a fee  No air conditioning but thankfully the windows open and there was a small fan in the closet  This hotel actually has an elevator so would be good for people with disabilities  
P =>   Good economy accomodation for short stay in Central London When booking this Hotel  we were looking for no frills budget accomodation that supplied a good breakfast and central  yet quiet location And that is essentially what we got  There were some initial problems with being allocated the wrong room and then we had to move as soon as cases were unpacked but otherwise this was an efficient stay Unless you book a suite  it will be a very small box room however  not ideal for an extended stay It appears that the bathrooms have been recently refurbished Ideal location for all the usual attractions i e  Hyde Park  Kensington  Knightsbridge  Kings Road  Oxford Street etc    Tube stations very close by  Bayswater and Queensway  If you are coming to London to stay for an odd night for the theatre  as we did  etc  then this is an acceptable option If your booking includes a complimentary breakfast  then please note it is a buffet continential offering  You will have to pay an extra premium for a  full english   
P =>   Good location really nice staff My daughter and I went to London on pleasure for   days   nights  through a special with British Air that included this hotel  I could tell from looking up the hotel online and from the reviews on trip advisor  that we would probably be okay  but I was pleasantly surprised at how nice the hotel was  Plus  it was extremely close to both the Bayswater and Queensway Underground stations which provides you access to three different lines  Central Line  Circle Line and District Line   There was just about any kind of food you could want in the area and we even went Ice Skating at the Queen s Ice and Bowl one evening  which was wonderful in the y Heat  right on Queensway  included for free on the London Pass  The desk staff was extremely friendly and helpful  The breakfasts were ample  yogurt  croissants  cereal  toast  farmer s cheese  ham  juice and coffee  and you could order a full English Breakfast or an omelet for a nominal price if you wanted more  There is a small pub on premises that is open late and internet access in one of the   small lobby rooms  for a fee   There is also an internet cafe around the corner on Queensway that is very inexpensive  So  all in all  I give this hotel a big thumbs up   
P =>   Good choice Having returned from the Best Western Phoenix Hotel in Bayswater I recommend this hotel to budget travellers who want a clean accomodation in a tourist friendly area of Central London The building is a terrace house and the interior design is plushy  so don t expect a modern puristic styled place Room  small but still reasonably sized  was able to move without hitting the furniture  no need to walk sideways  The room was furnished with a bed  clean sheets  good mattress   a desk with a chair and small tv on top  a small wardrobe and a tiny bench for luggage  There was also a hot water kettle for preparing tea coffee  The bathroom though was very tiny  ca       m x      m   and was equipped with a shower cubicle  toilet and a mini sink  It was ok for me as I m just     ft        m   but tall or big folks  think twice  The overall cleanness of the rooms was good Breakfast  buffet  rolls  croissants  sausage  cheese  m sli  joghurt  marmelade  jam  coffee tea  Quality I d say  was average Staff  friendly  had no problems with any of them Location  In Bayswater  you can walk to Paddington Station for airport connection  Heathrow Express  ca     minutes walk   there are   Underground Stations near the hotel and it is a   minutes walks to Bayswater Road where buses go directly to Oxford Street  Piccadilly Circus and Victoria Station  The area is very tourist friendly with many restaurants  money exchange  ticket shops  small supermarkets etc  nearby To sum it up I d say the Best Western Phoenix Hotel Bayswater is one of the better hotels of this price category though it doesn t compare to the Best Western Hotels I stayed in in the States  might be interesting to know for people from the US   I found the standard of this one a little lower than the usual Best Western chain hotel  but then  you re in London  
P =>  Good location convenient for tourists but loud This hotel is in a great location  just a short walk from   tube stations and near fast food  touristy shops  a nice mall and cinema  and some good ethnic and authentic restaurants  The streets are loud  which is a pain because the rooms get quite hot  even in ruary with the heat off  so you ll need the windows open  there is no fan  The rooms are small by American standards and the pillows are lumpy  but the maids are accommodating  though I recommend you not have them clean your room as their version of cleaning is spraying some aerosol perfume all over the room  If you re just using this as a place to sleep and rest  it s fine  There s a quaint little bar  a very slow computer you have to pay to use  and a decent continental breakfast buffet included in the price  The location is the best asset  it s in a safe area close to   tube stops  about a   minute walk  It s also near Kensington Gardens  I m not sure how this place would be in the summer  because I don t think it has air conditioning and it was unbelievably hot in the winter  The staff are friendly  you can leave your key at the front with them when you go out each day  They ll let you leave your bags with them if you arrive before check in  Overall a decent but not luxurious place in a very good location  with some loud street noise that is especially easy to hear with the open windows  no screens either   
P =>   Worked for us  Just returned from a week in London  There were   of us in our party so we booked a  quad  room at this hotel  Like others  we were a little anxious about what we would find due to the wide range of reviews on this hotel  Our room was on the  th floor and we found a nice size room with   twin beds in it  It looked exactly like the picture provided on the website  The beds were comfortable and the linens were clean  Bathroom  also nice size  was spotless and was kept that way throughout the stay  A large fan was already provided and waiting in the room for us  Staff was friendly and helpful for questions  although there is a little bit of a language barrier for some   Complimentary breakfast was good  A great location on a fairly quiet street for shopping and ideal for riding the  tube   Downfalls  no A C during the day is a bit of a problem as the room does get heated up but at night  with a fan  the room was very comfortable  Leave windows open  There are no vending machines and no ice machine on the property and only one outlet in the room is an inconvenience for   women  including   teenagers  trying to get ready in the morning  TV only had   channels but it s okay  we were gone most of each day and don t go on vacation to watch TV  Bring an alarm clock  the  wake up  call worked about     of the time during the week  We will definitely consider staying here again should we come to London  
P =>   A very pleasant surprise  You want a detailed review  You got it  Sorry in advance   I am a frequent visitor to the UK  but generally stay with friends or relatives  This particular time I was by myself and decided to take advantage of London by picking a place in the city core  After reading multiple reviews about the average   star in London  I was prepared for the worst   I know that hotels in Europe aren t generally at the same standard as our Canadian hotels  particularly when booking a single room  First  Gatwick Airport to LondonNot as awful as I anticipated  If flying into Gatwick  pre book tickets on the  quot Gatwick Express train  quot  which are available online  You can print the tickets and  if you are travelling overseas  save the trouble of waiting in a long line after an exhausting trans atlantic flight  A round trip pass costs approximately         CAD  when booking through expedia  though it s roughly the same when converted from pounds if purchased online through the gatwick express site   and well worth the money   it saves you a world of transportation headache  The train takes approximately    minutes and runs every     It was quick and easy   far easier than the bus  The GE comes into Victoria station  Here  I would HIGHLY recommend purchasing a travel pass for the tubes   if you re a tourist  stick with zones       any guidebook should really tell you that anyway  You can purchase the pass for approx        pounds per week   otherwise it s   pounds from Victoria to Bayswater  where you get off for the Phoenix Hotel   and then if you decide to travel the tubes later you ll have to pay the full amount for the week pass  Just a tip  I accidentally paid the extra  obviously  Live and learn   The Hotel  It s approximately a   minute walk from Bayswater  which is about all I could handle after trudging through Gatwick and Victoria with my massive suitcase  don t worry  no big hills to attack   but there are no elevators in the tube stations and LOTS of stairs  so if you are tubing it  make sure you have a lightweight suitcase   Mapquest the directions as they are easier to follow than my instructions  The location is very ideal for anyone interested in tourism  The Bayswater tube is extremely close to all the tourist attractions in central london  and makes it very convenient when coming back to the hotel during a late night  Check in was completely easy  Very pleasant lady at the desk  The decor was modern  clean and fresh  Adjacent to the reception area is a bar that doesn t seem to keep any particular set hours  but it s a pleasant enough area to sit and have a glass of wine when it is open  The only problem with this area is that the only internet station is set up directly across from the bar and in plain view of all the  quot Lager Louts quot  that had no problem harrassing me when I was trying to check my emails  As a lone girl in a foreign city  I was fairly uncomfortable to say the least  It happened on more than one occasion so my suggestion to the hotel would be to move it to a less conspicuous area  And maybe add another computer   it was really hard to get in any time as someone was always there before I could sneak in  The room itself          GREAT  Honest  Yes  there was a single bed   a twin size  Super small by North American hotel standards  But hey  I was alone and it was actually VERY comfortable  The bed was actually on an elevated platform with a staircase leading up to it  so I felt as though I had my own private loft  There is a small bathroom with a shower only  no bathtub   again  no biggie  Always clean as a whistle though and nice  modern decor  There is a desk area below the platform with the television  which was quite small and had the usual London total of four stations  Getting satelite would be a very nice customer service addition  in my opinion  However  most people aren t there to watch tv  Right  Room got HOT  I was there during a freak heat wave in the beginning of may         degrees every day for a week  so to be fair  I don t think the hotel anticipated it lasting and if they had central AC  it didn t appear to be utilized  I asked for a fan  which was brought promptly and advertised as available in  quot limited quantities quot   note to people who may be there in the summer   check in and get a fan asap  and kept it on me while sleeping and it was completely fine  There is a small safe available for free at the reception desk   use it for your passports  Safety  I generally felt safe in the hotel and relatively safe around it  I had a few late nights and the side road leading to the hotel later on in the evening is a little sketchy  but there always appears to be a gaggle of touristy looking people meandering around at all hours of the day and night so it felt safe enough  Be on your guard generally in London  though  Breakfast  Very nice indeed  I never ate in the main room myself but usually went downstairs to grab some fruit and a bit of cereal to take up to my room with me  I asked for coffee and they brought it out to me in a full decanter on a tray   terrific service and the coffee wasn t bad   this became my morning routine  That s really all I can tell you about the hotel  It was a really nice surprise considering all the horror stories I had heard of here and from others  I wouldn t hesitate to recommend it to singles  Now note   I DID look into a room with a double bed  It was VERY cramped looking and I probably would not have been as satisfied  If I go back with my boyfriend I am honestly not sure I would book there as it looked really small for two people  However  I only got a peek or two  so if travelling in a pair  then get your info from someone else who booked a double at the Phoenix  I tried to make this review as general as possible but I am personally recommending this hotel to individuals who are travelling alone and need a single room  NOTE  This hotel was not wheel chair accessible  Long winded  I know  but I have tried to be as thorough as possible  Book  go  have a blast  This hotel won t disappoint    
P =>   Phoenix Hotel   great base for London holiday Great hotel in Bayswater which is a bustling area with plenty variety of places to eat    minute walk to Hyde park and about    minutes from Notting Hill    minutes from   tube stations so handy for tourism  Hotel itself was clean and roomy enough  Good breakfast and friendly helpful staff  Nice bar area  Only drawback was the heating couldn t be adjusted and we found it too hot and leaving window open could become noisy at times  Otherwise would recomment this hotel and would certainly stay again if in London  
P =>  Great hotel in Bayswater I ve stayed in the Bayswater area before and I think it s a great section of London to base yourself in  It s close to a couple of tube lines  has all the amenities close by  it s safe  the price is right  and it s close enough to central London to see all the sights This is a great hotel for this neighbourhood and I would gladly stay here again and recommend it to friends The shower and toilet facilities  often the most questionable things I come across on my European travels  were impecable  Clean  newly renovated  and in perfect working condition Every London TA hotel reviewer is obligated to mention  or perhaps even complain  about the small state of the rooms  Yep  They re small  Get used to it  However  The Phoenix is clean  comfortable  and quiet enough Continental breakfast was quite good    especially for the UK  Lots of cereal  fruit  cheese  yoghurt  and so on to choose from  Optional cooked breakfast cost extra but I didn t try it  I didn t need it  Wait staff is extremely capable and quietly work away to get things done efficiently Front desk staff were helpful in pointing out night bus routes to me and directing me to a local pub for afternoon football on TV  Didn t use the small hotel bar as there are plenty of larger full service pubs close by There is a good sized mall nearby with all the amenities Safe  secure  comfortable  and quiet hotel that I would recommend to friends  
P =>  London for us   i stayed in this hotel in october in       the room are very nice and the bathroom very clean but also very small  almost impossible to make the shower   very close to the underground maybe     meters and also very close to the kensintong garden and notting hill  the breakfast are not very good  we are italian    but its ok because also in london is nearly impossible ti find a good cappuccino  the staff are very friendly  so i want reccomend this hotel but bayswater its not the our favorite place in london  
P =>   Keeps up Best Western values Good location with a Tube station about   minutes away  This hotel is right off of Bayswater Road which has a lot of small local stores and a few neighborhood restaurants  On a Saturday night  some of the noise of the drinking crowd drift down to the hotel Clean  room a good size for a city hotel although the bathroom was a bit cramped  Hotel is totally non smoking  which is nice  And the lines were not smoky  which isn t always the case Breakfast was good  Cold  but with a good number of choices  Of course  it never varies A small bar next to the lobby Pay internet access  which was terribly slow  I believe they had wireless  however  
P =>  A very comfortable hotel I recently went on a girls weekend to London with   of my girlfriends  We were looking to stay in the Hyde Park Bayswater area  We found a great deal on Hotels com for the Phoenix  We had a very comfortable stay  My two friends were in a much smaller room  but still found it very comfortable  The hotel offered a great location and easy access to the tube  It offered a light brunch in the morning  We were very happy with out stay  If you are a person traveling for sightseeing or work and need only comfort this is the perfect hotel  We didn t spend a ton of time in our rooms  but used it mostly to fall into bed at night and get ready for the next grueling day of sightseeing      I would absolutely stay there again and reccomend it to other people  
P =>   Only for sleeping First the pros The location is good  West London  just by the park  Quiet side street with no disturbing noise compared to other London areas The price is really good considering that breakfast is included The bathroom is new and clean The minuses Interior is not horrible  but quite worn and you do not feel like walking around in your socks exactly  Colours are murky brown  orange red   and not the trendy kind either The room first smelled of smoke so I asked to change  I wasn t greeted with a smile but they gave me another room without any fuzz  Outside the elevator was left a tray with half eaten breakfast on the floor  and this was in the evening so it seems that there is no real inspection of the premises after the cleaning team has gone for the day Rooms are normal in size  TV is very small and with bad reception  The cupboard smelled old dusty wood  wouldn t hang my best suit in there The walls are thin  so if the guests next door are a noisy bunch you will hear them All in all  You can t complain given the prize really  but I could only recommend this as an option to those spending only a few days and with a busy schedule so they don t have to spend so much time in the room  I m sure there are better options if you are willing to spend a few more quid or if you are flexible with whereabouts you stay  
P =>   Really nice hotel great location Had a lovely triple room here  third bed is elevated above the other two  quite characterful  Everything lovely and clean and inclusive continental breakfast as substantial as you want it to be with a lovely choice of cereals and fresh fruit  breads and croissants  Excellent altogether  
P =>   Good hotel but not for me  I chose this hotel for business reasons working in London for a week in   Its a real shame that it didn t score higher for me  I had stayed in some real horrors before and after a quick visit to the hotel  I seemed delighted to secure a room for a week  To be fair the hotel is clean and quite modern except for the lack of air conditioning which some of you may question as it was   however  the weather was quite mild and the room was stifling  If my stay was taken in the summer then it would have been unbearable I did seek the use of a fan  however  the hotel staff did not seem that bothered and did not provide one in the end  My colleague in another room did help out in the end My room was a single room and it was on two levels  strange eh  The room was quite spacious for a single room and the bathroom was very clean with the shower being very hot when needed  The only problem I had was with the bed being very very uncomfortable and the tv being on the lower level away from the bed  This may seem daft but you were given a tiny chair to sit in front of it which can be very annoying after a while  The breakfast was very good with a very large selection overall  You can even upgrade to a full english breakfast for       Unfortunately I will not be choosing the hotel for the reasons stated above but the hotel is located in a great area with many pubs  shops and restaurants  It is only a five minute walk from two tube stations and Hyde Park Oh yeah I secured this hotel for     a night  very reasonable for London  
P =>   ent hotel for a good price Based on the good reviews my wife and I booked a five day stay at this hotel  I was a mixed experience  The personel was very nice and helpful  The breakfast was splendid though the restaurant is quite overcrowded especially in the late morning   if you are an early bird there is far more space  We had a room on the  th floor  It was very small  barely enough space for a bed and the television was minuscule  Biggest problem though was the sink and the toilet  The sink was very efficient at making the whole bath room wet and the toilet was not able to flush very well  The house cleaning is excellent our sheets were changed each every day   quite amazing  At some occassions towels had an odd foul smell probably due to the place where they are kept  We had the exchanged and there were no problems As many people has pointed out   the location can t be beet  There s the tubestations within walking distance   which gives you easy access to circle line and central line The neighborhood does not seem entirely safe   at times there were a lot of rambunctuous young people roaming the streets  All in all  though it was a pleasent experience   and I would recommend the Best Western Phoenix  
P =>   Delighted with this Hotel Have just returned this evening from a four day stay in London at the Phoenix Hotel  After reading the reviews on this site about this hotel  was unsure what to expect as some were full of praise and others were not  However  we could not fault this hotel in any way  From check in  which took only a few minutes  the staff could not have been any friendlier or more helpful than they were  The first impressions of the hotel were also very good  Outside looked very clean and inside  the reception and bar areas were lovely decorated and smelt lovely  No mustiness here  Was very nervous entering the bedroom  but need not have worried  Had booked a triple room  was big enough for our needs  after all we had come to see London  not laze around a hotel and its facilities for   days  There are plenty of other hotels for that type of holiday  It had   twin beds and then had a  rd bed on a raised level   which our son was absolutely delighted with  claimed it was the coolest hotel room ever   and he had his own TV as well  The TV had the   English channels and Sky News which was sufficient  The room also had internet access  No problem here either  Just had to get a password and username from Reception and it worked perfectly for the whole time there  Our bathroom was spotlessly clean and beautifully tiled  A great relief after looking at some of the photos on this site of some of the hotels around  Plenty of hot water  clean towels  soap  shampoo  shower gel etc  For breakfast you had a good choice of cereals  toast  rolls  croissants  ham  cheese  fruit  yoghurts  juices  tea  amp  coffee  There was cooked breakfasts at an additional cost  but while we were there  I certainly didn t see many people ordering them  Everyone seemed happy enough with what was on offer  We were nearly last into the Dining Room some mornings and there was loads of everything still available to eat  The hotel itself is in a quiet square just off Queensway  It s hard to believe that you are so close to the main street when you re actually inside the hotel  There are   tube stations nearby  Queensway on the Central line and Bayswater on the Circle District line  On the morning we checked out  there was no problem leaving our cases  heading off and picking them up again later for the journey home  The hotel is in a great area with lots of shops and places to eat on the main street  Also there is ice skating  bowling and the cinema  What more entertainment could you ask for  without even mentioning central London itself  
P =>   good location but cramped I spent   nights here on business  and on the plus side it is indisputably in an excellent location  close to tubes and buses and good shops  I felt safe there and going backwards and forwards as a single woman  It was clean too  and contrary to some reviews here  I found the staff friendly and helpful  So far  so good   and my room was cheap  Breakfast was adequate  On the minus side  my single room was absolutely tiny  I barely fitted into it  I had to juggle my luggage around and perch it on top of the wardrobe  The bathroom was miniscule  I am a small female   I can t imagine a big bloke coping with that room at all  The other major problem was the noise from other rooms  Guests were coming and going at all hours and with the paper thin walls  you can hear every creak and door slam  I didn t notice outside noise  but I was on floor four and as it was horrible winter weather  didn t open the window at night  It was the noise inside the place that was bad  the walls are soooo thin I would only recommend it if the location means a great deal to you  you don t mind being cramped and you can put up with the noise    oh  and the lift is not up to the job   it s slow and there s only one  so often crowded at peak times  All in all  a claustrophobic experience  
P =>   Lovely stay at the Phoenix Hotel We stayed at the Phoenix Hotel in ember      for   nights  We were lucky to get a honeymoon suite for the same price as a normal room  The room was big and clean     beds and   TVs  The atmosphere at the hotel was very friendly and nice  Breakfast was nice with several different things to choose between  and the staff was quick to get coffee and the  I would be happy to come back next time I visit London  
P =>  Liked this hotel  This is a very nice London hotel   I have stayed in this area of London every year  at least once  for    years  Nice neighborhood  very convienient for three major Tube lines  ATM  inexpensive meals and good take away  groceries  pharmacy  gifts  etc   all between the hotel and the Tube  The hotel is on a very quiet residential street    minute walk to your choice of   tube stations  Elevator  Nice  attentive  and very helpful staff  Very clean  odor free rooms with large functional windows  high ceilings  and good lighting  Power shower was a welcome surprise  Room rate included a very good continental breakfast with fresh fruits  cereals  juices  cheese  meat  yogurt  and assorted breads  I will stay there again  
P =>   A week at the Phoenix The Best Western Phoenix Hotel is located a few blocks from both the Bayswater and Queensway Underground stations  The hotel was very clean and the staff was very helpful and knowledgeable of the local area  The room was a double and was fairly small  but adequate  The shower entrance was unbelievably small and very difficult to get into  There are many restaurants  stores  fast food chains within walking distance  Although it is expensive I recommend Bella Italia which is   block away  if you like Italian food  I rated this hotel as average only because there are much better hotels available  but I would highly recommend this hotel and I would stay again  I paid about      for   days which is fairly priced  
P =>  Great location   all we needed We ve just returned from a weekend stay at the Phoenix hotel and were very pleased with it  If you re looking for a luxury hotel  then the Phoenix is probably not for you  But if  like us  you were looking for a well located  reasonably priced  clean and comfortable bed for the night  then it s a great choice We travelled to London by train into Paddington station and so the Phoenix s location in Bayswater was perfect  From Paddington  Bayswater is the next stop on the tube and then the hotel is very close   just around the corner from Bayswater tube station  We travelled with small suitcases and found the walk quite easy and didn t feel out of place trundling suitcases up the high street The hotel itself is located just off the main street and is easy to find  The lobby is quite small but comfortable with plenty of seating  internet access  tourist leaflets and daily newspapers etc  We arrived at midday and the staff were very good at getting us checked into our rooms  We weren t expecting to be able to access the room that early  If you do arrive early they are happy to store your luggage until your room is ready in the reception area  Check in was straightforward and there is a lift to take you to the upper floors The rooms are fairly small  as are most in London  but we certainly weren t squeezed into the room as some reviews here would lead you to believe  We had a twin room and there was plenty of space to move around  The bathroom was also on the small side  but there was still enough room to comfortably move around and get dressed in there etc  Both the bedroom and bathroom were spotless and the furnishings were in good condition  Simple toiletries are provided in the bathroom  shampoo  shower gel  shower cap  soap and facial tissue   The continental breakfast was included in the room rate and  while not anything to get excited about  was perfectly adequate  It is a buffet style service with a good choice of Kellogg s cereals  croissants  toast  rolls  ham  cheese  yogurt  fruit  juices  tea and coffee  Simple  but all I d eat at home so I was more than satisfied  The breakfast room is quite small so try to get there early or be prepared for a queue Regarding the area  Bayswater is nice  not overly touristy  but easy to get to and plenty of local facilities  Within a couple of minutes  walk from the hotel is the high street which has a shopping centre  cinema  large Boots store  chemist drugstore   Tesco  supermarket     tube stations  Bayswater  amp  Queensway  and plenty of restaurants including well known  quot family friendly quot  chains such as Bella Italia and Pizza Hut  Buses from central London stop outside Queensway tube station on Bayswater Rd   a    minute walk from the hotel  The area felt very safe  even late at night  as the high street is busy  Hyde Park is just    minutes away  and Notting Hill about a         minute walk In summary then  the Phoenix offered everything we needed for a weekend break in London  We were out and about all day and during the evening  so the hotel was literally just a place to sleep for us  The location was fantastic and very easy to get to so we will certainly stay there again  
P =>   You can do better elsewhere I just returned from spending   nights at the London Phoenix Hotel  and my experiences echo those of  gottravelbug  Chicago  Illinois               Don t rely on the Best Western reputation here  The Phoenix isn t up to that brand s standards As every reviewer notes  the rooms are tiny  That s not surprising in London  but it makes it important to use the space efficiently  The Phoenix flunks that test  For example  it wouldn t be very costly to provide flat panel  wall mount TVs instead of the clunkers that take up half of the precious desktop  the only flat surface in the room   And that only get a few channels  surely a disservice to the many non English speaking guests that the hotel hosts   Most of the remaining desktop is taken up by a tea coffee service  I didn t bring my laptop  preferring to shell out    pence per    minutes at a neighborhood cybercafe  I don t know where I would ve put my laptop if I had brought it Another example  closet space consisted of a standing wardrobe  about   feet wide and with cheap sliding doors that kept straying off their tracks  With so little clearance  hinged doors or pocket doors would have been much smarter  It contained only   hangers  inadequate for a scheduled   night stay  When I asked for more  the front desk grudgingly brought up   more What is it with the clocks  Like travelbug  I found that mine needed a new battery   Which the housekeeping staff provided  upon request  but why did we have to ask   be they figure the clock is invisible from the bed anyway  so who cares  Again  dumb design   Memo  wear a watch in bed  The room was very warm  even in ober  I left the window wide open and tolerated the street noise  And the mosquitos  Yes  in ober   No screens  Dangerous  if you re traveling with young children  The hotel encourages guests to reuse bath towels instead of requesting fresh ones every day  That s environmentally commendable  and I complied   but it would be pleasanter if there were more than a single narrow rod on which to hang used towels  Travelbug  will be impressed to hear that my flimsy plastic bathroom glass was  indeed  replaced once during my stay D cor was borderline shabby  Cleanliness and repair were marginal  The bathroom s noisy exhaust fan  maddeningly  stays on long after the light is turned off  The one lift is inadequate  The breakfast room is unpleasantly crowded The interior of the hotel is non smoking  a plus  A consequence  though  is that smokers are almost always huddled on the entrance steps  so you enter the lobby through a cloud of tobacco smoke  The overwhelming impression is that the Phoenix is squeezing every pence out of this property  and dares its guests to ask for better treatment I m not some yahoo who s never visited London before  this is my tenth trip or so  I stayed for   nights at the Phoenix only because I had prepaid through a booking service  big mistake  and dreaded the hassle of demanding a change  I would have been happier spending the same amount elsewhere  or spending less for a charming  cosmopolitan bed and breakfast  albeit with shared bath  that I ve previously enjoyed greatly  
P =>   Reviews are Correct   average hotel All the reviews are correct   some bad  some good  some great  but all of them tell the truth about Best West Phoenix  We booked our stay at the Best Western Phoenix Hotel through Hotels com for our stay in Late tember  When we arrived we were told they were overbooked and that they would put us up in their  quot sister hotel  quot  I remember reading a review about this exact situation with this hotel so I stood my ground and said we were not leaving  They gave us a very small room  but we did not expect much since we knew before from this website what we were getting into  Advice for staying here  Don t except their invitation to stay at the other hotel  eat the wonderful breakfast before site seeing in the morning and be prepared for very small accomodations  I would probably search for something better for the price next time I stay in London  but overall the location was great and we had an amazing time  
P =>   Ok but nothing more Pros    Cheap for central London  Conveniently located close to the Queensway and Bayswater  tube stations and lots of restaurants  supermarkets  and stores    Very quiet at night Cons    The hotel room was the smallest I have ever seen worldwide   I had a single bed  and it could barely fit in the room  The  bathroom was closet size   The air condition in the bathroom is extremely loud and takes  about    minutes to switch off after you have turned of the light  in the room   Breakfast was absolutely horrible   even for London  Far too  many people crammed into a very uncharming basement and  the food being of the absolutely cheapest variety bordering on  the inedible   The staff at the reception could not  would call for a taxi for us   when asked very politely  All in all  An OK place to stay if you just want a bed to sleep in and nothing more  
P => must be the cleanest hotel in london  This hotel was soo clean we sat in the lounge on the last afternoon for about one and a half hours and during this time the coffee tables were polished by several members of staff at least twice in fact the smell of polish was overwhelming  not to mention the plumping of the cushions The hotel is in a brilliant location within a few yards of some decent shops and various eating establishments The Notting Hill carnival was on the weekend we were there so buses and taxis couldn t get to the hotel as many roads were closed off however it was a very pleasant walk through Kensington Gardens to Oxford street taking about       minutes I would definately stay here again  
P =>   GREAT VALUE Very good value for money with good rooms and friendly staff  Location is a plus point as well  
P =>   Great Value      recommended  We arrived to this nice hotel and i was a little scared according to some of the reviews read here Hotel has a marvellous situation  in a neighbourhood plenty of life  extremely well communicated with London Center    underground lines  and   h buses running in every direction you can imagine   There is a lot of restaurants and pubs in the surroundings as well as a lot of people in the streets all day long  The room was confortable  big enough for a couple and extremely clean  Bathroom a litlte tiny but also extremely clean  Towels were changed daily as well as linen  The room service is exceptional good For freakfast you can eat  quot all as you can quot  but there is not a wide election to choice  Toast  Ham  Cheese  Croissants  Cereals  Yogourth  Fruits  Juices  and all kind of mermelades  nutellas and those things So  as a resume  I will highly recommend this hotels because for the price we paid for it     ir worths it  
P =>   A Good Value I booked the hotel through British Airways Vacations because they offered an extremely reasonable rate in my opinion  I had stayed at the Phoenix previously so I had an idea of what to expect  On a previous trip  I had a double but on this trip  I had a single  Based on previous reviews  I expected the single to be very small  However  I was pleasantly surprised that my room was set up as a mini loft with the desk mirror TV and bathroom on one level and the bed  armoire  and nightstand up some stairs in a loft   how fun  The location  near the Bayswater and Queensway tube stations  is ideal  the room was clean  and the hot water plentiful  The neighborhood is quite safe   as a single woman traveling alone  I never felt uncomfortable walking back to the hotel  even late at night  It is also in a relatively quiet location and so I was able to keep the window open  Of course  you would hear the occasional car horn but it never bothered me  even with the window open at night  The breakfast that is included in the room rate includes quite a selection of items and I was always filled up and ready for sightseeing after breakfast  The staff was also very helpful and courteous  I had e mailed with questions prior to my trip and they were answered very promptly  The hotel is also near Whiteley s shopping center  which includes a ks  amp  Spencer store  some restaurants  and an internet caf   although it s not really a caf   per se   I would recommend this hotel  
P => Nice little hotel but overpriced We stayed at the Phoenix with a group of college students in  of this year while on a long weekend in London  While the rooms were quite small  the location was convenient  just around the corner from the Bayswater Underground station with many conveniences nearby  yet in a fairly quiet and very attractive neighborhood  The windows opened to let in fresh air  always a plus  and the free Continental breakfast was quite plentiful  including fruit  cheese  cold cuts  along with the usual breads and juices  We were unable to access the in room internet service  despite instructions from the front desk  but a computer is available in the lobby  for a price  and quite slow  However  the bathrooms were of a good size and quite clean  Water pressure was good and hot water was plentiful  All in all  this was a nice   quot moderate quot  hotel at luxury prices  
P =>   Great London Trip and Great Time Staying at Phoenix Hotel My wife and I and   daughters  ages    and     all stayed at the Best Western Phoenix Hotel from     to   il    nights   We had absolutely no problems  and enjoyed our stay thoroughly  We had two different rooms on the  nd floor  and both were rooms with twin beds  The Phoenix Hotel was booked for us through a travel agent using Delta Vacations  Out of all the walking and touring that we accomplished  I saw few other hotels as close and convenient to things as was the Phoenix  except those very costly hotels  The rooms were clean and in good repair  I was a bit skeptical after some reviews I had read  but we found everything to be great  Yes  the rooms were a bit small but not to the point of being uncomfortable  Yes  I can see why a few people complained about the heat  because our room had a small steam radiator that I could not turn off  Nonetheless  it wasn t that hot and as others have said  I simply opened the windows  I read somewhere of a complaint of street noise keeping them awake when the windows were open  but I had no problems  If you insist on sleeping in total silence  then save your foam earplugs from the airlines  and sleep with them in  We all found the continental breakfast to be good  and helped start each day out right  as we trekked throughout London and returned to the hotel exhausted each day  I particularly like the small bar at the hotel  where I would relax and enjoy a couple of pints in the evening  while talking to the bartender Jesus  from Brazil  and the other patrons from various countries  We thoroughly enjoyed being just     minutes walk from the Bayswater Tub Station where one can catch the Circle Line  Yellow  or District Line  Green   Just another   block further was the Queensway Station  Red Line   The convenience of the tub stations was outstanding  and we simply purchased four   day passes every day  Oddly enough  it was cheaper to buy each day than to bay a multi day pass  HINT  Take a Taxi from the Train Station to the hotel  I found it much easier than fighting the crowds on the Tube Line  while dragging suitcases   It was    pounds from Victoria Station to the Hotel   There were an unbelievable number of places to eat and drink nearby the Phoenix Hotel  on the same street as the Tube Lines  and then even more places to dine about   block further  AND  one of the most enjoyable days  but quite long  that we spent in London was walking from our Hotel  through nearby Kensington Park  past Kensington Palace  down to Hyde Park Corner  to Buckingham Palace  and on to Westminster Abbey  A tremendous about of walking  but the point is     If you stay at the Phoenix Hotel  don t forget to stroll through Kensington Park  
P =>   Wonderful stay  Got a great deal on the Phoenix through British Airways but was a bit nervous given some of the negative reviews  I needn t have worried  We had a  nd floor room overlooking the square which by London standards felt positively palatial  As others have mentioned  the room tended to be a bit warm  but this was easily solved by opening the windows a bit  The wardrobe was a good size  though I would have liked more drawers  Bathroom  while on the small side  was new with plenty of towels and toiletries provided  Breakfast was super    fresh  plentiful and very filling  For those who may be interested  there is a PC in the lounge with internet access for a small fee  The location is absolutely fabulous  only minutes from the tube  restaurants and shopping Some have said they found the staff diificult  That was not my experience at all  To the contrary  I found everyone most accomodating and helpful  from the desk attendents to housekeeping to breakfast room wait staff  I will definitely return  
P => Convenient location clean Spend a weekend in ch  Very helpfull staff  Very clean room  altough very small even by European standards  Walls are somewhat a little thin  but noise level ok overall  ks  amp  Spencer Food and   Tesco supermarkets around the corner  About   minutes walk from the Bayswater underground  Very nice and quiet residential neighbourhood to the west  About a      minutes walk to Kensigton Park  Notting Hill antique dealers and vintage clothing stores  Would go back anytime at the Expedia rate  about   GBP for a single room   however the    GBP advertised by the hotel on their website seems a bit much  Nice continental breakfast included  If you re not looking for luxury  this hotel is clean  conveniently located and if you don t mind walking you can get around town on foot very easily  
P =>   Good place to stay We stayed at the Phoenix Hotel in ruary  We were happy with the rooms  small  but that is normal for London   good beds  quiete street  a decent and clean bathroom  a nice breakfast with cheese  meat  rolls  cereals  fresh fruits and yoghurt  Nothing to complain about really  The location is again very nice  close to many shops and restaurants and two tube stations  We had a great time and will recommend this hotel  You don t find many hotels that give this standard of comfort and quality for a normal price  We were disappointed many times in the past because London hotels can be such a a dump  This one is absolutely value for money  Nothing fancy  but good quality  good location  fair price  Go there  really GO THERE   
P =>  We Liked the Phoenix My husband and I spent four nights at the Best Western Phoenix Hotel and we really liked it  It was very tastefully decorated with a pleasant reception area and bar  The hotel room was tiny but definitely enough for the both of us  The bed had lovely clean sheets and the shower area  amp  toilet  no bath   had towels of the same cleanliness  There weren t many sockets in the room however so we found it difficult having to use one electrical item at a time The windows need to be looked at due to the fact that on one windy night we had to lodge a piece of cardboard in them to stop the constant rattling noise  We had a continental breakfast which was very nice although you did have the option of a cooked breakfast for        The location is excellent  right next door to Whiteley s Shopping Centre which also has a few places to eat and just around the corner from Hyde Park  It also has   tube stations nearby for Circle District and Piccadilly Lines along with a street full of pubs  eating establishments and a bowling alley  It is definitely a place for couples rather than families but well worth it for the price  
P =>   FANTASTIC I spent   nice weeks at Phoenix  I ll return next time I ll be in Lond I spent    nights at Phoenix hotel for a business period in London  The location is excellent  close to   undergronud lines  Central  District  Circle  and close to a lot of restaurant  The people in the hotel is very friendly and try the best to help you  The breakfast is good but the restaurant room is too small so sometimes you have to wait for a table  The room was regular  considering London standard  with   windows  the wardrobe was small but I could use   big drawers  Resuming my opinion  the Phoenix hotel is a good hotel in London  close to the center  with friendly people  
P =>  Perfect Must read    Me and my best mate stayed here when we went clubbin last wkend  The hotel was perfect for what we wanted all round The Hotel    mins up the road from Queensway station off of high street  loads of shops around for convenience  quite area  no noise from outside when in room at all  The main part of hotel foyer  etc is lovely  part marble  part carpeted it is very clean with big sofas to chill on besides the bar The rooms  not romantic or couple oriented  perfect for those who want somewhere comfortable to stay and are out most of the day enjoying London  Victorian fashioned rooms BUT not like draped in old furniture or heavy flowered curtains  I mean simple and nice  The bathroom was best feature which was nice   us girls when getting ready to go out in evening  Room was small but big windows meant there was plenty of air coming in  our room faced the front of hotel and overlooked gardens which was good  There was also a fridge in walk in wardrobe which was very handy for dinks  You usually don t get one of these for the price you pay in other hotels  The service  staff was very chatty and friendly with us  man at desk ordered us a cab from the hotel into Leicester sq which cost us     way there      way back at  am  which wasn t too bad when sharing Would defo go there again for a wkend away  would defo recommend it  If your a couple who are looking for a romantic wkend i would opt for somewhere else but since me and my mate paid     each for the night  booked on the web  in London u cant go wrong or be too disappointed with that   
P =>   Great deal We stayed at the Best Western Phoenix for three nights in uary       We got a great rate online of   GBP night  A continental breakfast was included and was good  The location was convenient  easy to get to using the tube from Heathrow  It was a longish journey to the Eurostar  though  Room was clean and pleasant  Staff was helpful  The neighbourhood had lots of restaurants and there was a shopping mall at the end of the block  Also  there was a grocery store nearby  Overall  we were very pleased   especially for the price  
P =>   Superb value for money well equipped and excellent location Thanks to expedia  single rooms currently are going for        pounds a night  This includes Refurbished Power ShowersHairdryerCable TVHigh Speed Wireless Internet AccessBarIron Continental BreakfastThis is a very tidy typical   star hotel   furnishings look a little on the dowdy side  old windows let in more noise than usual  single rooms might be a bit tiny and pillows may be somewhat lumpy   But frankly for        a night who cares This hotel offers excellent value for money  and it s location next to a street full of shops  restaurants and two tube stations is very handy indeed  Notting Hill and Kensington Park are very close by A solid   stars  all things considered  
P => Very small single rooms The Hotel Phoenix is in a great location in an ecclectic part of Bayswater  It is convenient to two tube lines and there is a bus stop across the street that  with transfers  can get you into central London The staff was very friendly and helpful  the service was great and the breakfast was more than adequate HOWEVER  the room was the smallest I have ever experienced and I had difficulty in just moving about       quot      lbs   Also the room was hot  uary   st   While the hotel is rated   Stars  I would put the room at   Stars  If you leave early in the day and get back at late night  the room is OK but do not plan to invite friends in for a drink because they will not be able to get into the room because of the small size  
P =>  Great value at a budget price  Only issue wake up call was always    mins early Great value at a budget price  Excellent location with   tube stops on great lines  central and circle   next to hyde park  and lot of places to eat and good sized tesco supermarket block away Would stay again  Need to keep it a secret     oops then why am i writing this review    
P =>   Perfect location  This is a great place to stay in London  It is right off Queensway St  which is full of restaurants and shops  and even the Queensway Mall  There are   Underground Stations very near within   blocks and   blocks  The hotel was fine  the rooms were large enough  nice bathroom  wonderful breakfast  cereal  breads cheeses  fruit  meats and drinks  and the staff was very helpful  In the evenings you can walk down to Hyde Park  about   blocks  and sit and enjoy the people and atmosphere  The hotel street is also very quiet  so no trouble sleeping  It also has a small elevator  so older people like us don t have to climb stairs  And the price was not expensive  So we really enjoyed it  and would definitely go again  
P =>   Quiet Close Quant    We stayed at the Phoenix for a week over the New Year Holiday and had a wonderful experience  We were a bit apprehensive when we read the earlier review about the bed bugs but we had already made our reservations  We have trusted Best Western hotels when traveling overseas in the past have not been let down yet  The room was small by USA standards but normal by UK standards  The bathroom was very clean but small  The hotel was very tidy  As mentioned in an earlier review  the room was hot but this was easily remedied by opening up the window  The shades allowed the room to be completely dark  The street the hotel sits on is quiet and the window being open did not cause any difficultly with sleeping  The lobby has a cute little bar in it  The free continental breakfast was very nice and a full english breakfast was available for an additional cost    pounds   The area is culturally diverse and close to quite a few small bars  shops and restaurants  The tube station is only   blocks away and there is a large shopping mall about a block away  It was located very close to hyde park  which is a wonderful walk on Sunday   Also  it is about   blocks from Notting Hill Gate where they have an open air market on Saturdays  The staff were reserved and helpful  There were no hidden costs and the final bill was actually   pounds less than I thought it would be  All in all  it was very enjoyable and I would recommend this hotel highly for the cost conscious traveler  A great value for the money  Oh yes    there were no bed bugs in our room  There are websites out there to help inform travelers what to look for when arriving in a room  I would recommend reading them prior to traveling   Especially traveling overseas  We inspected our room top to bottom on the first night there and it was spotless  
P =>   Good service We had a good overall experience for the price  The rooms are small but the service is reasonably good  The staff was courteous to warm the milk for our kid at odd hours  The breakfast menu and the service were good for rating and price It is also walk able distance from two tube stations  
P =>   Unless You Don t Mind Sweating Don t Stay Here I booked this hotel on the basis of the Best Western name through British Airways  knowing that British Airways usually has standards for the hotels for which they sell booking  I like to stay in Hyde Park by Lancaster gate but read the tube station would be closed in ober and was afraid it might extend into ember I was very disappointed  In the    hotels I have stayed in in London  this ranks      just above one independent budget hotel I stayed in on Sussex Gardens near Paddington Station I stayed in a single room  The room was very small and slightly shabby  The room was clean  carpeting clean  but there were spots and marks on the wallpaper  There was a small wardrobe at the foot of the bed with   hangers and half of it taken up with a shelf with a coffee tea service on it  There was a small desk with two small drawers which had a small TV on it and telephone  There were no sattelite channels on the TV  There was a rack next to the desk for a suitcase  There was a clock on the wall above the door which was not working  The bathroom was tiny  The toilet was in a niche in the wall with about   inches on either side  I had to sit slightly sideways on the toilet because of the toilet paper roll just about overlapping the seat  The toilet faced the walk in shower  which had no shelf in it   and in between against the wall was a sink with no room between with a small glass shelf above the sink  When I arrived  there was a plastic glass wrapped in cellophane with the Best Western logo  This glass was never changed throughout my    day stay  I probably should have thrown it away and maybe would have received a new one  There is no way you can dry off from showering with the door closed The really terrible  unbearable thing about this hotel was that it was miserably HOT in DECEMBER  The radiator in the room was not on  The radiator in the hall was warm  so I don t know where all the heat was coming from  I spoke to several other people who said their room was very warm and they had to leave the window open  Looking up from the street  one could see many windows open  The problem with this was that you could hear all the street noise  which continued on to all hours of the morning  The hotel had a linen delivery at      a m  right out in front of the hotel in front of my room with people unloading the truck talking loudly  Where is the consideration for hotel guests  I think cabs used this street to turn around to return to the main street  One night as I lay awake  I could hear snoring coming from the room next door  I received   nights for the price of    so the price was very reasonable  but in the end  you get what you pay for   If you can t deal with these discomforts  spend a little more and stay in a better hotel in a nicer  more quiet area  
P =>  Great hotel  Just returned from a weekend at this hotel and have to say it was great and met all our needs  The rooms were nicely furnished and had everything we needed  except an ironing board  however a quick call to reception and an iron and ironing board arrived promptly to our room  The staff we all very pleasant and helpfull  Breakfast was plentiful  not just the basics  which set us up nicely for the day  Every evening before bed we enjoyed a drink in the cosy little bar  The location is excellent being only a few minutes walk from Bayswater station and Queensway station and there are plenty of restaurants to choose from  I would definately return to this hotel as it was great value for money  
P => Good Value Hotel My daughter and I stayed at this hotel on Friday    ober  The reception staff were very friendly and helpful and the room was clean and comfortable if a bit dated  The continental breakfast was adequate  You can leave your luggage at the hotel if you arrive early or on the day you book out We booked through hotels london co uk and paid     for bed and continental breafast Bayswater is a lively cosmpolitan area with many good restaurants and pubs within walking distance of hotel  Queensway and Bayswater tube stations within a few minutes walk   handy for all the tourist sites This hotel is certainly not luxurious  However  if you are looking for reasonably priced accommodation in London then it is a good choice  
P =>  Great location I would stay here again  It s a great location  and the customer service was outstanding  They really went out of their way to help us   and we had a million questions  Only a few reservations about it   there s only one elevator that takes FOREVER  and doesn t hold but   people max  for some reason all of the stairs seemed to be locked     very weird   and it was just swelteringly hot there  in ober  when it was cold outside   We were able to open the window  but it was pretty loud  as this is on a main street  Oh  and Best Western has this awful phone service   I couldn t use my corporate card to call out  I went round and round in circles with their phone operators  and finally just gave up  But that s not the Phoenix s fault  That s just Best Western  
P =>   Heaven for bed bugs   I stayed there for   nights last week and got more than a hundred bed bug bites at the first night    Since I was from the city where there s no bed bugs  I didn t know why I had welts and itching until I searched information about the symptoms after I got back home It looks clean and good but     there are hidden vampires   gross  If you are going to stay there  examine bedsheets  upper and lower seams of the mattress  headboards  etc  On the first day of my staying  I noticed there was blood spots on bedsheet but I didn t take it serious because I didn t know what it was and    it ended up with more than a hundred bed bug bites and medical expense  Except bed bugs  everything was good but I won t stay there again  never  
P =>   Loved our stat  We loved the location  It s just a short walk to the Bayswater tube stop  and right down the street from Hyde Park  The neighborhood is ethnically diverse with lots of great restaurants and pubs  The staff was quite friendly and accommodating  We had a lovely room        and the continental breakfast was oh so good  We would highly recommend this hotel  
P =>   Comfortable and good location This hotel is very well located for   tube stations which makes it ideal for tourists  I have been to London on numerous occassions and this was one of the best hotels I have stayed in  The room was quite big for London and the bathroom was very nice  The free wireless internet is great if you have your computer with you  The rooms are decorated to a good standard and the breakfast is good enough but a free english breakfast would be better  Around the hotel there are numerous restaurants which cater for all tastes along with all the shops you could need in the nearby whitelys shopping centre  
P =>  okay hotel in a great location This is a very average London hotel  The common areas were decent  but my single room was very small  typical of London   There is no AC  typical of London   The decor  carpet and furniture were very dated and worn  but the bathroom was modern and very clean   I have also stayed in the Best Western Corona Hotel on Belgrave Road  and that hotel had much nicer  newer rooms   The location was great  on a  relatively  quiet square right off Queensway  It is a short walk to two Tube stations with great access to   major Tube lines  and the area is teeming with great  cheap  ethnic eateries  It is a short   min walk to the quiet and beauty of Hyde Park  To sum it up  a clean  safe hotel with great location  but the rooms need a major face lift  However  you could pay a lot more for the same or worse in London    
P =>  Good Base for London Trip My opinion of this hotel is probably influenced by the fact that I stayed in two other not so great hotels during this trip  so this one seemed great in comparison  The room was small  and my room faced the street  but those are really the only problems I had  and to be honest  the small room wasn t a problem at all  I mean  it s just a place to sleep  Reception was nice and even let me use the computer for free for a few minutes  the rate posted for going on the internet in the reception area is highway robbery       for    minutes   I enjoyed the continental breakfast  it was certainly a good way to start the day  The location is very convenient to the tube  and the area seems to have plenty of shops  pubs and eating choices  I felt I paid a fair price for this room and if I got the same rate again  I would definitely return  
P =>   It is clean and central Just back from a four night stay at this hotel  The major attraction of this place was it s location  as mentioned previously it is only a few minutes walk from either Bayswater or Queensway tube stations  from either of these anywhere in London is readily accessable The hotel is clean  the rooms are small and the breakfast is good  but I thought paying       extra for the english breakfast was a bit much  The staff are good enought to deal with and while there isn t a safe in the room one is available at the reception area  We checked in early in the day and there is storage for your bags  till you get back and are allowed into your room The area is filled with multi cultural dining  so the ambitious people get plenty chances to try something new We had a top floor room overlooking the square and at night people going home at  am seemed noisy  The heat in the room was overbearing  the building needs air conditioning  I can understand how the people who stayed there during the heat of the summer must have felt  We had to sleep with the windows open fully  which didn t help with the noise form passers by or traffic Yes we would stay there again  simply because it is so easy to get to the hotel from Heathrow and the proximity to the tube stations and Kensington Gardens makes it worth while It is a great base from which to tour London  
P =>  Amazing  This hotel blew me away  First of all  the ladies at the front desk were extremely helpful  and even helped us book London tours for the following days  We were at this hotel for three nights and loved every minute of it  The rooms were small  but we re talking London  The hotel was greatly situated a few blocks from a Metro station  and there was a street of shopping adjacent to the road the hotel was on  There was also a great little pub just down the lane from it where the food was great and the bartenders very friendly    The room had two windows that worked  and a fan in the bathroom  The bathroom  although small was extremely clean   no mould in the shower   There was a full length mirror  and a desk        It was lovely  The breakfast wasn t bad  with croissants  buns  cereal  and ham and cheese  All in all  this hotel was absolutely phenomenal    
P =>   Good value for money Booked   nights at this hotel via BA website  The non smoking single room faced the street and was tiny and the bathroom even tinier  The first night the tiny TV didn t work and the showerhead in the ti     OK  OK you guys get the picture  shower sprayed water everywhere except on my body  Both the problems were fixed promptly the next day  The street can get noisy  conversations carried quite loudly at night into the room even with the window closed  so I would suggest booking a room away from it if you want some peace and quiet  Add to that the thin walls and you hear a lot of door banging and conversation  The decor is showing signs of wear and tear  The hotel is located off busy Queensway road with a lot of ethnic activity and has a host of Middle Eastern  Thai  Chinese  Indian and other take out eating places  my favorite was Nando s Portuguese BBQ about   minutes walk away   The breakfast was basic and I would imagine it was meant to be tucked into to tide you over your morning activity On the plus side is the hotel s location  a few minutes walk to the tube and to Kensington Palace Park   friendly staff and reasonable value for money  Recommended  
P =>   Fantastic value very good staff I read a lot of review and choose the Phoenix  I was very happy  Good location with very helpful staff  Very good value for money  
P =>   I d stay here again  A friend and I stayed at the Best Western Phoenix in ruary       and we had a very positive experience  The room was clean  the beds were comfortable  and the staff were friendly  The hotel is in Bayswater which is a busy and sometimes noisy area  however  the hotel itself is on a quiet side street and we couldn t hear the noise from the main street  The only negative aspect of the hotel was that they re very strict about their check in time and would not allow us an early check in  not quite what we wanted to hear after an overnight flight from Boston    However  they allowed us to leave our luggage in their holding area until check in  and this minor issue did not affect the positive experience we had at the Best Western Phoenix  
P =>   Inexpensive excellent location  I stayed at the Best Western Phoenix Hotel in a single room for one night in ust and have no complaints  The staff is not effusive but competent and friendly enough  The single rooms are small but very clean and even have a coffee tea maker in the wardrobe  I was able to check in prior to the usual time and to leave my luggage in the hotel the next day after checking out without surcharge  Although the breakfast room is very cramped  breakfast is perfectly ok  though slightly on the basic side  The biggest advantage is the location  near to two tube stations and Bayswater Road with a good bus connection into town  The square is relatively quiet  for London   Those suffering from insomnia should  however  try to book rooms facing the back  In short  an excellent choice for a short stay  
P =>  Nice location the rest is average   but not more I stayed at the Phoenix Hotel London for   days from Monday  y   th to Monday  y   st       with two friends I ll quickly start with the exterior  The hotel looks very nice from the outside  one might even think it s a more luxurious hotel because of the facade Inside  the reception area was quite as I expected it to be for a    hotel  Attached to the reception area is a bar with the possibility to get drinks and watch satellite television on a      format flat screen tv  they receive more channels there than on the room s tv   which is not quite hard to manage  Do already lower your expectations to the satellite tv  Unfortunately  the television in the room is not pretty luxurious concerning the receiving  the only channels we got was BBC    BBC    itv   Channel    Channel    EuroNews  CNN  SkyNews and one preset radio station  no foreign channels  We stayed in an intended double room  but with an additional bed  The latter did unfortunately cause the room to get an awful lot smaller  so  as a standard double room  it might have been quite comfortable  but with three people and an additional bed  it was damn small  The bathroom was okay  well cleaned but also very small   and this had nothing to do with the amount of people in the room  Generally  people taller than      metres have to move in their head a lot of times  especially in the breakfast room  luckily  some  quot Mind your head quot  signs try to make us remember not to bang our head against something  Breakfast was  in my opinion  average  but nothing more  You have the choice between the free Buffet Continental Breakfast and the full english platter at a cost of       per person  I haven t tried the english breakfast  so I can t say anything to that The Buffet Continental Breakfast consists of some sorts of rolls  small and hard to slice   wholemeal  or pure toasts  croissants and different sorts of cereals  Advice  Pay attention to the toaster  it might cause some people s toasts and croissants to get pitch black and burned   of course  good for those who like it that way  but most people might want them to become gold brown  You can choose between different sorts of jam  apricot  strawberry  orange   some cheese and some ham  Available drinks are cold milk  orange juice and some other   for me unidentifiable   drinks and still water  Of course you can also order warm drinks like hot chocolate  coffee and tea IF you get the possibility to order something  Staff is not really the most striking positive aspect in the hotel s review  As some others already wrote  the employees are quite unfriendly and do not really have an eye for details   especially in the breakfast room  You can call yourself lucky if one of the  quot polite quot  ladies comes and asks if you want to drink something warm  Otherwise it is hard to catch someone and if you do succeed  they don t really burst with enthusiasm   quite the contrary  particularly when you arrive for breakfast    minutes before the  official ending   Mostly at this time  staff is sitting at a table somewhere in the back for breakfast themselves   obviously they don t like to be disturbed at all then  The female  chief  of this  troop  is detatched of the others with black clothes and a golden name tag   but nothing more  If the others are having breakfast  she clears the tables and the dishes are being dashed onto the tray   just as the others do when putting the dishes onto the table  Another disturbing aspect was the chlorine smell coming out of the kitchen cleaning area  Luckily  this smell is only recognisable when entering the breakfast room and when sitting near the door to this mysterious area  Generally  the times for breakfast are almost  unhuman   Weekdays and on saturdays  you can get breakfast until      am  on sundays even until       am  Wow  Additional    minutes on sundays   how gracious The location  however  was pretty good  There are two Underground stations  Bayswater and Queensway  reachable in under a minute and about a minute respectively  Paddington Station is just one stop from Bayswater and offers connections to Heathrow Airport and a lot of other routes  A lot of shops and restaurants  lots of fast food restaurants like McDonald s  Burger King  Pizza Hut and KFC  but also some good italian and chinese restaurants  can be found on Queensway and the Whiteleys  shopping complex adds a lot more   you find some ODEON cinemas in there aswell I must admit that I expected a quite good hotel since this one belongs to the Best Western group  but my expectations did not get fulfilled   except concerning the location All in all  particularly the negative aspects of the hotel might be normal for a    hotel like the Phoenix  but a little bit more would not be amiss   especially for it to be part of the above named hotel chain I can recommend the Best Western Phoenix to people with little pretensions to a hotel in London  but everyone who might expect more should look out for another lodging  
P =>  Quite average I stayed for   nights in ust     the hotel is very well located    tube stations   Paddington Train station nearby  a shopping mall Whiteley s just around the corner   The room however was that great  unbelievably hot  no airconditioning  the window did open but was no helpand the fan the front desk gave was broken  so sleeping was quite difficult  The bathroom was the smallest I ve ever seen  I m a skinny girl and still had trouble using it  so someone who s a bit bigger will definitely have a few problems with it  Also  the water pressure was absolutely horrible  But for   nights it was bearable  The breakfast was nice and the staff was friendly  so overall I was satisfied  But I doubt I ll go back  especially in the summer  
P =>  Too hot  England has just recorded the highest temperature in y since records began   this hotel does not have air conditioning  a distinct disadvantage  The hotel did provide a fan in each room but was so hot that it was impossible to sleep  Warning   while I was in reception a women had her bag stolen  Three men came in  asked her daughter where the toilet was and then disappeared with a bag containing her passports and money  The hotel receptionist did not seem surprised by this incident   she reported it to the police and cancelled the credit cards  Watch your bags at all times Overall I would stay in this hotel again as the location is wonderful   it is in a quiet street but just around the corner is an amazing array of restaurants and shops as well as two underground stations  Until they install air conditioning I would only stay there in winter  
P =>  Surely there must be something better Unlike the recent reviewers I found the Phoenix Hotel to be very average  We have just spent   nights at this hotel where the service was extremely poor   the desk staff were extremely impolite  although I will give them kudos for arranging the hotel link bus for us    we asked for a fan and this seemed to be too much trouble for them   although we did eventually get one The room we stayed in was tiny   you could hardly swing a cat and the bathroom although clean was also extremely small  Sure I guess I shouldn t expect too much for   pd a night Breakfast is ordinary with only a small selection of cereals and breads to choose from   the staff in the breakfast room were quite friendly though The location of the hotel in Bayswater is good and is a nice walk to the city about   to   kms  however a majority of that walk is through Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park  
P =>   Would recommend the Phoenix My husband and I stayed at the Phoenix for   days this past y         Based on reviews on this site  I was extremely impressed with the hotel for its price range  The Phoenix is very convenient with the Bayswater tube stop about     blocks fro the hotel  along a nice street with shops and restaurants  Upon arriving in the morning  we were able to store our bags until our room was ready  however it s not an extremely secure location  but everything worked out ok  We didn t get back to the hotel until late that evening after sight seeing and found our room very warm  This hotel doesn t have airconditioning but they had placed a fan in our room already  Our one big problem during our stay was that the bathroom wasn t cleaned to my standards and even had the last person s soap still in the tub  Otherwise things were ok  The room was big for London  the street noise wasn t too bad with the window open  the breakfast was more than enough  rolls  croissants  toast  cheese  ham  cereals  fruits  juice  coffee tea  and the people were pleasant for the most part  They do have internet available in the lobby for a fee which helped us with some last minute planning  Overall I think the Phoenix is overpriced  but actually a deal for London  Would stay there again if looking for that price range  
P =>   Great Location Like the last reviewer  we had spent ages looking for hotels when we came across the BW Phoenix  and booked based on the price on Expedia and the reviews on this site Yes the rooms are small  the smallest I ve ever stayed in    but they are clean and comfortable and a desk fan was provided to help us survive the very hot weather  The breakfast is wonderful and although we didn t have all that much contact with the staff  they were friendly and polite Regardless of how you travel to London  I would recommend finding a way onto the Central tube line and getting off at Bayswater  turn left out of the station and then left again at the Whiteley s shopping centre and you ll be at the hotel in less than   minutes If you re on a budget but still want clean accommodation from which you can travel to just about anywhere in London in a few minutes  then I recommend the BW Phoenix  
P =>  Good location rather noisy After reading all the good reviews here  I decided to book this hotel  Normally I stay in the Comfort Inn Earl s Court but that hotel was fully booked  I found the two hotels very similar  The hotel is situated in a nice block  in an old building  The street is a nice side street from Queensway road on which you can find many local shops  cafe s and restaurants  Also the Whiteley shopping mall is just around the corner  which is very handy  On the third floor of the mall there are some restaurants that looked okay  I didn t try them  only went there to check my e mail on an Easy internet computer    pound for an hour   The Bayswater underground station is only a few minutes walking I had a single room that was quite small  but that is often the case in cheaper hotels  The bed was comfy  The room faced the street which meant that you could hear the people coming back from the pubs  but it was not too bad  The walls though were very thin  Perhaps my neighbours were just very loud  but it sounded like they were in my room  The bathroom was small but okay and there were coffee and tea making facilities  The only thing I missed was a safe  there is one in the earl s court hotel   The hotel could do with some modern decoration I thought  but it didn t bother me  I liked the layout  In some  budget  hotels you get lost easily because of all the corridors  but in this hotel it s very easy to find your room I wouldn t mind staying in this hotel again  because it is very difficult to find a decent  clean hotel in a safe area very close to a tube station that isn t extremely expensive  But perhaps it s best to take some ear plugs with you  just to be on the safe side  
P =>  A great place to stay in London I spent ages researching hotels in the London area and came across the Best Western Phoenix Hotel last ember  We made reservations for the first leg of our trip and ended up making a reservation for our return trip as well because we liked it so much  It s easily accessible from the Tube  clean  friendly  and comfortable  There is wireless internet available throughout the hotel  computer in the lobby near the bar for those without laptops  and the breakfast   I could go on and on about the lovely breakfast  Sure  the rooms aren t enormous but it doesn t pretend to be a five star hotel  For London and in this price range it s the best hotel I ve come across in    years of traveling to this city  If you re staying in London and this fits your price range  don t look elsewhere  You ll be very happy with your decision to stay here  
P =>  Quad Room   Family of     Great Experience   First off I have to say this was a perfect place for a family  We chose the Best Western Phoenix because of all the other wonderful comments I read about it in the Trip Advisor and we certainly were not disappointed  It is very similar to our Best Westerns in the States   not super fancy  but not a Motel   standard either  We stayed there for   days in mid il  We had   single beds which was great for my    yr old son     yr old daughter  my husband and myself  We had enough room to put our  jumbo expandable  suitcases     total because we were there for     weeks and I wasn t washing    on the floor and still have room to walk around without tripping on them  I was very pleased with the bathroom too  I was able to stand with my arms extended  spin around and not smack into a wall   which if you ve ever been to an English standard room this is very uncommon  There was plenty of room to relax without getting into each others hair  The other recommendations are correct in the multitude of restaurants and a Mall with in walking distance as well as the Bayswater Tube Station which is on the Circle Line   a main line to all tourist spots  There is an internet Caf  on the  rd floor dirt cheap     pound for   hour  The staff was exceptionally kind and went out of their way to make sure we had fresh wash clothes  which they call  face clothes   each day  That is not a traditional custom for England  but we requested it and they were very happy to oblige  They were also wonderful in getting us a great deal with a cab service for just   large van to the train station for   people and   suitcases for the second part of our vacation into Somerset  Devon and Wales for another week  We made the mistake of staying at a different hotel when we returned to London that was close to Victoria Station for our Gatwick Express Train ride back to the airport the following day  We stayed at  The Sydney Hotel   Victoria  and it was just horrible  The room was very cramped  unknown stains on the floor and I could literally go to the bathroom and brush my teeth at the same time  We were SO glad that we had our first   days in the Best Western Phoenix and would gladly go back there again on our next visit because they made our stay an awesome one  In fact  the only thing I could fault them on is that the basement dining area is too warm  but you go in have nice quick continental breakfast then you are out and on your way again   still SO well worth the money   A tip when out touring London   make sure to have change    p and   p  for the bathrooms   they charge to use the toilets and the attendants usually don t have change  I had forgotten about that  
P => Outstanding Value for Money  Great Location  Very Clean  Friendly Staff  My husband    yr old son and I stayed at the Phoenix in        We stayed there for   days  I would highly recommend this hotel to travelers who are looking for an affordable  clean hotel in a convenient location without having to pay through their nose  We had a queen bed and had requested a cot for my son which they had ready for us when we checked in  We arrived on an overnight flight and were there prior to check in time  The hotel had a closet where we could store our luggage  used the restrooms  very clean  to wash up  then headed out to sightsee  The location was perfect for us  a brisk     min walk to the Bayswater station  There were all kinds of not too expensive restaurants  a grocery store  Tesco  where we picked up milk for my son  water  sandwiches for lunches on the go  fresh fruit etc  A Boots  ks and Spencer  a laundromat  a film and photo shop  where we downloaded photo images on to CDs  kinda expensive anywhere  so carry sufficient memory   as well as several souvenir shops selling the usual post cards  shot glasses and T shirts  all within easy walking distance  When we returned in the evening from a full day of sightseeing or day trip outside London it was very easy to drop into one of the many restaurants for dinner then walk     mins to the hotel  There were   great chinese places  an Indian restaurant  a Lebanese restaurant  an Egyptian restaurant  a pizza place  a subway  The neighborhood bustled well past midnight but the hotel was tucked away on a quiet street  Our room faced the street yet was not noisy  Room was on the smaller side but that is typical of hotels in Europe  Bathroom was very clean  No problems with maid service  There was no air conditioning but they provided a table fan which worked great  Breakfast was included in the price  The freshly made pot of tea was heaven  Buffet included   different kinds of granola and cereal  yogurt  fresh fruit  orange juice  tea coffee milk  different kinds of bread  croissant  butter and jam  slices of ham and cheese  Try to get there before      to avoid the breakfast crowd  There was also a great coffee and pastry shop just around the corner  Never actually ate there as the we found the b fast at the hotel to be quite adequate We found the front desk staff to be friendly  The     women we interacted with were from eastern europe  very friendly and nice  all spoke fluent english  Happily provided directions or other assistance  The person who worked the evening shift showed me downstairs to their kitchen so I could warm up a glass of milk for my son in the microwave  Even offered to store the carton of milk in their kitchen refrigerator  I regularly warmed up milk in their kitchen microwave and it was never an issue  We had a pleasant experience at the Phoenix  my husband and I still talk about it and we would not hesitate to stay in this hotel again the next time we visit  
P => Great location great price This is a great place to stay  The hotel is only a few minutes walk from Bayswater station but there is no noise from the tube at all as the hotel is situated in a quiet garden square  We stayed in a lovely family room which was split level so our little one was upstairs and we could have some privacy downstairs  Although the hotel did not have any particular things for children we were made very welcome  Breakfast buffet was very good with lots of choice and there was a pleasant little bar in the lounge  Staff were very friendly helpful  All in all a good trip  I would definately recomend this hotel and it is great value for money  
P => Great value  I choose this hotell because of the good reviews here    And they did certainly not lie   great value on this hotel  great service  my room was acually quite big for a single room  always clean everywhere and the breakfirst was great value  the bed was fantastic  almost as good as at home    the location is also great  very quiet neibourhood  good connections from bayswater station and also paddington in close area   next to a biig shopping centre with cinemas   cafes   resturants and shops  all in all   perfect value for your money   i ll be back next time i m in london  period stayed    th may to    june         
P =>  Tiny rooms but great location  This hotel has tiny rooms but is an excellent location  As runners  the proximity of this hotel to Hyde Park was excellent  The underground  Bayswater station  is around the corner and there are a number of local restaurants and shops to choose from  The accomodation is clean and the bathrooms are newly renovated  Whilst the staff are not the friendliest  and can often barely speak English  the hearty breakfasts make up for much  
P =>  We loved the Phoenix My husband and I stayed at the Phoenix for   days in march  We stayed at the hotel based on the reviews we read on this site  It was the best choice in our opinion  Our room was a nice size for the two of us  There is a bar on the main floor that is open after  pm for drinks  continental breakfast is in the morningon the bottom floor  Whitley s shopping mall is at the end of the block  We went here almost every night for a late dinner  resturants open till       depending on the night  My husband fell in love with the italian resturant and their cheesecake on the  rd floor  Also on the  rd floor is an internet cafe that is open till midnight  There is a k  amp  Spencers on the  st floor for groceries and snacks  The bayswater tube station is about   blocks away  The surrounding area is friendly and clean  Kennsington park is   blocks away  Very nice for a leisurely stroll  My husband and I would definately stay here again  Friendly staff and great area  many shops  resturants  pubs  and fast food open till midnight  We loved it  
P =>  Perfect start to holiday My wife and niece stayed at the Phoenix Hotel for   nights just before Christmas      We arrived from Australia at  am and although we weren t due to check in until  pm that afternoon  the hotel let us store our bags in a secure area beside the check in desk  After a great walk around Hyde Park and a look at the London Eye  we returned to the hotel at noon to find that our room was ready for check in The facilities at the hotel are excellent and the room size was perfect for the three of us with the two extra single beds in the loft area  The bathroom facilities were very clean  and the shower was good and hot  The breakfast was also excellent  and very filling  and on some days we didn t need lunch at all  The staff were also very friendly The location near Bayswater tube station is also perfect  and by purchasing an all day tube ticket  we could visit all of London s highlights We also found the area around the hotel to be very safe There are a large number of shops and restaurants near the hotel  including mini supermarkets which stock enough for evening meals  sandwiches  drinks etc  
P => Great location  This hotel was quite lovely and in a great location  Walking distance from Bayswater Tube Station  Had a great weekend in London  We would love to stay here again  Good deal for Central London  
P =>  Good Location From reading the reviews at Trip advisor  I booked the hotel here  Most of the previous comments were right on  A few Pros and consProsvery close to a Whiteley  sp  shopping mall  in case you are into shopping  also within a block of numerous restaurants of all types and pubs  We thought the Standard Indian Restaurant was not touristy and was very good value for the moneyAlso near Kensingston Gardens and Hype Park  so if you are into running or even walking in the park  it is right there Easy access to the Circle line as the Baywater tube station is really close Room was decent size and clean  Staff friendly when asked  even booked transit to Heathrow no complaintsConsThe Breakfast  quot scene quot  was not worth the trouble  we wound up having coffee in a few shops in the Mall Some of the Pubs near by  including the Rat and Parrot  do not allow children  even in the day  I Have no complaints  would stay again 
P =>  Great location We stayed   nights in this clean and well managed hotel  checkin was quick  our room was simple butclean  didn t miss anything except for a larger TV Check out was as quick and easy as well  and therewas no problem to store luggage for a couple of hours since our fligt wasn t until the evening Breakfast was a better than usual contintental  with a friendly and efficient staff  The absolutely bestthing is the location  in a quiet street just in themiddle of everything  A lot of subways and busesjust around the corner  and a lot of great restaurants  We will absolutely stay at this hotelagain  and can absolutely recommend it  
P =>  Great Location Good Value Best Western Phoenix Hotel UK After reviewing this site over and over again  I decided to book us at the Best Western Phoenix in the Bayswater section of London  I really wasn t sure what to expect but  all the reviews were very good  I have to say the majority of the reviews were dead on  This hotel is in a great location  You are only a   minute walk to the tube  Bayswater   Circle Line  and can be to Westminster in    minutes  You are also remarkably close to Paddington Station if you are taking the Heathrow Express  It was only a    minute walk from the Hotel to the station  The rooms were modest and some how we lucked out by getting a triple suite instead of a twin room  We had a room and a loft were the  rd twin was stationed  The room was clean which was all I was looking for a place to shower and sleep  While it could use a little sprucing up  the accomodations were fine for us  The bathroom was a nice size  They had a change on the door for security and I have to say the room was very warm and we needed the window open the entire stay  Breakfast was continental and was ok enough to get you going in the morning without having to spend money By far the best part of this hotel is the location  Queensway is home to a variety of ethnic restaurants  There was chinese  indian  thai  pubs  italian  fast food and cafes  You name it and it was there  It definately made eating at night easy  There is also a mall about     yds from the hotel  They have restaurants on the  rd floor as well  I will give you our best secret  It is called ks and Spencer  If you are looking for a quick snack  water  soda or anything to eat in your room  head there  We purchased   L bottles of water there for   p and if you simply want a sandwich you can get them for             pound  They were great and above all help save a few bucks for dinner My other advice if you are going is to get a tourist tube card  It can save you alot of money everyday if you use the tube  My last piece of advice would be if you are a student or have students  take you student ID  you can save a lot of money by showing it at all the attractions  Good luck and have a great time in London  
P =>  Good value for the money I spent a week at the Phoenix in ruary  This was my second visit in six months  Again I was very pleased with my stay  The room was clean and quiet  The halls were quiet  The breakfast room was efficiently managed  Although the food was simple  it was fresh  I still think that fresh fruit  instead of canned  would raise the level of the breakfast  I love the location  convenient for tube and bus and lots of restaurants and shopping near by  I will definitely stay here on my next visit to London  
P => Every Thing Just Perfect Booking an Hotel in London is not so easy   specialy if you are a bugget travelerI stayed at the phoenix in ch with my girl friend and we found this hotel a great bargain    Great price for a good quality hotel   Every thing was just fine   The picture shown on their web site is what you should expect from your stay   Searching for rewies on this site I had high expectation   that is not very good when you travel    you feal sad or angry when your expectation are not reached      but thank God these expectation were reached  The hotel seamed JUST REFURNISHED     GOOD BREAKFAST  nothing special if you don t buy the english break fast for      pounds  but every thing was fresh   fresh juice every day I m Italian and was fine for me but other traveller could feel tired of the same break fast after     days Just two things they could improve on  Room are not very big    but fine for a stay of     nightsThe lift is very slow    probably because is just one and it is used by the keepers aswell 
P =>   Small rooms but friendly and clean  Friendly hotel with some small pitfalls as mentioned by others  Overall though  if you re not paying full whack  great value in a convenient location  Plenty of restaurants and shops within a minute s walk  Bayswater Underground Station within about   minutes walk  I was happy with the included continental breakfast  which could be upgraded to a max of       for a Full English  Would certainly stay again now I ve been once  
P =>   Convenient cheap clean This is an excellent budget hotel  For its price it is a bargain  in London  The single room is as small as in most London hotels  also in more expensive ones  but space is well organised  so that you don t feel like squeezed in a sardine box  The hotel is perfect for a short stay  if you are not going to spend long time in your room  Linens  carpet  and bathroom were spotless clean  The shower did work well with adequate water pressure and temperature  The only problem was that the room was overheated and a bit stuffy  because the radiator knob didn t seem to work properly  A person from the reception fixed it as soon as I reported the problem  though  The personnel was rather friendly and helpful  though none of them was English  actually  some of them had little knowledge of the language The continental breakfast  choice of cereals  yogurt  croissants  fresh bread  toasts  jam  cheese  ham  is fully satisfactory and is included in the price  while full English breakfast can be had for       The location makes the hotel very convenient for travelling about London  the Bayswater tube station is only   minutes walk from the hotel  There are several restaurants  pubs  internet caf s and shops nearby It must be added  though  that there is no air conditioning  and this may be a problem in the summer  
P =>  good value for money If you re looking for a nice budget hotel with basic services this hotel is an excellent surprise Unlike in many other cities abroad  in London the major problem with hotels of this category    stars or below  is the relative size and cleanness of the rooms compared to the price charged  If you re expecting amenities and spaciousness here  as I read in some previous comments   make peace with the idea that you will have to spend at least     twice as much  Personally  this time my need was to have just a clean  convenient  comfortable place to sleep and possibly have breakfast while leaving my belongings safely kept during my stay  because I would have to spend all day and evenings out and about in town  Room  Single  It was small but bigger than most you d find in similar hotels  the space was used rationally so it didn t give me the beehive impression of some unpleasant experiences of the past  The bed was comfortable  clean linens and covers  two pillows    no bedbugs  The room and the bathroom were spotless  Curtains and carpet clean too  The shower was working properly  with good pressure  and of normal continental size Security  Chain locks on the door and safe boxes downstairs Breakfast  Good  Offered all the basics  juices  milk and yogurt  choice of cereals  cheese and ham  jams and honey  breads and croissants  English breakfast option upon request  not included in buffet   I d suggest not showing up at the last minute or you ll most probably have to queue up  the room will be crowded and the staff busier  The breakfast room  may have small iron bars at the windows  as someone pointed out  but at least this one has good natural light    breakfast rooms of other   stars hotels were in basements lacking windows and fresh air altogether  Location amp Transport  Extremely convenient  I needed to be flexible and independent in order to meet different people in different parts of town and indeed it was never a problem  Besides the tube  look into buses on both ends of Queensway so you ll enjoy additional sights of the city  Note that Queensway tube station is closed until      When I m flying to amp from Heathrow  I personally prefer taking the Express     min only vs almost an hour by tube   Paddinton Hotel  you can either walk    min   grab a black cab       or take one of the many buses  one bus stop journey   The hotel in general is well kept and the staff helpful  
P =>  Lived up to Expectations I read the reviews here before selecting this budget hotel on              for my London stay from          This was my  nd trip to London and the hotel was exactly as the positive reviews described  I stayed at the Ascot not far from this hotel on my first stay   my review is on TripAdvisor   Check in was a breeze and the front desk were cordial  I had a double room that was on the  nd floor  Although compared to American hotels  it was a small room  it was a normal European double room  I wasn t there to lounge about or entertain guests in the room and was only in the room to sleep and shower  I am very meticulous about cleanliness and this room fit the bill  The sheets and towels were changed each day  There were no odd stains on the carpet  curtains or bed linen  The bathroom was sparkling clean and modern with an overhead shower  I was concerned about facing the street but the noise level was fine  The only instance of loudness was a jackhammer at     a m  one morning  but that s normal operating hours for street work anyway so I can t complain  There was a very small tv in the room that I wish were larger but I wasn t in London to watch tv anyway so I didn t mind Regarding safety  the room had a chain lock  which not all European hotels have and a  quot do not disturb quot  sign which was very helpful as maid service made their rounds very early each morning The inclusive brekfast was great  The staff were pleasant and quick to clean the tables as guests waited for tables  It was VERY crowded at the hotel and there was a small wait   of the   days I had breakfast there  but it was included in the price so again  I can t complain  For those who do complain about the menu selection  they are probably used to American hotels and mistakenly expect the same standardization of large breakfasts in European hotels  I had cereal  milk  bread  ham  cheese  juice and tea each day  If I wanted somthing different I could easily have gone to any small cafe or fast food chain around the corner The neighborhood was very lively with a large Middle Eastern community  While there was Internet service in the hotel lobby for a fee  there were several Internet cafes around the corner which I stopped by each day  The only craziness I encountered was Waitangi day which took over the tube for one day so I had no problems taking the bus as an alternate  I plan on staying at this hotel in the future when wanting to stay in London on a budget  
P => Good value and location  Best value in Bayswater  I believe  No frills   e g  no one to open your cab door annd take your bags  but there is an elevator and a good breakfast  Rooms are clean and comfortable  but London size  The twin rooms are bigger than the double bed rooms  and you can move the beds around easily because of their wheels  so we improvised for the sake of a bit more space  Don t use their phones without a card  Their internet is also more expensive than nearby internet cafes  Lots of shops and good restaurants in the area which stay open late    don t miss the Persian restaurant Alounak on Westbourne Grove  
P =>  Average hotel I went to England for two weeks  for all but   of the days I was elsewhere besides London and stayed with friends of mine  But I needed a hotel for the first and last two nights of my trip  The first two I stayed in the Thistle Charing Cross which was much better than the Phoenix cost twice as much  It probably had my expectations higher  I got to the Phoenix and realized the location just wasn t as great  I preferred being in the west end  With the Phoenix you had to take the tube to get pretty much everywhere  One of my biggest problems with the location was that I wanted to go to a club or bar in Leicester Square at night however because the tube stops running at around midnight I would have to find a taxi and pay a lot or take the bus back  I couldn t just walk back in less than   minutes like I could at the Charing Cross  Otherwise the location was fine because the tube got you anywhere As for the room  I got a single room  It was small  but that s fine  I was a solo traveler so I didn t need huge  The bed wasn t great  just average  The room was on the warm side even with the window open  It was pretty clean though  The free breakfast was average   better than nothing as it had breads with all sorts of spreads  cereal  coffee  ham  and some fruit  One thing I noticed is that all the staff was foreign whereas at the Thistle many were British  So some couldn t speak english well  The lady at checkin was rude  So service wasn t great  However  I only paid about      for two nights here  So I can t complain  it was a decent place to stay and if I were to come again and couldn t get the Thistle for that price  I might stay here  
P =>  Worth the small hassles     The RoomI had a single hotel room which  as expected was small   Not tiny but not very big either  The room was very tidy  not only on arrival but every day after the cleaners had gotten in  The bed was comfortable also  The shower pressure however was not only weak  but squirted in every direction but down  The television seemed to be mistuned  with no satellite available  there was no radio in the room  I ended up leaving one there I had purchased for the next guest  and what point is it having a Kettle if the jug doesn t fit into the bathroom sink to be filled up  Also  a toilet right next to a huge window which meant  if using the toilet with the light on  EVERYONE outside could see through the mesh curtain The LocationI dont think you could ask for a better location    block from the Bayswater tube station    blocks from Kensington Gardens Hyde Park and heaps of shops and restaurants nearby The PriceThe price was fantastic  I got a deal from another website which meant I got this hotel for less than other  obviously nastier places The StaffMany of the staff didnt seem terribly interested in being helpful at all  I had to ask   different waitresses in the restaurant how I ordered something from the menu for breakfast and was each time either told to wait and forgotten about  or in   case just had a finger held up to me to wait  I was quite shocked by it  The bar staff however  were very nice  and keen to start conversations The Other stuffThere was building going on in the building next door which  unfortunately started at   every morning and involved drilling and nailing directly against the wall my bedhead was at  Not the hotels fault  just something to be aware of if your in a room near the far end of the building  Luggage storage is free which was handy  Laundry service however was INCREDIBLY overpriced  Im used to staying in places where there is a laundry in the hotel you can use yourself  From memory it was around the   pound mark for a single sweatshirt  Use the laundromat around the corner  Much cheaper and only takes about    minutes of your time  
P =>  Highly recommended What a great bargain find  The posts about this hotel are all correct  I had prepared myself for a tiny European room  however  my room here was more than ample and perhaps only a touch smaller than comparable hotels here in the states  The staff was extremely friendly The hotel does not provide safes in the room  but the front desk will assign you a safe deposit box free of charge  which rivals a bank safe deposit box  You have a key and the receptionist has a key and you need both to access the box Breakfast was good and plentiful but did get a bit tiresome after a week  It included   varieties of rolls  butter  jams  nuetella  hot tea  coffee  toast  yogurt  fruits  cheese  and ham The neighborhood is superb  The hotel is literally a few buildings down from a Mall  Whitely s  and on Queensway there are a ton of restaurants  both fast food and nicer ones  as well as a Boots  drug store   and   Tesco s  There is also a M amp S in the mall The Bayswater tube stop is at most a    minute walk away and its through the commericial areas so even walking late at night is not a problem No complaints about the bed furniture or the maid service  Everything was perfect  and considering the price  this is truely a great buy Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a safe  clean  quiet  cheap not fancy hotel  
P => Great Bargain Comfortable  spacious  quiet rooms  Triple room had a separate loft area for the third bed with separate TV  Quality breakfast with cold meats  cereals  pastries  etc  No lunch or dinner served on premises but   block from a variety of restaurants    blocks from the Bayswater subway    block from an indoor mall  Internet access is available in lobby for a small fee  Able to check in at   am to stash our bags as our flight arrived early in the morning  Highly recommended  
P =>  Excellent value for money At     per night for a twin room  including breakfast  this is a great London hotel  The room was tiny   we had to edge round one of the beds to get into the bathroom   but it was quiet  clean and comfortable  Staff were friendly and helpful  
P =>  Great location great room The Best Western Phoenix Hotel is very centrally located  off of Queensway  a lively street with restaurants of all kinds of different foods  Chinese  Japanese  Indian  Italian  Fast food  etc  There are convenience stores there too  so if you need bottled water  juices  or snacks  you ll find them there  There is also a shopping center on the corner  Whiteley s which has many stores  good restaurants  and an easyInternetCafe  which is open until very late  so you can keep in touch with your family friends back home  The Underground station Bayswater is a short walk from the hotel  so you can get anywhere from there  There is a lot of security in all the Underground Stations  so we felt very safe coming back late  The room itself is small  but very clean  The bathroom has good size and the morning breakfast is good  cereals  yogurts  juices  coffee  tea  breads and spreads   All in all  we had a great stay at this hotel  and we would certainly go back there again  
P => Good Value We booked in advance from Bestwestern com  and got an excellent rate     GBP per night per room   all in   Location  excellent  short walk from the Bayswater tube station and Whiteleys shopping centre  This is a big shopping centre with many brand name stores  which we didn t discover until the last day of our stay  When we got there  they gave us a room with twin beds instead of double as per our reservation  We were told they don t have a double room available until the following day  So we  honeymooners were stuck with twin beds for the first night The twin bed room  no fan so the window has to be open and it was very noisy at night  Room is small  basic but clean  Mattress is a little soft We got moved to a double room the following day and what a difference  Better bed  more room and there was a fan in the room  Included breakfast was above average  
P => Great Place to Stay We stayed in London for   nights and booked this hotel based on the reviews I read stressing the value  I couldn t agree more We got a very clean  large double room at a very good price  expedia   Rooms can be very expensive in London  so it would be foolish to stay anywhere else  The breakfast buffet  included in room price  is a good way to start off the day  Typical buffet food  bread  cheese  cereals  etc    The hotel is located in a quiet neighborhood  but just off a busy street so lots of restaurants  internet cafes  pubs  shopping mall are accessible by foot Furthermore  the tube station Bayswater is a very short walk away so you can access all the sites from there We re all looking for a good clean hotel in a quiet neighborhood at a resonable price  This hotel fits the bill  
P =>  Excellent Value I have stayed in many hotels in London and the Phoenix Hotel  located in the Bayswater s area  is excellent value The rooms are pleasantly decorated  with modern tiled bathrooms and are very clean  The beds are very comfortable as well  Nothing terrible fancy but none the less very pleasing  The staff are accomodating  the continental breakfast  included in the room price  is more than ample and served in a pleasant breakfast room The location is just a short walk from the Bayswater tube station and there are many shops  including the all important Tesco s  on the main thoroughfare  Queensway  The Whiteley s Shopping Centre is located at the end of the street  There is also internet access  located in a sitting room just off the main lobby   nominal fee  and a little bar as well with a couple of nice seating areas  There is an elevator in this hotel  big plus The only drawback is the lack of air conditioning in the hotel main areas and the rooms themselves  This did not pose a problem as the weather was very mild but might if one was staying during the summer months  On the plus side  though located just off the main road  Queensway  the hotel and surrounding areas are very quiet and quite pleasant  All in all a very good value for one s money In future I would not hesitate to book again with them  
P =>   Nice hotel I spent   nights at the Best Western Phoenix Hotel Located in Bayswater area of London  at     meters from Bayswater Tube Station and three stations for Earls Court Convention Center  The staff were pleasant and very helpful  Room was small but comfortable  no air conditioned The whole hotel is in mint condition and very clean The bathroom was almost new with large quantity of towels  The continental breakfast included in rate  GBP        had a good selection of cereals  cheese  ham  several rolls and breads  juices  coffee and tea Restaurant with excellent service and very clean Wireless internet worked only at the lobby area where a nice lounge allowsto take break after seeing London It is surrounded by restaurants  stores and a shopping mall and at walkdistance of Notting Hill and the park I highly recommend this hotel  
P =>  Great Hotel Clean and Comfortabel Just came home from a four day trip to london  We booked two double rooms in advance for only      Euro Night person room We got very got value for our money  The rooms are very clean  large enough and very quite  Staff is friendly and helpfull Had some drinks at the bar in the night  and the usually close at   o clock in the morning  But we asked and they helped with drinks much longer  I can recommend the hotel to everybody  Breakfast is OK as well  did not expect more  and you can eat as much as you like  
P =>  Good Hotel for Money Just returned from London  spent   nights at the Phoenix and for the most part we were pleased  Yes the rooms are small  but I understand most are in the area   the rooms are clean and cosy  No AC but open the window during the day and use the fan at night  if a hot day in Summer  get a hotel with AC if you must  Location is excellent  very multi cultural  close to the tube  and shops  pubs  and lovely indian food  Staff are ok  english is not their first language but no problems to report  The pillows were very hard  we asked them to change ours for us and they did  The reason the pillows were hard is that they are new pillows   good sign  Nice little Bar area and after a long day  a cold beer is just what you need to relax from touring  Food   the continental breakfast is one of the best I ve seen   better than most in Canada or US  Lots of selection  and the tea is great  Price of hotel is good  we would have preferred AC  I guess we are spoiled  One final note  the bathroom is small  but modern and managable  if you plan to spend a lot of time in the room don t stay here pay several     more or stay home  Good value for money  Would stay again  
P => Loved the Phoenix This was a lovely hotel  Unbelieveable location    Whitely s Shopping Centre at the top of the street  less than     block  and great bus service  The Bayswater Tube Station is just around the corner  While the rooms are very small  they are extremely clean as is the whole hotel  Very comfortable  While the continental breakfast is basic  it is plentiful  This hotel is very good value 
P =>  wonderful locationclean and elegant lounge area I visit London regularly and usually battle to find a hotel with a good location that is also very clean with an elegant ambiance at a very resonable price  The Phoenix provided all of this  I will most surely stay there again  Be careful that you ask for a room that does not face the main road  Friends that i travelled with got such rooms and they found it very noisy  I had a room that faced away and never heard a thing  The breakfast restuarant is pleasant but the food very plain  
P =>  Great Spot I would not hesitate to recommend this property  The location is excellent   just off Queensway in Bayswater within minutes of the Underground and bus routes  Service was very good and staff accommodating  Breaksfast is all you can eat and very high quality  Rates are excellent  So much higher standard than some of the older  more down at heel hotels in Paddington  but priced realistically  
P =>  a pleasant stay We had a nice room  Every day cleaness The breakfast was very good The hotel is about     metres from tube station Bayswater and about     metres from Whiteleys  a great shopping centre We had a room on the streetsite but it was rather quit We stayed for four nights and have a great stay in London Good service in Phoenix hotel 
P =>  Very good hotel  The hotel was very clean and comfortable although our double room was quite small  Bathroom was excellent  Nice location and everything  I would definetly stay there again  
P =>  Great Location   Good People We stayed in a spacious family room for   days in e  The staff was very kind and helpful  The location is excellent   close to Bayswater underground  small shops restaurants  The neighborhood is supprisingly quiet  My only complaint and this comes from a spoiled American   no air conditioning   This is not uncommon in London   Our stay was during an unusual heat wave  While the hotel gave us a fan  our room on the  th floor was uncomfortable until the weather broke  We would definitely stay at The Phoenix again   
P =>  I would stay there again without a second thought I had never stayed in London before  and was warned that the rooms would be small  and a three or four star hotel meant nothing  but this hotel was more than I had expected  I had a great experience  and the next time I visit London  I would not hesitate to stay here again  I was traveling alone  and my room was perfect for just me  and the staff was very helpful with suggestions of where  what to do for nightlife  getting around  etc  The breakfast  included  was more than I expected  Great area  with great restauraunts  shops  close to the tube stations  Thumbs way up for the Phoenix  
P => great hotel  My husband and I stayed at the Phoenix in Bayswater               I got an awesome rate of    pounds per nigt  inclusive of the VAT  at hotels london  This was half the price quoted at all the other popular hotel reservations sites  The hotel was within   blocks  maybe a   minute walk  to the Bayswater tube stop  exit the tube  turn left  turn left at the mall gallery  and the hotel is a short block down on the left    Because our flight arrived at      AM  we were at the hotel well before check in time  however  our room was quickly prepared so we could drop our bags and head out  I was nervous about the size of the room after reading reviews about all the London hotels  but the size was just fine for sleeping and decompressing  It had large windows that overlooked the small square  No AC here  so I would hesitate about staying here in warm weather  The street was quiet  and we slept one night with the windows open  something I couldn t imagine doing in a big city  The bathroom was in almost new condition with mable tiles  Very clean and comfortable  The continental breakfast is exactly how it was described here  predicatable  However  since our trip took us all over Europe  we found that every hotel has virtually the same continental breakfast  bread rolls croissant  ham  cheese  cereals  milk  juices  coffee  fruit  usually canned   yogurt  The difference here was the presentation  At the Phoenix  you were seated in the restaurant area with beautifully set tables  and you made your way to the buffet room  Empty plates were cleared immediately  Very nice  As is the US custom  we thought we should tip the waitresses  however no one else was  We found out from our European friends that tipping is different in Europe  Most include the tip in the check  and if you would like  you can leave an extra Pound or Euro  Tip  look at your bill in London to see if the tip has been added  Tour tickets are sold at the hotel lobby desk for the same prices as at the attractions themselves  so save time and get them at the hotel if you don t have a London Pass   We found the Phonix hotel to be clean and well kept for such an old building  The staff was very professional  too  The neighborhood was packed with small restaurants of every kind  and cheap internet access was easy to find  at about   Pound an hour  I have recommended this hotel to my friends and family and would stay here again fall spring  It is a great location  so close to everything  quiet  clean  and a professional staff  
P =>  Highly recommended Stayed twice in il on business  Once had double bed  once single  Though not large  rooms were clean  breakfast great and location in Bayswater excellent  For the price  best hotel I have stayed at in London   and I spend alot of time looking for good chear   star hotels wordwide Richard  New York 
P =>  Perfect Place to Stay     I stayed here for   days in il and it was a great deal  I payed   GBP on the weeknights and   GBP on the weekends and it was worth every bit  I stayed in a single room but was given a double bed at no extra charge  The rooms are small  but not any different than what I expected  The bathroom had a nice warm shower and a sink and toilet with a small heater next to it  which I never used   My room had a hair dryer and tv and my window over looked a quite street alongside the hotel  It s very centrally located  only a block away from the Bayswater tube stop and has shops all around it  but is far enough of the main street to miss the noise  The staff did their job but weren t overly enthusiastic which is my only small complaint  The breakfast was ample and I ended up skipping a few to go to the French Patisserie just down the street for some wonderful treats  My room was cleaned every day and I got fresh towels  The newspaper was outside my door every morning  It was perfect for what I needed it for and I had plenty of pillows and blankets and the bed was SO comfortable  In fact  one of may favorite parts of my trip was waking up to British TV and lazing around in my bed  Very nice hotel and well worth the price  I d go back anytime  
P => Quite Surprised With This Hotel I just spent   nights at the Best Western Phoenix Hotel in Bayswater area of London  I had read the reviews for this hotel and the majority were good  I was quite pleased with this hotel overall  It is in a very good location  a   minute walk from the Bayswater Tube Station and a    minute walk from the Queensway Tube Station  I had a single room  and yes it was small  but all hotel rooms in London are on the small side  It was tastefully decorated in neutral colors and clean  The bathroom was of good size for a single room and looked almost new  The towels were big and fluffy and the water pressure was excellent  I had no limitation of hot water either  I only had a shower without a tub though  which was a little disappointing as I like to take hot baths I had friends who stayed in a family or triple room  They had a very large bathroom with a tub that was very suitable for taking a soak in the tub  Their room was very spacious and was easy for   guys to move around in The continental breakfast that comes with the price of the room was filling  I have seen continental breakfast offered at a   star hotel I have stayed at in London that was worse  You had a selection of cereals  cheese and ham  several rolls and breads to choose from  Coffee and or tea  and juice  The service was good as well The staff at the front desk were pleasant and very helpful  You can purchase tickets from them for the open bus tours or just about anything you would like to see in London for the same price you would pay once you got to the exhibit  If you purchase from the desk  then you do not have to stand online  We did this for the Tower of London and saved us standing online  We walked straight to the will call window and picked up our ticket They have a small bar lounge area and we enjoyed sitting there after a long day walking around seeing London  It was very pleasant and less smokey than a pub  There are some very good reastaurants in the area around the hotel  there is an indoor shopping mall across from the hotel All in all  I say this is a very good hotel to stay at and I would put it on my short list of hotels to stay at in London  The price for a double was    pounds per night  The only drawback is they do not have air conditioning and I would hesitate to stay there in the summer  The front of the hotel looks out over Kensington Square  
P =>  Good hotel convenient location I stayed at the Phoenix for   nights in ust      and found it to be a convenient and comfortable base  It is nice and close to the underground as well as food outlets in Bayswater  The surrounding area gets busy and noisy during the Notting Hill carnival but the Phoenix is just far enough off the main drag to avoid most of it  The bed was quite comfrtable  I do agree with one previous reviewer about the condition of the iron cord  My only gripe was  being in a non smoking room  that whenever someone nearby smoked it came straight through the exhuast fan vent in my room  
P => Just What I Was Looking For I stayed at the Phoenix for   nights in mid uary and it was just what I wanted  clean  comfortable  convenient and reasonably priced  I chose it based largely on the reviews here and so I thank those that reviewed it previously    it was just as advertised  I was traveling alone but opted for a double room which was worth the bit extra  Bathroom was spotless and looked newly renovated  Plenty of hot water and water pressure  Breakfast was sufficient to get one going in the morning and that was all I asked of it  Extremely convenient  Bayswater tube station just around the corner  Circle and District lines  and Queensway station  Central line  another block futher along  Lots of restaurants and shops along Queensway and short walk to Notting Hill neighborhood  Although Queensway is a busy street  the hotel is on a quiet square just off of it  I had a room on the top floor which overlooked the square and was never bothered by noise  It s not a super posh neighborhood but I always felt safe  even when coming home from theatre  Even with the dollar in the tank  I felt I got my money s worth  
P =>  A pleasant hotel room at last  On the   th of uary       I arrived at the hotel lobby before   a m  for an overnight stay  Though I was too early  I was allowed by the frieindly staff to check in into a non smoking room I was very pleased with this level of service  Thank you Room  bath  and the inner decor were clean and pleasant and its definitely worth for the price you pay  Checked out early and therefore  couldn t comment on the breakfast  However  by seeing the bar  amp  the breakfast room gave me a good impression  Hotel location is pefect very near to Bayswater Queensway Tube  Either for the elderly visitors  or for the lonely female travellers  this hotel is idealas it is within easy walking distance from the tube  safe  and always people passing by even at late night  T V   amp  Toilet was small though clean and functional  It did not bother me  This hotel will give you a business like hotel feeling and it gives you a good value  Thanks for reading my review and hope you willfind it helpful for your next London visit  
P =>  Very satisfied  We stayed here in early uary for three days  It was perfect for us  The hotel was very comfortable and quiet  small bathroom but very clean and well stocked   the staff was helpful  the location couldn t have been better and they provided a good breakfast  There are many good restaurants nearby as well as small stores and the subway  I would definitely stay here again and thought the price was very reasonable for the location  
P =>  girls weekend We ve just got back  and we fully enjoyed our visit  Hotel location is great  restaurants  pubs and shops nearby  And easy connections in to the city  The Hotel is great  It was clean and the breakfast is enough to start the day with  The room was on the small side but not bad at all  The staff are very friendly and the barmaid makes the best cappuccino   Thanks   we ll be back  
P =>  Very nice accommodations I travel to London often and usually stay in same hotel in Bloomsbury  The most recent trip I stayed at the Best Western Phoenix in Baywater and was very pleased with the room and service  The Breakfast room was bright and cheerful  there was plenty of hot water in the room  and the the staff was very courteous  The rooms were average size for a London hotel with two twins  desk  nightstand  closet  small tv and a nice bathroom  It is located in a busy area of town but the noise was minimal even with the window open  I definately recommend this hotel for it s affordability  location and accommodations  
P =>  Tiny room but good quality facilities and service Excellent Location     mins walk to Queensway or or Bayswater tube stations  Kensington Gardens  Queensway Shops  I guess I must have had one of the worst rooms in the Hotel as it was on the basement level and had a window of a brick wall and some wire fencing  and the room shower was tiny  luxury if you re an ompa lompa LOL  But it was still clean had tv  tea coffee kettle  nice hot high pressure shower  clean floor and beds and breakfast is included with very affordable rates Not too shabby  
P => Nice hotel and great location This hotel was nice and clean  Our room was pretty big and very comfortable  though the bathroom was tiny  The staff was friendly and helpful  we actually extended our stay and they were extremely accomadating  Overall the hotel was very nice  The area was really the best thing about this hotel  It is close to the Bayswater and Queensway Underground stops  which was nice for sightseeing  and getting to central London  However  most nights we stayed close to the hotel because there was so much for us to do there  There are many pubs and restarants within walking distance  one in particular was the Troller Hut  which has excellent food  entertainment and wonderful people  
P =>  Good Choice for Reasonable London Hotel We stayed at the BW Pheonix for two stints of two night on our recent Europe trip in tember  The Pheonix is a clean  reasonably priced choice in a very good location and we recommend it  Staff  Mostly friendly and fairly helpful  They accomadated a room change our first stay  The hotel is the typical European  leave your key at the desk  deal Room Hotel  The Pheonix is the common Georgian townhouse conversion and fairly good sized  The lobby is pleasant and clean  Our first room was typically London sized  small  but fairly well furnished with newer furniture  The bathroom was very nice and recently remodeled  No AC but a fan was provided  No iron in the room  probably can request one   Tea coffee  and small TV with usual channels  A morning Paper is a perk  Our  nd room was again clean with a new bathroom  But    almost ridiculously small  There is basically the bed and about        ft around it  We travel light and there was no place to open our bags  Anyone with actual suitcases would be in big trouble  The size of the room was frankly very irritating  We were going to request a change but looking at the fire escape floorplan it looked like most other rooms were similar in size  I think we lucked out our first stay  The room with two twin beds as opposed to one double we were originally put in was much bigger  Location  Very good  The hotel is right off Queensway and a very short walk to the Bayswater tube  approx   min   and a couple more blocks to Queensway  Then a   min ride to the West End  Queensway itself is buzzing late and thus feels safe walking to the hotel around midnight  am  Overall  Recommended given the quality of rooms  location  and reasonable price              However  you might be in for a squeeze  even by London standards   
P =>  good The location of this hotel is good beauseboth Basewater circle  and Queensway cent  are available Although I am not good at speaking English staffs are very kind Plus price is not so expensive in spite of London  
P => Excellent Location We stayed at the Phoenix for   nights in late ust  The location is excellent  The Phoenix Hotel is only a block from the main street  Queensway  Whiteley s Mall  with its food court and ks and Spencers grocery store is a block away  Bayswater is a great multi ethnic neighborhood with plenty of restaurants and shops and activity  The Bayswater tube station is about a short   block walk  and the Queensway tube station only another block or so further  An internet cafe is only a block or so away on Queensway  We had a triple room on the first floor and found it to be spacious and clean  The high ceilings made it seem even larger  Since it was a bit humid  we asked for a fan and it was delivered to our room in a short time  The bathroom was small but sufficient and very clean  It was restocked every day with shampoo and bath gel  The included breakfast consisted of cold cereal  croissants  ham  cheese  yogurt  fruit and assorted rolls  It was the same every day but nicely presented in a breakfast room in the basement  We will definitely stay here again on our next trip to London  The location is perfect  The only reason I didn t give the Phoenix a   rating was the breakfast  It could stand a little more variety since it tends to get a bit monotonous after the  nd day  Other than that  we highly recommend the Phoenix  
P =>  Great value for the price I stayed at the  Best Western  Phoenix Hotel on     Kensington Gardens Square for   nights in y       On arrival the lift was being serviced but a member of staff cheerfully     carried my heavy bag up three flights of stairs  The rest of my stay the lift worked fine  Desk staff were friendly  but couldn t help with some tourist type questions   Had single room on  rd  US  th  floor  Excellent en suite facilities  small room size typical of London  I ve stayed in smaller rooms    Breakfast fine  both continental and  quot cooked quot  options   Easy walk to two different tube lines  good restaurants and shopping too  I travel to London every couple of years and would definitely stay here again if the price remains comparable  
P =>  good hotel in a good neigbourhood We stayed her one week in june       We had no troubles at all  The elevator worked  the clock worked and also the tv worked  A lot of water pressure  hot water and every day new soap and shampoo  Even new bed sheets every   days  The breakfast is ok  there is enough of everything  but yes it is every day the same stuff The can be some noise on the street but nothing to really worry about for London standards But the best is the location  near the   tube stations Bayswater and Queensway  A lot of restaurants and shops in the neigborhood  If you want to be in a green parc  Kensington Gardens at a five minute walk  So we were happy with it and will go back when we come to London again  
P =>  Stayed there in       thought it was a good hotel for the price  clean if not spacious  had nice gathering areas  good location  very convient to two tube stops and across from a mall with a few shops  restaurants and a movie theater  
P =>  You get what you pay for The main advantages of the Phoenix are that it is inexpensive and that it is conveniently located  Anyone who stays here expecting anything other than a typical London budget hotel will probably be disappointed    the rooms are small  the breakfast is minimal  etc  The bathroom in my room was quite adequate by London hotel standards  I found the staff to be quite pleasant  I stayed there in ch  and would probably be willing to stay there again if I were travelling to London on a budget    but since the rooms are not air conditioned  I d probably think twice about staying there in summer  
P =>  Reasonable price made it a good choice  I stayed here for three nights at the end of ch in a single room  I have stayed in London a few times before and the room size seemed comparable to other single rooms I have stayed in  I choose this place based on the reviews from tripadvisor and because I found a good rate for the place on a London hotels web site    GBP per night  I had to laugh when I returned home and saw that some of the reviews that have been a bit more mixed in recent weeks  As I was having similar thoughts about the hotel  Here are what I thought were the best points  Great location  close to many shops and resturants  I felt safe walking at night back from the tube to the hotel as there were lots of people still walking the streets  even as late as   pm  The room seemed clean and as I mentioned earlier  the price was very good  The room appeared clean  ironically  the wall clock in my room also needed a new battery  The bathroom was small but typical of London  I did  however  get sprayed a few times by the facet sink  as it could only be turned on very lightly  almost a dribble  or the water bounced off the small sink and hit the person in front of the sink  While breakfast was free  it was pretty bland and appeared of low quality  And the breakfast staff seemed overwhelmed and while not unpleasant  they did seem joyless in their work  I would stay here again if I was able to secure a reasonable rate but at the same time will keep an eye out for other possibilities  Perhaps back to bed and breakfasts  once a person has enjoyed a well cooked English breakfast it is hard to not want the same quality again  But I would recommend this hotel  especially for women travelling alone who need a budget choice  
P =>  Acceptable and satisfactory My wife and I stayed in this hotel for three nights in ember      and had a good time  Yes  the elevator had problems when we were there  Bad start  but it got better  We got here on a cold  rainy day and were happy to find a warm hotel with friendly staff  When we got to our room  we found it to be clean and fine  Nothing fancy  but no complaints  either  The room was kind of stuffy  but an open window took care of that  Heater worked great and we had no cigarette smell troubles The room was fine for two people  not big  but not bad either  No airco  but who needs it in ember  The clock didn t work  but who cares  The colour TV worked fine  but who cares when you re in London  There was a water boiler in the closet  which was clean and worked great  The bathroom was not huge  but again  not too small either and was clean and fitted all our stuff  Warm water and plenty of water pressure We stayed on the third floor  second for Europeans  and were at the front of the hotel  So  we had a beautiful view of the park in front  Since this area has lots of hotels  people walk by a lot  but it didn t bother us and we found the area tranquil  Breakfast was the same everyday  but was good and not less than many of the other hotels that I ve used  The area is fantastic as the hotel is located just a minute away from the tube  Bayswater   You can get to Paddington Station and from there to Heathrow super easily  The same place is packed with shops  eating places  fast food  regular  and there is an evening store across from the underground  Perfect for when you come back late and hungry  Whitelys is even closer and that was perfect as well  Whitelys is a beautiful mall with tons of shops  clothes  food  books  music  where we stopped by many times  to pick up our lunch  muffins at Starbucks    Notting Hill is very close by and it doesn t take long to get to any of the tourist sites from here To make a long story short  the hotel isn t great or flashy  If you are in London as a tourist for a couple of days and can take a few setbacks here and there  it is a fine place to stay  
P =>  Good place to stay Reasonably priced  clean  attentive staff  great location  wonderful neighbourhood  For those with back problems  the bed was comfy   firm mattress  Nothing luxurious  but good value for money  Be prepared for small rooms  Buy room using online discounts  
P =>  Not so bad not so good I stayed here for   nights  Read the reviews on this site before booking and found them mostly accurate  if a little optimistic  I was travelling alone  and booked a single room  Yes  it was tiny  Wee  Miniscule  Carpet was threadbare and stained in places  water damage to wallpaper and carpet in one corner  Although I had requested a non smoking room  my room had an ashtray in it  although it didn t smell of smoke  and my neighbors smoked  My room was on the fourth floor  with a lovely view over the square  Mostly pretty quiet at night  although since I live in a big city I might not be as sensitive to noise as others  The room was extremely clean     and I m picky  Bathroom  also tiny  was spotless and the shower had good water pressure and ample hot water  I had no trouble getting an extra pillow and batteries for the TV remote  Never ate breakfast  so can t comment on that  Elevator is a little scary  clunky   No peephole or deadbolt on room door  Location is good  close to two tube stations and within easy walking distance of tons of restaurants and shops  Would I stay here again  Yes  but if I could find something better maintained at the same low price  I d stay there instead  
P =>  Very Disappointing We booked into the Phoenix Hotel recently for   nights as an Easter break  I can t really comment on the facilities in detail as  on our arrival  we felt our room was so depressing that we immediately booked into another local Hotel and left  We also had a teenager staying with us  The single  small  portable television in the room was in the  quot loft quot  area  Were we all supposed to cosy up together on the single bed to watch TV   The furnishings and bed linen also looked extremely drab  I agree with the previous reviewer that this Hotel is certainly not to be recommended  I am amazed that this is rated as a    facility  There are much better Hotels in the area at about the same cost which are significantly more comfortable and welcoming  
P =>  Convenient but Lacking Big Time I stayed at this hotel for five nights the week before Easter  booked by a travel agent  After reading the reviews here I thought it would be a great hotel  Although a convenient location  great shops  and the tube so close  the hotel lacked quite a bit  I ve stayed in other London hotels  and yes there are the horror stories  but some of these reviews pump this hotel up more than it deserves and can misdirect someone  There were two of us and a teenager in a room that overlooked the side roof area with a dismal view of London and the hotel pipes and no where to put luggage became very frustrating  The small loft area was really a nusiance  Although clean   even though the maid cleaned in her barefeet  it was tiring to leave notes to keep the screenless windows locked and shut and not wide open  Even that didn t help  and every day we would return to wonder if our belongings were gone  I finally put a travel lock on it so she would stop opening them  Doors paper thin and two nights running a group had their doors open into the hallway directly across from us  smoking and carrying on till  AM   amp  knocking on our door  Don t bother calling the front desk  seems they think you are the bother  And if you need an electrical outlet to charge anything  well  expect one usuable outlet which you have to crawl under the desk to get to after unplugging the fading black and white TV   The daily breakfast gets old after the first day  no changes  and not much choice   Great pastry shop around the corner  and plenty of restarants in the mall across the street   Elevator broke two times we were there  and yes  it was when we needn t it to carry the luggage up the stairs  Some staff were helpful  however  don t ask for an iron  because you have to pick it up at the desk  and the cord is so frayed that using it looked hazardous  I thought I caused a meltdown when I asked for a battery for the one wall clock in the room that I guess hadn t been running for awhile  I also had to bring that down and put it back up myself  They have no means   or they tell you that  to hold luggage  and if you arrive when a tour group does  there is no room in their small lobby to even stand  The hotel is inexpensive by London standards  however  they will up the rate on weekends on you even if you have a package deal with a travel agent  We checked out a day early  drove to Bradford on Avon  and stayed at a bed and breakfast that was beautiful  Cheaper  cleaner  safer  and the staff much better  Sometimes spending the few extra dollars to upgrade to a safer and fresher hotel is worth it when you are exhausted and traveling with a teenager  If in a pinch  this hotel is worth the convience  however  any more than two days and it becomes downright depressing  
P =>  Have Been Back Again And Again I travel to London approximately twice a year  Have been doing that now for five years  With the Phoenix  I finally found MY hotel  It is the right combination of location  price  ambiance and facilities Usually travel solo  and have to admit that the singles are very small  They are clean and comfortable  though  and I have no complain about the bathrooms and showers  The included breakfast is more than satisfactory It is the location that is awesome  It is one block form Queensway  in the Bayswater area  It is on a usually quite residential square  weekends late at night can be a bit loud  but this is true just about anywhere  One block away is Whitley s Shopping Center  which is similar to any American mall except it is in an old factory  There is a ks and Spencer store that is     grocery  There is another supermarket around the corner  Queensway has many restaurants  small shops  newstands  fast food  etc  Other restaurants  pubs and such are on a nearby cross street  The Bayswater and Queensway tube stations are about two and four blocks away  Hyde Park is four blocks away  All in all  tremendous One last comment  Nearby  on Queensway  is the Four Seasons Chinese Restaurant  The best Roast Duck I have ever had  and I m from the New York area

P =>  Perfect Location  We stayed at the Best Western Shaftesbury Hotel last week for one night after seeing Grease the Musical  Definately shop around for the best price before booking  We saw price ranges from      plus per night down to          We booked a superior room  with breakfast for        We arrived at the hotel at around  pm  after a short walk from the tube and were delighted to find room was ready  Staff very helpful and friendly  Room was average size  but very clean and well equipped  Mini Bar  Internet acess  free   Ironing board with Iron and a tv in the bathroom  Although we didnt use it  the room service menu looked very comprehensive  Why have room service though when restaurants nearby are open till  am   We loved being so close to Piccadilly  Regent Street  Oxford Street  China Town and all the theatres  It was great being able to walk to all the attractions and not rely on tubes etc Our room overlooked a church courtyard and with the windows open we could hear all the street noises   I loved it   church bells and lots of sirens  Windows and double glazing in place we heard nothing and slept soundly Breakfast was in a basement resturant  very clean  but I wouldnt book breakfast again  Nothing wrong with it  just not to my taste  and many more options close by  We checked out at   am  could stay till midday  and the hotel kindly offered to store our luggage while we explored more We will definately stay here again  Location  Service and Value make it worthwhile  There are so many theatre shows we saw advertised we want to see    
P =>  Fantastic for fun break in London This hotel is right in the heart of Piccadilly Circus  It is quite cramped inside but the rooms were fabulous  We paid     B B which was very good I thought for staying in London  Walking distance from all the theaters and right by a Tube Station  Staff were so friendly  most friendly staff I have encountered for a long time  
P =>  Satisfactory I stayed there for a few nights in a solo room It was kind of small  but however nice and tidy  Shower facilities seemed top notch The lounge in the hotel was very nice and decorated with turquoise elements  Staff was one of the nicest and most competent I ve seen Good price to quality ratio as it s located in the center of London Thumbs up for free  amp  fast Internet connection  
P =>  cosy hotel   made us happy  A very cosy and welcoming hotel in a nice area of London  Definately great value   the best I ve seen in central London for that price  Was mostly clean and very well furbished  Had everything we needed  Staff were all friendly and helpful  Would definately want to stay there again  We loved it  As for the train noises    that was ignorable     
P =>  Small Rooms yet nicely refurbished   In have stayed here twice on business  and the reason being more central hotels were far too expensive due to Wimbleton  The rooms are very small  breakfast was basic yet adequete and I couldn t stay her with my wife and child due to the rooms sizes  Yet it Is isn t far from Paddington tube  so you can get around quite easily  and the rooms have been refurbished nicely Fine for a single traveller  
P =>   Great business hotel Stayed here quite a few times due to the great location near to Earls Court tube  District line and Picadilly line The rooms are perfectly adequate and bathrooms are a good size Can t really ask for much more at the price I paid  
P =>   Surprisingly good for the price Picked up a lastminute com offer and at      for the night next to Piccadilly Circus my expectations were low for our one night Friday night stay We were fortunate enough to bag a top floor room though  and have to say it was clean  a decent size and had all the necessaries  flat screen tv  minibar  couch  etc   Bathroom was a decent size  shower only  The only problem is that Shaftesbury avenue isn t the place to get some sleep on a Friday night   I think the bar opposite closed around  am  then there were sirens  and we finally woke up properly  having slept  at     am  Good job it wasn t an early start  No New York style escape with a   th floor room here  Location is faultless for central London  even Flat White in Berwick Street  Soho is   minutes walk for breakfast  Must say that the reviewer who said it was  quot   minutes walk from Paddington station quot  has either never been to London  got the wrong hotel  got the wrong station  or is on drugs   It s probably   minute walk North West of Charing Cross  Nearest tube would be Leicester Square  We parked in the NCP   minutes walk  in Chinatown  Very narrow  as is usual with parking in London and around     for the   hr period  Much less if you got away before  am  but then we would only have had  hrs sleep  Sounds as if you need to be lucky with rooms  and also that the lift needs to be working   which is was when we stayed  Strangely enough our room cards weren t working either  maybe the system is a little ropey  Finally I found the staff pretty helpful and very polite  Very good English too  a rarity nowadays in places   
P =>   ok Slighty out of the way from the hustle abd bustle  A quick    min walk to the tube stationNice local restaurants and shops Hotel staff very helpful and dealt with problems promptly   key card problem All in all cheap and cheerful 
P =>  Great stay  I got this hotel booked through Thomas Cook under a football game package  The room was big and pretty  nice large bathroom  huge TV screen and awesome breakfast    Absolute comfortable stay for one night 
P =>  It was ok but attention needed to detail My company books me in here whenever I come to London  Its close to the office which is good  My main complaint is that the lift wasn t working and it wasn t working the last time I stayed a few weeks ago   quot Waiting for parts quot  I was told  So I had to hump my bags up   flights of stairs and with arthritic knees thats not fun  The staff don t seem to care less and I assume they are brow beaten by complaints of the lift being out of order  The room was ok  but the TV flickers and the TV channels don t match what is on the menu  Not a major issue but irksome all the same  The light on the telephone flashed constantly and every time I called reception to aks them to fix it  I got a different answer each time  A porter came with some instructions and still couldn t fix the problem  Small problem but I had to cover the phone so the light didn t keep me awake  Up and down the stairs for a mediocre breakfast and asked to sign by   waitresses who look woefully at the  quot thank you quot  basket in the hope of a tip  the location is perfect if you like loud noise  homosexuals kissing in the pubs  lots of tourists blocking the pavements and walking in the middle of the road  sex shops up the side streets  poor quality of service and food with over pricing in China town  and theaters and restaurants where if you are from out of town  which everyone is   you get ripped off  Welcome to London I won t be staying at this hotel again if I can help it  and I won t be staying in this part of London again  
P => Sadly we won t be back We have stayed in the Best Western Shaftesbury Hotel  Piccadilly  a few times and have found it to be clean and comfortable  The hotel has all the amenities you would expect of a    hotel and is good if you are on a working trip and not on an expense account  However I am withdrawing my recommendation  I stayed with my husband on   st ch    for a joint business trip  The lift was not working  and my husband who is    and very arthritic had a very slow  painful struggle to get up the    or so stairs to the first floor  He was embarrassed as he had to keep stepping to one side of the stairs in order not to impede other guests  The staff told us that the lift had been out of order for the previous two weeks  which made us feel that our pre payment booking had been taken under false pretences by Booking com  as the hotel advertises that it has a lift and that was a criterion in our choice of hotel  A second older couple staying in the hotel at the same time were similarly inconvenienced but the staff just shrugged  Nothing to do with them  
P =>  Very good for London average I would repeat  They were really nice  the first night we got a tiny room  and after asking for a change in reception  we were moved to a really nice big one  Modern and clean  Great location  
P =>  Great location and good value I took my   year old to London from New York and chose this hotel after reading reviews  I really can t fault it   the location is perfect for food  theater and sightseeing  We walked easily to Horseguards  The Eye and Covent Garden  The rooms are comfortable  modern and clean  Staff helpful and responsive when the TV didn t work to   year old standards We booked online and got a pretty good price at the last minute  Recommended  as is the pie at Pizza Express   
P =>   Great room nice hotel  I stayed here for one night in dec     The hotel was clean the room was very nice and the bathroom was really something special  We booked the cheapest deal we could find so while the room was lovely it was on the ground floor and over looked a very small and unpleasant concrete  quot garden quot   The corridors were dark and small but all the public areas were large and bright  Its about a   min walk from Paddington station and was surprisingly easy to find despite having to cross several major roads  We walked to the statue of Peter Pan in Hyde Park  The Royal Albert Hall and Harrods in Knightsbridge  at a tourists pace  in just over an hour  The buffet breakfast was also very nice  There is also a great pharmacy a few yards from the door that sells very reasonable perfume  The staff were more than helpful and I would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again and to recommend it to others  
P =>   Multiple properties OK  I work for over    years with the travel industry and select suppliers  airlines  hotels  etc   for large corporations  hence I look at a property in extreme details  As I am always looking for hotels that I would put a business person in  I was attracted by the location and amenities offered by the hotel First and foremost there are truly two properties with the same address   The Best Western Shaftesbury Premier  a     concrete building  and the Shaftesbury Executive which is also referred to as Hogarth Executive Rooms by Shaftesbury  a   story townhouse across the street   This is all terribly confusing as the hotel staff seem to treat them as one and the same As I was arriving around  am  I purposely booked the night before to make sure I have a room upon arrival  When checking in I was advised that they did not receive the late check in message and therefore treated it as a now show  In other words I was charged for the room and they still gave it away to someone else  Things can happen with reservation  however  to make this the customers fault is not acceptable Despite claiming they were absolutely sold out I was offered another room in the main building  Best Western Shaftesbury   The room was in the basement and had no windows at all   unacceptable  When I advised them I was suddenly moved to a main room in the building   temporarily as they said  After a    hour flight I finally took a nap just to be woken by staff  advising me that they now have a room in the Executive building  the townhouse across the street  and that they would be up shortly to move me again  I declined and told them that I would do this in the afternoon after resting  They were apparently not happy with that decision  as they already had a guest for the room they put me in temporarily  All the hotel facilities are in the  quot old quot  Best Western building  restaurant  gym  etc   and the Townhouse has only  quot executive rooms quot   Having see both rooms properties now I can assure you that there is NO difference between the rooms  The common areas are worn and look pretty bad  The rooms on the other hand were recently renovated and look as  quot good quot  as the pictures promise  However  the rooms are not maintained well at all  I really cannot rate the cleanliness of the room in the main building as I was too tired to inspect  however  as they use the same staff for both properties  I assume it is identical While the carpet in the center of the room is clean  all around the edges there is at least   centimeters deep border of dust  see picture   One light switch was broken and could only be turned by using your fingernail  The foot of the microwave was broken and held up with a napkin that was folder numerous times  see picture   The shower head was covered in Limescale  The heater in the bathroom had rust marks on the floor  The bathtub had mold  see picture   The window ledge was covered in cigaret buds  coffee utensils  etc  While the main building had cable TV      channels  the executive rooms had only    The top of the closet where my luggage was stored was covered in dust  see picture   etc   etc  etc The short of it is that the hotel rooms are VERY small but nicely furnished  however  the property is very badly maintained and staff is very rude and unwilling to take responsibility for anything  
P => Friendly staffgreat location  This is a very nice clean hotel in a great central location The staff are helpful and friendly This hotel is ideal for a short stay in london convenient to theatres  shopping e t c  
P =>  Perfect in every way Affordable London hotel rooms are notoriously pokey and having read a few reviews here I was cautious in my choice of hotels  I booked this hotel via booking com at   days notice  and requested a room away from the main street with a bathtub as I had toddler to cater for  I also booked a twin room in the hopes that we could push the beds together rather than have a tiny double bed When we arrived we were automatically upgraded to a Club room at the back of the hotel with a tub   peace and quiet   perfect  The room was of a decent size  clean and well equipped  The bathroom was lovely with power shower over the tub  heated mirrors and an inset TV  which didnt work   who watches TV from the bath anyway    We found the staff polite and helpful  The big bowl of chocolates at the reception desk was a hit with our   year old  The fresh fruit in the room was a nice touch too  When travelling with a toddler  access to good quick food is very important  We had a corner shop across the street with the whole of Chinatown just behind it  Picadilly  Leicester Square and Soho all within   minutes walk  I will definitely be coming to stay again   in fact my   year old says that when he grows up  he wants to live here  
P =>   A great hotel  I was putting reviews on of other hotels and remembered this  we stay there every time we go to London  It s a great hotel  the staff are friendly  the rooms are clean and really cool and it s in a great location   Chinatown and Theatreland close by  as is Soho  Oxford Street   Regent Street   Leicester Square etc and the underground  We ve stayed eight or nine times and never had a complaint We ve never eaten there but have no reason to doubt the food but with so many great places on the doorstep  there s no need to  
P =>  Very enjoyable stay Great location   chose to book Clubroom  well worth the extra for the wine  chocs and breakfast  Room clean  staff very nice  No bar or lounge area but so many places to go on your doorstep  
P =>   Simply flipping marvellous    My partner and I were going to London to a gig in Oxford Circus  being seasonally rubbish at being organised we began looking for somewhere to stay on the day we were travelling  After extensive trawling through many many hotels I decided to book the Piccadilly Best Western for three reasons    firstly  it s fantastic location  secondly the reviews of previous guests on tripadvisor and lastly because of the great deal we got through Activehotels  We ve stayed at many hotels in central london including the Millenium Knightsbridge and     The Gore Hotel both of which were great for different reasons  To be honest I wasn t expecting the world due to the price    how could you get a great double room in the heart of Theatreland for under      a night Well  we arrived at the hotel at about  pm after a   hour journey and had a limited time before we needed to get to the venue  Check in was smooth and very friendly and we were given our key to room      was the hotel trying to tell us something     When we walked into the room we were both blown away by how great it was  A lovely clubroom with flatscreen tv  fresh flowers and the best bed either of us have slept in for a long time  It was a shame to have to leave it   We were right on Shaftsbury Avenue a step away from Piccadilly etc etc and I can honestly say that we had a fantastic nights sleep and barely heard the busy London traffic below  We didn t sample breakfast or any of the other ameneties although the free apples were a welcome snack after a night out   I would without reservation recommend this hotel to anyone and will absolutely be staying again  I would even go as far to say that we found the quality of the room much better than it s more expensive competitors  Thank you Best Western for such a gem of a hotel    
P => Great location overall good stay This hotel has a brilliant location   right in the center of it all in London  You caneasily walk to major tourist areas in London  and also to many theatres within the area  Great for going out in the evening around Leisceter Square etc  you don t need to worry about how to get back to the hotel    you can just walk it  The room was very well appointed  It was on the small side true  but that is to be expected in London  The bathroom however was a very nice size  Comfy beds and good continental selection for breakfast  Spent a very nice long weekend here with my mother    shopping around and going to the theatre  Excellent choice for female travellers in London  
P =>  great location had   night at the shaftbury on shaftbury ave the staff were very helpfull room fresh and clean  fruit and wine pact fantastic location everything on doorstep would recomend it 
P =>  Great Hotel Excellent Location Stayed here for my   th birthday last week so that my husband and I could see the Phantom of the Opera  The hotel staff were very helful when we arrived  called for the lift for us  apologised as it took a little time to arrive  Stayed on floor   at the front  it overlooked Shaftsbury Avenue that was busy and bustling as you would expect right in the heart of the city  i am surprised some people have commented on this in their reviews  what would you expect in central London  The room was immaculate  the complimentary water and fruit was a nice touch  The room had everything I could have wished for    poster bed  TV  internet access  tea and coffee  buscuits  iron and ironing board  robes and slippers  and a TV in the bathroom  Breakfast in the morning was very good  plenty of choice and variety  if you want a cheap breakfast go to McDonalds  its just down the road  we thought the breakfast was worth it  after all you are in LondonIt was a very hot day  so the airconditioning was very welcome  The location is EXCELLENT for Trafalger Sq  Theatreland  Picadilly  Chinatown etc  I could not faulty this location at all  and would like to thank the manager and their staff for a very comfortable stay and will happily return without hesitation  
P =>   Great Location I really couldn t find anything to fault with this hotel  I stayed on business and found the room spacious  very clean and well equipped  My room overlooked the side street rather than the main road and was therefore really quiet   I d recommend asking for a quieter room if available  In the room was a complimentary half bottle of wine  fresh fruit and chocolates  I had booked a standard rate room so didn t expect any  extras   There was also a good choice for breakfast   expect to pay on top of the room rate The only thing I would say is that the reception area is a little soulless but the location of the hotel is great   and that s what you pay for really  I had previously stayed at The London Bridge Hotel which I liked  but on balance I would perhaps pay the extra for this location  
P =>  Clean good value and excellent location First of all  be aware there is a similarly and confusingly named hotel  Best Western Premier Shaftesbury  which is in Earls Court but TA wrongly brings up that hotel s details This review is about the Best Western Premier Shaftesbury Piccadilly   which is on Shaftesbury Avenue  corner to Dean Street  a couple of miuntes from Piccaddilly Circus So  excellent location  most major sights within easy walking distance  less than    minutes to Westminster Abbey   and of course    s or restuarnats  bars  and of course theatres The hotel is either new or very recently renovated   everything is clean and unused looking  in lobby  restaurant  breakfast area in lower ground floor   I had a single room which was tiny but had everything you need   expect and more  comfy bed  writing desk and chair  flat screen tv  ironing board  plus free fruitplatter  water and biscuits  tea and coffee making facilities  nice views over central London skyline  good shower room  with lots of toiletries All staff were friendly and polite  especially the recepectionist  I fell ill during my stay and had to extent and that was no problem  same rate I booked   and very caring attitude  offering to get me anything I needed Only thing I disliked   which was particularly an issue as I was stuck in room due to being unwell   was that the windows were secondary glazed and sealed  Did not have breakfast  just picked up a roll  but it looked very nice  and comprehensive  Still  I d stay again  and can really recommend this place  
P =>   convenient for the theatres Stayed at this hotel for one night  It is so convenient for the theatres in Shaftsbury Ave area  It wa nice to come out of the theatre late evening and only have a short walk back to the hotel  Our room was small   when you open the door it bangs up against the mini bar  but apart from that it was spotlessly clean and very modern  Can t see the point to the tv in the bathroom but the free friut and water is a nice touch  We didn t eat at the hotel  there are many good restaurants nearby and chinatown is right opposite  Only complaints were that the rooms are so hot   we had to switch off the radiator and open the windows as it was so stuffy  Our room was at the back so we heard little noise but i m sure it must be noisy at the front of the hotel   so ask for a room at the back We will certainly use this hotel when going to london again  
P =>  Theatre Break Booked through lastminute com for      a night  bit pricey but thats what you have to pay to stay on shaftesbury ave  on arrival they were selling rooms for      a night so that made me feel better  the hotel is   minute walk from leicester sq    mins form picadilly circus and overlooks chinatown  Oxford st shopping is a nice    minute walk  take the route through SOHO  it will open your eyes  Our room was on a floor recently renovated and was very swish  very nicely decorated  small bathroom  i bange my elbows on the wall when showering  Mod cons of a nice lcd tv and coffee maker  Only one lift which can be slow and i did notice some of the floors were not renovated like our one and they did look a bit shabby  request a newly decorated room if you can I didnt have to use the concierege services so cant comment on that  The staff seemed ok allthough didnt see one single english person which is a shame  they seem to be eastern euopean or french  We didnt eat in the hotel  whats the point  Angus steak house on leicester sq did a great breakast  This is a good clean place to stay thats right in the centre of it all  id stay here again  the only down side was no car park but there are   or   ncp s withing   minutes walk  
P =>  A good hotel at a reasonable price This hotel was not as bad an experience as I have seen claimed  The nature of the old Edwardian mansions means that rooms can be small and awkwardly laid out  The bathroom and showers are both very small  I am     quot  and much larger than me would have been a problem  The beds are typical singles  The furnishings are new and modern  The rooms are well maintained  The location is perfect for me  I attended a conference at Olympia and worked from my office in Holborn  Both are easily reached via the closest tube  For tourists  the proximity to Paddington and the easy walk to Lancaster Gate and a lovely walks to Knightsbridge  Harrods   Kensington  and Notting Hill make this an excellent choice for those on a budget  but want to be near the attractions The staff was friendly and courteous  The free wireless in the generous lounge area and the free internet connections in the room are a welcome plus in London  There are plenty of nice restaurants within easy walk  I recommend the Churchill as a pub  It is a bit of a walk  between Notting Hill and Kensington  It is an excellent pub with good thai food in the back restaurant  Given the condition of the dollar  I would strongly recommend this hotel if budget is a factor in decisions  
P =>   location location location My heading for this review might be a common one but in this case it is      accurate  The Shatesbury Piccadilly is right in the heart of  theatreland   The British Museum  Chinatown  Covent Garden  Regent Street etc for shopping are all just a short walk  The hotel s own website claims that they are a   star hotel  Tripadvisor list it as   star and this is a far more realistic grading  My Wife and I were lucky because we received a free upgrade to a lovely corner room with a   poster bed  So no complaints about the room or the bathroom  Both very clean and well appointed  Only two minuses  There were no face clothes in the bathroom  The hanging space in the wardrobe was half taken up by an ironing board and iron and a third of the space that remained was occupied by two bath robes   does anyone ever use these    The fresh fruit and water and the tea and coffee making facilities were most welcome Reception staff were friendly and helpful  We used the restaurant for breakfast  I would describe it as a cafe  Very basic  and that includes the food offering  We paid      for our room and breakfast  Next time I will negotiate a better price for the room and have breakfast in one of the many cafes within a short walk from the hotel Would we return   Yes  but mainly because of the location  This should definitely be a   star hotel  Do not expect   star facilities  
P =>  Quite good Paid      through a booking site for a single room  which I think was a double room   Check in went fine  Complimentary water and fresh fruit were nice We didn t use the breakfast facility  went to Costa across the hotel instead  Location for this hotel is great  only footsteps from the restaurants and bar in SoHo and Chinatown  short walk from Leicester Sq  amp  Piccadilly Sq  close to shopping in Regent St  This is the biggest advantage of the hotelSmall dissappointment  when asking for an Indian restaurant nearby  they only could advise chinese restaurants in Chinatown  However a Google Maps search  using the internet access  revealed there were several restaurants nearby  Dean St  Room was rather tiny  but hey  this is London    Con was that the corridors were very hot  as were the rooms and that the elevator was too slow   Pros  location  free internet connectionCons  noise at night  hot corridors  hot rooms when airco turned off  staff not too well informed  elevator slow 
P =>   Love It I have stayed in this hotel   times in less then    months i think that alone tells you i love this hotel location is fantastics rooms are clean and find the fruit in the room a really nice touch my first stay went without an hitch and cost us      per night the second time there was a problem with the rooming this was not the hotels fault we thought wed booked a twin this wasnt the case and no twins left available they offered me and a friend a single room each although we opted for a double whats the point in having a girlie weekend and being in separate roomsthis cost us     per night and my final stay was march      when id booked for Mum and I to see sound of music i arrived at the hotel tired ill and ready for a lie down the company on the website we had booked with hadnt advised the hotel and no room was ready for us the girl on reception was very appologetic but i wasnt blaming her she sugested we pop across the road for a costa coffee and room would be ready on our return this cost us     per night with no breakfast but we were given the breakfast free of charge as a good will gesture although i would admit i wouldnt have paid for it although i was ill and even my favourite food didnt taste nice Yes the hotel rooms are tiny but this is central london for gods sake the staff are very friendly and help point me in the direction for theatres shopping etc ive stayed on the front and back of the hotel and would proberly request the back its just a little but quiter remember your on Shaftesbury avenue although it didnt bother me too much All in all the fact ive visited   times in    months tells you i love it id never stay in any other hotel in London  
P =>   Excellent value for the money For a hotel in central London  right in the heart of everything  just a stones throw from Picadilly Circus  Leicester Square and Trafalgar Square  this was an excellent value for the money  The room was very clean and the bed was extremely comfortable with high quality bedding  Some may complain about the small size of the room  but be reasonable   this is a downtown hotel  Compared to hotel rooms in Manhattan   the size of the room was more than adequate Staff is friendly and knowledgeable  The one and only elevator could use some updating  but it s acceptable  
P =>  Convenient location good service just needs a little more maintenance Located in Theatreland  it s a busy spot less than   minutes walk from Leicester Square and Picadilly Circus   some of the front facing rooms were a little noisy at night  but the back facing rooms were very quiet  I loved the buzz of the area  myself   so many options so nearby Generally speaking  I really enjoyed my stay  Most of the staff were very helpful and professional and really made an effort to see to my comfort  I felt that legitimate complaints   issues were dealt with very swiftly and the staff were really focussed on going that bit extra to see me right  even offering me an umbrella to take with me on a rainy day  To me  the extra effort really made my stay  The only suggestion I would make would be to ensure that they have better information about services available in the area  I had a long stay so needed a laundrette  but staff had no idea where to find one  yell com sorted me out though   I would also recommend against using their recommended taxi service  which cost me     for a fare that runs    in a black taxi  The decor was a bit tired   stained carpets  stuffy corridors  chipped woodwork  and the  greeting  from the manager in the front of the guest book took me a bit aback to say the least  One gets the impression that the hotel has been abused a number of times by past guests  However  saying that  it s not bad  Just a bit scruffy around the edges Had some maintenance issues as well   most notably a shower that backed up and flooded onto the carpet  However  staff moved me into a new  and bigger  room as soon as I flagged the problem to them  In addition  all I had to do was throw everything into my cases   they moved all the bags and sorted out room keys and whatnot  so that when I came back from shopping  everything was ready for me The rooms were nicely decorated and very clean  I loved the little extras like fresh flowers  amp  fruit in the room on arrival Also on the plus side  the broadband connection was good and most importantly FREE   what a relief from ridiculous hourly charges that some other hotels impose The breakfast was quite nice and reasonable for hotel prices  and offered in a lovely  relaxing environment  A large screen tv was in the room so you could watch the news and or read the papers while having your breakfast   good selection of hot  amp  cold options as well  Lovely sausages in particular My stay was by no means perfect  but the service  aside from one mistake by room service  was excellent and far above what I have come to expect from some other London hotels  I would be very happy to stay here again the next time I m over on business Pricewise  my rate was booked via LateRooms and was significantly cheaper  avg     per night  than some of the other reviews note  so it s worth shopping around for the best online price  
P =>   The tyniest room of my life  I was given room     which is the tyniest room I have ever seen    I could hardly walk around the bed   Also the room had no window  was hot as hell and the A C did not work Add on top of that a complete    minutes power outage for  quot maintenance quot  and trouble with the Internet connection The only positive side of this hotel is the location  very convenient Probably the worst hotel experience in my business trips  
P => Definitely NOT   star accommodation  Even after the makeover this is not a   star hotel  The lobby is minute  the dining room bar like a staff canteen and the one and only lift  tiny  The double room allocated was on the top floor small and boiling hot  you could not open the wardrobe door fully as it caught on the bed  the bathroom smelt because the toilet had obviously been leaking previously and had not been repaired properly  The sink plug got stuck and I had to call reception and a very nice young man came and managed to get the sink working again fix the light in the bedroom and refll the tissues The bed was comfortable and the room clean but compared to my last stay at the   star Mandeville and the   star Cumberland earlier in the year  this is a    star hotel at   star prices  
P =>   Great Location for First Time Visitors to London Although I ve been staying at hotels as an adult for many years  all my experience is in North America and the Caribbean  I  therefore  do not have the experience to compare the Shaftesbury to other British European hotels  I will  therefore  try to present the facts as I saw them with minimal value judgments LOCATION  Located on Shaftesbury Avenue  the hotel is close to theaters  tube stops  Chinatown  Soho  TKTS  Piccadilly Circus  Leicester Square  Covent Garden  Trafalgar Square  Shaftesbury Avenue is bustling and at no time does one feel unsafe THE ROOM  The room with one queen bed is not spacious  but a couple co rdinating their movements around the room will have no problem  Our room had a safe  coffee tea maker  hair dryer  and fridge  The fridge contained complimentary bottled water as well as beverages for sale  which you pay for at checkout  Housekeeping replaced the bottled water as we used them  We were left a package of fresh fruit twice during our seven night stay  We were left cookies every day  The room had a hair dryer  but no clock  Sockets in the bathroom  for electric shavers  implied that one was for North American shavers and the other for British European  My electric razor was fully charged  so I never tried it Drawers and closet space are minimal  An ironing board with an iron attached at a very awkward angle reduces the closet space considerably  We increased the closet space by detaching the iron and storing it on the top shelf of the closet  A daily paper is included in the room price and is delivered to your door  If you bring your computer  high speed internet access is available in the room and is included in the room price  The TV is a flat screen  I cannot comment on picture quality or station selection since we did not attempt to watch TV during our stay  The shower spray is adjustable and the flow is steady  There was no problem with the hot water  There is no tub  the shower is a stall  I believe that a rotund guest would be very cramped and uncomfortable in the shower  The toilet was a somewhat humorous adventure  Like a car that stalls a few times before you get it to start  we never knew how many times we d have to attempt to flush it before it would flush  The highest was six  A few times it flushed on the first try  I found a maintenance man and showed him the problem  He studied the situation  saw the toilet malfunction  offered a few suggestions that were not going to solve the problem  and declared it fixed  Housekeeping was dependable and performed their duties well  The bed was comfortable  Because the area is bustling and noisy  you can t leave your windows open at night  so for us that means air conditioning  Our first room had a broken air conditioner  The hotel supplied us a fan  a complimentary bottle of wine  and changed our room the next day to a similar room with functional A C  The air conditioner ran quietly and did not make noise as the compressor turned on off  The room had a three quarter  but not full length  mirror  If you stay in one of the rooms that don t face Shaftesbury Avenue or Dean Street  then you face a neighboring church and a pretty courtyard  The church rings its bells hourly from  AM to   PM ELEVATORS  There is one guest elevator  It s slow and steady  Being on the  rd floor  British  nd floor   we usually took the stairs  The slowness is mitigated by the fact that there are only seven potential stops and it s a relatively small hotel INTERNET ACCESS  If you don t have your computer with you  the hotel provides a computer in a conference room in the basement  The cost is included in the price of your hotel room  A minor problem is that  being a conference room  it s sometimes being used for a meeting  We tried using the internet access supplied in the room via the TV  but as was reported in a previous review  the pixels were set at such a low number for the screen that the picture was too large and you could see only a small portion of the picture at one time    basically useless  definitely frustrating STAFF Every member of the staff that we encountered was friendly and attentive  
P =>   Outstanding location Excellent location for a tourist in London  Close to Theatres Picadilly Circus  China town Soho Covent Garden and shops Don t miss the restaurants and bars behind the hotel  Full of night life  Kind  informative and helpfull staff  Hotel recently refurbished to a very good standard  This is THE bargain for central London  
P =>  Great location for the money Overall the room was comfortable  though very small  typical of London   The breakfast was simple but fresh  The location  near theatre  shopping  Chinatown  National Gallery is fantastic   and   blocks from Piccadilly Station  Costa is across the street for great coffee  I would just say that the front desk staff could all learn to smile and seem more welcoming   the lack of friendliness was off putting  
P =>  Not brilliant but consistent Stayed on business again at this hotel  Twin room wasn t bad although the ironing board and iron take up half the wardrobe space   I d rather be able to hang my clothes and pay for a valet service It s a few years now since the last refurbishment and the carpets  fixtures and fittings are showing some sign of wear Nevertheless  still a good value hotel with efficient staff and an unbeatable central location  
P =>   Great Location This hotel is located a few blocks from the heart of Picidilly Circus but also walking distance to ChinaTown  SOHO and many of the best theatres in london Rooms were small by American standards but because of the location we weren t in the room much at all  Bed was nice as was bathroom  Beware of booking a room for   person however as they will give you a single size bed and the entire room is slighly bigger than a decent sized bathroom  
P =>   Well appointed room but outside noise at night is a problem We ve just returned from an overnight stay in this hotel  having stayed in it some months ago  We booked via a site offering discounts and ended up paying      for a double room without breakfast  This was a lot cheaper than booking directly on the hotel s site  and a lot lot cheaper than turning up and booking direct  The staff at reception were excellent and friendly  informing us that there was complimentary bottles of water in our fridge  There was also fresh fruit  tea making facilities and biscuits  The room was clean  had an LCD TV with internet access  we didn t use the internet so can t comment on that   a well appointed bathroom with good toiletries and even a separate TV screen in the bathroom  The bed was comfortable and the shower had plenty of hot water  so no complaints there  The corridors are a little drab  but I m being picky here  This isn t a hotel to lounge about in      it s just somewhere to sleep after a day and evening out in London The downside to this hotel is the noise at night  because its location on a road that connects two very central areas of London together  means that you ll definitely hear sirens at night  and noisy people  even on a weekday evening  For this reason I wouldn t stay here for more than one night  and I don t see this as a hotel for honeymooning couples  or business people  We did not sleep well at all last night What this hotel has got going for it  is its central location  and a reasonable price as central London hotel prices go  If you re after a hotel for a theatre break  it s   minute walk from Les Miserables for example   then this is perfect  If you re after a hotel to stay in within very easy walking distance to Leicester Square  Piccadilly Circus and Oxford Street  again  this is perfect  Surrounding the hotel are many many restaurants and of course all the restaurants of China Town  Perfect   no need for any taxis  The hotel also has a gym but I didn t look at that  
P =>   A Very Bad Choice After all the positive TripAdvisor reviews  perhaps my expectations for the K K George were too high  My twin room was NOT clean The K K George is okay if you don t mind filth  VERY DIRTY BATHROOM  urine on the floor  Sticky  no toilet paper and the towels smelt and were unclean  Shame about the housekeeping staff quot  Overall the worst service we have ever had This was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in  I would never never ever stay here again or recommend it to anyone  
P =>   Great base Stayed three nights from   th tember       Transferred here by the Hyde Park Paddington Hotel because  despite our booking in uary       they had no rooms  We enjoyed the Shaftesbury in room      Clean well equipped room  recently refurbished  with TV  internet  fridge  airconditioner  kettle  ironing board  comfortable beds with duvets  good english breakfast  friendly staff  Theatre land on your doorstep and within a mile     km  of many tourist attractions including  buck house  the eye  Leicester Square  Trafalgar Square  parliament  the Globe Theatre  etc  Don t allow the functional  plastic reception area to put you off  
P =>   Great Location   but a little noisy Myself and a friend stayed at this hotel for one night whilst in London for a concert  The location of the hotel is fantastic  right in the centre of everything and ideal for shopping  theatre breaks or just for a good night out in Soho  Old Compton Street is just behind the hotel  I had booked a standard double room and on arrival was informed that I had been upgraded to a four poster room which I was very pleased with  The room was a corner room on the first floor and was lovely and spacious  It had a huge four poster bed  flat screen tv  internet access  mini bar  seating area  large windows overlooking Shafesbury Avenue and China town  The only problem was that the room  being on the first floor and due to the central location  was very noisy at night  If I had been staying for more than one night I would probably have asked to be moved  As it was  I was very tired having had a busy day  so I did manage to get some sleep  I think the hotel should invest in some double glazing which might sort the problem out because other than that it is a fantastic hotel and I will stay there again  but will request a room on a higher floor  Can t fault the staff or the facilities   all very good  
P =>  Cozy and Chic This is a chic little hotel Took is a while to find but we dot there in the end   the reception is a little plasticy but the rooms are totally different  Check in was a little dodgy and slow My room was on the top floor  nice corner room lush dark purple velvet curtains  dim lighting and the room was a little small  The beds were very  very comfortable fluffy and crisp  Internet access in the room    fabulous dressing table with a little bud vase with a couple of carnations and a platter of fresh fruit tea and coffee  Flat Screen TV and a little lounging area couch with magazines and papers The bathroom was a little dissapointing  very small  couldn t swing a cat in it but the shower was nice  showers are always important I had a view of the Chinatown gate and the London Eye If you are looing for somewhere to eat  be prepared to stand for up to    mins inline for a seat in any of the near by restaurants  the Italian across the road invited us in but had us standing for ages at the top of a steep victorian stairs  pushing and shoving past us trying to make us feel akward  so we left     straight for Leicester Square to the Angus Steak house   The Shaftesbury is in an EXCELLENT location  a couple of doors down if you come out and turn right is the bar club Sirocco  very upmarket and fab cocktails I wouldnt complain about this hotel tbh  Very reasonable price Try it  
P =>   Premier room without a window    Let me start by saying that I fully agree with previous reviewers about great location of this hotel Tthe hotel was clean and pretty modern  for London standards   However  those were the only positive things    After reading positive reviews here I decided to book a premier double room for one night  Big mistake  I felt like staying in some  quot Easyhotel quot   since my  quot premier quot  room that costed over      per night didn t even have a window    The room also was so small that there was probably less than   cm space between bed and walls  there wasn t even room for a single chair  I wonder what the  quot regular quot  room is like  is it possible to make it any smaller So it s a place for just sleeping after having the night out in Chinatown elsewhere nearby  but that s about it  You could have the same experience at least      cheaper from some other place  Personally I will stay away from this place  Romantic getaway in this place  Yeah right    Luckily I was on a business trip so I didn t have to pay the bill for this pleasure 
P =>  Great location bad vibrations  Arrived at hotel       Tuesday with my mum  helpfull friendly concierge  Got shown to room on  rd floor  at front of hotel  Twin room  very  very small  Beds were together  person in bed by window had to walk sideways on past tv and desk to get to bathroom  Very clean  dreadfull pillows on bed and extremely hot  unable to change settings on air con  The vibraitions really bad at night  as there is a bus stop right in front of hotel  and the busses when they are sitting there with engines on send vibrations up through hotel which you can really hear and feel  not good  Managed to sleep eventually  Breakfast good of it s type  Friendly staff  Great location  just ask for a room at the back of the hotel by the way  our reason for visiting London was to go to The Palladium for the  Sinatra  show  If you see one thing  make sure it is this  It is FANTASTIC  Could watch it again and again  
P =>  Excellent choice for enjoying London s nightlife If you re looking for a romantic or relaxing getaway in London head for the Portobello Hotel or the Hazlitts  For   star service  perhaps the Halkin or the Dukes might suit you  However  if you re interesteded in enjoying the bustling day and night of Central London while staying in a clean  affordable  and functional hotel  the Shaftesbury will result perfect  A friend of mine and I booked a double premier room with a nice king bed through londonnights webpage and found it very satisfying  We actually ended up sneaking in a third friend and the   of us still managed to fit confortably in the king bed  The bedroom itself was decently sized  airy and with two nice big windows facing dean street  The bathroom was fantastic  with functional non flooding american style shower and equipped with another TV and american sockets  Even though you could hear a bit of noise at night it was nothig to prevent you from sleeping  and you have to realize that you re actually ON Shaftesbury Ave  and a block from Old Comptons Street  The staff were always nice and helpful and always left any left messages under your door  However  what I valued most of this hotel was the location  Everything is walking distance  It s great to be able to walk back to your hotel at any time without having to take a taxi  
P =>  Excellent location  clean comfortable room I was a bit concerned about staying here after reading some of the reviews  but as a single woman staying in London the location was ideal for the two theatres I was visiting  I needed have worried as I was pleasently surprised by the whole visit I found it better to book via the Best Western web site as the room was much cheaper with their special offers  though they were non refunable  The staff were friendly and helpful  with an offer of help with my luggage  I was given a free  unrequested upgrade as I d requested a bath and their single rooms with baths were occupied  The room was small  however plenty of room to manouver and everything to hand  It was clean and nicely decorated  and the bed was one of the best I ve ever slept in   one to sink into without it being too soft  the linen was clean and crisp  plenty of natural fibre pillows The bathroom was clean and a nice size  thoughthe TV in the bathroom was a novelty  though difficult to see from the bath and the picture was never quite right  However this was a luxury not a necessity and the main TV worked well  I would advise though that they increase the number of channels availabe   BBC   BBC   ITV and C  were the only options The fresh fruit and complimentray newspaper were a nice bonus  I didn t dine at the hotel so cannot comment on the food  There is a free luggage room  though I did tip the  consierge  when he brought my luggage as I left as he d been helpful throughout the stay  Again the staff were great and very accommodating All in all it was a great experience and I would recomment it and consider staying there again  
P =>  Good location but can be better We were there for our anniversary  basing on the name   BW Premier Shaftesbury because in France the BW Premiers are the top of the BW  In fact  here  premier is only the name of a local chain   Location is very convenient theaters  Piccadily  shopping   We have a room on the avenue so very noisy even late in the night   and I have requested a quiet and large room for our anniversary  It was called  quot juniorsuite quot  and I  m always looking for the  quot suite quot   bath room was only a shower   Staff was courteous and smiling but didn t remplace quietness and squarefeet  I think BW have to change the denomination  quot premier quot  in this particular case  because it allows some  voluntary      confusion    
P =>   Avoid at all costs I concur with the reviewer who dubbed this hotel  quot a nightmare quot   I m convinced that some of the   star reviews of this site must ve been done by hotel staff or else someone else compensated to give this wreck of a hotel a good review I don t know where to begin  Firstly  the service and attention to detail that you would expect from a USD    night hotel were just NON existent  The hallways were narrow and uncomfortable  with stains on the carpets  The hotel room smelled as though it had a toilet leak   awful  I won t even criticize the room for noisiness because it s understandable that a room adjacent to a major thoroughfare would be noisy  But the front office staff seemed as though they could barely understand English Then it gets worse  The shower head on the cord didn t work  It was uncomfortable temperature wise  and I couldn t find the thermostat for the life of me  Would you believe that a      night hotel DIDN T have a THERMOSTAT  They said they d just installed a new heating ac unit on the wall in three units  but only had   remote control  How ludicrous is that  The guy comes up with the remote control  but he can t leave it with me because it s supposed to serve three rooms  Well  I can adjust the  expletive  heating ac unit manually MYSELF  I don t need hotel staff to do it  Basically  there was NO way to have the room maintain a constant temperature  If you were too hot  you had to get on a CHAIR to reach the unit and turn on the AC  But since there was no thermostat it couldn t self regulate  So  of course  if you were to fall asleep and it got too cold  you d have to get out of bed to turn the AC off  And so on  ad infinitum  To add more pain  or humor  depending on how dark your sense of humor is   the front desk staff didn t even know what a thermostat was  I kid you not  I asked   quot Where is the thermostat in the room  I don t see it  quot   He responds that it was on the wall  but it was obvious he thought I was referring to the heating ac unit itself  I said   quot no   not the unit   the thermostat  Where is the thermostat  quot   Whereupon I hear him talking away from the phone to one of his colleagues  and I hear him say the word thermostat  then he comes back and says   quot oh  if you go three blocks down Shaftesbury    quot I m not kidding you  people  Just to illustrate that he didn t know what a thermostat was Want more  I had a very important business meeting and decided I would take a nap  I asked the staff for a wakeup call  Having been travelling through Europe on meetings I had been exhausted and needed to be fresh for the meeting  I wake up an hour after my meeting was to start  three hours after I d requested my wakeup call  No wake up call  I called down  furious  inquiring   quot Oh   we had it written down here  I m not sure what happened quot  One of the very few outlets in the room didn t work  And the manager  after all the aforementioned catastrophe  could muster nothing more than an  quot I m sorry quot   No mention of a partial refund  no complimentary breakfast  not a cup of coffee or a cookie All I ask from a hotel is that the room is clean  things function  and the service is good  Any hotel  regardless of the price  should be able to provide that  The best thing I could say about this hotel is that the room had a nice tv  Other than that   things didn t work  and the service was absolutely TERRIBLE  They will never  ever  EVER get my business again  This is the worst hotel experience I ve ever had  in    years of international travel for business and pleasure  
P =>  The room was so small    Stayed here for   nights as a woman on my own  I was attending a course  Lucky that the very pleasant reception staff upgraded me from a single to a double as I would hate to imagine the size of the single room  There is hardly any room left for a suitcase  The bathroom is tiny  No room to put your things  I felt somewhat claustrophobic but being so centrally located made up for it  I was a little disappointed with the internet browser in the room which did not work well  The staff were very nice  Without them I think it should be a lower star rating  
P => Would Highly Recommend this Hotel My sister and I traveled to London from y            I had done a lot of research on various websites  tripadvisor  londontown  expedia reviews  london hotel reviews etc   as I am a very picky person when booking hotels  I want just the right hotel  for the right price  location  as well as decor and cleanliness  After much research and contemplations between hotels at Earls Court  Euston  Russell Square and Westminster areas  I selected the Best Western   Shaftesbury  The room is a bit on the small side  however very clean  bed was comfortable  great location     blocks from Picadilly line  and a central location to all major attractions       minute walking distance to Piccadilly Circus  Chinatown Trafalgar Square  Soho     Underground distance to London Eye  Big Ben  Westminster  Tower of London  Tower Bridge    The hotel was at a reasonable price especially for the location       pounds nite  Hotel staff was also helpful  One person at the reception desk was a bit on the rude side  but other than that everyone was very helpful  I would definately recommend this hotel and would absolutely stay here again  Hope this is a helpful review to those reading it   FYI   this is my first posting a review on tripadvisor com  so it says alot for me to type a review  I normally just read reviews and keep opinions to myself  
P =>  Tiny room but convenient The BW Shaftesbury was perfect for my trip  but the room size was downright funny I booked a single and the bed was at the end of the room  extending the full width of the room     feet maximum  You couldn t put your bag on the bag trolley without blocking the door  Thank heavens I had a small bag The pluses    Location to theaters  perfect  I was only     to a few blocks from all of the theaters I wanted to see  and only     blocks from the Piccadilly Underground station  There are many restaurants and convenience stores in the area  This was great for a woman traveling alone as I didn t have more than a couple of blocks to walk home after a show    Bathroom  the shower worked well  good hot water  Sink had good water coming in  but could easily overflow as it was small  Nice free toiletries  Only   bath towel and   face cloth    Bed was very comfortable with a comforter  sheet  two great pillows    Air conditioning worked   and I was there on an   F day when it was truly needed    High speed interent access free  Worked great    US plug in  this was wonderful to have for my laptop    Nice flatscreen TV  with a webTV sort of internet thing  This didn t work so well for me as the screen didn t resize  so had to scroll around everything  I was happy I had brought my laptop    Bowl of fruit on arrival    My room was very quiet  it was at the back of the hotel  One afternoon they were playing music in the room next door and it was very loud  but when I flushed the toilet they turned it off  So  it may be noisy if you have neighbors Drawback  Incredibly small sized room  But  that said  it worked fine for little old me One complaint  on checkout  they handed me a bill which showed their rack rates after the first night rather than the rate guaranteed by my reservation  a difference of     pounds     Luckily  I had my internet reservation printout and they corrected it immediately with no fuss Moral  always bring proof of your rate  
P => Good value for money Just got back from a night in London where we booked in at the Shaftesbury hotel  Got a good rate of     for a premier double room  which was very very small but modern  clean and comfortable  Staff very friendly and the hotel is right bang in the middle of everywhere that you could possibly want to go to  Obviously it was extremely noisy being in the heart of Theatreland  and the noise doesn t stop all through the night   so the best thing to do is make sure you have a few bevvies to help you sleep right through  Would defintely recommend this place though and we will definitely be going back again  
P =>   Good hotel but make sure you get the right room Stayed here in il for four nights and was initially allocated an  attic  room       which was so small that the bed stopped the wardrobe door opening fully  There was just a shower   rather than bath as advertised so I complained and was allocated a much better room        This was adequate in size  the bed was comfortable and the bathroom spacious with a good shower and a small TV  You have to request some of the advertised features  i e  a DVD player and a bathrobe  There are tea making facilities and flat screen TV  I requested a quiet room   rather than one overlooking the busy Shaftesbury Avenue  The location is great if you are going to the theatre and if you like to be in the midst of the west end throng  It is opposite Soho with its many chinese restaurants  
P =>  Great location very good hotel Like other reviewers  I was nervous about booking the Shaftesbury  but the hotel has been extensively modernized  albeit not always organically   The bathroom  especially  was nicely finished  though the plumbing drained slowly  and neither the heated towel rack nor the in wall TV worked  I had a  quot junior suite  quot  which isn t large  based on the floor plan  I couldn t imagine staying in the standard rooms   And  like another reviewer mentioned  the two twins pushed together to make a king bed do not align well   The service is pleasant  and the breakfast is adequate  The location can t be beat for a theater trip  though the street noise does make itself heard late on Friday and Saturday nights  I got a very good B amp B rate on the Best Western website  and I ve certainly paid more for less in London  That s the bottom line  really  For a central London hotel  most of which range from appalling to mediocre and all of which are astoundingly overpriced  the Shaftesbury is a solid choice  
P =>  Excellent Location Good Hotel Just returned from a   day break in London to take in the sights and see Patrick Stewart at the Apollo  Checked out this site before staying at The Shaftesbury Hotel and was a little nervous because of some of the reviews  We booked through the Best Western site and found the cheapest deal was to pay fully in advance to get the best price  The Best Western site was cheaper than booking direct with the Hotel itself   Arrived early afternoon and had no problem booking in  Was offered help with my bag but politely declined  The room was a standard double for my wife and I  It was very clean and tastefully decorated  had a shower but no bath  whch is fine by me  and wasn t huge but perfectly comfortable for    Our room looked out onto the church to the rear of the hotel but the chimes stopped at   pm and didn t start again till   or  am and the double glazing kept most of the noise out  The Hotel is situated on Shaftesbury avenue which is perfect for both theatre goers and sightseeing  The Apollo which we were going to was no more than    m down the road  To the front of the hotel is China Town and to the rear is Soho so it does get very lively on an evening and means there is plenty to do  A lot of the comments about the noise from it s location are a little exaggerated  the rooms are double glazed and i had no difficulty sleeping  The only disturbing noises i heard were from other guest who had children running in and out of rooms and the doors were slamming shut and because the rooms are close together the noise does carry but it is a hotel and you do have to expect that other people will be staying there If you like to moan about the little things or if you can t sleep unless there is complete silence then don t stay here  but if you want a nice  good value hotel in the heart of London then i can highly recommend The Shaftesbury Hotel  I hope you enjoy your stay as much as i did  
P => A little less conversation   Spent a weekend here            with some girlfriends  The rooms are very small but clean and the beds are very comfortable  One of the problems we had was that our rooms faced Shaftesbury Avenue so the noise was constant all night long  Sirens  shouting  car horns etc  The key cards would only work at certain times of the day and when they did work we had to shoulder charge the door Starsky and Hutch style in order to get the door open  This was very amusing at the time but it was that sort of weekend  Some of the staff were friendly and welcoming whilst others were cold and sullen  As we were checking out I don t think the receptionist spoke one word to us and spent    minutes taking a private call whilst dealing with my credit card  I would return for another short visit but this time i would request a room at the back of the hotel  
P =>  Excellent Location My husband and I arrived here for the weekend of   th ruary  We had booked to see y Poppins in the Prince Edward Theatre and wanted to stay in a nearby hotel due to it being a nightmare finding a taxi after the evening performance The check in staff and porter were friendly and helpful  The porter chatted as we went in the lift to our  nd floor room  The room was small  as is usual for central London  but it had everything we could have wished   TV  radio  internet access  The plate of fruit   despite a negative mention from a previous reviewer   was most attractive and very welcome The corridors are narrow and very much like a rabbit warren   but the room numbers are signposted well along each corridor Breakfast was adequate but it would have been nice to see more fresh fruit and selection of breads  and toast  as is customary in most hotels these days The only negative comment I have is that the hotel has but one lift which is rather slow  You can wait a disproportionate length of time waiting for it to arrive  However  due to the layout of the hotel  I cannot see how they could add a further lift Great location  Good service  Would recommend it to anyone wanting the West End  
P =>  Better than most London hotel experiences Had a night staying here with a theatre visit for our wedding anniversary  was really pretty impressed with the hotel  considering previous London Experiences  Room wasn t the biggest  but it was veru nicely furnished  well appointed  lovely bathroom  good aircon  bit of street noise from outside but what do you expect in this location  Location as far as Theatreland is concerned couldn t be better  right in the heart of the West End  Staff friendly and efficientI recommend this hotel  if you get a decent deal through the Internet as we did      GBP for a four poster room   and book at least a junior suite  Rack rate is astronomical and the lesser rooms probably too small 
P =>  Good location but a little noisey Stayed here in   room was nice and clean and was at the front of the buiding  but was on the cold side  however  heater was provided to aide this  Bathrooms were nice with tv in there  so good to watch  Only complaint was the noise  facing the front of the building  traffic did not stop from morning till night  Good location though  if you want china town  across the road  or SOHO  at the back of the hotel   
P =>  Poor value for the money Room was pigeonhole sized with suitcase blocking the dresser  or bathroom  when opened  And this was for the equivalent of      US a night  I do not consider this a good value  Also the toilet handle had to be pumped at least twice to flush  The staff was cordial and helpful and the location in the midst of the West End was great but that is not reason enough in my opinion to choose the Shaftesbury  The Thistle Piccadilly  in the same neighborhood  at the same price  has much larger rooms and more amenities  
P =>  Great location tiny rooms Probably the best location in London  Right next to Picadilly Circus and Leicester Square and just a short walk from Oxford Street Very nicely decorated rooms but let down by their tiny size Worth staying at if you can get a decent price  
P =>  BW Select Shaftsbury   Good Location Bad Hotel

P =>   Well worth it considering the price of London hotels We spent   nights here while in town for a wedding  It was exactly what I thought it would be  Clean  well located and affordable  The room was large and bright  Very quiet neighbourhood  Tube station was   min away     min ride to central London  The overall decor is a little tired and the beds are firm with some springs poking  The bath room was always cleaned well and the room made up well each day  I was okay with the lack of updatedness  I figure if or once they do a total refirb the price will jump as well  Travelers with disabilities should avoid the  th floor  where we were  as the tiny lift only goes to the  rd then a flight of steep stairs  The largest rooms are on the  th  we booked a Superior double  actually were given a triple    single beds   The breakfast was priced high and I took the prior reviewers advice and ate elsewhere  Oliver s on Belsize was awesome   All in all we would return  
P =>  Quiet and very well located This is a nice hotel in a superb location   almost next door to Swiss Cottage tube station and the shops and cafes of Finchley Road  but in a pretty  very quiet neighbourhood  We chose this hotel because we drove to London but wanted to avoid the central congestion charges   if you get there at the right time  there s a very limited amount of onsite parking  but also metered parking and an NCP carpark nearby   The hotel itself is pleasant enough   the decor and furniture are a little old and the basement   ground floor   corridor is dank and musty  but the rooms are clean and comfortable  We paid a little extra for a superior double room  which was very spacious and had its own little seating area next to a set of doors which opened out onto   the carpark  Not the nicest view  but we weren t exactly there for the scenery  The bathroom was largeish and spotlessly clean  with a good shower and nice toiletries  though the floor was covered a strange greasy film   probably the remnants of their cleaning fluid      We only stayed for a night  so didn t really meet the staff   the ones we did encounter were polite in a rather distant manner  All in  this is a good choice if you want to be close to central London but in a tranquil  interesting neighbourhood with  some  parking  The Best Western website seems to offer the best online rates  
P =>   Not exactly The Ritz      but OK We managed to get a really cheap deal for this hotel  and were staying for a long weekend   my husband and I in one room  my mother and young daughter in another room  The hotel is in a great location  nice area and a stone s throw from Swiss Cottage tube  The hotel looked promising from the outside  and the reception area was lovely  Our rooms however were not too fabulous  They were down in the basement  in an area that was being refurbished  possibly this is why the rooms were so cheap   The rooms themselves were clean and the bathroom spotless   all towels and bedding lovely and clean too  The beds were possibly the hardest I have ever had the misfortune to sleep in though  the matress could have been made out of concrete  The beds in the other room were just as uncomfortable  Out bathroom was very small  and if you were a person of large build I can t see how you would manage to go to the toilet  so close was it to the opposite wall  The shower was terrible   the controls didn t work so it was by pure fluke that I got it to work at all  I couldn t manage to get the water hot so had to make do with a luke warm shower  The shower produced the most feeble trickle of water  and was about as powerful as a sprinkle of rain  Our toilet flush stopped working  and despite telling the staff at reception about it nothing whatsoever was done  we were told it took    minutes for the cistern to refill   ours didn t flush for around    hours   Despite this  for the money we spent I don t feel too badly done by  It wasn t fantastic  but it wasn t terrible by a long shot  It s fine if you get a good deal and aren t too fussy   tip  don t buy your breakfast there   there are several cafes on the main street a lot cheaper   
P =>  Nice victorian hotel Nice athmosphere in a good place with very nice streets Good rooms  different tipes No luxury but good for travel and verry well located The subway is very close It was arround    pounds a night    not so cheap    but ok The internet was bad in the lobby Don t ask me about breakfast We took something on the way   Some problems with water pressure Our room was at last floor  
P =>  Consistent    Is That a Ghost  The Swiss Cottage hasn t changed much in years  I guess that s ok then as long as you re not expecting mod cons  but wifi is available   Narrow halls  tiny lift  when it works   creaky floorboards  mismatched Victorian like furnishings  it s all part of the charm  My room was FABULOUS  on the first floor  large living room area with   sided bay windows overlooking the street  remodeled bathroom  very nice job   king size bed with clean linens and   big pillows  I booked directly with the hotel via email  I told them what size room I wanted and they did me a much better price than the web site  ONE CAVIET  if you book a taxi with the front desk  make sure you specify a black London taxi  otherwise you ll be hiring a mini cab private car at twice the regular fare   I learned the hard way  I added some photos and the ghost in the room was quiet and respectful  
P =>  Good value for London   lovely lobby I was tired of staying in the usual anonymous Holiday Inn and therefore chose this hotel  The area is great   close to the restaurants at  the village  and with buses and the tube station almost in front of the door  Liked the hotel  especially the lobby with the piano  the couches and chairs  Everything looks like it has been recently fully refurbished so nothing to complain in terms of cleanliness  Had varying experience with staff   Overall very nice and attentive  but there was one guy at reception who totally ignored me when I arrived for check in  although there was nobody else and he wasn t busy  and wasn t friendly at all  Free Wi fi in every room  would definitely stay there again next time  I ve had horrible experiences with hotels in London  and this was a very pleasant surprise for great value for money  
P =>   NEEDS A REFURBISHMENT ASAP   A TIERD HOTEL This Hotel is in a good location for central London as the tube station is  mins away  the area is residential and no noise at all so a good nights sleep you should receive  First impressions is the Reception   Lounge are very nice and good deco were they want to impress with antiques to a baby grand piano in the lounge area and access to the Internet if you forget your own gagets  The rooms I requested was a low floor as I do have walking difficulties and they put me on the third telling me there is a lift      only goes to the third floor and my room was not near to the lift at all  not impressed  The room was a twin no     and I was travelling with a young child so you can imagine my horror when we entered and I looked to open the window there was no child locks and a sheer drop three floors down  I did ask to be moved but the hotel was full not a good start       The room itself was clean but the deco was grubby and needs a refurbishment asap  the shower adapter was stuck and the toilet was cracked  also a nail was not hammered down near to the door of the bathroom  good job we had shoes on  Food we did order Breakfast a cooked one and had to pay extra for this       this was over cooked and the sausage looked like they were from the day before along with the beans  Healthy option breakfast was poor also not a lot of variety with cheap makes of food a lot more could be done with this service I suggest you go out as you will enjoy your meal somewere else  The staff are very nice and friendly and could not be more helpful in giving direction and ringing taxis for guests This Hotel would benefit from a full refurbishment of rooms and bringing the standard of food up to an acceptable level as the location is lovely and the Hotel could do a lot more to maximise its full potential  Disabled guests please check that you get a low room and parents with children younger ones watch the windows as they are   Health Safety issues  a sheer drop with three functional windows to open is an accident waiting to happen  I did point out all the above to Manaement and was told to write all the above on the comments sheet       which I did oblige them with  Would like to see the Hotel after a refurbishment as the location is good for getting around  
P =>   I fell in love with this hotel              The hotel managers are fantastically helpful  with the perfect balance of politeness and friendliness  There isn t anything they wouldn t do to make you happy  The whole house is a Victorian museum  Every corner is exquisitely furnished  You could spend hours just gazing at the beauty of the paintings  antiques  chandeliers  and relishing the atmosphere  The corridors are very mysterious and you could easily get pleasantly lost  There is a loving ambience in the hotel dating perhaps from people who have lived there in the past  It has all that England has to offer and is a perfect experience for those wanting to experience this country and all it represents  It s the perfect English experience  I love going back there every night  and if I could  I d live there permanently  I m made to feel like a Queen  This is definitely my favourite hotel in England  
P =>  Great hotel ticks all boxes We stayed at the hotel for four nights with Breakfast  We found the hotel easily by car and  although there are only   parking spaces  spaces were available throughout our stay as many guests were holidaymakers from abroad  The room was clean and comfortable  with sheets and towels changed daily  All staff were pleasant and helpful and the Breakfast staff always had smiles  Literally one minute from Hampstead Theatre and Swiss Cottage Tube Station  which gets you in to central London in       mins  Although not much to see in Swiss Cottage high street  the Swiss Cottage pub is not to everyone s liking   it has all the basic stores e g  M amp S  Boots  WHSmiths etc for convenience  The hotel itself is set back from the high street in a quiet residential area  a quiet    minutes walk to Belsize Park and Hampstead Heath  We would definitely stay here again because of the value for money you get when compared to central London hotels  especially as they give discount to local government public sector workers  We walked to Abbey Road Studio from the hotel in    minutes  for a photo opportunity on the famous pedestrian crossing outside  
P =>  A tired hotel with acceptable but modestly trained staff OK if you get a good price  Good location for Swiss Cottage and Finchley Road but very tired inside with grubby feel 
P =>   disappointed I used to stay in this hotel for many years but it seems the service is getting worse and the rooms are getting too noicy as the walls are quite thin even though it is in a quite area  It gets very pricy  I had a confirmation in wirting that I will have the supirior double room but was given a standered double room  They chrge seperately for breakfast  It is better to go out and have your breakfast  
P =>   A nice inexpensive hotel close to everything yet in a quiet location I ve traveled to London frequently over the past few years and have come to expect London hotels to be a good     stars overrated  Typically mid range hotels have small rooms and attention to cleanliness and details is spotty at best  This hotel was a pleasant surprise  funky  with creaky floors and older rooms  yet  it has a certain charm helped by the building style and very quiet location  Service could be a little friendlier  if I ran a hotel  I d probably greet new guests at check in  All it takes is a  quot welcome quot  or acknowledgment of arrival    In sum  if you re looking for perfection  this is not the place  However  if you can handle some Brit quaintness in an excellent location while you save money  this may very well be one of the best deals  
P =>   A very pleasant stay We stayed for one night at this hotel and I would definitely go back when I am next in London We had a superior double room that was very spacious  clean and comfortable Staff very pleasant and an excellent english breakfast The underground is about a two minute walk away so very convenient for getting into the centre of London  
P =>   Would Not Stay Here Again We stayed at this hotel back in      and frankly were quite disappointed  The    rating by Tripadvisor is pretty accurate  although from some of the ratings and the pictures at the time  we were expecting a      There is nothing really good to write about this hotel other than the fact that it offers parking  which is hard to come by in central London  It has a very small parking lot and overall it s a very difficult place to find if you re driving  We stayed there at the end of an England driving tour and did not want to get rid of our car  pay drop off fees and get an expensive taxi to the airport and the parking option moved this hotel to the top of our list  If we were to do it again  we d stay in London longer  ditch the car and pick another hotel  even if it costs      night more  
P =>  great location spent one night at this hotel  we chose it mainly for its location  outside the london congestion charging zone  and very close to swiss cottage underground station  the hotel is a basic     and as long as you expect no more than this your stay will be okay  it is clean  the staff were very polite to us  and we had free overnight parking in the small onsite car park  our booking included a continental breakfast which we found ample  for    extra you can have the cooked breakfast  we would stay again but only for   or   nights  
P =>  Almost good First impressions it looks a ok hotel But it s a little tired looking and rooms are ok but not worth the money The decor is in need of a refurbishment The breakfast was ok The positon of the hotel is good and it s not too noisy Overall the web site photos paint a better picture I suppose that the hotel feels it can charge these prices because they are in London  
P =>   Lovely stay If you re looking for the traditional American hotel chain experience  i e  vending ice machines in hallways or every room identical to each other whether you re in L A  or Sarasota  then this little hotel isn t for you  I found the hotel quaint and quirky  filled with antiques and pretty   if a bit odd  pieces of art  Narrow hallways that twist and turn and no   rooms alike  My room was on the  nd floor with a beautiful view from the window  I had a full bathroom with tub  a nice soaking tub at that  and large  oversized windows on   walls  Beds were firm  room was clean  staff was gracious and helpful  Shower was of the european variety but water pressure was fine and despite showering at various times of the day  I never had a shortage of hot water  Wonderful  thick  heavy towels   You do have to request face cloths however Breakfast was good but not remarkable   There are better breakfast options nearby on Finchly Road   But I was able to get a great cup of coffee  There is a hot pot with instant coffee   tea and cocoa in the room if you prefer  Tube station is only   block away  Wednesdays and Fridays there s a farmers market right outside the door and down maybe     feet  Neighborhood is lovely  rather upscale and mostly residential  I will definitely go back on my next visit to London  A fantastic bargain for the price  
P =>   Pleasantly surprised  On arrival the man at reception was very pleasant and gave us the key to a room which was exactly as I had requested   rd floor  twin room  non smoking and quiet  The interior design and furniture are what I would call  quot quaint and quirky quot   The room was very clean  airy and had a huge bathroom which was spotless  as was the bed linen  We had a very enjoyable evening and rounded it off with a nightcap in the bar  The room rate was reasonable for London and the location is ideal for the tube and at the same time on a very nice road  I would recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again  
P =>   Nice hotel close to tube line Hotel rooms are Ok  the beds are a little soft  try and stay on main floor not basement rooms We had room on main floor       lots of windows space with       foot ceilings  and the main window opens for fresh air Very close to tube line to central London  lots of shops and pubs within easy walking distance Staff are friendly and helpful  breakfast the normal coffee tea cereal toast jam etc       pounds about standard for the UK Would stay againtyn  amp  Lauren Jones 
P =>   Excellent value for money I stayed for three nights in uary       I had asked for an upper floor room  and although it was not guaranteed  I got it  A very nice surprise was the size of this room  Very big and comfortable  more like a suite than a room  with separate sitting area  and bedroom with double bed Overall  my experience was very good  for the money I paid  
P =>  Better than expected based on previous reviews What made this such a good hotel was the short walk to the tube and the safe location  We did not opt for the breakfast but found a little french bistro up the street that served a wonderful breakfast for the same amount we would have been charged for the continental  There are plenty of restaurants in the area if you like ethnic food  which we do   The rooms were fine  spacious and clean  The plumbing is what I expect for a European hotel  The service is good but if you require hand and foot service  this is definitely not the hotel for you  And if you can manage London s underground  Jubilee line to most major attractions   you ve got a great bargain  off season  and a great hotel  If you are looking for something clean  safe  comfortable and recognize you are still in a large cosmopolitan city and exercise some simple safety concerns  I would recommend this place  The only issues I had was the guest in the upstairs room left the bloody shower on our last night there and we had to change rooms in the middle of the night  night staff was efficient for a room change   Also  make sure you check your room carefully upon checkout because if you have left something  they aren t very responsive and chances are    it won t be  found  or returned  
P => Best Western Swiss Cottage was OK We just finished an eleven night stay at this hotel  On the whole it was very satisfactory  It was clean and well carried for  We had a superior twin with Continental breakfast for         That took some negotiating on the phone direct  Being winter and the low season helped  The breakfast was adequate but without variety  Cold cereal    kinds  juice  italian salami  processed cheese slices  rolls and occasionally crousants  sp  tea or coffee and white or brown toast  For        person they could do better  Location in zone   was fine because it is       blocks from the Swiss Cottage tube stop on the Jubilee line which is frequent and very fast  Further  it is not as crowded as the Piccadilly line or the Victoria  Whines  The front desk staff was not terribly co operative at times  The sound on my TV got locked at a low level and I was told that they were all that way  That was on Friday  On Monday when I went to the front desk to complain again  the clerk sent someone up right away and it was unlocked  When I checked I was told that the reservation was without breakfast  I insisted that it included a full English breakfast  My husband had talked to the desk manager or someone on Monday and arranged it  He reluctantly looked up the reservation and found the note but said it was continental breakfast  I was too tired to argue the point  As it turned out the English breakfast was the same as the continental with the addition of cooked eggs  hash browns  bacon or sausage  beans and tomato  We did not need that much food so it worked out  But the clerk s attitude was surly at best  When we asked about a church for Mass same clerk had no idea but found a card with one on it  but then gave total incorrect directions  When we asked if there was a launderette near by  he thought there was one at the end of Eton St  Well that was a mile down the road  Basically it is poor front desk training and supervision  On the plus side  I did not have to wait until   pm to get into our room  I was it by      am  for which I was grateful On the whole it was a positive experience if one ignored the front desk staff  We would go back 
P =>   Nice good location   good price for value After the reading of the critics in tripadvisor I was positively surprised then I arrived at the hotel The reception desk was friendly and they asked if everything is allright with the rooms  The rooms were above average compare what I have already seen in London and quite spaceous  It is very close to underground station  just     meters  Breakfast was not extraordinary  but okay  
P =>   Nice and charming Swiss Cottage was a positive experience for our stay in london  I stayed there with my friend for   nights and felt that it was definitely worth the money considering the high prices of London hotels  The room was tidy and spacious  The beds were quite hard but that didn t bother me  I really liked the hotel s Victorian athmosphere  The neighborhood was really quiet and nice and the underground station just a few hundred meters away  The hotel floors were a bit squeaky but it only woke me up once when the neighbours came back in the night The breakfast was ok  the normal boring stuff but sufficient for giving the energy for sightseeing for a few hours  
P =>   once more a challenge  Every year we say that we can t face the inconvenience of staying here    but we go back  There s a seedy charm about the place  the rooms are big  the breakfast is pretty good  the area is quiet and convenient to the underground  We like the area particularly    it s away from  quot tourist London quot     and there s a feeling of living in the Hampstead area  So we ll keep going to the Swiss Cottage  I guess    as long as it survives    
P =>   Beware of hooded thieves in the night The room we had was a decent room on the first floor   nd floor european   It was very warm  so we opened the window   latching it so it was open about   quot   At     am  I was awoken by a noise and light  I opened my eyes to see a dark  hooded person standing in our room  I screamed as did my husband and he fled back out of the room through the window and down the fire escape  We called the front desk and they stated they would call the police  When we checked out  the clerk claimed they had never had this type of problem before  but the criminal must have seen the open window and took advantage of an opportunity  
P =>   Good location but hotel only OK I stayed here on business which was nearby  The price is good for the area but the rooms I saw were not very good  The bathroom widow in the first room offered did not close  The second was OK but very small  The electrical wiring seemed odd with switches turning on lights in other rooms    Bizarre On the plus side the underground station is very close and there is a good selection of cafes and resaurants nearby  
P =>  Going downhill I have stayed here numerous times  it was my place of choice when in London because of its convenient location and good prices  plus car parking  which is valuable  However it is getting a little dingy and rough around the edges  and at my last stay I found the bed just too uncomfortable  I am middle aged verging on elderly  so a youngster might not have the problems I had  Location is still excellent   lots of great restaurants plus ks and Spencer food nearby  Breakfast is varied continental or pay extra for cooked  with good and friendly service  Staff are very helpful  and I did not find noise a problem  in uary   Just the bed and a grubby bedspread  Prices still very good  plumbing is fine and bathroom great  Tea service in room which is nice  small tv but okay  
P =>  Its really a B i stayed at this hotel some years back and it was lovely  however  since being taken over by best western the standard has clearly gone down i was in between houses and had to stay for a week in may    quite frankly  its now just a done up b amp b  the entrance and lobby are still very nice but the large rooms are just shabby filled with cheap furniture and with beds which are so used out they bend in the middle  all in all its still quite good value for central london the staff are polite and they do serve a lovely breakfast  but sorry best western    im afraid wont be going back again 
P =>  A slightly frayed charmer with good rates in good nabe This review is for people who like to travel and not spend a fortune for a room that you hardly stay in  especially in very expensive London  We just came back from    days in London  broken up by a Chunnel trip to Paris and a few days in the Lake District  and had three different rooms in this lovely old four story building filled with antiques and paintings and Oriental rugs that has many charming features about it including a nice bar  a lounge with a piano and a large sitting room  The lobby is quite small however  They do a nice full English breakfast  included  in the basement which was very filling and kept us touring around longer than most breakfasts would have  The place is clean  the bathrooms are a good size and the toilets work wonderfully   as do the showers in the big English bathtubs  And we always had plenty of hot water  Every room has a phone and a small screen television  and you can get limited room service as well as a bucket of ice  and porter service as well   We found the beds to be quite comfortable  i e   I did not wake up with a backache every morning  There is also a very small elevator so request a room on the ground floor if you don t want to take the stairs  For    GBP a night for a good  quiet double  and convenient to the tube one block away   I would recommend the Swiss Cottage to smart travelers who can t afford The Ritz and would prefer to spend their money on gastropub food and shopping rather than on four walls you hardly stay in  By the way  there are good local restaurants nearby  e g   Arabesque  Indian  Thai  take away  a nice pub  and even a KFC and MacDonalds  and small grocery stores  if needed  We were only five tube stops from Westminster Abbey so Swiss Cottage is quite convenient to all the action   and also has  quot family rooms  quot  
P => tourist hotel class if price ok Stayed in triple for   nights y Ignoreprevious review This is a basic tourist hotel I got deal on internet for      inc very basic breakfast Ignore all bull about antiques etc  bric a brac Only accept newly refurbed room  newish carperts outside doors Given a dump at top but no prob to change They tried it on  Staff nice  kind  helpful but mainly foreign Very clean but no aircon a prob in summer Stayed over in Thistle Westminister at      a night  good class hotel  mod cons  Last word  bar in Swiss cottage is tiny and has no draft beer plus no   up any night Unless you get a great deal  miss  good location tube wise and quiet Jimmys restaurant on Finchley road excellant Thai and good value I was mislead by previous review 
P =>  Very nice budget hotel uMy wife and I just returned from an   day trip to London  and we stayed at this hotel  I highly recommend this hotel  The room was very clean  nicely decorated  and large by European standards  The bathroom was also very large  with a tub shower combo  tiled walls and floor and a pedestal sink  The hotel itself is a quaint  historic property with creaking floors and narrow  wandering hallways  The elevator is interesting as well  It looks like you re opening a closet door  and that s about the size of the elevator  The public rooms and halls were vere nicely decorated with antiques  Breakfast was excellent  served buffet style  A good selection of Continental breakfast items  as well as traditional English breakfast items such as fried eggs  bacon  sausage and baked beans  The staff was friendly and efficient  As for location  it depends what you re looking for  A first time visitor looking to be in the heart of the city would not be happy here  However  for someone who wants to be close to everything but off the typical tourist radar screen  this place is perfect  The hotel is a   minute walk to the Swiss Cottage tube station on the Jubilee line  You have direct access to Baker Street  Bond Street  Green Park and Westminster  Also the Number    bus goes to Oxford Street  Picadilly Circus and Trafalgar Square  It was very easy to get anywhere in London from here  The Swiss Cottage neighborhood is nice as well  There are a number of restaurants along Finchley Road  and the next tube station  Finchley Road  has the O  Centre  which has a wide selection of restaurants  We especially liked Wetherspoon s Pub  The neighborhood east of the hotel is also full of historic townhouse homes  It s a very nice area to stroll around in  So  all in all  I highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a nice budget hotel in London

P =>   Una sorpresa   
P => 
P =>   clean tidy very helpful friendly stayed here for two nights very nice room plenty of toiletries and towels very friendly staff clean throughout breakfast nice toovery close to tube station   mins quiet area 
P =>   Great hotel outstanding staff I just had the pleasure to stay in The Boltons on a quick trip to London and was pleasantly surprised  especially with the outstanding staff  The front desk reception was exceptionally courteous and helpful  their service attitude would stand out even in a   star hotel  The hotel is conveniently located near Earls Court  feels like new  very quiet  breakfast is good quality  I will come back to The Boltons on my next visit  
P =>   Good hotel excellent location The hotel has I think been recently refurbished as there was a slight paint smell in the lobby  The room was fine  compact and clean  I liked the location as it was near Earls Court Road Underground Station you come out at the Earls Court Road exit turn right  turn right again and on the left is the hotel around   minute walk but in a quiet street  Breakfast was good with a full English and cereal and fruit available  Polite staff as well  
P =>   st choice in earl s court Small but very clean hotel with a bussines atmosphere rooms were a bit small but the were fantastic and very clean deserves the  star tab Plus the great breakfast buffet  
P =>   Wonderful Hotel   great price  good location This was our first trip to England and we found Best Western The Boltons after extensive internet searches  We found the hotel to be very nice and were pleasantly surprised with the quality and pricing of the accommodation We  quot prepaid quot  our reservation including breakfast and were not disappointed  The process was efficient and confirmation was quick through the Best Western system The room was very comfortable providing very nice bedding  central air heating  a fresh appearance  extremely clean and included amenities such as flat screen TV and internet access  By London standards  the room was certainly of adequate size and functional  The bath is somewhat compact  but I am a relatively large man and had no difficulties taking full advantage of all the amenities Breakfast included quite a selection from both cold and hot selections  Breakfast selections were complete including eggs  meat  potatoes  breads  bakery items  cheeses  cereals  dairy items and juices   quite complete Getting around London was easy from this hotel is located in the Earls Court area and the  quot tube quot  station is one short block away   Get the Oyster card for public transport   very cost effective and easy to use  Lots of London restaurants provide almost any type of food  If you like Thai  try the Blue Elephant   only   tube stops from the hotel  
P =>  Great in its class nicely located This hotel is conveniently situated around the corner from subway station Earl s Court  which connects to two of the major Underground routes that take you to all the sights and sees in London Located on a sidestreet of the always lively Earl s Court Road  this hotel offers a gateway to a multitude of restaurants and shops in the immediate area  whilst also offering acces to the quiet and idyllic neigbourhoods of Chelsea and Kensington Really  the location could not be more perfect The hotel itself is a small hotel  and everything apart from the bed is indeed a size smaller  the lift  the rooms  the breakfast room  et cetera  I feel the best comparison to be made is that of a boutique hotel  everything is there  but dimensions are squeezed to the minumum  Next time we visit London  we will definitely rebook at this hotel  
P =>   Great Location comfortable but small rooms I knew the rooms were small but thank goodness there was only a double available when I booked  even though I was on my own  I am not sure how the other person would have got in and out of bed  save for crawling under the TV or climbing over the bed  I don t think that a very large person would have managed in the shower either  That said  I spent   very pleasant nights there  the room was clean  the bed very comfortable and I had everything I needed  free high speed Internet  tea and coffee on tap  an ironing board on request and lots of TV channels to choose from  Reception staff were friendly and helpful and supplied me with a European adaptor for a    deposit  I was on the  nd floor and not disturbed by traffic but I believe that the lower floors can be a little noisy  Ask for a higher floor when you book  One big gripe I often have is hearing people in other rooms  bathroooms  etc but this was not the case here and I could not hear anyone at all  The location is superb  just   minutes walk to Earls Court tube station  Plenty of restaurants and shops in the area and an easy walk to High Street Kensington  Breakfast was not included so I did not bother  One thing I found very odd was that the room service menu only had Indian and Chinese dishes with no exception  A sandwich  soup or dessert option would have been nice  it is hard to rate the rooms and value given that I was a single person in a double room  As mentioned  it was very comfortable for one but I paid for the priviledge but I have given them the benefit of the doubt with my scoring  
P =>   Smallest rooms I have ever seen  Rude staff  Great location  I booked a King executive room and made the booking over the phone  I checked several times over that it was a king bed and he confirmed it was  When I arrived  I found it to be barely a twin size bed  I spoke to the front desk  who was the man I made the reservation with and he informed me that its what a  quot Best Western quot  king is and that is what a king is in London  I have stayed in many hotels in London and never had a king like that  The rooom was nicely appointed but absolutely tiny  Great location but all the staff at the front desk were incredibly rude and unhelpful  
P =>  Great location clean and very good value for money Stayed in this hotel on a weekend break  Valentine s weekend  this year  Hotel is really close to Earl s Court tube station  situated in a quiet street off the main road  Booked through booking com  great value for money  Desk staff were very friendly and helpful  Rooms were on the small side but ended up with a  family  room for   of us with a double bed  single bed and a nice sized bathroom  The lift wasn t working when we were there so it was a bit of a struggle up the tiny winding staircase with suitcases but wasn t a big problem Only   downsides  The walls are very thin and in the morning I woke thinking that water was running down the walls next to my bed as someone was showering above Secondly  the breakfast room is very small so it s a bit of a squeeze but the food is varied and plentiful If I could get this hotel for a similar price again  I d definitely stay here due to cleanliness and convenient location for sightseeing and shopping      
P =>   Good Clean Hotel Just back from a stay at the BW Boltan s hotel  the hotel is very clean which to me is very important  The rooms are a little small but then again you don t go to London to sit in your hotel room all day  The hotel is very close to Earls Court station so handy for getting around London  Some pubs  restaurants and fast food takeaways just at the top of the road too  Rooms are all very modern with flat screen tv s etc and the street the hotel is based on is very quiet so not much noise at night and you can get a good nights sleep  Would stay here again when next in London as it was a reasonable price also  
P =>   great location great little hotel stayed here for   nights great location for the national history and the v and a museums all within walking distance superb italian and french restaurants along with pubs and the usual fast food outlets all within   minutes walk hotel small but well appointed very clean friendly staff plenty to eat for breakfast nice and quite hotel good nights sleep in a quite street  
P =>  Very nice Clean  good location  helpful staff  Highly recommended  
P =>   Too Small Room  Room      probably   m  including everything  bathroom  bedroom and wardrobe   No space for luggage at all  Bathroom is minimal  Bedroom is very noisy  I could hear everything from the neighbor room and the doors from others rooms snapped all day and night long  The elevator is so so so small that we couldn t accommodate our luggage  To be fair they have good breakfast  fine staff  cleanness  beautiful decoration and the free wireless worked well    just don t be mislead by the pictures  and if you are more than one person  forget it  
P =>   Perfect location The hotel is located in a quiet road just a short walk from Earls Court underground  It is close to M amp S Food  Boots and lots of little resturants and bakeries  The staff are very friendly and helpful The rooms are a bit small   normal for London  but they are modern and well thought out so it works  The bathroom is tiny   but again  they have worked well with what they have and the fixtures and fittings are new and very clean Two little problems  In the mornings sleeping past      is impossible as there are loud banging room and fire doors  The hotel has wireless access but no computer with internet access   useless for leisure travellers without their won computer 
P =>   Great experience Stayed in the hotel for four days with my daughter  We loved it  Hotel is beautifully decorated  clean  modern  Staff very helpful and friendly  It is close to the Earl s Court station  and parallel street has all convenient stores  pharmacy  M and S food store  post office  bank  exchange office etc  and the street itself  Pennywern  is very quiet  Great stay  
P =>   Perfect Option if you wish to be near Earl s Court I stayed here for a week during the time of the London Bookfair in mid il and couldn t have been more satisfied  My positive experience began some days before my arrival  as I needed to ship a good number of boxes in anticipation of the bookfair  I had phoned about a week before my arrival and discussed with the sublime  quot Andrea quot  that I would be shipping the boxes and she could not have been sweeter and more understanding  Prior to my visit and even during my visit she took the time and effort to email me to alert me of the arrival of each of the boxes  a level of service and consideration that I simply could not have expected and I m not sure would be duplicated by any hotel at any price The property itself has obviously been recently renovated and from lobby to stairway to the rooms  the glow is apparent  As an annual vistor to London for many years  I know the hotel situation quite well and I must say that the room was actually relatively spacious  As many of you know  that s not saying much by London standards but in any case  the room was absolutely more than I anticipated  in both size and finish  The shower could have been designed a little better  as it was impossible to not get the floor wet and the bathroom sink was too modern for its own good  but these are really nitpicky points  The bed was really comfortable and the sheets really seemed clean  and I am very sensitive to these points  The free wireless internet worked flawlessly  though the daily change of password was a bit of a pain but understandable from the hotel s perspective  What also struck me is also how nice all the front desk staff are  not just Andrea but everybody is sweet and genuinely happy to be working there  from all appearances  Even the typically grouchy night desk fellow was friendly and didn t grumble at all when i would come and go late at night  All in all  a resoundingly positive experience  made all the better by Andrea s kindness and consideration and a facility that s clean  well designed  except for shower and bathroom sink     and extremely well maintained  I can t imagine doing better in the Earl s Court area at even double the price  I ll see you again next year  Boltons     
P =>   Absolutely perfect    I have just spent   days in The Boltons and have only good things to say about this great hotel  The staff were all friendly  the room was spotless  modern and a nice flat screen tv and free wifi   a bonus  It s so easy to use the bus as well as the tube  both just down the road  Use London Transport site for routes and get an Oyster ticket if you are staying for more than one day   it s good for tube and bus use and cheaper  The C  bus goes direct to Victoria Coach Station if you need it I was sick while there and the staff rang me several times to see if I needed anything and to see if I was ok   most hotels don t even know your name once you have booked in  I loved this place and will definitely stay here again when I visit England I had a king bed room and a friend who stayed several nights had a double  The rooms are not huge but we were both more than happy with the space and the price for such nice clean  modern rooms  I was on my own and at no time felt insecure so ideal for single travellers  ks and Spencer Food is down on the corner too   a bonus   If you need anything not in the room just ask as they are more than happy to oblige The bus down the road goes direct to several museums  Also bus to the new Westfield Shopping Centre from Warwick Road end of Penywern Road  Earls Court Rd is one way so you come back via the Warwick Road end of Penywern  The hotel sits pretty much in the middle of the two roads so is very handy  
P =>  Perfectly packaged little hotel Having booked a hotel for my    year old daughter and myself as a  base  for our London weekend we were delighted with this hotel  Literally around the corner from the handy Earls Court tube station and set in a beautiful Avenue off a bustling little road with an M amp S  Boots  Subway local pubs and restaurants etc on it   the location couldn t have been better  The newly refurbished hotel is  compact but bijou  as they say  Grown men might have trouble fitting into the little lift and quadrant shower cubicle but ladies couldn t pick a friendlier or safer hotel  There is no bar or restaurant just a little breakfast room but the waitress when she noticed my daughter insisted she have hot chocolate with her breakfast and went into the kitchen to organise it herself  
P =>  nice little hotel stayed for   nights   the hotel is small with small rooms and a business look but it is clean and recently restored  No complaints but not great hotel either Overall Small beds  beautiful decor  nice breakfast  good location  
P =>   Great Location We stayed here back in ruary for four nights  It was a fantastic find   we got a great deal on       The hotel has recently been redecorated and the decor is fresh and stylish  The hotel was located two minutes walk from Earlscourt station which allowed for easy access all over London  There were plenty of shops and restaurants nearby The hotel is located off the main road and was peacefully quiet night and day The room was cleaned daily but it was VERY small  It had a wardrobe  desk  safe and flat screen tv We booked a twin room and I was very glad that we did as I think that other reviewers on various websites had mentioned that the doubles are very small  The beds weren t the most comfortable   very soft I would highly recommend the hotel for budget conscious travellers   great location for all the activities London has to offer  
P =>   perfect for lone travellers What a lovely hotel My friendt and I treated purselves to a last minute weekend away and booked out hotel through laterooms com which is the best website for booking hotels The hotel itself is only   mins walk from Earls Court transtation and is in the perfect location for exploring London The hotel has around    rooms and is fairly small but the staff are very friendly and helpul  We paid     for both of us for   nights which is very reaonable for london and had breakfast included The hotel is recently refurbished and in excellent condition  The rooms were so so small though  I have never had a hotel room as small as this but however they were in perfect condition and beautifly decorated  it would be perfect for lone travellers or people who dont mind getting a bit cosy Tea and coffee making facilities provided and our room was even cleaned in our   night stay Best shower I have ever had and the usual shampoo  conditioner and towels etc were provided Breakfast was buffet style and very good  Continental or full english and set us up for the whole day Plenty of places near by to eat too and not too expensiveOverall I thought this was a very good hotel and would stay here again 
P =>   Good Value for Money I booked a Sunday night via Laterooms com for              which was far cheaper than the      or so per night on the hotels own website  For     the room was fantastic value for money  but had I have paid the full Best Western price I would have been very disappointed  The room was very tastefully decorated and modern  but incredibly small  The double bed was pushed up against the wall with only one way into it  There was a small bedside shelf big enough for a cup and the hotel phone  There was a wall mounted flatscreen TV with all the major Freeview channels at the end of the bed  so you have to lie on the bed to watch TV  but I have no problem with that     Coffee Tea Hot chocolate facilities supplied but no mini fridge  There was a small but workable toilet shower room which was clean and very smart modern  The room was climate controlled  but the shower room wasn t and it did get a little cold  There was a buffet style breakfast which was included in the price   and this consisted of cereals  yoghurts  fruits  toast  croissants  sausages  scrambled eggs  hash browns  mushrooms and beans  Tea  Coffee  and juice was also included  The cooked breakfast wasn t fantastic in terms of the quality  but it was perfectly adequate  The staff seemed very friendly and the service was perfect  The rooms were very clean and well stocked  Wired and wireless internet was included free of charge The location was ideal  Three minute walk to Earl s Court tube station  and a short ride into central London  There were regular bus routes as well along Earl s Court Road  There are plenty of places to eat in strolling distance   everything from Burger King through to Subway  pubs  KFC and restaurants  All very reasonably priced I would definately stay here again if I could find a similar deal but I think I would try elsewhere if I had to pay any more than      night  I have stayed in Travelodge hotels which are much roomier   
P =>   a little gem this hotel is in an ideal position just a short walk from the earls court tube the room no    we stayed in was very bright  clean and the decor very nice the only complaint being the room was very small for a double room   breakfast room was small only   tables in total but very nice everybodys taste cooked continental the lift still not working for the price we payed        per night inc breakfast booked   laterooms com i think it was very good value for london and would stay again 
P =>   bolt hole from Earls Court Expo I am always really nervous when booking accomodation in london  because you never know what you are going to get for your money Traveling to Earls Court alone  to man an exhibition stand is very hard work and can be lonely  so a nice room with a lovely bed  decor  flat screen TV and inclusive Wifi   breakfast all for the excellent price of        is very warmly welcomed I really loved the room  and bathroom and the breakfast was great and the staff lovely I would reccomend to anyone traveling alone on business in this area of London  
P =>   Almost perfect I stayed here for   nights at the beginning of ruary and managed to get it for       a night which included breakfast  Overall I was very impressed with the hotel  the room was lovely with modern furnishings  a flat screen tv and a nice roomy shower  I had a few minor problems   The check in desk assigned me room     initially but then they realised there was somebody in it and changed me to     so that could have potentially proved problematic  When I got to my room  there were indeed   people coming out of     so i m glad he realised in time   Also  the lift isn t working at the moment  does say on the website  but as I was only on the  st floor that didn t bother me at all but it s worth noting in case you get a high floor  Another thing was a strange noise coming from the fan in my room which kept me up most of the first night  I couldn t work out what it was and it probably wouldn t affect you if you are not a light sleeper  ear plugs sorted me out  Overall  I liked the hotel  the internet access in the room was good  the breakfast was lovely  the location was perfect and I felt very safe coming back late at night  I would stay here again no problem   
P =>  A new clean good value hotel with a few teething problems  We booked a Double room at this brand new Best Western Hotel for three nights on Laterooms com for     a night inclding breakfast  The hotel is on a quiet road   mins  walk from Earls court Tube station which means easy access on the Picadilly line to Knightsbridge  and the West End of London  We checked into room     at  pm which was tastefully furnished and airconditioned with a flat screen T V  Breakfast was fine with both hot and cold options which was ideal to keep us going well through the day  Even the coffee was good  Generally we were very happy with the quality of the hotel and we thought it was excellent value for money  However we stayed for three nights and the elevator didn t work at all while we were there  also the airconditioning heating packed in on sunday night  but was working again on our floor on Monday night  The position of the toilet in our bathroom was somewhat unfortunate too  as it was so close to the towel rail that we had to sit sideways on it to avoid getting fried  All in all we felt we got a really good deal at     I m not sure if I would have felt the same if we had paid the Best Western website rate of       which claimed  falsely  to be the cheapest on the internet for the same room for the same   nights and despite their internet promises refused to honour the laterooms rate that we ended up booking

P =>   Lovely Hotel We are a young couple  and we stayed at the Cromwell for a romantic escape  The hotel it s clean  the staff it s nice and it s good located few steps away from the Metro I ll be back  
P =>   Don t listen to bad reviews  Absolutely great hotel  got a fantastic deal through      hotels  The breakfast and service was excellent  Big bonus that they serve breakfast until   am at weekends  We got a room on the  th floor     I requested not to have a basement room as we were staying for four nights  the rooms are small so I say the basement might feel quite enclosed  However  although the rooms are small  it s comfortable and very well laid out and staying for four nights was absolutely no problem  The location is perfect  really good restuarants around  Ask restuarant across the road perfect cheap eat and then the green door steak house down the road from the tube is a really good spot  Really loved this location and if flying to Heathrow all you have to do is get onto tube across the road  pay four pounds and you re there within    mins  
P =>   Basic room too small Excelent location for tube  buses etc  Within walking distance of V amp A Natural History and Science Museums  Hotel very modern  clean with helpful staff  But stear clear of the basic rooms  they are tiny  Best to pay that little extra for superior room or balcony room  
P =>   Never go to this hotel  Worst exprerience ever  If you want to feel basicaly comfortable you need a triple room at least  I mean a triple room for one person    Double rooms are horribly small   so two persons could hardly change positions and pass through each other Room pictures in the internet look like having quite a vast space that is absolutely false  
P =>   Every thing you needed   Perfect Hotel Perfect hotel  Location was great directly across the road from the tube station  easy access to all resorts and attractions  Hotel room was amazing  with queen size bed  clean and outstanding bathroom and outside terrace patio  The hotel was exceptionally clean could not doubt one thing  
P =>   Amazingly Great Budget Hotel Hello  After a very stressful search me and my girlfriend found this hotel based on reviews from TripAdvisor and its location so we chose to stay there for   nights  Having heard of London hotels we were a little bit afraid because it was our first trip together and we wanted it to be perfect   At first we asked for a room in the upper floors and soon the management answered us and agreed to assign one  When we arrived the staff was very friendly and helpful and they kept our luggage in a room because it wasn t check in time After a short visit to Stamford Bridge to buy Chelsea tickets we went back to the hotel and our room was ready  All our worries ended instantly  the room was beautiful and cozy and we had enough space to move around  besides the room was spotless  The bed was really confy and we fitted in nicely  the bathroom was stylish with enough towels and a nice hot tower rail  As for storage  we had a closet with a safe inside  The room also had a desk  a table and chair  flat screen TV  free tea and biscuits and air conditioned After our first night we went downstairs to have breakfast and it was also really nice  helpful staff and a nice variety of food with good quality in a buffet system  pretty much All You Can Eat   The breakfast ended at   am but they still served some people after that wich was nice  One advice  go early because it sometimes gets crowded and you need to wait for a table When we arrived back from sightseeing the room was very clean and the towels changed It was like this for all the   nights and we loved it  We only had two minor complaints  when the people in the room above walked in the area where our air con was it made some noise but it was no big trouble at all because overall the room was very quiet although it was facing the street  the second was a little stain in a pillow and another one in the mattress but it was well covered so we didn t mind The location was great as it has a Bus station in front of the hotel and Gloucester Underground around the corner with access to Central Picadilly District Lines  it also had plenty of places to eat  Burger King  KFC  Garfunkel s  Nando s  etc Like I said earlier we wanted it to be perfect and it came really close as we were very pleased and it certnaily helped our experience by giving us no worries at all  For sure we will come back 
P =>   Bargain gem great location Yes  the room was tiny  but tspotless  the bathroom quite nice  and the desk proved quite useful  We had a quiet room at the back overlooking an attractive courtyard and managed just fine in the small space  even after having stayed in larger rooms elsewhere on our trip  Location can t be beat    steps from the Gloucester Rd  tube stop    in lovely Kensington  Lots to do and see nearby and easy access by tube to all other points in London and of course on the direct line to from Heathrow  Staff was helpful and the price was a bargain compared to other hotels in the area  Free wifi was appreciated  especially since other London hotels charge quite a bit for internet access  
P =>   The Cromwell Had a   night stay here last night and wanted to post whilst fresh in my mind  We were going to the Royal Albert Hall and there is a fair selection of hotels to choose from along this stretch of Cromwell Road  only a    minute or so walk away from the Hall  However the Cromwell was about fifty pounds cheaper than any other in the locale  being on a tight budget I plumped for this one in Kensington  rather than a cheaper one further away  I was worried that I d paid only eighty pounds and I was so pleased with the hotel  although we were in one of the basement rooms we still had plenty of natural light from the high window and the room was lovely and newly refurbished  in creams and aubergine particularly the bathroom  which was thoughtfully fitted out  stylish with a great bath and shower  Being towards the rear of the hotel  we could hear no traffic noise at all and but for   small detail we would have slept really soundly the room was very comfortable with great aircon  The tiny detail was that my husband is  ft    not super tall  and the beds are way too short  his feet hung off the end and this made his night quite uncomfortable  Had we been staying longer  this would have been an issue Its a real maze thought  so beware  we got lost several times  As for location it is right around the corner from Gloucester Rd tub    minute walk  and a leisurely    minutes all the way down to Harrods and Harvey Nics in Knightsbridge  or   mins on the tube  but it was so warm during our stay we walked everywere  Kensington Gardens on the way to the Hall are worth a visit and we sat and ate lunch there in glorious sunshine  Across the road from the hotel are shops and a little arcade  A quick mention to Ask Restaraunt across the road  fantastic attentive service with an enthusiastic knowledge of their product   not always the case in chain eateries  and lovely reasonably priced italian dishes Reception staff were lovely and helpful and the area was small but nicely laid out  I will definately stay again if they have larger rooms with slightly longer beds  
P =>   Delightful London Home for   days We are very pleased with our room  Quite stylish and they use the small space to all of it s advantage  Love the bathroom with it s overhead Rain shower head and then the side moveable shower head  Best part is our little balcony that looks out into a huge tree and grassy area  Yes the room is small but it is the same size room that we had in Manhattan and has not been an issue for the two of us Location is excellent for the tube is almost at the corner  several excellent restaurants just within walking distance  Ask is right across the street and has excellent Italian food and a few blocks away is Little India with the most amazing Indian food  Across the street is Boots for anything you forgot to pack and there is Waitrose  grocery store  for snacks  etc  We ve been popping by each night for a bottle of wine The one thing I would not repeat again is the breakfast here  Dreadfully expensive and not very good  Actually it has been difficult to find a good American breakfast here We would definitely stay here again and have been quite pleased with our temporary London home here at the Cromwell  
P =>   Will stay here again I researched a good value hotel in great location and found The Cromwell Hotel to fit our needs  We were delighted with all and stayed for   nights on a room only basis  We booked direct with Best Western and got a     by just asking  We changed from our original room to a larger room with a fabulous terrace  Great modern bathroom with powerful shower which is a must for us  And very very comfy bed  Flat screen TV and mini fridge which is always handy  Would      recommend this room but would suggest paying the bit extra for the terrace room  It s worth it   mins walk to Tube station  boots  Tesco and some really good bars and restaurants which we sampled  Will stay here again for sure  
P =>   Nice Hotel  Nice Staff We enjoyed our stay clean  good breakfast  friendly staff  amp  great location  
P =>   Great hotel Great hotel with very good service   Great staff  clean rooms   great location  good rates    Expensive and small breakfast Incredible food at ASK  right across the street  
P =>  Great hotel to stay at This hotel was a great place to stay at  The consierge helped a lot in finding out places to go and how to get there  It also has great location  right by the Gloucester Road Underground Station  There is a great market next to the hotel and also a wide variety of eating places nearby as well  
P =>   Great Hotel Great Location I stayed at this hotel from t       My primary purpose was business but also was there on some leisure time as well  I was visiting from the USA  This hotel was a retro fit into a hostel  I stayed in room      Note that the lift only goes to the  th floor  you will have to walk your luggage up to the  th floor  It did not face the street so I had a nice view of trees and it was quite  My room was clean and modern  It was tiny but you are in London and spaces are tight in London so as expected  If I was in my room  I was in my bed sleeping so this was fine for me  The staff is very friendly  helpful and willing to answer questions  They made me feel welcome from the moment I walked into the door  This hotel is a great location  There is a grocery store directly across the street  There is a Starbucks and restaurants right in the area  The tube station is also right across the street where you can catch   different tube lines  I could easily get to all tourist sites without changing tubes  I also walked to Harrods one afternoon which was a nice walk to a great shopping area  The rate was very reasonable for a London hotel  If I return to London  I would stay here again and recommend it to others looking for a good central hotel  
P =>  Very good hotel considering the price and location The location and cost of the hotel cannot be faulted  However  our room was at the front of the hotel in the basement  As such  there was very little light in the room  a view was non existent  an external staircase ran directly across our window and you could feel the vibrations from Cromwell Road at busy times  It was a good job the room had adequate  but noisy  air conditioning because opening a window was not really an option  That said  as a base to go out and explore London with Gloucester Road underground station a few minutes walkaway  I would recommend it  However  if you plan on spending a lot of time in the hotel  I would go elsewhere or ask for a room on an upper floor  preferably to the rear  As for the service and cleanliness  both were acceptable but not fantastic  All in all a satisafactory stay  
P =>  Nice Hotel   Great Location The hotel was perfect  clean and the location was perfect  just five minutes walk from Glousester Road tube station Hotel staff was very polite and they want to help you with everything Breakfast was good  
P =>   Great Boutique Hotel I have just returned from a trip to the UK with my    year old grand daughter  I am an expat Brit and was very concerned about the hotel as I had heard bad reports about small London hotels    however  it was just wonderful   the furnishings were top notch  the beds comfortable and the bathroom roomy and well appointed  The room was small   I have stayed in smaller in Spain     but perfectly adequate for our stay and certainly had everything you could wish for   good quality hair dryer  tea making facilities  shampoos  shower cap  etc   The location is ideal  being very close to Gloucester Road Tube station  and many pubs  eating establishments and stores  including a Boots right opposite   very handy   One tip   we bought Oyster cards for the week  which was a wonderful cheap way to get around London  I had not heard of these before  We found the front desk personnel very helpful and cheerful and we both enjoyed the breakfast  my grand daughter is a vegetarian    a full English breakfast was very important to us given our hectic scheduleI met with some of my old school chums and recommended the hotel to them if they ever wanted a nice get away to London for a few days  If I was to return I would certainly stay here Thanks for helping making our trip memorable  
P =>   Perfect little hotel This hotel is the perfect hotel  The location is just a few blocks away from Knightsbridge where all the great shopping is  such as Harrods  It s close to many museums and it s right across the street from a tube stop and a grocery store  There are plenty of resturaunts in area too  The hotel was recently renovated so all the furniture  bedding and bathrooms are brand new  very modern  It is super clean and the staff were all very helpful and friendly  You can t beat the price for a London hotel  We were very impressed with this hotel  We stayted in room     and it had a bay window which gave us a litte more space  We would stay here again  
P =>   Nice cosy little hotel   perfect for young couples Nice little hotel  the room was small  but we had a lovely patio outside the room to hang out  The windows that opened onto the patio were a little strangely fitted  but otherwise we had a nice stay  Breakfast was hearty and staff were friendly and helpful  Recommended for a decent stay in central London  Gloucester Road tube station was just a stone s throw away from the hotel  
P => Little Gem I stayed in this hotel with a friend for one night when we were visiting Wimbledon and thought it was great value for money  I got a good deal via the Travel Republic website   The hotel has recently been refurbished though I don t think all the rooms are finished yet so would advise to request a newly refurbished room when booking  The room was small but certainly no smaller than most other London hotels I have stayed in   it was beautifully decorated in boutique style decor and the bed was so comfy  The reception staff were friendly and very helpful  We were on a room only deal so can t comment on the breakfast as we ate out   there are lots of cafes nearby  The hotel is about a   minute walk from Gloucester Road Tube Station so in a very convenient location if you are visiting the west side of London  I would definitely stay here again  
P =>   Comfortable stay but TINY room We stayed in this hotel for one night  At the moment it has scaffolding up outside  which does look quite off putting  however once inside  the hotel is very clean and modern  The reception staff were very friendly and helpful  We arrived before our room was ready  but they took care of our bags  so that we could go out instead of waiting  and even had them taken up to our room  so they were there for us when we returned  The lift in the hotel is slightly archaic  so after using it only once  we did opt for the stairs from that point on  The biggest negative we experienced whilst in this hotel  was that our room was absolutely TINY  It was quite a squeeze to have two people and two bags in there  However  the decor was modern and clean  although the walls were covered in scuff marks  but I would put that down to the lack of room to move around  The ensuite was lovely  with floor to ceiling titles and a good size shower  but no bath  Breakfast was included in our room rate and was OK  I would strongly recommend that if breakfast wasn t included in your room rate  not to pay the        and instead walk   minutes down the road where there are nice cafe s and a Starbucks  Whilst I appreciate this is the normal price for hotel breakfasts  this one in particular  due to service and food on office  really isn t worth the money  Location wise this hotel is great  only two minutes walk from the nearest tube  on circle and district line   We did stay in this hotel for leisure reasons and if you can stand to be in a really small room  then would recommend this hotel for one maybe two nights  However I don t recommend it for business travellers  Whilst the room did have a desk  it was so close to the bed that you couldn t really have pulled the chair out enough to comfortably sit at it  I have stayed at the Holiday Inn across the road for business reasons and this was much more amenable  However  I would like to point out that The Cromwell did have a more homely manner  
P =>   excellent value for money   very clean nice hotel  clean modern rooms with all the facilities you need  very friendly staff and excellent location  we will come back      
P =>  They made us feel like family like their favorite relatives  My cousin and I stayed               Our  st night was a double with a lovely view of the garden and lower terrace  Last   nights we were moved to a larger twin on the ground floor in front  They are painting the building so our high window was covered with cloudy plastic  Perfectly clean  nice large towels  comfortable beds  no street noise  The friendly and fun staff accommodated all of our needs  Conveniently located near Gloucester Tube  We were fortunate to be able to check in early after an early morning arrival from the US  and store our luggage after check out until our evening departure  We would stay here again  and again  
P =>   Would Stay at The Cromwell again We were very pleased with our accomodations this past week  We did upgrade to  quot executive rooms quot   one on each floor  and would recommend this  The rooms were spacious enough  very clean  and very nice bathroom  The beds were comfortable  the staff helpful  overall  a very nice experience  The location was great  right across the street from the Gloucester Rd  tube station  perfect for zipping around to places in London  We did not eat in the hotel restaurant in the basement  but took advantage of Starbucks right across the street  and a wonderful patisserie  Paul  also across the street  Furthermore  there was a Boots Pharmacy across the road  and a tourist shop post office for sending those postcards to family back home  There were several local pubs within very short walking distance including the Stanhope Arms  to get some lager and to mingle with the locals  esp  over a  quot football game  quot  The only drawback to our hotel  They are re doing the facade of the hotel and so scaffolding and plastic sheeting covered the whole of the building  was noisy during the weekday mornings if we wanted to sleep a little late  
P =>  Super Tiny but Good Value This is a great hotel for the solo business traveler  but I would not recommend it to families or couples on account of the very small size of the rooms and hotel in general  The free WiFi worked amazingly well  I was on the second floor   hairdryers in every room  and relatively spacious bathrooms make it a great place when you need to relax after work  The single rooms really are incredibly small  I had to put my suitcase on the bed just to close the door   but it s not bad if you re just by yourself  People need to understand that hotel rooms in London are not going to compare in size to a Holiday Inn in Montana  Rooms are all re done and have a clean and modern design  and the location is INCREDIBLE  Literally anything you could need is within two blocks  Great access to tube  Gloucester Road   large supermarket  bars  restaurants of all kinds  and in a very safe posh neighborhood  Hotel staff is hit or miss  some are very nice and others are pretty unremarkable  
P =>  Good hotel well situated  The hotel is just a couple of minutes walk from Gloucester Rd tube station   and there are shops  pubs and restaurants close by We were a little worried to find the hotel covered in scaffolding and work being carried out  Our allocated room was at the front of the hotel  with scaffolding and tarpaulins blocking out the light  We asked for the room to be changed  wich was done quickly without any fuss  The receptionist told us the work was to remove years of paint  and to restore the original Victorian brick facade Our room was spacious  clean and well presented   as was the first room we were offered   The hotel interior was refurbished about    months ago  The room had a flat screen TV and a safe We booked the hotel through a  late deals  website  and got full English Breakfast as part of the deal  A bargain as it turns out   the breakfasts were worth        each   There was a good choice of food  the chef checked at frequent intervals and replenished as required  There have been comments made about queues for tables at breakfast  We had no problems  but the hotel was very quiet  The breakfast room did seem small for the size of the hotel though All the staff members we encountered were friendly and helpful We would certainly consider this hotel again We were told that the hotel  and presumably many others were unusually quiet because of the credit crunch  There should be some deals to be done   
P =>   Excellent  I stayed for   nights whilst in London with work  I booked   nights through Travel Republic and got an excellent deal  The room was single  so small   but perfectly formed  It really is newly refurbished  the shower room was quality and the decor tasteful and in excellent condition  Attention to detail also good with everything thought of  On the first night my next door neighbours were very noisy  and drunk  and at   am I phoned reception who went straight up and sorted things out  The next morning they enquired about my welfare saying that the people responsible had been asked to leave  mine was not the only complaint   Breakfast was georgous and very fresh and tasty  The location was stunning too  right next to the tube  The staff were very helpful and attentive  Sorry to gush  but I was delighted with this hotel and will return with my husband for a weekend  
P =>  Except for the Tiniest Room    It is Good  The last time when I was in London in       I stayed at a B amp B in Sussex Gardens as it was very close to Paddington Station which has the HEX to Heathrow  This time I found this hotel  Best Western The Cromwell  for an average of      including breakfast  per nite for   nites at alpharooms com from           Before we left for our holidays to the UK in      I called the hotel to re confirm my bookings and also to inform them that I will be arriving late on check in date by train from York and to put in a request for a quiet room facing the garden It was very easy to locate the hotel from Gloucester Road tube station  only a   min walk  across Cromwell Road  We were greeted at the reception on arrival  the room check in was very efficient and quick  We were given room      on the ground level facing the back  It was one of the tiniest room I ve seen  the room was so very small and cramp  You could literally open the door and jump right into bed  There isn t much space to walk around let alone open one s luggage Besides the space constraints  the room and bathroom was clean  comfortable and newly renovated  It is equipped with a flat panel LCD TV  hairdryer  tea  coffee making facility  free Wifi  a writing desk with chair  an open clothes cupboard and a hot towel rail is available in the bathroom What I liked about this hotel    Great location  Right across from the tube station that has the Piccadilly Line to Heathrow Airport  Piccadilly Circus  Covent Garden and King s Cross St  Pancras  Eurostar to Paris   the main Circle Line for most tourist attractions in Central London  Paddington Station  Westminster  Notting Hill  Tower Hill    Near food outlets and other major hotels like Holiday Inn  Waitrose Supermarket is across the street  Starbucks around the corner along Gloucester Road  the larger Sainsbury Supermarket is just    m down along Cromwell Road  a Royal Mail Post Office is at the end of same block  bus stop right in front of the hotel that can get you to Knightsbridge and Central London    The Museum Mile is a short walk away along Cromwell Road with Natural History Museum  Science Museum and Victoria and Albert Museum    Buffet Breakfast was sufficient and decent  Each morning  there was bacon  scambled eggs  grilled tomatoes  grilled mushrooms  sausages  baked beans  cereals  bread with a toasting oven  yoghurt  fruits  juices  tea and coffee  The breakfast area is clean and comfortable    free Wifi internet    friendly hotel staff My irks about this hotel    SMALL and CRAMP room    limited TV Channels    bad drainage in the shower cubicle  BUT the housekeeping efficiently attended to that problem even without us having report the choke as we forgot about it when we left the room early in the morning in a rush and after coming back we were pleasantly surprised that shower drainage was cleared     Double doors in the room  ie  The main room door   another door to get the bed   As the room was already very tiny  not sure why they needed to have   door in the rooms  besides having another door to the bathroom Overall impression  Good except for the tiniest rooms ever  I cannot help on emphasising about their tiny room   But we didn t mind as we only wanted a decent and clean place to sleep the nite  We  being on holiday  were out and about all day  The hotel staff were nice and friendly  I will still consider Best Western The Cromwell on my next return to London  I do not mind staying here again  I am willing to recommend this hotel to friends  
P =>   The Cromwell was just as we expected I agree with all the previous comments this Hotel is in a very good location with the tube nearby and lots of shops and restaurants on the doorstep the only downside is the size of the room we had     which was side facing and there was traffic noise it was also tiny and Ive got bruises to proove it The staff were freindly and helpfulFor a short stay though it had everything 
P =>   Small indeed   but excellent Sat along busy Cromwell St is this little Kensington gem  The hotel is squashed together like a typical London home  but it s a very classy establishment All areas are stylishly renovated to a high standard  rooms feature everything you need  including large Plasma TVs and smart bathrooms  Breakfast in the basement  whilst simple in choice  is served in a pleasant environment with attentive staff  Round the clock room service is also available with a small selection of items My room was on the  th floor  rear facing and was peaceful and comfortable  A great choice  heartily recommended  
P =>   cool stayed at hotel at the beginning of ember  Very good location  Staff was very friendly and helpful  At last in London I saw breakfast of acceptable quality for reasonable price  Wi fi free of charge   excellent  of course room was extremely small but this is the case for most of hotels in London of course if you dont stay in       hotel  
P =>  Very pleasant surprise Usually unimpressed with London hotel rooms this was a very pleasant surprise  Room was an executive double   not enormous but plenty of room for double bed  sofa  easy chair and table as well as chair with dressing table  Everything looks very newly refurbished with lovely bathrooms   good shower  heated mirror  etc Double glazing was reasonably effective at cutting out the traffic noise and staff extremely helpful throughout  
P =>   Excellent renovated hotel with a boutique feel Like most London hotels the rooms are small  especially compared to hotels in the United States  this however is really the only complaint I can make Location is extremely convenient with Gloucester Road tube station one block away and the surrounding neighborhood is lively  quiet at night though  with lots of restaurants and cafes near by  there is also a nice grocery store directly across the street The hotel is in an old housing complex  extremely common in London  that appears to be very recently renovated  The inside is clean and modern  Our room was on the  th floor and had a great view of the street with windows that opened  The room it s self was very clean and had a contemporary style  The bathroom was excellent  clean  had a nice shower  and well lit  Free WiFi is available in the lobby and the hotel rooms The service was amazing  the staff was always extremely polite and accommodated all our requests  Our flight didn t leave until    at night the day we checked out and the hotel held our bags so we could enjoy London during the day  
P =>   Liked it a lot Stayed here for three nights at the end of ember For my purposes the room was fine  I was on my own  and got a room on the fifth floor  It had a double bed  shower and flat screen tv  It was facing away from the main road so was quiet Although the room was small  for me  who was out during the day  it was perfectly acceptable and clean The lifts only went up to the fourth floor so I had to walk up a flight of stairs  Again it was no problem I didn t book breakfast there  but there are a load of places round the corner next to Gloucester Road Tube For the price I would recommend it very much  
P =>   Great Location but very small My wife and I stayed   nights in ober at this hotel  Overall  we were pleased with our stay but were getting claustrophobic by the end  Good value for money  but really better suited for a shorter stay  Room was clean  but very small  Very limited space for keeping your clothes   a place to hang some and a shelf or two  There is free wi fi  a plasma television  and desk  for Room      sitting there blocks off the doorway from the bedroom to the entrance area and bathroom   a real nuisance when there is two of you   Location is fantastic for anyone using the Tube  likes museums or going to the park for a walk or run  It is very close to the Gloucester Road station  with a variety of restaurants in the area  and two grocery stores  we used these for picking up food for our own continental breakfasts for about   pounds   Hyde Park is only about a   minute walk away  very large and enjoyable park   as are the Museum of Natural History  Science Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum  Easy to get to the theatre district  
P =>   Clean  My husband and I stayed four nights at The Cromwell  The room was super clean  modern and had a flat screen TV  The bathroom had a full tub with shower  The only downer for the room was the size  It was small  We knew this when we made the reservation  but were still a little surprised when we were not able to fully open the bathroom door because it it hit the foot of the bed  Not a huge deal  We were in London for the sightseeing not for the hotel  The staff was really friendly and they made sure that if we needed anything at all we could ask them  The tube stop was amazily close as were two grocery stores  a pharmacy  a Starbucks and a several cafes and shops it was a great location to base our vacation from  
P =>  Veal crate with Plasma screen and shower  quot Not enough room to swing a cat quot  said one review  Well  if you did you d knock it out that s for sure  Room     is the size of a veal crate If you stay in some rooms i m sure it s fine  Mine was laughably small  You could just about squeeze between the bed and the wall  the bed and the open wardrobe and the bed and the door   and it was claustrophobic beyond belief They shouldn t be selling these rooms basically unless it s a     a night deal Cold air conditioning but no heat  Fabulous on a cold night Service was fine but the room is embarassing  Great for agorophobics i m sure but not for claustraphobics or anyone else for that matter Pick the right room or go somewhere else  
P =>   Loved It  My husband and I stayed at this hotel in ust and we couldn t have been happier  The location is great  About a five minute walk from the tube at Gloucester Road  Close to two supermarkets if you wanted to buy snacks for the room and close to a great cafe for breakfast if you don t want to pay for the hotel breakfast  The staff were lovely  We were in London for our wedding and they could not have been kinder or more friendly  We stayed in the larger style double room  It was clean and modern and perfect for our needs  We highly recommend this hotel and plan to stay here on our return visits to London and speaking as a bride I was incredibly touched to find fresh flowers and champagne in our room on our wedding day  A thoughtful touch that was very much appreciated  The Manager and his staff really make the place special  
P =>   Small but perfectly formed This small hotel was really excellent value for money  The room was bright  modern and spotlessly clean  Although not great for swinging cats it suited two females away for some shopping and sightseeing  Our room was twin bedded and there was enough space to push the beds apart  Tea  coffee facilities and a huge wall mounted flat screen TV  The bathroom was small and neat with everything we needed Breakfast was the usual but better than many large hotels in that it was super efficient and staff throughout the hotel were very friendly  For a London hotel opposite Gloucester Road tube station it was outstanding value for money  
P =>   What a gem What a gem of a hotel  Very clean  modern room and a very helpful  efficient staff  The most pleasant staff we ve met for a long time  in particular Diana and Vold The position  too  is good  with a bus stop directly outside to take you into the West End and the Tube almost opposite  Do purchase your daily travel card which covers both buses and tubes What more could you want in London where most hotels tend to be tired 
P =>   A good stay  My boyfriend and I travelled to London with a friend couple of ours  and we all stayed at The Cromwell  The other couple received a pretty ok sized room in the basement  with no window   and my boyfriend and I got a room at the top floor  which was tiny  with a tiny window  There were no problems with our room aside from the fact that it was extremely small  It wasn t possible to open the bathroom door all the way because the bed got in the way  But a fine place to rest and sleep after a day in London  The cleaning was always well done We didn t have breakfast included in our stay  and we chose to eat breakfast somewhere else because the hotel charged        for full English breakfast  which we thought was quite pricey  The hotel s location in Chelsea South Kensington is great  so there are lots of good breakfast spots nearby  and only a one minute or so walk to the underground station Gloucester Road  Also lots of shops and museums  like the Natural History Museum and the Science Museum The staff of the hotel were friendly  helpful and surprisingly young All in all  a good stay  
P =>   Just the business  I stayed one night for a conference in Imperial College  I chose it for its convenience to the tube station and the conference venue I was very pleased  The hotel was small and quiet  but very welcoming and clean  Seems to have been refurbished recently The room was small but more than adequate for me alone  It was very clean and well furnished  Staff were welcoming and helpful  Breakfast was fresh and tasty I would happily stay again  
P =>  Standard double more like a single I stayed at the Cromwell for   week with my husband while he was in London on business  We had booked a standard double via the internet  Lovely hotel  fabulous and friendly staff  The interior is very nice clean and modern  Our room however  even though very nice  wasn t big enough to swing a cat  We could have coped with it for one night  but we were staying for a whole week and a room that you can t move in without bumping into each other was simply impossible  I measured the room and it was    x   feet  sorry old school    With the bed in it  the desk    side tables  wardrobe etc  there was no room for us  We had to walk sideways past the bed to get to the miniscule bathroom and there was absolutely nowhere for our suitcases  I believe this room would be ok for one person for a night or    but definately not   people for a week  So  after one night of extreme claustrophobia  we upgraded to an executive room  and wow what a difference  We could move at last  Same interior  very nice indeed  and space   Gloucester road tube station is within   minutes walk from the hotel  as is Tesco  Waitrose  Starbucks   all of which come in handy as there is no restaurant or mini bar   There is a breakfast room however  but we didnt have time for breakfast so can t comment on that  Overall  if that s the part of town you need to be in  then it s a great hotel and surprisingly well priced too  
P =>  Warm and Friendly Welcome I stayed here with my elderly and disabled mother and received graet service from really kind and friendly staff  They were helpful with mum  held doors open  always had a smile and made the stay an absolute pleasure  
P =>  Great Hotel Fantastic Location If i could sum this hotel up in one line it would be  quot well  i m definitely staying here again   quot  Without a doubt  i wouldn t look at staying anywhere else in London again My boyfriend and I stayed here for   nights      e   and paid      for   nights including breakfast  This was the TOTAL price  not each   So really  only     each per night  Bargain It is obvious from the minute you walk up the steps from the road  that the hotel is extremely well maintained  clean  modern and has everything you need  Our bedroom was lovely  maybe a little on the small side  but we were only here to rest our heads   and the bathroom very luxurious with a great  powerful shower  We had a huge flat screen TV opposite the bed  with a good choice of tv channels  The room had tea coffee making faciltiies  hairdryer  space to hang your clothes  full length mirror   all the things you need to make your weekend run smoothly  Oh  and a paper left outside your room each morning  Great for the boyfriend to read  while i was getting ready We were on the  th floor  and i can honestly say  we never heard a peep from anyone during our stay  It was very quiet The breakfast was served up until   am  and there was plenty to choose from  and i must say  very delicious What a fantastic location the hotel is in  too  You can practically hit a tennis ball to the Gloucester Road tube station  it s that close  And Gloucester Road tube is a great one  with   of the best lines running through it  so you really can be on your way to all the main attractions within minutes  If you fancy a walk  the Museum of Natural History is less than   minutes walk  and the very centre of Knightsbridge  including Harrods  is within       minutes walk  Some of the buildings along Cromwell Road are divine  and it makes an enjoyable walk I just can t fault the place  Wish i was still there  and still in London  
P =>  Great Hotel Great Location  I stayed here for   nights to see London   As a single female traveller  it was a really friendly small hotel where the staff were very helpful and accommodating  It is so close to the tube station that I felt very safe getting home late at night  The decor is clean  modern and bright  the hotel is extremely comfortable with a warm atmosphere in a lovely old London house  The bathroom was beautiful  very modern and very very clean with a bath  shower and thick white towels  I cannot fault this hotel at all and will definitely be returning  
P =>  Nice stay at the Cromwell I just wanted to reiterate what many of the other reviewers have said  I recently stayed at The Cromwell because it met my three criteria  located between Earls Court and South Kensington  reasonably priced and clean  I was not disappointed  The hotel was very modern  the room was clean  although small but that s what it get in London  and there was a small bar area in which to relax and have drinks  I made the reservation through the best western website and paid just over    pounds per night for a double room which I thought was very reasonable  I would stay here again  
P =>   Great Location Good Stay Just returned from a last minute trip to London  staying at The Cromwell  Location was excellent     minutes from Gloucester Road Tube and a short walk from Natural History Museum  Science Museum and V amp A and the open top bus tour stops picks up from the bus stop at the tube  Hotel itself was clean  check in was easy  They did ask for a credit card to preauthorise for extras  of which we had none  but gave us a receipt on leaving showing nothing was charged to it and have had no problems  One of our room keys was a bit tempramental  something to do with the magnetic strip  but staff were always helpful and friendly  Room itself was in the basement   nice and quiet as we were between a boardroom and cupboard  much better location in practise than that sounds    We were a bit concerned about reviews commenting on small room size so had booked an executive room  This was a nice size  though it has   twin beds pushed together rather than a double as expedia suggested  and very clean  The bathroom had a brilliant shower and the room was well made up each day  We didn t have breakfast so can t comment but there is a Garfunkels right across the road and the Museums are close enough to have croissants in their cafes before exploring the exhibits All in all had a really good stay   wanted a nice hotel as a comfortable base for exploring London for a few days and this was perfect  Based on our stay would have no problems recommending it  
P =>  Comfy Convenient Hotel I stayed in this hotel on a short trip to London in Fall       and found it to be an excellent value for the price I paid  First  all hotels in London  and throughout Europe  are going to be small so do know that space is limited here as it is everywhere else  That aside  the room was comfortable  I had a nice view of the residential area behind the building and the tube is very convenient  the stop is immediately across the street   Wireless internet and flat screen TVs are big  modern perks here  A tea maker with biscuits replenished each day were also a treat as I didn t have to leave my room for a snack  The bathrooms are large  bright and very clean  My room was always well stocked with towels throughout my stay  I didn t have much interaction with the staff but my limited experience was good  I had no problem checking in around   AM  much earlier than my check in time  and was able to shower and unpack before leaving for the day  Checkout was also no problem  It s about ten minutes  on the tube  to the Oxford Street shops  twenty to Waterloo and the south bank area  My ride to Heathrow was also only about forty minutes I didn t eat at the hotel but can recommend fish and chips from a pub across the street and there are tons of stores next to the tube  Would certainly tell my friends to stay here and I would stay here again any time  
P =>  loved it   great hotel  rooms small but recently renovated  if you don t like noise ask for a room at the back on the    floor   we stayed here and it was very quiet  staff very helpful and friendly  breakfast good but overpriced  we had it as part of package deal    italian cafe round the corner opposite tube which does a good breakfast or waitrose over the road if you need a nibble    great stay  would definately use again next time in london  
P =>  Loved It     We loved this hotel  The front desk staff was friendly and accomodating  they even allowed us to check in about   hours early  The room was small but very clean  comfortable and modern  The Gloucester Road underground station is right across the street which allowed easy access to anywhere in the city  There are plenty of restaurants  cafe s  and places to shop nearby  For the price of this hotel it exceeded our expectations  I would definitely stay here again  
P =>  Great little hotel great location Spent a night there with my husband and son  Hotel is in a great location for the Royal Albert Hall where we were spending an evening and also good for the tube for other locations Hotel staff were extremely efficient and pleasant  Breakfast was excellent and the rooms we had  although small  were beautifully clean  Would stay there again without a doubt  
P =>   Great Location small rooms but overall pretty good         for London For London  the Cromwell Hotel is a hidden gem  a reasonably that is very modern The rooms in the hotel are very small  absolutely fine if you re on business or if you re sightseeing in London  if you want to spend large amounts of time relaxing in your room  the Cromwell isn t for you  but if you want a clean comfortable hotel with free wi fi and a decent breakfast  including a free newspaper    you should try the Cromwell I have had been unlucky enough to pay the same amount as I did at the Cromwell  in other London hotels  and the Cromwell stands out as the best hotel I have stayed in  in this price bracket for a long time  
P =>   Great Experience Date              this is my first time to visit London  the hotel could add to me a lot of comfort very clean   nice internet free  but the small single room the staff is very lovable  amp  helpful  
P =>  Good quality for nice price Nicely renovated in      with modern furniture including    quot  large flatscreens and good bathroom  Not the old fashioned English style carpets  etc   Rooms are rather small like any other hotel in London  so I took a double room for myself  only    pounds more  which is o k  Friendly staff  Continental breakfast is basic  English breakfast is  if you like it  good  
P =>   Very friendly staff Hotel staff extremely friendly and welcoming on arrival and departure   maybe they ve listened to the previous reviewer Everywhere very clean  the place must have been recently refurbished Room was VERY small but perfectly clean and cosy  It had free wifi access  large LCD TV on wall  tea coffee and compimentary newspaper  Bed was comfortable too  A decent hot breakfast the next morning rounded my brief stay off nicely The property s big selling point is it s location  in lively area good for tourists and business people alike  Right opposite Gloucester Rd tube station and a short walk to museums  shops  bars and restaurants As a frequent traveller to London  this place easily makes it onto my list of preferred hotels  
P =>  Worst Hotel I have ever experienced If you expect a warm welcome go somewhere else  As a woman struggling with a large suitcase approaching the glass entrance door saw a young male staff member who simply stood there with his hands behind his back watching me  When I finally struggled through the door we were greeted at the front desk with  You can t book in here now   to which I replied  Good morning    Rudeness is an art form here  Also you will go mad in the room which is no more than a cell   clean but a cell  
P =>   Business trip Short business trip on   nigths stay  Very nice and helpful staff  The day I checked out  they looked out for my luggage the whole day  until I left for the airport Breakfast was ok Just what I expected  when I booked  
P =>   Lovely decor tiny room The hotel had only just re opened when I stayed   they were still finishing off some of the fittings  It s just minutes away from Gloucester Road tube station  restaurants and supermarkets  The staff were very polite and tried their best but were inexperienced and struggled to cope with the computer system  The decor is very modern  with white linen on a comfortable bed  a plasma TV  modern bathroom and tea coffee facilities  However  you can t get the kettle properly under the sink tap to fill it  A good shower but no hot water for several hours in the evening  The room was tiny  right at the top of the hotel overlooking the main road which was busy and noisy  I had a double bed  but really there was only just enough space for a single   two people would struggle to move around the room  The storage wouldn t cope with anything bigger than a small case  The room rate included a buffet breakfast which was ok   bacon and eggs  yogurts  pastries  toast etc  
P =>  Smallest room in the world Quite possibly the smallest room in the world Hotel is redeemed somewhat by pleasant staff  great location     quot  plasma TV and an ample breakfast  included in our rate  But really   more than   person in this room is a push  Also rooms overlooking Cromwell Rd can be noisy

P =>  Terrible experience at Delmere Hotel I will never stay at the Delmere Hotel again  I was treated in the most disrespectful way when there was confusion about my booking which was off by one day  The Manager insisted on charging me for the mistaken day despite my having booked three nights stay  Most would have accomodated the mistake  regardless of whose fault  given the the multiple night booking  but not at the Delmere  They insisted on charging me and were so rude I left and booked into the Hilton Paddington  I WILL NEVER BE BACK  Too many better hotels in the area   
P =>  Great location very nice hotel We stayed in this hotel for three nights  The location is great  very close to Paddington station which made it easy to go back to drop things   pick things up during the day  There are also a lot of restaurants in the neighbourhood  so you have a lot of choice  The room was very nice and clean  The breakfast was good  a nice buffet with the option of ordering full english breakfast  The full english was made to order and very nice  We will stay here again next time  
P =>  Great location  but tiny stuffy rooms PLUS   This hotel is in a really great location     min walk from Paddington Station and lots of bars  restaurants and convenience stores nearby  Only    min walk to Hyde Park too  Continental breakfast is good and the staff were friendly  Free internet also NEGATIVES   our room was on the third floor and it was soooooooo hot and stuffy that it actually ruined our stay  The temperature was    degrees and we were dying at night  so I dread to think how warm the rooms on this floor would get in the summer months  
P =>   Great location wonderful staff We stayed in room     for   nights  The room was very small  typical of London  but very clean  Very clean small bathroom  Shower only  Our room overlooked the alley  so it was quiet  Nice soap and shampoo in the bathroom  Remember to pack a face cloth  they aren t supplied  The young staff that work in the hotel are excellent both at the front desk and at breakfast  The continental breakfast was complimentary with our room  Perfect for us  bread  rolls  croissant  cheese  ham  cereal  juices  yogurt  coffee  amp  tea  We ate there every morning  The location is great  an easy walk from Paddington Station  and all it has to offer  Lots of restaurants nearby  Easy walk to Hyde Park  Kenningston Gardens  amp  Palace  The little bar in the hotel is a nice touch as was the free internet in the basement level den  
P =>  Great Location Value for money  I stayed her at beginning of tember for a week  The hotel is one of many of converted apartment houses  Thus the rooms are a bit cramped but very well done  I stayed in room     and had a double bed with small night tables on either side  There was a desk with chair and another chair in the room  A narrow closet held additional linen and pillows along with accommodating my clothes  There was also a narrow shelf on the wall holding a kettle with teapot and two cups and saucers  There was tea of course  instant coffee  regular and decaf  with sugar and sweet  amp  low  I liked the choice of cream or milk too  The bathroom was small but a very good use of space  no tub but very good shower enclosure  The towels were good as were the liquid soaps at the sink and in the shower  There is a flat screen TV on the wall facing the bed with a nice selection of channels and a clock attached below  The room is well lit and the bed very comfortable  No air con but there was a fan  which I didn t need  The window opened onto the street so you have the noise of the road below but with the window closed it was bearable  The heavy curtains kept out the early morning sun too  The free wireless internet was great  the login code changes everyday at noon but that was not problem  just asked the friendly front desk staff for it  They were very helpful at check in with no problems experienced and they held my bag while I explored the city until the  pm check in time  My bags had already been taken to my room when I returned at  pm  Very welcomed  There is a small elevator  a small terrace outside the small bar lounge and a small dining room in basement where you can get breakfast  Unfortunately I never ate there so cannot rate the food or service  There are many dining options along the roads within walking distance as well as at Paddington Rail Station  which is only a   minute walk away  Great if you are coming in on the Heathrow Express train  In all a very good experience  
P =>   Good Hotel was acceptable for a few nights  the room was very small but adequate especially for a business traveller  The staff where very nice and could not do enough for me  The free internet was great as well I did have to ask for more tea and milk but that was not a problem  I would suggest a good book as there are only five tv channels  freeview wouldn t go amiss Breakfast was nice but the dining room got awfully full after   amRates and location are good  it is what it is  if you want more then pay more 
P =>  This is an excellent clean well decorated hotel  Though the room was small  it was very clean and beautifully decorated  It has obviously been renovated recently  The wall paper  rug  bed covering were tasteful and clean  The room was small and it was amazing to see how many amenities could be added to such a small room  including TV  fan  desk  closet  night stands  The bathroom  also small  had counter tops with nice touches like Kleenex  hand towels  and hand soap  It was a vast improvement over the hotel we stayed in the previous week in London  It is also very close to Paddington Station and two subway stations and restaurants  
P =>   Great Cheap Paddington Hotel I was looking for a clean  cheap hotel close to Paddington Station and thats exactly what I got  Rooms are quite basic  clean and on the small side but perfectly adequate for an overnight stay  Free internet was a nice bonus There are lots of restaurants on the door step and Paddington train station is less than   minutes walk away  
P =>  Clean and Great Location After staying at the Gresham for three nights  prebooked  I walked down the street to the Best Western for three more nights  I was not staying at the Gresham any longer  and I agree with the bad comments in a previous post  Though the front door folks were friendly and nice to us  For the same price and breakfast  the Best Western was a wondeful change  as it was CLEAN and looked as if it had been recently redone  I agree small  but it was CLEAN  There was also a very comfortable sitting room in the basement  Don t use their computer  as it overpriced  much cheaper alternatives in the neighborhood  The Paddington area is not that great  but the location is great  It s within walking distance to ble Arch and all that surrounds it  I used the Tube to go everywhere  Evans Tours picked me up for a couple of long all day tours in front of Paddington Hilton and dropped me off at Gloucester Road tube  so only a couple of stops from Paddington  We had a hard time with restauants in the Paddington area  We liked a wine bar and I think an Italian restaurant called Jax  I think it s chain   which was pretty good  two blocks down on a side street off Sussex Gardens  Also a Cafe Nero on that street  The pubs were not so good  or at least we didn t find the right one  
P =>  clean basement room yours for      a night Down the stairs  outside into the airshaft  and the door to my room  and four others  was right there  how convenient  Small room  with two tiny twin beds  I m  m    tiny is not fun   very clean  with modern bathroom  ent English breakfast  served by pleasant staff  Don t buy Internet access  if your computer will not interface with their system  they will NOT refund your money  Of course  you find this out only after you have paid  They stole        hour access  from me  but the overnight rate is over    pounds  so it could have been worse  For       an absolute ripoff  even in London  I ve stayed in several hotels near Paddington in recent years  the Delmere is  by far  the worst of the lot  
P =>  Clean safe and excellent value All you could possibly need for an overnight stay in London  Rooms are small but immaculate  there is a really comfortable loung with hsia and breakfast was a much less stressful experience than in larger hotels which often involves a long wait Walking distance from Paddington and a few nice pubs and restaurants around  It had the feeling of a family run hotel and I felt very secure too  
P =>  Pretty good place  Pretty decent location  Smallish but clean room  and an adequate breakfast  
P =>  Overpriced The hotel is located on a street that has about    other identical hotels on it  Rooms  hallways  breakfast area  reception  stairs are all quite small Room was clean and quiet Breakfast choice is limited and I would avoid paying for it if it s not included in your room rate It s about     minute walk to the Lancaster gate tube station which is often crowded since this area of London has literally hundreds of  quot budget quot  hotels which still charge extortionate prices  Your money can go a lot further than this place and if you shop around you can find hotels that are not only more central but better in size and quality for the same price  
P =>  Great Little Hotel Was supposed to stay down the road at the Gresham hotel but their rooms weren t suitable  see my review for that hotel   so    seconds down the road and we found this hotel  what a relief  They only had smoking rooms left but the only way we knew it was smoking was the ashtray and matches  The room did not smell of smoke and nor did we end up smelling of it either  The room was small but adequate for our needs for one night and in a good location  The room was spotlessly clean and well maintained and everything worked  The noise from the road wasn t an issue for us and the bed was reasonably comfortable  Breakfast was nice and simple and all the staff on reception were friendly  Would definately stay here again  
P =>   fair price for London hotel  We paid a      for our double room and continental breakfast  which we considered reasonable  as our hotel was    minutes walk from our venue  Hyde Park  I had telephoned the hotel a few weeks before and asked if it was possible to have a room with a bath and the dear Receptionist remembered and we had a room with a bath  Wot bliss  Visitors from abroad were afforded much assistance by Staff   All the fine houses in the area are now Hotels and as such were not purpose built  so rooms are going to be small  The breakfast room restaurant is lower ground floor and not particularly impressive  Given the thousands of eating places in London the Perla would only be suitable for tired travellers who did not wish to travel far for a meal  be it was just one of those days  but we had to wait for a table for breakfast had to remind the staff about our coffee and when the cooked breakfast arrived  were offered no condiments  Small issues  but attention to detail is everything  The hotel industry is not renowed for overpaying its staff and given we were staying in a nice part of London  considered it value for money  However  am not sure if we would stay more than   night as there are countless small hotels in the area   all eager for trade  Perhaps some consideration could be given to having a more inviting eating area on ground level and opening up small reception area  
P =>  Dissappointing Took a  Get Away  Best Western break at this hotel for two nights on the   th ch  Room was in a courtyard at the rear of the hotel  Had to mend the plug on the basin and clear the blocked shower tray drain to empty the water  Otherwise the room was adaquate The Get away menu for those staying was totally inadaquate with main meals only consisting of something and chips  My main couse was totally inedable  The prawn cocktail comprised of three deep fried prawns with a salad garnish  The manageress said she thought that was what a prawn cocktail should consist of    We made a complaint  left the resturant and never ate there again  My formal complant to Best western remains unanswered  Would not recommend this hotel  We have previously been very pleased with other Best Western Hotels  This one lets the side down and so does thier customer services  
P =>  Good for London hotel  My wife and I stayed in the same room as the previous poster  Depending on your point of view the room was pokey or cosy  we found it to be pokey on initial inspection but cosy once we d gotten used to it  It is indeed very quiet which was a real blessing considering it s London location  The bathroom is tiny but clean and adaquate  The shower is one of the best I ve ever used in a hotel with a nice powerful water flow  The supplied toilettries were of a good quality and they were not mean with the supply The room itself was quite small  but had well designed fixtures for the tea making facilities and bedside storage  The bed was my only gripe with this hotel  not only was it too small for two people it was not the most comfortable  It may be that I am spoiled with the quality of beds in American hotels but for the rate I believe you should get better The main hotel was well appointed  and the continental breakfast had what you need to start the day  The lounge allowed smoking so smelled as such The staff were friendly although I would not rely on them for directions  The hotel is very convienient for transport links  paddington is   minutes walk away  and there are a number of pubs  restaurants  fast food joints and newsagents nearby I would recommend this hotel but avoid paying the rack rate  it s not worth     pounds a night for the room we stayed in  
P =>  Great Location Superb Staff We stayed here for   nights in a room which was away from the main part of the hotel  across a small courtyard  Thankfully  we managed to get the room for a very good deal  thanks to a National Rail promotion  For location  it s superb  You are two blocks from Paddington station  which is very well served for tube lines and mainline rail from Heathrow  and a great terminus if you want to go to Bath or maybe Wales for sightseeing  The local area is good  well served with takeaway food outlets and pubs  We never felt unsafe or threatened The room we stayed in  No     was more cosy than pokey  I would recommend it for a couple carrying a small amount of luggage  The room was cleaned daily and the continental breakfast good and plentiful  For London  we found it amazingly quiet  be this was luck  but we never heard traffic  cop sirens or even next door neighbours  Bliss Staff were brilliant  One night I needed a beer bottle opener  Not only did the receptionist gladly provide me with one  but she even loaned me two glasses from the bar to take back to the room  What a refreshing change Highly recommended   if you can get a deal  
P =>  Poky but handy I stayed in the Best Western for two nights while attending a course in London  The first night I arrived late  around ten p m   and I must have got the last room available  It was out a back door  into a courtyard and was stuck in a little corner separate from the hotel  The room itself was literally a coffin with just enough room for a bed and was very claustrophobic  The window was tiny and couldn t be opened fully as it was on the ground floor  The television also did not work and I had a horrible night s sleep with the noise from party revellers in the bar next door  I even heard someone get sick out a window during the night The following night I requested they move me to a more pleasant room and they put me in one on the third floor  What a difference  While the room was still small  which is to be expected in London I suppose  it was much more spacious than the previous one  Everything worked  the bed was more than comfortable  and I slept soundly  All of a sudden I loved the quirkiness of the hotel again The included buffet breakfast is more than adequate  The full English  which I got on the second day  is nice  but a bit on the expensive side The location was the best seller for me     minutes walk to Hyde Park or the train station  Plenty of pubs around the corner for good food and good restaurants if you want something a bit more upmarket Overall  I think it is luck of the draw whether or not you get a good room  Staff were courteous  but not as friendly as some other reviewers made out  in my experience anyway   Would I stay there again    probably not  unless I had assurances that I would be getting a really good room   but I would pick another hotel in the same location  Unfortunately  I forgot my camera so could not take any photos  
P =>   Good value friendly staff walls like paper     Can recommand this place  been there for   nights  Knowing the size of a London hotelroom I always book a double room  the extra space is definitely worth the money  So the room was OK  clean and quiet In the first night loud guests next door  the walls are thin    But that is the only point to critisize  Excellent value for the price  I paid    GBP incl  brakfast  Breakfast was not very spectacular  but OK and included in the room price  The place has a fast WLAN net from the hotel  costs    GBP per day  good performance and speed  I travel to London very often and have seen lots of worse places for much  much more money  
P =>  Clean and Comfortable We stayed in the Delmere in early ober      for   nights and found it to be very clean and comfortable  The staff were friendly and helpful  The location couldn t have been better  Simply catch the Heathrow Express to Paddington Station and walk   blocks  Clear instructions are provided on the hotel s website  The Continental breakfast  included in the price  was more than adequate with stewed fruit  yoghurt  cheese  ham  croissants  toast  jam  juices  tea  amp  coffee  However the cooked breakfast at a cost of   pounds was disappointing and is not recommended  Stick to the continental breaky  If you re expecting a large room and bathroom  you will be disappointed  We have travelled extensively in Europe so knew what to expect  The room was very comfortable  providing everything you needed including a TV  hair dryer and tea coffee making facilities  The bathroom was tiny   only space for one person at a time  but again  had everything you needed  There is no soundproofing to the rooms  so noisy neighbours who let their door slam could annoy light sleepers  This is a problem in most budget priced hotels  The location of the hotel was quiet  so outside street noise was not a problem There are numberous restaurants and bars nearby  Public transport and the hop on  hop off tourist bus stops are just around the corner  
P =>   Comfortable and convenient the Delmere isn t in the best area of town   but it s a great little place  good value  relatively quiet  and very convenient to the tube  I stayed there for almost   week while in London for work  and found it quite comfortable  I did much work in the lower level lounge  which suited my needs well  
P =>  Great place to stay The Best Western Delmere is a great place to stay  especially for the price  It is very conveniently located just two blocks from Paddington station in a neighborhood full of restaurants  pubs  and more The room was a bit small  but that was to be expected  Nor was it air conditioned  also expected  but the staff supplied a small fan  and with the windows open in early tember  it was more than cool enough in the evenings  The bed was big enough for two and plenty comfortable Our room was spotlessly clean when we arrived  and cleaned well every day we stayed   our stay lasted eight nights  The bathroom was also quite clean as well as newly fixtured  It was also very quiet  excepting one evening when we had some rather loud neighbors  It helps that this is a very small hotel   less than    rooms The continental breakfast was plentiful  if heavy on bread products   rolls  croissants  cereals  toast  some fruits  yogurt and ham and cheese  and the waitstaff extremely friendly All in all  our stay was extremely pleasant  and we would happily stay at the Delmere again  
P =>  Good but small The Delmere is conveniently located a few minutes walk from Paddington and Lancaster Gate tube stations  The staff were friendly and helpful and the room was spotlessly clean if a bit small  Continental breakfast came with the room and was nice  although choice was a bit limited  Overall  for the price of     per night for a double room  the hotel represented good value in London   I ve seen far worse for much more and would happily stay there again  
P =>  Loved the Delmere Excellent hotel on Sussex Gardens  just two blocks from Paddington Station in downtown London  Very clean  up to date rooms  excellent baths  exceptionally helpful staff  and a great free breakfast  Not only that  it s less expensive than most of the rip off places in London  A Best Western hotel  Great value    would stay there again in a minute  
P =>  Loved the Delmere  I just returned from a week at the Delmere and my husband and I were quite pleased  The staff was very gracious and helpful and the room rate included a continental breakfast  The rooms were small as are most European hotels  but very clean and all that we needed  It s in a GREAT location and I felt very safe the whole time  I would and hope to stay there again   D 
P =>  Clean as a whistle What a nice little hotel with surprising friendly Dutch staff  My husband and I picked the Delmere after reading reviews on Trip Advisor  By American standards  the room is small and so is the bathroom but this is how things are in London  I must say that the place was spotless  Continental breakfast which was included  includes rolls  yogurt  ham  cheese  cereals  juice and fruit  which was more than enough variety  The location is very close to Paddington Station which runs a direct line to Heathrow called the Heathrow Express  We would definately stay there again  
P =>  Great Location Noisy Housekeeping We just returned from a one week stay in London  We booked our stay at the Delmere after reading many glowing reviews on this site  The staff were very nice and helpful overall  and the room was clean  comfortable  and more than adequate for our needs  My sole complaint about the Delmere is that every single morning  around   o clock  we were woken up by the extremely loud noises of the housekeeping staff opening and slamming the   doors surrounding our room  This was particularly bad on the afternoon of our arrival  as we were exhausted after a    hour trek and desperately wanted to sleep  We had to wait until   o clock when the crew finally finished before we could get a few hours of sleep before going out for dinner  It didn t help that our room was directly across from the housekeeping storage room  as they kept going in and out of that room  resulting in very loud door slamming  Other than the noise  the hotel was wonderful  clean  and safe  
P =>   Single room only closet sized I stayed at the Best Western Delmere Hotel ch    amp    and my experience was not memorable  which sometimes is good  The stay was comfortable but I was really disappointed with the size of the single room on the top floor  The street on which the Delmere is located is two or three blocks from Paddington station  and only walkable if you are rolling your suitcases  Some nice restaurants are in the neighborhood  however  I arrived early and my room was not ready  Perhaps doubles are better  but mine was hardly large enough for the narrow and short firm bed  with little room to open my suitcase  The shower stall was up two steps      and the toilet stall was quite cramped  Television channel selection was only the standard  I had just stayed at a B  amp  B north of London which had better TV and a larger room for one third of the price  Hot breakfast cost more  but the free cold breakfast at Delmere was just fine  with cereals  sliced cheese and ham  rolls or croissants  tea  coffee  etc  and there was a bar restaurant on site for suppers  All in all  certainly not a disaster  and the staff was very cheerful and friendly  Just avoid it if you are claustrophobic  
P =>  Great budget hotel I booked a single room from the Best Western website for     night  and because the rate was so low I was a bit nervous about what the hotel would be like but I was very pleased with it  Although the room was the smallest I ve ever been in  it was clean and tastefully decorated and the hotel staff were all very pleasant and helpful  The location is good as it s close to both Paddington and Edgware Road stations  and as a single woman I felt safe walking to the hotel from the tube at night  as well as safe in the hotel in general  In other reviews of london hotels the poor quality of the showers was mentioned and I can say that the water pressure at the Delmere was fine  All in all  this hotel is very good value for the money and I would reccommend staying here if you re looking for an inexpensive hotel in central london that doesn t compromise on quality and convenience  
P =>  Good Location Closet Like Rooms Stayed at the Delmere for   nights in ember        Location is great     minutes from Paddington station  and the express train to from Heathrow  and the Tube  along Sussex Gardens  Plenty of places to eat drink in the area  My single room was the smallest I have ever let in Europe  I ve been to more than a dozen cities and stayed in several BW s  and this was definitely a closet  It had all the amenities   shower  separate WC  hair dryer  toiletries  and a coffee maker   so I can t complain too much  Breakfast is adequate   continental style   breads  cheeses  yogurt  good sized packets of cereal  etc  You even have the option of a full English breakfast  although this is extra   the continental breakfast is included in the rate  There is also a restaurant bar attached to the hotel Staff was very friendly and helpful  Sussex Gardens is busy with traffic  I had a room facing the street  but the hotel is set back far enough from the road to where the noise didn t bother me and I had the window open my entire stay This is one of many small hotels that adjoin each other along Sussex Gardens  When I first arrived I actually entered the hotel next to the Delmere where the room rate was     lower  I couldn t imagine the rooms being much different because these hotels are all in the same attached row buildings  Next time I will try one of the neighboring hotels  although I can assure you that the BW Delmere is a fine place to stay  I just think you ll get the same thing next door at a much lower price  
P =>  Clean  I booked a single room for     via laterooms com and paid      you would pay     phoning the hotel direct   The Delmere is one of numerous hotels along Sussex Gardens  which is quite a busy road  The room itself was absolutely fine  and better than I had expected  Small  yes  but spotlessly clean with a pristine shower  amp  toilet  and quality white towels  The room was cold when I arrived but I turned the radiator on full and within a very short time it was belting out heat  Safe  coffee making facilities  small TV working perfectly  If you a lone traveller you can use the lounge area downstairs  with comfortable armchairs  Breakfast was also good  I eat like a mouse but others had the choice of cereals  yoghurt  fruit etcThe only thing to remember is to ASK FOR A ROOM AT THE BACK when booking  I had asked for a non smoking room but it was the only one available  and was at the front  I couldn t bear the idea of smoke permeated fabrics so I suffered the street noise instead  I didn t sleep too badly but was woken at      by a BT van in the street offloading ladders  
P =>  Excellent Hotel If you ve been looking on the internet for a good hotel in London at a good price stop looking  This is it  I picked the Delmere based on the good reviews on this page and they are all true  My wife and I were very satisfied with the hotel  The continental breakfast was excellent and the staff was always nice and friendly  In general  all the people in London was very nice and friendly  We had a great vacation in London  Thanks  
P => Good value for money We chose this hotel based on the many favourable reviews we read on this page  I can verify that they are accurate and that the Delmere is a charming hotel with very friendly and helpful staff  It is easy to reach on foot from Paddington station  which of course is on the direct link to Heathrow  We did have a problem though with our room being excessively hot  as our stay was during late summer  There was no airconditioning and we could not open the windows because we were on the streetfront  and the traffic noise kept us awake  The duty manager did go to great lengths to relocate us to a quiet room  although this did cost us more  The room was small  and the bathroom roughly the size of an average toilet  but okay for a few nights  Breakfast was very good and very much appreciated  Overall  excellent value for money  Ask for a room in the courtyard downstairs if you are concerned about noise from the street  
P =>  Great place to stay   The hotel is a small and cosy  and so are the rooms  But they are clean and equipped with the things you need  We even had a little yard with flowers and a bench outside our room   Much nicer than a carpeted hall   Nice staff and ok breakfast Location is great too   Recommended to everyone wanting to stay in a nice affordable place in London   
P =>  Great hotel Nice location  hotel room and bathroom were perfecently adequate and clean  Good value  
P =>  A Beautiful Hotel right in the Heart of London Thank you Trip Advisor  This site has been a very good source if you want to book your hotel  This is the second time I used trip advisor  The first was when I went to New York last        I also booked the right hotel because of the comments of this site  Believe me  everything you read here is true I stayed at Delmere from e    to y          Our room was     and it was a twin room  Small but very clean room  Comfortable bed and pillows I read all the reviews first before booking my london hotel since it s my first time to visit london  The hotel is located along sussex garden which is a walking distance from Paddington Station  You only have to ride the Heathrow Express    minutes to Paddington  The Hotel is only   minutes from the station  Very safe neighborhood  Very Comfortable Hotel  La perla restaurant is where you have your breakfast  There is ham  cheese and an assortment of bread  It s not the usual   star hotel breakfast buffet but nevertheless it is enough considering how expensive the food in London There is an internet shop nearby along london street  A convenience store or  quot budgens quot  its the   eleven equivalent in London I really enjoyed my first trip to London  Great hotel  great city  I was able to experience F  formula racing in the heart of Picadilly circus      off shoppping at Harrods  Gay Pride at Trafalgar Square  West End Plays all happened during the duration of my stay  Wonderful indeed

P => Great location great for the cost Great location  within walking distance to Buckingham Palace  London Eye  Westminster Abbey etc     minutes from Victoria Coach  amp  Rail stations  Hop on   Hop off bus Tour and country tours  Room size is just comfortable  bathroom excellent   elevator fits   people with   cases  clean  well serviced daily  Tea coffe etc in room  Great cooked breakfast included   plenty of it  Free internet in the lobby  Very helpful  amp  cheerful service from staff  Would definately stay there again  Didn t hear street noise   with the window closed  which is incredible as it s so close to pub  restaurants etc    
P =>   Great budget hotel in fantastic location We stayed at Victoria palace in mid tember for the start of a three week UK Europe vacation and we thought it was great    minutes walk from Victoria Station and easy access to all of London as a result as well as being walking distance to a lot of the main sites  The staff were really lovely  buffet breakfast very nice and we got a very quiet room which came in handy with our jet lag  The free WiFi came in handy too  If you book here expecting it to be The Dorchester you will be disappointed  but if you want a nice clean room with friendly staff  good breakfasts  waking distance to some main attractions  close to shops  cafes and restaurants as well as main transport at a fantastic price then this is the place for you  We would and will stay here next time we are in London  Great first stop on our trip  
P =>   Hot summer days  This was my second stay at Best Western Victoria Palace  so I knew that the staff and the service is very good  And that that the rooms are cline and nice  We had booked this hotel because off the good price  location and AC inn the rooms  The AC was very good because of the heat wave in London during our stay  Rooms are average London size  We had booked tree rooms  and was given rooms on the same floor  The breakfast room is one the small size  so it is smart to go down early  This is a good hotel inn a grate location  walking distant to manny places and about   min from Victoria Station  train  tub and busses  and Victoria Coach Station  airport busses   
P =>  Outstanding Stayed in the Victoria Palace for   weeks in y  The room was clean and cosy  The staff very helpful  Perfect service  Will definitely return to this hotel  
P =>  A nice enough hotel We recently stayed at the Best Western Victoria Palace for one night prior to catching a cruise in Dover  It s location  within walking distance of Victoria Station  was ideal  The room was large enough by European standards and the bathroom  though small was larger than many I have experienced  The staff seemed friendly and helpful and I did enjoy the included breakfast  The hotel is air conditioned  the rooms include a safe and the only drawback is that the sheets and bath towels have the consistency of sandpaper  Still  I would stay there again  
P =>   Good place to stay   avoid single rooms though Me and my girlfriend stayed in       in the Best Western Victoria Palace for the second time  It was good as ever  The location is superb  close to the Victoria Station  which has a nice variety of shops and fast food options  and there are some good restaurants nearby  The service is very nice  the staff is very kind  polite and helpful  The rooms are good enough  altough a bit small  even for the double room However  avoid at all costs the single room  which seems like a cell  Too narrow and small  There is practically just the bed and the bathroom  nothing more Even tough  I wolud recommend this hotel for couples  It s a very good option to get to know London  
P =>  Met our Needs We were looking for a hotel with adequate space  comfort  near public transportation and this hotel fit our needs  It was comfortable   however please don t expect large spacious rooms  had free internet connection  nice bathroom with a good shower  The location was a   minute walk to the Victoria underground  train and bus station  The Victoria station has numerous fast food restaurants and shopping on the upper level  Walking distance to the Victoria Apollo Theater  A few pubs nearby  A corner grocery store across the street  The free breakfast was ok  however if you want meats will need to pay extra  Finally the hotel staff from the front desk personnel to the ladies working the breakfast room were all friendly and helpful  This Best Western will probably never win an award but it certainly was exactly what we needed to enjoy our trip to London and see all the sites  
P =>   Hot and cold in equal measure The first room was very hot and smelly  so I asked for a different room  however no joy on the first night  Sunday   Monday morning I asked again and was moved to a different room However  in the second bedroom the heater in the bathroom didn t work  and I had to get some tape to tape up the windows as the cold air was rushing in through all the gaps etc in the window and frame  This did the trick and the bedroom was then margainly warmer  bearing in mind the bed was right up against the windows  not too sure how the previous occupants had endured the cold air coming in  I certainly wasn t going to The hotel staff were helpful and polite  if you want bacon and or sausages for breakfst they cost extra  why    Would I stay there again  yes but in the summer Hotel very handy for Victoria bus train stations less than    mins walk  
P =>   Perfect for tourists Small but clean and well enlighted rooms  vegetarian breakfasts  smiling staff  the price is worth of a great location   walking distance to Buckingham Palace and Westminster  We enjoyed it for three nights of London trip  Internet handy for necessity Fedor Liuba Macasek  Bratislava 
P =>   Did the job  Hotel was in a great location  Easy walk from Victoria with plenty of resturants and bars  Easy enough to walk to Harrods and Westminster and on to the Eye Staff were very helpful  inlcuding fixing the faulty shower door whilst we were out during the day Rooms were very small and the bed very hard  Glad there was A C as the room was very stuffy  For having a lot of guests the noise from other rooms was not bad  Only noise was a knock on the door at  am on our first night  It appeared to be someone at the wrong room Breakfast room in small  If you are later than      you will have to wait for a table  Having to pay extra for Bacon or Sausage having booked B amp B is a joke  You get eggs  beans  tomoato and mushrooms as well as the normal cerals but if you want the bacon  you pay the premium  This should be stopped Overall a nigh hotel but even though I got a deal I think it is still way over priced  but thats London for you  
P =>   Excellent value and location  Greeted by friendly staff who let me into the room early  Small room but I expected that so it wasn t a problem  Hotel was clean  room was clean and had my own clean bathroom  Great location for walking tours of London    minute walk to Victoria Station  plenty of pubs about    For the price  you can t beat it in my opinion  
P =>   Very pleasant experience We  a family of four  children aged   and   yrs  were left stranded in London when the hotel we hade originally made reservations with cocked up and had double booked us  Luckily we usually stay in Victoria  so we knew the neighourhodd enough to go search for another decent hotel  as the staff at Comfort Inn Victoria failed to find a room   However  Quad rooms are not too easy to find  so after having travelled for   hrs  having small children to tend to and nowhere to go we were a bit distraught We stumbled upon Best Western Victoria Palace  It was the fourth or fifth hotel we came to  and I expleined the situation  be a distraught mother  and two crying little girls made a difference  because we were immediately told that even thoug all the family rooms were taken they could offer an apartment a couple of houses away  And yes  they could include breakfast in the price  We ended up paying      for three night  A bit more that we had planned   but rather that than having no place to stay The location is perfect  It takes   min to walk to the Victoria Shopping centre and then you have the tube and trains station only a minute away  There s a coach station nearby  and for us who travel with the Terravision Coach Service from Stansted the hotel is perfectly situated The apartment was quite recenty refurbished  It was not the most practical solution as there were very narrow stairs to get to the room s   and the apartment in itself was a two storey apt   Our room had three flights of stairs    steps AFTER having entered the apt  Narrow stairs for anyone  but extremely narrow ehrn you have to juggle a pushchair up and down      On the first floor was a fully equpied kitchen and a lounge living room  On the Second floor were two bedrooms  two bathrooms a bigger one with a nice bath tub  a smaller one with a shower  The master bedroom had one double bed  and the oter bedrrom had a kingsize bed  Bothe rooms had a small cupboard with hangers and a safe  desks  a chest of drawers and a flat screen tv  Beds were nice and comfy  Bathrooms clean and modern  The lounge living room hade two sofas and an armchair in fake leater  or was it real  one living room table and two smaller tables  and a big    quot      flat screen Tv Carpets in all room except kitchen where there was a wooden floor  Cleaning was good  The only thing was the kitchen floor  it could have been mopped a bit better before we arrived   now there was something sticky on it and if you took your shoes of  as we do  being Swedish and all  our socks were very dirty after having been in the kitchen  I bet that if I had told the hotel management they would have taken care of it  but I couldn t be bothered Hotel staff were very helpful   from the very first second we enrtrd the hotel till the minute we left  Breakfast was good  We had to walk to the main building  but that wasn t a problem  A bit crowded if you waitet until        to have breakfast  A nice selection of bread   croissants  white toast  brown toast  danishes    There were scarmbled eggs  baked beans  eggs  tomatoes  a coffee maschine as well as regular coffee and tea  fresh fruits  apple and orange juice  yougurt and different kinds of cereals and muesli  Kitchen staff were nice and efficient All in all we had a great stay  We ve stayed in many hotels in the area and know what to expect from London Hotels   and this hotels ends up on the top five list of favourite hotels  in our family  
P =>  Value for money With the Gatwick Express I arrived at London Victoria and this hotel is only a   min walk from the train station  Staff is adequate and really helpfull  The room was clean and the shower was just great  especially for London standards  The breakfast room could be a bit bigger  but then again  wait   mins and you will have a seat  This hotel is great value for money and will definitely stay here again 
P =>   Great choice for sightseeing close to transport links I have stayed at this hotel twice now with my mum and sister when we have been to London to see a show  The hotel is clean and has been refurbished in the last couple of years so fairly modern  For the price you pay it is ideal for a short stay close to a major train  coach and underground station  Victoria   The rate has gone up since we first stayed there but comparable to other  not so nice hotels in the area  The staff all seem polite and helpful The rooms we have been in were a triple room and a family room  both plenty big enough for us for the time we spent in it  Try to avoid the family room in the basement as it is next to the breakfast room so can get noisy early in the morning The only slight quibbles I have are that the pillows were quite hard and you have to pay       extra for bacon or sausage with your breakfast  The breakfast was fine  and healthier  without meat though with cereal  fruit  toast  croissants  pastries  scrambled and poached eggs  mushrooms and beans to choose from Overall I would definitely recommend it  
P =>   Great little Hotel   warm friendly and great for London sightseeing My wife and I stayed here for   nights   we were going to see Eddie Izzard live in his new show   and wanted to do a little sightseeing  mainly christmas shops and lights  Booking in was very easy  quick and friendly  The young receptionist was very helpful when we asked him a few questions about locations and trips The room was basic and on the small side  but very modern and newly decorated   and very clean One of the cleanest hotel rooms I ve stayed in  including some much more expensive ones    And that included the bed   comfortable  clean and without that  quot tired slept too much in quot  feel about it The hotel was very warm in al the rooms areas which was very useful seeing as we picked the coldest two nights of the year to stay Breakfast was the usual buffet style   juice  cereals  toast  croissants and the usual cooked option  The cooked buffet was different in that if you wanted bacon or sausage  you had to pay extra   but at least it meant that they were freshly cooked On one morning  it seemed that everyone decided to have a late start  as there wasn t enough room in the breakfast room  which was rather small  for everyone to fit in  The precious morning  there was room for everyone  so I m guessing that was just a one off that everyone seemed to sleep late All in all   i would definitely recommend the hotel for anyone wanting a reasonable priced  clean  modern hotel   with excellent location for travelling around London  Victoria train and underground station are a   minute walk away  and once there  most of the central London sights are a few underground stops away Definitely would use again  
P =>  Great Hotel  After finally deciding on the Luna  amp  Simone  but finding it full  I booked a triple room for   nights at the Best Western Victoria Palace  After a    minute walk from Victoria Station  expecting to leave our luggage and then cool our heels for a few hours before afternoon check in  we were thrilled to find that our room was ready   at mid morning   Very welcome news after a sleepless overnight flight from Atlanta While the desk clerk checked on our room  I was able to use the free hi speed internet to report home  Our room was smallish  but not extremely so  very sleek and modern  with a small balcony overlooking the street   But didn t notice any noise at night   Bathroom  shower only  was sparkling clean  with plenty of hot water and towels  plus a very efficient heater with fan mounted high on the wall  We had one double bed and one single  Plenty of extra pillows and good quality  heavy sheets  A tiny wall mounted shelf held an electric tea kettle and plenty of tea bags  coffee sachets and creamer and heavy ceramic cups and saucers  A flat screen TV  desk and mirror  plus good reading lights over bedside tables completed the furnishings  Breakfast was plentiful and good  in a very clean basement dining room with white linen table cloths  My mother was not pleased with the bland scrambled eggs  pork  amp  beans  tomatoes and mushrooms  but I was very happy with meusli  fruit  croissants  sliced cheese and yogurt  And of course juice  tea  coffee and espresso drinks  quite good  from a self serve machine  Staff was very helpful  booking us tickets on double decker bus tour  and sending someone up to re set the safe  A very pleasant experience and I would recommend this hotel  
P =>   Great hotel in great location This hotel is in a great location  It is in walking distance to Buckingham Palace  Big Ben  the Houses of Parliament  the London Eye  Westminster Abbey and the Thames River  The furthest away is only about    minutes walk  It is only a    minute slow walk to Victoria Station where there is a Hop On Hop Off tour stop  The rooms are small  but that is normal for Europe  The staff in the hotel are wonderful  Extremely polite and helpful  Nothing is too much trouble  On our first stay we had a back room  and on our  nd stay we had a front room  I would have to say our front room was much nicer with french doors that opened to let fresh air in  
P => Very expensive for what you get I guess London is just a very hard place to find a good hotel at a reasonable price  At this place  we paid extra for a  quot deluxe quot  room  The room was so small that we had to move the two twin beds around so that my husband could sit at the desk and play with his computer  I could only lie on the bed and read  Absolutely no space  I did have a lift  which was great  It was FAIRLY clean and had a safe in the room  a good thing to have in London  It is in a GREAT location and seems to be about the best around of these average little hotels  The staff very friendly and accommodating  Great breakfast  
P => 	  Highly Recommended     After reading through many unsatisfactory reviews of hotels in the London Victoria area i finally arrived here at the reviews for the Best Western Victoria Palace Based on the excellent reviews from previous guests i booked a room on line I made an excellent choice Check in on arrival was very fast and in less than   minutes after i arrived i was in the lift going to my room On entering the first thing that caught my eye was the digitalLCD TV mounted on the wall I was very pleased to see it at a comfortable eye level and not up near the ceiling which can makefor uncomfortable viewing For any news buffs reading this CNN and SKY News are available My room was small however as i was on my own i was happy with the small size as the room was comfortable and cosy The bathroom was also small but ok There were sufficient supplies of soap and towels and the bedroom had tea coffee making facilities also a code lock safe This hotel seems to go to a lot of trouble to please their guests unlike other hotels in the Victoria area First of all it is very clean and the bathroom was spotless I could see dust nowhere The bed was just too soft and comfortable   well worth the room rate charged Breakfast was first class I did nt fail to notice how clean everything was in the dinning room which was very freshly aired I tend to eat continental and had an ample supply of everything i wanted I should say here that the young female cook certainly knows her job and is very friendly She made a point of saying a cheerful  quot bye quot  when guests were leaving the dinning room           and that was a nice gesture  
P =>   Great location great London value excellent manager and staff After a nightmare stay at an adjacent hotel  the kind of room that people go to commit suicides  I was desperate and willing to pay any price for a clean  safe room  I did a walk in and the manager at BW understood my problem and was happy to show me several rooms as well as adjacent flats to accomodate my needs  OK  by North American standards  these rooms are smaller and proportionally expensive            GPB per night   For that price in Toronto you are treated like a star and can have a luxury suite  But by London standards  they are a blessing  The rooms are clean and modern and the breakfast is adequate  no meat but lots of other choices   The staff at the desk were exceptionally helpful  I felt very safe and the area is fabulous  pubs  restaurants  grocery  plus walking distance to Victoria area sites  London in general is mind blowingly expensive  be prepared to blow through a bundle if you are there for any lengh of time  But if you can afford it  BW is a good bet  Tell the staff  Dawn from Toronto says Hello  Walk to the Prince of Wales and look for Jason and friends    real gentlemen all  
P =>   Very nice good value We stayed three nights and were very pleased  It was convenient to Victoria station  and the train from Gatwick   approx     minute walk  The rooms were ready when we arrived at   a m  and they were small  but clean and well laid out  I requested a quiet room and was given one in the back of the hotel  The front desk staff was extremely friendly and helpful and they gave us excellent recommendations on where to eat  helped us with ticket purchases  etc  I would stay here again  good location  clean and good value in a very expensive city  
P =>   Saved our Trip We were so grateful to be able to move to this hotel from another one in the same area that was totally unacceptable  My husband approached them in the morning after spending an awful night in a dirty hotel room that was on Eccleston Square  We were a family of    and they provided us accomodations in a lovely apartment that they had available two doors down  It was new  with a very nice modern kitchen  very clean upgraded bathrooms  one with a tub  very clean and good quality linens  and a living room with a flat screen TV and three leather sofas  Eight of us stayed in this apartment  and another two stayed in a very cute basement apartment that was also tastefully decorated  and had a kitchen  The kitchens were stocked with everything you needed  and they provided tea and coffee  and milk for you coffee  This was an ideal situation for a family group  as it gave you a place to gather together at the end of a long day of touring  We also were able to walk over to Sainsbury s and bring take out to eat in the kitchen in the evenings  The larger apartment was     pounds a night  which was less than we were paying for the totally unacceptable hotel we moved from  The staff at the front desk helped you with everything  just like you were staying in the Hotel proper  They delivered our bags to our rooms  and we also had telephone service with the front desk  and between our rooms  The location was great  and we able to book our tickets to everywhere we wanted to go right at the front desk  The staff was very professional  helpful  and courteous  Highly recommended  We were so grateful that they saved our trip  
P =>  Loved the Palace Traveled to London alone in il       booked a room here with a queen size bed  Was pleasantly surprised   what a nice room  The bathroom was huge for a European hotel  Room entrance was by key card  room security was very acceptable Hotel is a very quick walk to Victoria Station  The location is most convenient The only negative was my room faced the front on the street side  Was rather noisy even in the evenings  I feel sure a room away from the street would be much quieter  Next time  I will request such a location for my room I arrived before the official check in time  but the desk clerk promised to have me in a room by noon and he did  The staff was very friendly and helpful I would definitely stay at this hotel again  
P =>  Clean New The hotel is situated two blocks away from Victoria Station  on the Belgrave Road  street full of other small B amp Bs   The hotel has been recently refurbished  The lobby  room and breakfast areas are all kept clean  We were allocated a double room no       The room was a bit too small  Barely enough room for our two medium sized suitcases  Also barely enough room to pass from one side of the bed to the other  The bathroom was Very compact  As previously mentioned the room had a flat screen TV  kettle with tea coffee  sugar sachets  Also soap was provided next to the basin and in the shower  Ample towels were also provided daily  Extra pillows were readily available in the room  The mattress however was too hard  It would be a good idea if the management considered installing a minifridge in the rooms as this would be of great benefit should one want to keep cold drinks  etc  Breakfast was plentiful with cereals  croissants  bread  eggs  baked beans  mushrooms and tomatoes  strangely no sausages and bacon    etc  Free internet available in the lobby which is definately a plus  All in all would recommend this hotel however I would rather not stay in Victoria as i much prefer Paddington which is the location I have stayed in during my previous visits  
P =>   Cosy Victoria Stayed   nights in a single room Room is small and cosy  It was only a couple of inches wider than the width of the bed Room felt new Room contained flat screen TV  only   main channels  radio station  and   other channels  not really satellite TV as listed on hotel s website   radiator  kettle  amp  tea coffee sugar sachets  desk  chair  small area for hanging clothes  control for heating  didn t need to use Bathroom had sink  toilet  shower and heater  The shower was easy to use and adjust With the room being so small anyone with a large of more that one case may struggle for space  I stored my case in the small area for hanging clothes Breakfast room in basement  buffet breakfast  limited cooked  mushrooms  no taste   beans  scrambled eggs  and cereals with bread to make toast   tea and coffee Hotel in good location for Victoria Station and within walking distance of Buckingham palace and Big Ben Staff were helpful and polite There s a PC near reception for visitor use I booked my room at http   www bestwesternvictoriapalace co uk  was a lot cheaper that any other website  
P =>  Excellent Hotel This is an excellent hotel  You get what you pay for  Staff was very friendly  room was perfectly clean  bathroom was really nice  beds were comfortable  Access to internet was free and breakfast had excellent coffee  
P =>  Great Stay Great Room Great Price What a great deal  We stayed here for      for the week for a double room  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful for my first trip to London  The room was big for Europe s size and the place was kept very clean  The breakfast was good and had everything I expected  We road the bus from the airport which is much cheaper and the walk from the Victoria Bus Terminal was only a few blocks  There is a laundry site just across the street and other closeby shops  The sandwich shop was great for noon snacks  We took the Original Tour of the city and the pickup location was only a few blocks  I would recommend the hotel and I would stay here again the next trip to London  
P =>   Great Hotel Very smart  newly refurbushed hotel which is in an old row of houses  Room was large  smart  big bathroom with power shower in a cubicle  Free Wifi too Balcony with opening doors  however no double glazing  Earplugs a must for street side rooms Very helpful staff and plentiful  varied breakfast Fantastic location     minute walk from Victoria tube station  with bars  restaurants and even a  Sainsburys ket  nearby Thoroughly recommend  
P =>   Great weekend away Enjoyed our stay at Victoria Palace  After reading some of the previous reviews  it was a pleasant surprise  The hotel was very clean in all areas  Had been tastefully refurbished  The staff were friendly  Room small  but had everything we needed   ideal for a weekend away  Everything worked  which isn t always the case in some hotels I ve stayed in recently  For London prices  it was good value for money  Good location  Victoria station not far away  Some really good restaurants within a very short walk from the hotel  Would stay here again  
P =>  Clean comfortable convenient We spent two nights here in ember  It s conveniently situated for Victoria Station  and the Gatwick Express  and there are lots of places to eat in the area Our double room was adequately sized  relatively spacious for london   the bathroom was ewly refurbished and clean  and there was a radiator  air conditioning and a flat screen TV Breakfast was a buffet  full English  amp  Continental  and served till    am  It s best to get there arly though  as some latecomers had to queue for tables the staff were freindly and let us leave our luggage there for a fee of    on our last day Overall  it was nice  amp  quiet  clean  non smoking and we had a lovely stay  
P =>  Location is good about    m from Victoria Station  Room is clean but small  Facilities are okay except that the wireless internet connection keeps on disconnecting  Signal not that strong Location is good  about    m away from Victoria station  There are good convenient stores  cafe and pub nearby  Staff is friendly and helpful  
P =>  Wonderful experience This nice boutique hotel made all the difference in making our London experience a positive one  Though small  the rooms are clean  modern and arranged with economy of space in mind  Just   blocks from Victoria Station transportation hub  Walking distance to the Thames and Buckingham Palace  Free internet and free breakfast  Very polite and helpful staff  We would stay here again  The prior review makes no sense  We slept like logs  
P =>   nice hotel i enjoyed the victoria  the location was good  and had good eating places nearby  hotel was clean  and staff friendly  would go again  
P =>   very good really comfortable and clean hotel the rooms and the bathrooms are quite spacious the receptions has been very kind and there is also the luggage deposit  excellent position near to Victoria Station  
P =>   Great nights sleep   Great Location   Great Price This is a great little hotel   not far from Victoria Station   Buckingham palace is a nice easy stroll away It s not fancy schmancy and the room was TINY   but for the price and location   it was perfection  The bed was a little too hard for my taste  but it was so quiet at night  I am an extremely light sleeper and our room was right above the main street  and I had no problem sleeping  There is also a computer with internet access in the lobby An extra little tip  There is a great Indian Restaurant right around the corner   very inexpensive and very good   Paradise Indian Restaurant    Denbigh St  Ask the reception for directions  
P =>  perfect locationnot expensive  I travelled to London with   friends for a girlie weekend at the end of feb       I picked this hotel after many hours of research on tripadvisor because it was inexpensive central near to victoria station which has an express train from gatwick airport and had triple rooms available  We got   rooms for   nights for    GBP which worked out very reasonable  The hotel has recently changed its name from the hamilton house hotel to the best western victoria palace hotel excellent location near to metro very safe area taxis always available outside hotel at night  rooms are spotlessly clean warm with air conditioning heating tea coffee facilities beautiful bathroom with shower breakfast excellent and served til     am staff very friendly couldnt really fault the hotel on anything would recommend it to anyone  
P =>   Great for being London Considering I during the years have had my worst hotel experiences ever in London I had very low expectations when arriving at Hamilton House with my husband and kids  But for ONCE I got pleasently surprised  We had booked the apartment two doors down from the main hotel  and I was relieved to find it had clean beds  a real bathroom  NOT a shower cabin stuck in the room on the wall to wall carpeting     with a tub  clean floors  central heating  yey    microwave  oven  fridge  miniature tv    everything in working order  No luxury  certainly  but for London at app      pounds per night   this was perfect  And   above all  it was CLEAN  Maid service every day  complimentary breakfast  great location   mins  stroll from Victoria and nice restaurants in the area  I will definately bookmark this hotel and return here  
P =>  lovely I had a enjoyable time  the room was on the third floor  clean and not noisy at all The hotel is very clean  new and the room had a big tv  DI appreciated the fact that there s an internet connection free for guests in the hall since internet caf  are pretty expensive there The neighborhood is fine  quiet and full of pubs  cafes and shops Victoria station is at   minutes walk  
P =>   Nice place My family just returned from   nights at the Hamilton House Hotel  We had   rooms  the pros and cons are as follows Pros Clean and Spacious  double room           twin          was smaller Very reasonably pricedHot breakfast includedPleasant staffEasy walk to Victoria StationPlenty of restaurants and grocery stores nearbyCons Building work going on  drilling started at about     Double room on the same level as the breakfast room and the elevator was just outside the door  so you wake up when breakfast starts at      Overall a very pleasant experience  There s a nice pub just across the street for an after theatre pint  
P =>   Most Enjoyable stay  The Hamilton has just undergone a complete refurbishment  Everything is completely new  Yes  they are still finishing the last of the bits and pieces  but the place is finally shining through  There was very little inconvenience due to the builders  Our rooms were on the  st and  th floor   and yes  they do have a lift  no slugging luggage and climbing stairs  The rooms were brand new  and a real pleasure  They had ALL the creature comforts one requires  The bathrooms were an absolute delight   all new  and state of the art The dining area was also large and spacious  with an excellent offering   three cereals  yogurts  toast  crousants  Chelsea buns  an assortment of jams and cheeses   and tea  or an assortment of coffees and hot chocolate  via a superb Nescafe machine There is also free internet access   hours a day in the foyer   only one PC though  and time is limited to    minutes a session  Also very conveniently placed   not far from Victoria Station Our stay here was most enjoyable  Excellent value for money  
P =>  Loved the London Hotel Apartments  We  myself  amp  a friend  had booked a room at the  London Hotel Apartments   which is affiliated with the Hamilton House Hotel  and also goes by the name of the Warwick Hotel Apartments   for late e  It was the  LG  apartment  which was supposed to have a double bed as well as a sofa bed in the living room  It actually turned out to be a twin bed The room had a very well stocked kitchen  including a microwave  mini fridge  gas stove  kettle  toaster  plenty of dishes and tea coffee  The pictures on the hotel s website of this room actually make it look a little more claustrophobic than it really is The living room area was quite large  with a tv  chair  love seat  sofa  and a twin bed  While there was no air conditioner  they did provide a fan and that served the purpose quite well  Had we been there during the summer heat waves  it may have been a different story  The furniture itself was showing a little age  but nothing horrible The bedroom had a double bed and a very large closet  There was also a set of French doors  which opened onto a tiny courtyard  which was not accessible by the general public   This is probably a good thing  since the doors didn t close very well The washroom was a pretty good size and they supplied a hair dryer as well as some basic toiletry items  The biggest complaint I have about the washroom was the lack of shelf space for us to put our own items The location of the hotel was great   a      minute walk from Victoria Station  The apartment was serviced daily and this included cleaning our dirty dishes  which we hadn t expected  The gentleman at the front desk when we arrived could not have been more helpful  He allowed us to store our luggage in the room  while it was being cleaned  we arrived   hours before check in   gave us a tour of the apartment and even helped carry our luggage down the winding stairs to the room  He also allowed us to use the washroom at main hotel to freshen up and he came to help out when I accidentally tripped a circuit breaker a few nights later  and blew out our lights  The gentleman that was there when we checked out wasn t quite so helpful  and wouldn t call us a cab on the rainy morning we checked out   we were only going to the Victoria Coach Station  and the hotel usually only deals with cabs that go out to the airports I would not hesitate to stay there again  The convenience of the apartment  the location and the service received more than made up for any of the minor negatives we experienced  
P => Basic but fine We actually stayed in an apartment beside the hotel  but went to the hotel each morning for breakfast  which consists of cereal  toast  croissants etc The apartment was fine  there was   in our party  It had a bedroom with a double bed  a bathroom  and large kitchen  dining and living area with a single bed and sofa bed  The apartment was basic but clean  and provided was a fridge  microswave  cooker  toaster etc so you can make your own lunch meal I would recommend this hotel  if your not fussed on quality  and just want someone handy to stay  The hotel staff were friendly and helpful  As we were in London sightseeing  we really didn t spend alot of time in the apartment  but it met all our needs  
P =>  Perfectly adequate I d read on Trip Advisor that this place was undergoing renovations a year ago  but didn t expect that they d still be going on  We arrived at a building site with all the associated banging and drilling  We were assured that the noise would only happen from      am to      pm each day  but a lone hammerer persisted until after   pm one evening  An afternoon nap to sleep off some of our jet lag was out of the question  Walking along unfinished corridors dodging all the builders  debris was difficult  When we opened the curtains in our room the view comprised scaffolding  piles of dirt  mud and garbage  and when it rained  muddy splashes came through the window  It was necessary to have the window open because London was coming out of a heatwave when we arrived  and it was   C in our room with no air conditioning nor fan Though we were staying three nights initially we were moved after two for some reason  Our first room was about the length and width of a tourist coach  With two single beds  a wardrobe and a bathroom down one side this left a narrow strip to move about in  It was easy to hit your head on the LCD TV mounted on a swivel arm projecting from the wall if you got up to visit the bathroom during the night  The bathroom was a little over a metre wide and reminded us of the washroom in a tourist coach or on a plane  Your knees banged against the vanity unit as you sat on the toilet and you hit your head on the mirrored cupboard when you stood up  There was a shower but no bath  The tiny amount of room between the basin and the door  about    cm  was all there was to undress in On our third night we were moved to another room  for reasons unknown  we assumed it was something to do with the building schedule   The staff told us that they would move our belongings while we were out during the day  which they duly did The new room was a much more agreeable shape  and the bathroom  still no bath  was a more normal size  with room at least to undress  Like the first room  there were plenty of unfinished fixtures  such as no air conditioning  tiles missing from walls  etc  We hoped that the exposed wires that kept getting jammed in the bathroom door  see picture  were not live  And there was a film of fine white dust over the insides of cupboard spaces  not a good environment for my digital SLR camera Let me now focus on some positives  They were obviously trying to turn this place into quite a classy hotel  The light fixtures  bathroom fittings and bed linen were high quality  and a swivelling  wall mounted LCD TV in our first room was a nice luxury  There were tea and coffee making facilities and hair dryers in both rooms  The    pounds a night room rate included a continental breakfast which  though not extravagant  was perfectly adequate  with a choice of corn flakes  rice crisps and muesli  milk  yoghurt  toast and spreads  croissants  two juices  coffee and tea  Some fresh fruit would have been nice  we provided our own to slice on our cereal If the renovations here are ever finished and they don t jack up the price  this should be good value  One reason they re less likely to increase rates I suppose is that there are dozens of competing hotels within a block of the place  The location is very convenient  about     metres from Victoria train station  and within an easy walk of at least a dozen decent restaurants and pubs  The hotel management and staff  Pakistani  we think  were very efficient and cordial We stayed here again for two nights at the end of our month in the UK  just before we flew out  and got another room like the second one above  But you ve probably read enough by now     
P =>  gr  This place is perfect   not expensive   good value   clean   good staff   OK breakfast  And handy to Victoria bus and train stations     minute walk   Situated in a reasonably quiet area   handy to local shops etc  
P =>  Cheap and Unpleasant We stayed in the Hamilton House Hotel in late tember       The room was tiny and smelt a little like urine  The furnishings had all been well used  and nothing looked particularly clean except the bedsheets  The receptionist was haughty and unhelpful and made us give him our keys for safekeeping whenever we left the hotel  We stayed on the sixth floor  and there were no lifts  so our legs tired quickly  On the plus side  the hotel is close to Victoria Station  
P =>  Hard to find the positives We    parents    kids  arrived to the Hamilton House early on a Saturday from Victoria Station after flying from Toronto  Not a bad walk  and the neighborhood looks pretty interesting  To the Hotel s credit  the rooms were available early  by    a m   so we were able to check in and get washed up  However  the first room given to my wife and me was miserable   first floor off the lobby  smoked in and with no windows  Shocking actually that they put anyone in there  They did reassign us on request  and we were put into small and dingy  but apparently clean rooms  We slept fine  Breakfast is a joke  Starbucks  and a better cafe  are down the street  The showers had water but were very narrow  The prior reviewer mentioned the stairs   also very narrow and formidible  We stayed two nights  but this place ended up setting very low expectations for all the other places we stayed for the rest of our trip  I can t recommend the Hamilton House  and would tell anyone who is large or has difficulty climbing to absolutely stay away  We later stayed at a comparably priced hotel in the same Victoria Plimico neighborhood and found better arrangements  though still not great   
P => clean adequate accommodation convient to city centre stayed at the Hamilton house hotel  Victoria london for Bank Hol weekend in   we arrived in Victoria station via the Gatwick express and walked to our hotel in less than    mins  Reception staff are courteous and polite  We had a triple room with ensuite  The room was adequate  The sheets were clean and fresh towels were provided everyday  We had a few problems with street noise the first night but were too tired to notice and slept well for the remainder of the trip  There is no lift in the hotel and we had to climb   flights of stairs to get to our room Breakfast is a self service affair and you have a have a choice of cornflakes or cornflakes   You have to queue to toast your bread and they will bring you beans  egg and bacon  Orange juice tea coffee etc are also available from the self service machine  You get used to this after a day or so  and the staff are friendly  We found the hotel handy for the city centre  The number    bus runs into Trafalgar Square every   to    mins or you can catch the tube from Victoria  If you are travelling as a family you can buy an off peak travel card for      per adult per day which you can use on the tube and on the buses  We were even able to get a reduction on the Boat trip to Greenwich with the card  Check out is at       but they kept our luggage until that evening

P =>   Terrible experience The only plus side is the location Negative points  Reception non existence  sit and watch TV or playing games and refuse to help at all  Leaves desk at eight at night then you are stuck  On departure the reception refused to contact taxi service so had to stand in the main road with all luggage to obtain taxi service by stopping taxi as they drive by  Two elderly ladies had to carry their luggage down flights of stairs as the reception refused to render any assistance   Rooms terrible stale and not ventilated  Had to finish making up the bead one day out of the   days as the bedspread was bundled up in the corner of the room   this was at nine in the evening on our return to the hotel Single bed linen on double bed does nor work  We slept more on the mattress as on the sheets and on top of it all the linen had holes in it as well   Breakfast What a disaster This hotel do not understand the meaning of continental breakfast  What you get is  A water downed artificial juice which tasted like nothing ever tasted before   Over Boiled cold eggs as blue as it can be   Cerials with no taste at all   Cheese  one variate  slivers so thin that in the event of lifting them they tare apart   Meat slivers from the lowest grade and standard possible   Only sliced bread which you had to toast yourself no other option of buns or muffins  fresh fruit or even yogurt available   One platter of the same cheese and meat every day  Dining room without table cloths and packed with to many tables and chairs for you to move around when      occupied In conclusionThe world rate South Africa as a  rd world BUT I can assure you that our one star Hotels are better than this three star dump  hotel  
P =>  Excellent Value Convenient Location We stayed at this hotel for one night    th       It was Room     on the second floor at the rear of the hotel so very quiet  Our room had a double and two single beds  although we had only asked for a double  with a small but clean and functional shower room  basin and toilet  Plenty of wardrobe and drawer space  TV  extra pillows and bedding in wardrobe  if needed   very clean and warm Excellent value for London for the price we paid         for two people B amp B one night via opus Travel com   Located within   minutes walk of Paddington station so within easy reach of Central London The hotel doesn t have a lift and as the breakfast room is in the basement may not be suitable for the elderly or infirm  Breakfast room was quite small and crowded but served a more than adequate cold buffet breakfast   juice  weak   cereals  bread   toast  preserves  cold meat and cheese  hard boiled eggs  tea or coffee Wouldn t hesitate to stay here again  Reception staff pleasant and efficient  
P =>   What a cute little place to stay  I loved this little hotel  It is easy to find from Paddington station  walking distance  so is very easy to get to from Heathrow airport  It is one little hotel in several similar hotels all in a row  set back from the street  There is no lift so pack light  The hallways  stairwells and rooms are very small and  English  and I loved that  We stayed in a room for two and you wouldn t have fit three people in the room but it was cosy  The rooms are clean and tidy and the bathroom is tiny but functional  It s not for the fussy travellers because of its size  but we are not very fussy and we loved it  would definately stay there again  There is also a cute little breakfast room downstairs which was excellent too  
P =>  Absolute dump Do not stay at this hotel  We made the mistake of booking   nights here and it was so bad that we left after the first night  In no particular order  the bad points are    There is no lift or elevator so if you have large suitcases and are staying on the higher floors  you will either have to lug them up to your room yourself or pay some poor cleaner   pounds to help you  The guy at reception will not help in any way    The rooms are TINY   one person and one suitcase cannot fit in a twin room at the same time  Also  two single beds will only fit in a twin room if they are pushed together  so don t expect any personal space at night      Supposedly  non smoking  room smelt terribly of stale cigarettes    Guy at reception goes home at  pm so if you need assistance after that time  you are out of luck    There is no ventilation so the rooms are very stuffy    There is no  full English Breakfast    what you get is reconstituted orange juice  thin pieces of toast and fake jam type substance to put on it This place is like many others near Paddington Station   an overpriced dump masquerading as a hotel  Read the other reviews and consider yourself warned  
P =>   Average hotel terrible breakfast  Beverley house hotel is the equivalent of a two star property  The ensuite room was average with a small but clean bathroom  The bed was nice and comfortable  However no tea or coffee making facilities and it is a shame the room was not as clean as the bathroom The breakfast is the worst breakfast i have ever had in any B and B or hotel watered down cordial orange juice and the choice of three cereals  all of which were very untasty The hotel is in a pleasant location  near to Lancater Gate tube for easy accessibility around London  
P =>  We won t stay here again On the plus side  the hotel is located on a charming and beautiful tree lined street  within walking distance to Hyde Park  and only   blocks from the Paddington Subway station  and several different lines of surface buses pass by the area  From the hotel  it s very easy and convenient to get to all the other attractions in London  especially by subway  The neighborhood has many restaurants  shops  pubs  and a post office  The rooms are clean and maintained daily  A free breakfast buffet consisting of assorted cheeses and cold cuts  hard boiled eggs  cold cereals  toast  juices  coffee  amp  tea  is available for guests On the minus side  the rooms are very small  and with luggage  leaves hardly any space to be  other than to prop oneself up on the bed  The bathroom was extremely small and one has to be very careful in moving about  not to bump into things  The hotel does not have an elevator  and our room ended up being on the  rd floor which meant having to haul our luggage up all the flights of stairs  and each floor consists of two staircases around a very tight turn  One of the clerks at the front desk told me that if they are given advance notice of a handicap or health related problem  they will try to accommodate a guest on the lower floors We won t stay at the Beverley again  but will try to find something that would be more suitable in this particular neighborhood  
P =>   Don t stay here First room they gave me here  sister hotel to the Nayland  was tiny and the loo didn t work  Reception closed at  pm but they moved me to another room just before they went off  TV didn t work in new room and windows draughty but okish for price  Went into bathroom at     am next morning and the lock on the door broke  Finally  released  at      am  No apologies  No refund  
P =>  Good location but be careful  The hotel located pretty good  some    m from Paddington station  where Heathrow Express  four tube lines and three major bus routes are intersected  There are a number of pubs  steak houses and other places to eat around  check out  quot Sussex Arms quot  and  quot The Bear and The Bishop quot    the last one is at the  rd level of Paddington Station  good selection of ales and traditional english food  The hotel is mostly sleep only  like many others in London    TV channels    of them are in Greek  like columns besides the entrance    When booking  try to avoid two basement level rooms  if you are not a hardcore traveller with just basic needs The breakfast is just average  The room service is surprisingly good  in some manner it was better than in Shanghai      Front desk sfaff is cheerful and helpful  
P =>   Um     All the reviews are spot on  The bathroom is TINY  The breakfast room is impossibly cramped  Please note why I am really writing this review   there are NO coffee tea making facilities in the rooms  They were happy to fill my flask with hot water at the sister Nayland Hotel  I would not stay here again  It was ok   no real complaints  Nicely decorated 
P => Loved the Beverley The room and bathroom at the Beverley were small but efficient and perfectly adequate for me and my two kids  The location was terrific  The front desk guy was really helpful and nice  as were the breakfast staff  I will definitely stay in the Beverley on future trips to London  
P =>   I loved the Beverley hotel  Hi  I travelled alone about two years ago  and found my stay quite pleasant  I had the free continental breakfast  which offered thefollowing  eggs  toast  jam  cheese  sliced ham  three kinds of cold cereal  grapefruit juice     milk  tea  coffee  I also found the rooms small  but packed lightly  only two pieces of luggage  The bathroom was small  but with a shower that does not operate on coins  it is a great deal  I bought a tour package  which ended up with me staying in a room by myself  with  free daily breakfast  t v   blowdryer  room safe  private bathroom  queen sized bed  comfortable   and good walking distance from the tube and inexpensive restaurants  all for      canadian a day I thought it was great value  and people get what they pay for    withthis hotel I got more than I paid for  I recommend it for people who are able bodied  as seniors with walkers or wheelchairs will find difficulty going up the stairs  There is no elevator  but the price I paid for included VAT as well  so I cannot complain  this is best for starving writers  like myself  or college students  or even honeymooners on a tight budget  
P =>   Cambiate subuto hotel se potete  
P =>   agreable sejour  
P => 
P =>   not all bad After reading the rewievs  I was really scared of coming to the hotel  BUT fortunately it wasnt that bad  The staff was nice  the room   a standard single   was small but had everything I needed  location perfect and the breakfast was ok  The floors ARE very squeaky  but it s an old building  so what can you expect   All in all I m very happy that I took the chance with this hotel  I didnt pay much  and I got what I paid for  So fair trade  
P =>  No value for money   don t be tempted by the price Although the hotel is very conveniently located within   mins  from Baker Street Station  this is probably the worst hotel I ever stayed at  Strange people tend to hang around the reception area  The rooms are super tiny and very very old  The worst part is the insulation of the windows   it s just as if there wasn t any  so just imagine yourself sleeping on top of a London doubledecker bus     including the draught  There seems to be only one room going out to the back so you can be pretty sure to have a noisy night There s plenty of other options very close by   so just ignore Bickenhall Hotel and save yourself a dreadful stay  
P =>   absolutely awful  how the owners of this place have the cheek to call this a hotel i dont know  when it was given any star status must have been years and years ago  as it is certainly not worthy of any stars now  where shall i start form the ceilings which is falling down in places to the threadbare carpets wallpaper hanging off walls uneven broken floorboards  you can hear every creaking footstep of the people in the room above  no cups for the tea making facilies  mouldy shower and a dirty limescaled toilet  the list is endless  yes they do provide beakfast but even that was served by a disinterested woman in a freezeing cold room with a broken catflap that was just a hole in the outside door  any creature could have access and looking at the place it prob does  the location however is good but there are many budget hotels in london and we have never ever come across one as bad as this  it should be closed down and the owners should be nade to improve it  shame on you expedia for even listing it  in short DO NOT EVER CHOOSE THIS HOTEL  
P =>   OK location  Well the best thing is the location only two mins from Baker Street station  From the outside it looks ok as well  Reception staff were on the minimum wage and i felt sorry for them  they must get so many complaints  The rooms were tired  paint peeling off walls etc but were clean as far as I could see  The worst thing was the constant noise from the creeky floor boards   Above me were several people in a room who were busy until      am  What they were up to I am not sure   its that sort of hotel  Breakfast in the morning was not good  with the english breakfast especially not recommended and the cornflakes probably had a sale by date of last year  The oddest thing was the breakfast room looked as though it had been decorated by a   year old  there was paint on the threadbare carpet and the door had obviously been painted in less than   minutes  So overall impression was disappoiting   apart from the location which was good  
P =>  Horrible The room is filthy  the staff unfriendly  the place is awful  It is conveniently located but that is all Bedding was covered in hair and staff was put out to change the sheets when we arrived  The shower would not shut off and then flooded into the lobby  They would occasionally turn off the water  stranding you in the shower without notice The bathroom was stained  dirty  had hair on walls and floor  and the towels were rank and stained as well Included breakfast should warn that it includes dirty dishes and stale cereal There is external construction on the building and the laborers were standing in the window of our room for   days scraping the mortar  Noisy  and no privacy For the price paid  the reviews are off  STAY AWAY  
P =>  Needs modernising As most reviews say its very handy for the town centre  Just a short walk from ylebone Station and Baker Street tube station  The hotel itself is okay for one night but no more The hotel was old and tired looking  It requires modernising  The shower was very good with good pressure and hot water  The English breakfast consisted of  x sausage   x strip of bacon   x hash brown and  x eggs  very poor quality  Over all I wouldn t say I would stay there again  
P => Needs redecorating   fast Have to agree with other reviewers that this place has a good location   But thats about it  The place is in dire need of re decorating   and a bloody good cleaning  Bed cover in my room was torn   carpet dirty  bathroom in need of some chemical cleaning   I could go on   only constant noise I heard was the floor boards in the rooms around me   Receptionist seemed ok  if a bit bored  Breakfats staff were nice  I d say this place is good for those not expecting much   just a bed for the nite  Did notice it had WIFI  but didn t have my laptop to test it out  
P =>   Good location Six of us stayed for the London marathon weekend  The reviews nearly put us off but we enjoyed our stay  Yes it is old and getting tatty but the room and en suite were clean and the breakfast was good  and very accommodating to the   children   For the price and the great location we felt it was OK  
P =>  A great deal better than expected I ve just come back from a   nights stay in London where my mum and I stayed at the Bickenhall Hotel  Having read the other reviews on this site I wasn t really sure what to expect of the hotel  I dreaded the worst  but was pleasantly surprised  Yes  the hotel needs re carpeting  especially in the hall and staircases   and new wallpaper  and somebody really ought to do something about the squeaking floorboards    but considering that it s an economy hotel it s definitely acceptable  The room was not as small as feared  the staff was friendly and helpful and the breakfast was decent  Furthermore  the location is great  The hotel is located really close to busses and Baker Street Station  Unfortunately this also has a downside  with the hotel being located on a very busy and fairly noisy road I would definitely consider staying at this hotel again  
P =>  avoid at all costs smelly dirty noisy  its a disgrace there are plenty of others in the same area for the same cost  all of which are better amazing that these guys survive in central london  i ve stayed in better hostels in the  rd world  
P =>  Excellent location could be improved Great value for money  the rom was small but attractive and clean  Excellent location  Only problem to be kept in mind were the creaky floors   very noisy  Breakfast could be improved as well   the orange juice wasn t very nice at all However  the staff was very friendly and the location  a few minutes  walk from Baker Street tube and with a selection of buses right outside the front door  was unbeatable  
P =>  Good hotel I checked out of another hotel  and had to go looking for another hotel on foot  I was very happy with my stay here  The room was adequate  The bathroom was new and everything worked great  The rooms are small   but most rooms are small in London   but it was adequate and I loved the high ceiling  The breakfast was very good  All of the staff were very nice and helpful  The location was perfect just a few minutes walk to the tube  The only thing that needs improvement is the carpet is worn on the steps  but for the price I paid this place was perfect  Also  if the receptionist did not smoke would be a nice change I would stay here again  
P =>  Smokers haven No elevators  Not clean  Cats everywhere  Some people from reception are smoking and if you have a room near by the smokes gets you  and the smell of cooking in the morning  One bright point is the receptionist Taraneh very nice and helpful

P =>   Highly Recommended  My husband and our    year old daughter stayed here for   nights in Room    with one double bed and one twin and private bath  While the room and bath were small  it was very clean and comfortable  The shower was tiny  but the hot water and good pressure made up for it  The innkeeper Kevin was a great guy  He found us a taxi to Heathrow for almost the same amount as the Heathrow Express  Breakfast was included and provided a good start to the day  The area seemed relatively safe and was within easy walking distance to the Pimlico and Victoria stations  We actually walked from Vauxhall with luggage without difficulty   P S  I got a better rate by writing to Kevin directly rather than going through any of the websites online   
P =>  Would definitely stay again  We had a wonderful   night stay at Blades Hotel  Kevin and the staff were fabulous   friendly  helpful  and so pleasant  Our room was very comfortable and incredibly quiet  The location was perfect   just a few blocks from a Tube station and a bus stop almost right at the door  The value was amazing   we couldn t have asked for anything more  
P =>  Same postcode as the Queen  We booked this hotel because of its location  A previous review rated the location as  poor    so the Queen live in a poor location as she shares same postcode  Really silly question  Very clean hotel  not   star but that reflects in room rates  Great buffet breakfast and very good staff who make the stay very pleasant  Advice on events and hotels from a guy who seems to run the place  No lifts so ask for a lower floor if a problem  i t is a period building  The best bed and breakfast hotel we have stayed in a capital city  Local transport   BRILLIANT  
P =>  Refurbishment Required Tiny Room The external appearance is fine once you are inside it all goes wrong  The overall decor is poor and our tiny room located   flights up was very poor Holes in the wall holes in the curtain holes in the towels The lock on our bedroom door required much attention to make it work it looked as if it had been broken into and then badly repaired The shower was pathetic On the positive side the sheets were clean and the bed was reasonably comfortable but not good enough to change our overall view  would we return NO WAY 
P =>   A friedly gem We have stayed at Blades several times  and enjoy returning there  Kevin s friendly attention in the  non cooked but excellent  breakfast room is a highlight  Drawbacks are the steep stairs   especially on the top floor  and the occasional need to seek help with the shower taps  but everything is there   if one asks  Very convenient for bus and tube  
P =>   We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Blades Hotel  We like to stay in this location when we go to London and this year left booking til very late but were lucky to get into this hotel  Keven and the staff made the stay very enjoyable indeed  We were lucky  lt haha gt  to get one of the top floor rooms and as Kevin said by the time we reached the top with our luggage we would have  quot faith quot   For those who cannot do steps it is something to consider when booking  For us it simply gave us some more exercise  The rooms are VERY clean and have everything you need  Everything was in good working order  There is a lovely place on the  rd level I believe for you to sit in an open concept room and enjoy the day or evening  We would definetly book at the Blades Hotel now instead of the other hotel where we usually stay  
P =>   Excellent Kevin great mine host  Room large clean and welcoming  great location  Breakfast all you could need with Kevin on hand to help with sightseeing and easy transport  would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a break in London 
P =>  Great location personal service Spent five wonderful nights at the Blades with my husband and two teens  Room was small but adequate   typical of European hotels  Kevin was great and the personal touch by him and his staff was terrific  Breakfast was great and includes cheese and meat but nothing hot  The only thing I would change is to provide some variety in the breakfast buffet for those of use who spent more than   or   days in the hotel  Wifi was available but didn t always work very well Would definitely stay at the Blades again and would recommend to others  
P =>   Will return  Kevin and his staff were welcoming and friendly  Upper floor rooms were very quiet  even with windows open all night  Breakfast was a friendly affair with other travelers exchanging ideas  The teen shoppers were thrilled with Kevin s suggestions  More like a B amp B than cookie cutter hotel  and perfect for a family  
P =>   Great value for money I would reccomend the hotel it s great if your staying in London for a few days  I stayed with a group of friends it was all our first time in London and the tube stike was on when we were their but we still found it really easy to get around and the hotel was pretty central The room was cosy but it was clean would have been better if the towles were replaced daily but overall I was pleased with the room The staff were lovely and very helpfull I would use the hotel again next time I m in London  
P =>  The Blades Hotel is brilliant  On our first morning in London  Kevin  the wonderfully witty manager of the Blades Hotel  marched our group of four plus several of his other guests off past Buckingham Palace for  quot something we must see quot   It was only a short walk  the hotel is wonderfully located  and Kevin kept us entertained the whole way  We stopped just down from the palace at the edge of a small group of people  Minutes later  cars started arriving carrying various members of the Royal Family  In short order  THE ENTIRE ROYAL FAMILY  the Queen  Prince Charles  Princes William  Edward and Harry  etc   etc  etc   showed up to unveil a statue of the Queen Mother  Had any other hotel manager taken the time to walk his guests to this once in a lifetime event  Absolutely not and that s why Kevin and The Blades Hotel in London gets our highest possible recommendation  
P =>   Great Hotel My daughter and I have now enjoyed two weekends in London and have used Blades Hotel on each occasion  The hotel is in an excellent location being vey good for transport links to all the tourist attractions sights  The rooms are clean and the staff are very helpful  Breakfast is provided and very good with a selection of fruit  cereal  choice of breads  cold meat and cheese  The addition of crumpets is a nice touch  We were very well looked after both times and would not hesitate to recommend others to try the hospitality extended to guests at Blades 
P =>   Great Family Hotel Traveling with   young children to London can be a daunting task  It s great to know that when you arrive at the Blades Hotel you ve found a comfortable home for the week  The Blades has one of London s few family rooms that actually will accommodate a family of    You trade off a hallway bathroom  private to the room   but it s more than made up for by the clean and comfortable room that fits a family and all your belongings  The convenience of being   minutes from the blue line on the tube and half a block from the bus stop is tremendous  All of this is topped off by the friendly staff  Our youngest child considered the manager  Kevin   who welcomes you to breakfast each morning  one of the highlights of her trip  Breakfast is served in an intimate dining room  with a nice selection of choices  The guests were from all over Europe which makes for an educational and very international experience  The staff was very kind to the children  helpful for touring tips and went out of their way to help with my internet needs  They even decorated with red white blue balloons and signs for the presidential inauguration  I found this hotel on Trip Advisor and agree with the many positive postings that led us to book here  Highly recommend  
P =>   Great little hotel in an excellent location  I was traveling to London for the World Travel ket Show and my husband wanted to tag along  Since he and my   year old daughter hadn t seen London  I brought them along so they could sightsee while I worked  The Blades Hotel met all our needs  Very close to the Victoria Tube station  which is a hub for many lines  the Blades is a great neighborhood in Kensington  close to restaurants  transport and shopping  The staff is all lovely  very friendly and accommodating  Kevin  the proprietor  takes good care to help you make the most of your trip  For example  my husband was going to take my daughter up to see the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace  Kevin suggested that she might be more interested in seeing the changing of the Horse Guard  which is just as beautiful  but with better access and a clearer vantage point for a small child  He was right  As for the accommodations  the rooms are clean and well appointed  Breakfasts are simple but quality  We will definitely stay here again  Note  While this hotel is highly recommended  note that it is  quot low frills quot   So if you re looking for a chocolate on your pillow  stay elsewhere  But if you want a well located  clean  friendly and comfortable  and well priced  hotel  the Blades is your place   
P => Great location spotless great staff We enjoyed a room for   nights  There were   of us for   night and   for the other three and we were able to stay in the triple for the price of the double which was great so we didn t have to pack up and move  The bedroom and bathroom were spotless  beds comfortable  view was nice  Breakfast was good with excellent service and converstion from Kevin  Lydia was helpful and sweet during checkin  Location is wonderful  easy walk from Victoria Station and Pimlico Underground  Bus      which runs up through Trafalgar square  stopped half a block away and the area seemed safe at night  Local restaurants including a Pizza Express and a Tapas bar were really tasty  Thanks for a great stay  We ll be back  
P =>   A little shabby but did the job  Recently stayed at Blades for a weekend and on first impressions thought the hotel was adequate We had the last room available which was a single room with a double bed and there was enough room for both of us  The room was clean but it really smelt of Garlic  The smell was so strong we kept the window open day and night  The bed was lumpy and could of done with renewing  The room did not have a hairdryer and tea and coffee facilities as advertised and therefore didn t take a hairdryer with me so that was a bit inconvenient  The bathroom was ok with a good power shower which was welcome after a long day in the big smoke The breakfast was basic but there was plenty of it and set us up for the day  The staff were friendly and helpful  the manager was always up for a laugh and making jokes  very amusing So basically it catered for our needs as all we wanted was somewhere to sleep at the end of the night  If you want luxury then probably not ideal but otherwise a good base for sightseeing and very reasonsible in price  
P =>   Excellent value for money I was very impressed  The location is fantastic  a    minute walk and you re at the Houses of Parliament   and the staff is friendly and welcoming  The hotel is located in an old house  but it s well kept up and my room had modern and perfectly adequate fittings  the bathroom  especially  was new and clean   My room was quite tiny  but I believe most are larger  mine was a special one in the mezzanine which was going for cheaper rates just because of its smallness   And tiny or not  I had an en suite bathroom and plenty of those little extras that make for a comfortable stay  coffee making equipment  sachets of shampoo  a TV  etc    Oh  and it was perfectly clean  The only thing that wasn t perfect was the bed  which was a bit lumpy  but nothing too bothersome What else  Breakfast was also really nice  with good food and plenty of variety  check in and check out were a breeze and the staff allowed me to leave my luggage there until the afternoon the day I checked out  Highly recommended  
P =>   Overall not impressed Last e I made my  th trip to London  I had always stayed in the Sussex Gardens area and I had spent the first   nights of this trip in Sussex Gardens before going to Normandy and Paris  I returned to London from Paris and decided to spend my last   nights at the Blades Hotel  based on glowing reviews on this and other travel sights I was disappointed with my room at the Blades  It was at the very top of the building at the end of a long climb of stairs  The room was shabby and in need of a good cleaning  It was very stuffy and the small fan provided served only to blow the dust bunnies around  There was no screen in the window and opening the window was an invitation for the flies to occupy the room  Getting some sleep was not easy On the positive side I did enjoy the breakfast room and the selection of food available  The only staff I encountered were two very young girls  who were very polite and helpful I am returning to London this tember and I will be going back to the Sussex Gardens area  
P =>  Comfortable beds Blades Hotel makes up for the tiny bathroom with the hospitality of it s staff and the very comfortable beds  In fact  I was told I was only the second person to sleep on the beds in our room  so they are quite new  Most beds on our   country trip were hard  but not these  they were comfortably soft  so it was the best sleep I got on my entire trip  I also enjoyed the breakfast and opportunity to ask touristy questions  plus looking around teh sunroom  The staff bend over backwards to help  especially the feather light lady who carried our very heavy luggage up the stairs       handed us an informational sheet all about the neighborhood  set us up with a pot of tea for our room  and told us where we could grab a bite to eat  The room is done up nicely for a budget hotel and has a traditional English feel with the chinz drapes  Another reviewer mentioned the lack of closet  but the closet rod is in a open area like the bay of a bay window  I thought the open space made the small room feel bigger  and I liked the tin ceiling  I truly feel that  other than gaining more space  the hotel is at its best  
P =>  The Blades is the  Cutting Edge  Cute  little hotel  Wonderful staff  Located close to an underground station  Good breakfast each morning  We had the  nd floor balcony just above the Blades sign  It was a good sized room and suited our needs  
P =>  Great location and more We were recommended by friends in Orlando who stayed before to go to the Blades Hotel  It lacks elevators and some other modernisation as it a late Victorian house converted to a hotel but it is a really clean and friendly with a brilliant location  While were there there was the royal State Opening of Parliament and the hotel manager  Kevin  took all the guests to a great spot on the route of the Queen s procession to Westminster   a sensational day  Our room was a moderate size and the breakfast was a time to plan the day with advice been given on theatres and places to visit  Certainly will stay there again and recommend it to family and friends  
P =>   Not as good as wrote in the reviews We stayed in Blades for   nights and there were bed bugs  Although the manager moved us to another room for the last night  he didn t apologize for the problem and kept saying that they never had the problem before and suggest we probably got beaten somewhere  The sheets and towels were not changed everyday but every   days  So if you stay there for   nights  you ll just get fresh towels on the first day  The breakfast was ok but pretty basic  As the reviews said  the manager entertain the guests every morning during breakfaster  it was nice  but we don t pay     just for jokes  The hotel is at a decent location  which is very near to the Pimlico station on the Victoria line  There are plenty of B  amp  Bs on the same road so keep your choice open  
P =>   Good Hotel  Does What It Says on the Tin  We stayed the second weekend in ch    for   nights  The Hotel is literally   minutes walk from  Pimlico  Underground station  which gives quick access to the centre of London  Victoria Railway station is one stop up the line  We received a warm welcome from the Staff  who where friendly and helpful throughout our stay  The rooms were very clean along with the bedding and the En suite Showeroom  The room we had   st floor  was a good size in relation to the price paid  it gave you enough room to move about without falling over each other  The En suite Showeroom was all you needed and worked for us  however was very small and could be a challenge for above average to large sized people  The Breakfast was good with a selection of different cereals  breads cold meats and cheese etc  The only thing we felt missing that we like to see in a continental breakfast would be some croissants   fresh pastries  otherwise it was good  In relation to the prices of other hotels we looked at in London this hotel was good value for money  clean  with good transport links to the rest of the city  we would happily stay here again   
P =>   Clean convenient and friendly We received a warm and helpful reception from the manager  The room was small and the bath even smaller but sufficient for our needs  The Underground was only   blocks away and the    Bus was just out the front door  Wonderful coffeeshop around the corner along with a friendly Spanish restaurant and nifty pizza place  All in all a good value in incredibly expensive London  
P => A very nice stay Just called in off the street looking for somewhere to stay and was offered a room immediately Very comfortable hotel and room  The service from the reception was very personal and welcoming  The bed was extremely comfortable and I had one of the best night s sleep I have ever had outside of my own home Convenient location and it was very quiet too Next morning there was a generous breakfast including fresh fruit  ham and cheese and a choice of cereals and juices  All supplied fresh and not from a machine Would stay again  Dr J Penney 
P =>  One star  Wouldn t recommend to a friend We stayed there five days in e      in a double  First  it was hot in London  And  our room was on the top floor  no elevator by the way      Loud and hot  The window was a single pane glass  So at night  it was so loud that we couldn t sleep until  AM when people outside started going to bed  and traffic died down  And  it was so hot with no A C that we couldn t even get comfortable  After walking around London and sightseeing for    hours per day  you want to be able to go back to an air conditioned room  So  we sweated all day  and went home and sweated at night  It was miserable     Terrible bed  The bed was like a foam stuffed bag with springs sticking into us  It was probably the cheapest bed that they could find     Dirty towels and linens  The towels were about as thin and cheap as a one star in the United States  To make matters worse  they didn t wash them for three days  So you had to hang up your dirty towels to dry every day  The U K  law for Hotels is to wash at least every three days in London  So  Blades does the bare minimum required by law     Tiny bathroom  This bathroom was obviously an add on  So what you have is a small bedroom room about    feet by   feet  And inside that room is a tiny shower toilet  about   feet by     feet     Non English staff  If you want an English B amp B experience you can t get it at Blades  The staff is not from England  Nothing wrong with the people  however  if you are in London  you want to have someone who has lived there their whole life to give you tips and interesting conversation  The owner manager Kevin made a cameo appearance one day  He is great  but not around     location  It is not by Victoria Station  it is one stop after Victoria station  Since you will use the Tube everyday to go to Westminister or the Tower  you should stay near Westminister  That way you can save the    day on Tube tickets for two people  Add that to the cost of the Hotel room and it is about       night  So for the same price or perhaps     more  you can stay in an air conditioned     star hotel with washed towels  elevator  comfortable bed  and a good nights sleep  It is ridiculous to stay at Blades for that price when you can get comfort for the same price on the other side of the Thames in Westminister     Breakfast was lame  I don t know why they advertise a  quot hearty breakfast quot    it is essentially Wheaties  yougurt  bread  and some canned mixed fruit  The meat is ham cold cuts  Yum     customer service  when we complained it was too hot  and loud to sleep the young lady working there immediately blamed us  She said   quot why don t you wear earplugs  Aren t you tired from walking all day  You should have no problem sleeping   you must not be walking enough  quot  Meanwhile  we walked    hours per day  and the room was sweltering  She did move us though to the back of the house which was much quieter  
P =>  Just Right  We were absolutely delighted with the Blades Hotel  If you want a clean  quiet room with comfortable beds and aren t looking for frills  this place is for you  Our family of four felt right at home from the moment Lydia checked us in  Four nights later  we were sad to leave  and had no regrets whatsoever with our decision to stay here  We would highly recommend it to families visiting London  
P => For the price this hotel is a fabulous place to stay in the heart of London My husband and I spent   nights at the Blades hotel          and we thoroughly enjoyed everything about the place  First of all  it s in an absolutely ideal location   just a short walk to Victoria Station  Since we love to walk cities  we walked everywhere  Buckingham Palace was perhaps a       minute walk and there s lots to see right in that area  The owner  Noreen  and Kevin  the Manager were exceptionally friendly and helpful  Kevin adds a lot of spice to your stay and is always cheerful  In another review  the person states the bathrooms are small but I didn t find that they were so small  They are quite standard based on other hotels we ve stayed in  The sheets and towels were crisp and clean and the room was very clean   something that s of utmost importance to me  We loved London and will be going back and there is no doubt that we will stay at the Blades Hotel again  If you do stay there  check out the following restaurants just a few blocks from the Blade Hotel  Jomuna at    Wilton Road  it s wonderful Indian cuisine and reasonably priced  prior to going to London I did not eat Indian food at all   I m now a convert   and SeaFresh at       Wilton Road for excellent fish   we were told this is where the locals go  You will not be disappointed in the Blades Hotel if you re looking for something reasonably priced       night  in the heart of London  
P =>  I might stay here again The staff was extremely friendly and accomodating and the rooms were spacious  My only complaint is that the bathroom and room were not the cleanest and towels had an odd smell  The hotel was fine for one night but I might think twice about staying there for an extended period of time  
P =>   Bien comunicado  
P =>   isamente ottimo rapporto qualit  prezzo  
P =>   Accueillant et sympathique

P =>   Dive Your better off going to millets and buying the cheapest tent they have and sleeping on the streets as soon as we checked in we were met by a nice guy on the dest who was qucik enuff to tell us about all the trips and take our money  after    min s of him talking   not sure what about  he sent us to our room up   flights of stairs with beding on each floor got to our room OMG iv never seen so many stains the cleaner here is on a winner easy money for her  while walking in later at night we came across the hotel gaurd a rat leaving a window very fast  next day woke up went for food which you wouldnt feed to a dog on the street  then went to get my car from a car park    min s walk away which cost me     for    hrs on the web site it tells you rates for people in the hotle the guy who run s the car park knows nothing about it but london was great 
P =>   Don t listen to all the whiners    you get what you pay for   After reading all the poor reviews on this place here  me and my travel companions were prepared for the worst  But fortunately the horrors of the hotel was nowhere to be found   We were   people and stayed in two rooms  quad and double   during a peak of activity in the weekend of NFL International Series   Wembley The quad room was rather small and a bit crowdy at times  but the overall standard was good  The double room appeared a bit larger than the quad room  strangely   and the standard here was equally good  The reception had been given wrong information regarding the number of beds in the double room  but instnatly agreed to switch rooms as soon as a new room with to single beds became available  The continental breakfast was a bit rubbish  but you can t really say you re surprised That brings me to the overall perspective  You get what you pay for  so when the overall rate for   people in a quad room for three nights comes out to          and the rate for two people in a double room for two nights comes out to about          you can t really complain about the smallest of things  especially given the convinient location of the place  You should expect a clean room  which was provided to the fullest with dailly cleaning and changing of sheets  You should also expect a service minded staff  which also was provided in full  Other than that  every other aditional service  is just a bonus  So to sum up  the Blair Victoria isn t the best hotel in London  and not the best in the nearest surrondings either  But at a very reasonable price and with a great location  within     m walk to Victoria Station  you can t really complain    and you shouldn t either  
P =>   Bed bugs Two nights in Room    resulted in me suffering over    bed bug bites from neck to ankles  For    days I had lumps the size of   p pieces  blisters and gnawing itches  This hotel is filthy and old  The male front office staff were helpful but the building does not offer creature comfort  Take our advice   stay away  
P =>  disgusting walked into the room  barely put bag down and walked back out  Brought down to basement  nearly broke our necks over sheets on stairs and then brought into pokiest  dirtiest room I ve ever seen  Wouldn t put a sewer rat in it  Definitely wouldn t recommend it  Left and got a decent place nearby  
P =>   This is the worst place I have ever stayed    We have just got back from staying there for   nights  At first we were put in a tiny room in the basement  which hardly had any standing room between the bed and the walls and the view from the window was a brick wall  After complaining we were transfered to a room on the  st floor which at least had a view of a street  but again was tiny  we couldn t even open the wardrobe doors  and the bathroom was very mouldy and none of the windows shut properly and the whole room looked like it hadn t ever been cleaned with a duster  My partner paid extra for a full english breakfast whilst I had the continental breakfast  choice of   cereals and that was it  After the first breakfast we didnt go again  This hotel nearly ruined our holiday and I would never recommend this place to anyone  The place looked full  mainly foreign tourists  and I felt ashamed that this would be their first image of England  
P => loved the service A clean hotel with great service i really dont know what people are saying   We asked for a spair pillow and they gave us one beds were made each time we came back and towels were prepared for us small but ok for sleeping in       
P =>   disgusting this hotel is terrible  It was nothing like the picture so do not be fooled  The room was so small we could hardly walk around  the bathroom was so small that when you sat on the toilet your knees touched the door  the toilet seat in ours and my collegues fell off  the curtains were hanging off and the duvet cover was black with dirt and mouldy   need I say more   DO NOT GO HERE 
P => Stay Away    The worst place I ve ever seen  This  quot hotel quot  is dirty and has none of the facilities they say  The room was small and unfitting for humans  Dirty and smelly  The bathroom was a plasic cabin there the water ran constantly on the floor The room was in the basement with a window facing a   by   meter hole  The other window was in the cielling  No fireescape at all Television     quot  with a buildin antenna which made i impossible to see anything  Just thinking about it makes my sick  
P =>  Cheap but nasty The room was small   the bathroom was a capsule where there wasn t enough room to close the door if you were on the toilet  The whole room was dirty with mould on the floor from the bathroom  windows that were falling apart and dirty bedding  I complained and they did as good as job as possible at cleaning the room but it was still bad  I made the mistake of not checking the reviews before booking and the photographs of the rooms on the webiste looked good  I appeciate this was cheap but there are much much better hotels around for the same or less money  I feel embarrased to think that people from all over the world will stay here and think this is what English hotels are like  DON T STAY HERE  Note that the photos added to this site for this hotel make our room look   star  
P =>  it could be better i booked two rooms in blair victoria hotel for spending my new eve year  i lived there for   nights with my girlfriend  his bother and a friend of our  my pourpose was visiting all day trought london and using the hotel only to sleep  and on my opinion that s good  i don t understand all the bad rewiews i read and that frightened me before arriving  i know that one room is different from another and that we had two good rooms  they were cleaned every day  exception for the cleaness under the beds  i MUST be done   receptionists were friendly  i think ik one asked them to change room they could  the proplem is the way someone asks    there are things that MUST change because i know that it cannot be called an hotel  first of all breakfast    it s not continental neither british  than sanitary  that werw cleaned in a good way all the mornings  have to be reapired  and so all windows must be checked  i think that is our duty warning receprionist of wrong things  i read about the problem o excaping in case of fire  it s a problem of all british house   in the end i didn t see the tudor inn but i heared by to visitors it was awfull my opinion of blair victoria is good also for the location dear owner i suggest you to change lot of thing and to close for some day to restructure  this should be correct towards visitors  but visitors should not complain and should choose an hotel also for the thing they want to do  fr a traveller and a tourist is a good place  but it MUST improve domenico mombello  italia 
P =>  Never again  I regret not having checked the reviews you had written before  We always go to this kind of B amp B and never had seen any like this  filthy carpet  walls  toillet  shower We had to ask for toillet rolls  towels  Tea and coffee facilities are full of limescale  tea bags are loose  anyone can caught over  touch them    Sheets weren t changed for   nights Our first night was terrible  some guests were drinking  smoking  It is not allowed  and fighting with the stuff  after and early flight and a long day touring the city what you need is a good sleep  don t you  Well  it was   o clock in the morning and the  quot show quot  was going on  When asked about what was happening  the stuff  very rude  just told me to speak to the manager in the morning   Cleaning lady came in without knocking the door Don t go if you want have a good time I had forgotten it  The building is falling down  no works have been done in the past   years at least  What is goig to say management about this  You cannot say I was there   years ago and things have changed  I saw it   weeks ago  ember       Good Luck  
P =>  Room Ok   Major Improvements needed The location of the Blair Victoria Hotel is perfect  with only a   minute walk to the Victoria Tube  bus  and train station  You step out of the hotel door into the local area  which has many shops  including restaurants and bars   so I love the hotel for the location The reception area and stair case needs serious maintaince  with cracks in the walls  and badly needed painted walls aswell  The people at the reception desk were friendly  and let me view the room before paying The hotel is very good for visitors who need internet access with    a night WiFi access that I didn t have any problems connecting to from the hotel room The room was small  but clean  and featured storage units  wardrobe  tv  bedside cabinet and en suite bathroom  which appeared to be recently refitted with shower  toilet and sink The view from the hotel room wasn t appealing  overlooking over buildings in a yard  but then it is ember  and its dark by  pm in the evening  so that wasn t a problem The major problem for me was the noise  I was next to the staircase and I could hear every whisper  and every footstep  the walls are thin so you can hear people next door if they are noisy  or have the TV up loud The hotel appeared secure  and yes you had to leave your doorkey with the reception  but I did not find that to be a major problem So to recap   hotel needs major maintaince in the reception and stair case  noisy hotel if you happen to be with noisy guests  great location  okay room with cheap WiFi 
P =>   what a joke When we looked at the pictures for this hotel  it looked very nice  What a joke      it was dirty  had a funny smell  and needed a full refurbishment  thank god we only had to speand   night here  
P =>  Dirty Hotel This Hotel is absolutely disgusting and dirty  Everywhere was fiflthty  the only clean parts were the entrance  amp  reception  made out to decieve people  In the morning i noticed the roof in my room was leaking  and over heard other guests saying they had the same problems  They try and con you by saying that the hotel is under refurbishment written in the inroom certificate  but this is clearly a lie  as the other reviews have been bad for some time on this place I had saw skin on arms after staying here  This place is run by Asians  They will not let you keep you re key on you  you have to hand it to reception every time you leave the building  very annoying and should not be the case with a hotel  The door to my room had a gap of about   quot  underneath between the carpet and door I would say that this Hotel is not fit to be in bussiness  and should be closed down under health and safety untill it is improved and made safe  After seeing the condition of this hotel i certainly did not risk eating breakfast here  it really put me off the idea 
P => The place is real bad Positives  white bedsheets  helpful reception staff Negatives  everything else you can ever think of A terrible hotel worth less than     for double B  amp  B after considering convenient location in London  By the way  the Breakfast of B  amp  B means bread and butter only  
P =>   Disgusting and a fire hazard Most of the adjectives have all ready been used  but one thing that I found most disturbing was the apparent lack of fire escapes  Three floors up a narrow threadbare staircase  carrying cases  was too much for two     people  and no fast way down in an emergency  Booked and paid through Hotel Club wholesale  Never again  
P =>   The worst place I ve been    I arrived late at night and that was the only reazon why I stayed for that night I was going to be there for   nights and even paid for them as I made a reservation on the Internet  Looking at the website the Hotel seems to be a lot better    but in fact the place is not clean at all and seems to be falling apart  It s really terrible  The rooms are way too little  the service is not very helpful and I even asked for an invoice and didn t get one  On the next morning I tried to get a refund for the second night but I couldn t get a single pennie  I only stayed there for about    hours and have to say it was the most awful experience I had on an hotel  and I do travel a lot  I went to another other near by to spend my second night in London  This place should be closed down as it probably is even a danger for the public health  I ve never seen a place so dirty as this one  I was really badly impressed by this  To bad I didn t check this website first as I m looking at the rewies on this Hotel and most people have the same opinion  I had to write my own and registed especially for this so I can help others not to have a so badly experience as I had  
P =>  Awful wouldn t recommend it  We were first time tourists in London and we stayed at this hotel for   nights in    and our stay at the Blair Victoria And Tudor Inn        Warwick Way  Victoria  London Sw v  rz  was the only negative memory of London  This hotel was mentioned in Ryanair s webpage and we thought that this  together with the price     Euros for   nights bed and continental breakfast   about      for   nights  would guarantie a certain level for a   star hotel The pictures we saw in the web couldn t be more misleading  When we got to the room we didn t have towels and we had to ask for them  Our room was dirty  with big damp patches on the walls  with the paint peeling off  The worse was that we were bitten by fleas and after searching and searching I managed to find and kill a couple of them  and they were full of blood  our blood  I like to travel a lot and I have stayed in many other hotels in different cities  some of them also   stars   but I have never been bitten by fleas before and I don t think the   star rating should justify this hotel for it s appaling level of hygiene and basic maintenance So no  I didn t like the hotel and I would certainly not recommend it to anyone    
P => Mite infection    Don t go there  One of our company got a rash over the whole body after two nights at the hotel  After visiting a doctor well home again  the doctor concluded it was mite  a small spider insect which digs itself under your skin and lays eggs     The worst thing we ever have experienced in a hotel  Well  by our definition  this is NOT a hotel  
P => nightmare Dreadful Hotel  was nothing like advertised  double room was small with very poor en suite facilities  I will never stop here again  
P => Awful  My family and I stayed a total of    minutes before checking out and finding another hotel  The rooms were freezing and felt unsafe  especially with children  We learned that you get what you pay for  
P =>  Avoid at all costs  Stay away from this hotel  We found it on the internet because we were looking for a hotel near Victoria Station  The actual hotel is nothing like that described on their deceptive website  The photo presented as representing the hotel is misleading  it is a photo of the whole block    the hotel is really only one of the doorways   What a letdown after we arrived tired from a long journey  The room was like a bad college dorm room  Cheap furniture stuffed haphazardly into the tiny space   a view of a brick wall   no elevator access to the room   no air conditioning   a bathroom so tiny that you can sit on the toilet and brush your teeth in the miniscule sink at the same time  The management extracts an extra fee for any request  we asked for a map  and they wanted to charge us   pounds  
P =>  The worst hotel I have ever been Don t pay in advance so that you are able to go looking for another hotel after you have seen your room  I can only confirm that it was really dirty  with hairs in the toilet room and on the bed  We stayed only one day and had to find another place for the rest of our vacation in london  
P =>  Worst I ve ever seen in my life  This is the worst hotel I ve ever stayed at in my life  I m not sure I can describe the filth adequately with words alone  The walls were cracking  the paint on the door was peelling  the carpet was so filthy it was sticky and had runs and holes in it  The toilet and shower did not work yet the shower curtain had mold all over it  The curtains on the windows were frayed and only covered two thirds of the window  The blankets on the bed were so dingy I couldn t tell if they were clean or not so I slept without any  If I had not prepaid for the room I would have left immediately  This is a great location but I m sure there are better rooms available for the same price  I wish I had found the reviews before I booked  Most of them are right on target  Do not stay here under any circumstances  
P =>   Far from the best This is not a hotel I d recommend for anything other than an urgent overnight stay when there s nothing available  Made from a number of houses joined together there are four different staircases and the interior is maze like   finding your room can be a challenge involving many many stairs  Small rooms and very small shower pods  but generally what you d expect for     per night in central London   if you paid more than that you could have stayed elsewhere  Would get a lower rating at any price over    I would go back if there s nowhere else nearby as the location is good  
P =>  what a rip off   avoid at all costs   utter crap   So disappointed  Angry that they have my cash    the thieves  So wish I had the chance to look at the room I was staying in before paying  inwhich they overcharged me        I can t believe that they are allowed to run the hotel in the state it is in   utter embarrasssment for people around the world who would visit a hotel in London The room was tiny   The bathroom was the size of an areroplane toilet  no joke  and the landing areas was covered in paint   very strange indeed I cannot believe that the picture of the hotel room on their website is actually there after reading everyone else s reviews   must be the owner s house bedroom as he obviously profitting and ripping people off  PLEASE DO NOT VISIT THIS HOTEL UNLESS YOU WANT TO GET RIPPED OFF AND STAY IN A BOX   The only good thing about the hotel is the area it is in   that s it   
P => Excellent isnt a word its a statement I did really enjoy the stay my stay at the Blair  i understand a hotel is just to sleep in but staying at the blair is a huge exprience  the rooms are very nice when i was there the rooms had just finished being rebuilt and the new rooms look very good Their clean and highlt maintained The staff are very friendly and helpful Recommended    
P =>  LOVED IT    Recommend it The hotel lived up to everything i wanted I booked a Double Room in december and i enjoyed evey minute of it I dont know what has been said below but i completly enjoyed my stay I would recommend the hotel to anyone as its value for money The staff were very polite and helpful and gave us a great deal with sight seeing around london Ill definatly be staying there again  
P => Hotel from Hell The only thing I would recommend about this dump is  quot please don t go quot   It should carry a government health warning  We were totally lost for words when we checked in and were shown to our rooms on ember  st  The receptionist took us to the wrong floor then tried to lead us up a flight of stairs blocked by an old bed  On the filthy  narrow stairs we had to side step a half full bucket of sour smelling water presumably from a leak  the banister on the very top floor was dangerous  The damp dirty wallpaper was hanging off in places and cracks in the plaster and brickwork was an inch wide  The non smoking rooms we had booked stunk off cigarettes  there was ash on the sheets  the bed was ripped  the bedding smelt vile and the carpet was dirty and stained  Our friends had to clean the coat hangers before using the wardrobe  we decided to leave our things fastened up in the suitcase to stop anything nasty crawling into them  everything was covered in dust and grime  Can it get any worse  Yes it can  Bare wires  loose sockets  dirty cups in our room and the tea bags looked second hand  The tiny shower cubicle was covered in grime and grey tide marks  hairs in the shower tray and sink  four half used toilet rolls thrown on the floor and a broken toilet seat and lid The fire alarm went of twice during the night  due to someone smoking in their room  so at least we knew that it worked okay Then to top it all off we had mouldy toast for breakfast Need I say more The only decent thing about this hovel is the area it is in  
P => The dirtiest place I have ever seen We booked this hotel through a London website  and checked out after one night  It was very dirty  no light in the bathroom  no promised English breakfast  That morning  there were several other people trying to get out of the booking  Never pay for your stay there in advance

P =>   good value   if you have rooms on  th and  th floors  ask for them   Really good value if you stay on the  th and  th floor were all the rooms were confortable and completely new   infact using the stairs  since the elevator blocked   times during our stay  you can see and feel the difference from the old building  ground floor to  th  and the new one    I suppose they are rejuventing all the infrastructureOn the new rooms have all the confort from ironing to safe  from a spectacular bed to and      LCD  i estimate        Breakfast is fine   if you take the English one they will charge extra  pound   Location Great in  min you can take the Central line to Piccadilly or the Circle to Westiminster and the Tower Bridge 
P =>   Never again   Good location but that s about it Hotel itself is on a very good location only a few minutes walk from queensway station and   min walk from the oxford street  Everything else was a big disappointment  Rooms were old and tired with awful bathroom without floor drain so the water was everywhere  On the nights you could hear everything what s happening on other rooms because there seemed to be no soundproofing Breakfast was poor with only cheese ham and croissants with tea or coffee  You had to pay extra for eggs or sausages Don t go here if you have to pay more than   e night  
P =>  good location but watch out for the bed bugs     it was close to   underground stations   other than that  the walls were too thin that you hear the sounds   snoring   etc  from the adjacent room   BED bug alert   my sister came home with bed bug bites     I am hoping and praying I don t get them too   the restaurant was a good place for dinner  
P =>  Convenient Room was small  Very convenient location   short walking distance to Bayswater and Queensway tube stations  and Hyde Park  Breakfast was basic and there s an extra charge for cooked breakfast  Front staff was helpful  
P =>   Good location cheap but with dreadful service  The location of this hotel is very good   a two minute walk to Hyde Park and the tube  Rooms are clean  but poorly designed and laid out  The service was very poor  We waited    minutes for our dinner one night  They also charge for anything they can  There is no trouser press in the room  but for a charge  they will arrange for your trousers to be pressed  Also  the hotel has some kind of complicated arrangement with another party to provide telephone service  So  if you have a complaint about the charges  they tell you that there is nothing they can do because it is the responsibility of someone else  The charges are expensive for a service  contacting an international operator  which one can get at a call box for free  The closest call box is   blocks away  Also  internet access is  GBP hour  
P =>  Amazing value on a budget  We managed to find a last muniue reduced rate online for this hotel  at     total for a twin room for   nights  and for the money  did not expect such an impressive and efficient hotel  Ours bags were looked after for us  the barman was charming  and the shower was impressively powerful  All in all  if I had paid      for a room  I may be disappointed   but for the     each a night that two young ladies for a fun few days away in the city paid  its absolutely perfect  After all  do you really come to London to sit in a hotel room and look at a basin  whether beside your bed or otherwise    No you sit in the bar     which  incedentally is open until  am   Enjoy  Highly recommended  
P =>   My bag was stolen while I was checking in at the hotel  reception At about       hours on ember  th      I arrived to THE BLAKEMORE for three nights stay being once again a visitor to the World Travel ket   Within a few minutes from my entry and while I was standing in front of the hotel reception desk to check in  one of my two bags was stolen  The hotel showed neither sympathy nor compassion  Hotel manager and staff were totally uninterested  Immediately after the theft and checking the hotel floors with the hotel s night auditor we met an Asiatic man circulating freely in the corridor of the  st floor  This same man was sitting at short distance from the reception desk with a couple  who disappeared the same time I noticed that my bag flew away  Questioned by the night auditor the Asiatic man answered he was not a hotel resident but just visiting friends staying in      room of  nd floor    The hotel manager refused to let me see the films of the security cameras  while he had already informed the police that the cameras didn t register anything of the robbery so that the police closes the case  Before I left the hotel he admitted to me that he had    forgotten to check the third camera  He promised to send me a CD with the films and he never did Looking at reviews about this hotel I noticed other cases of thefts in this hotel  even from its very hotel rooms  THE BLAKEMORE is a filthy  awful  dangerous and highly insecure hotel and it is a pity that booking com insists to promote it  
P =>   Let down by the Service We stayed for one night and for a budget hotel  the public areas and the room were very good  Certainly we had a room that had been reconditioned  It may have been a bit on the small size  but the decor was good  and the beds were very comfortable indeed  However  it was let down badly by the service from the Bar  We arrived at      pm on a Saturday afternoon and we were unable to order any sandwiches   although advertised on the Bar menu Then the staff were unable to make any coffee  although various different types of coffee were advertised on the menu   Then my friend decided to ask for a Stella  but the Stella pump was empty  Early evening I visited the Bar again  looked at the menu and decided to order a cocktail  a Singapore Sling  which was advertised  Firstly the member of staff didnt know what one was  then when I showed her the menu  she told me that no cocktails were available  I m afraid that the service from the Bar  let down the whole experience  I hadnt asked for anything that was not advertised in the menu  If you cant provide the items dont advertise them  
P =>  Could be worse   After reading all the other reviews I was quite unsettled about staying here  I was travelling with a large group and this was booked months previously I have stayed in a large number of B amp Bs and hotels around the world and I have definitely stayed at far worse than the Blakemore and I think it is not as bad as it is all made out to be  What I want from a hotel is an ensuite and a clean bed with fresh sheets  Yes it is a little old fashoned with worn carpets and a sink in the main room does seem outdated  However  the rooms were clean and smelled ok  I was in a twin room and it seemed large enough for my needs  As with any old room there are a few cracks and peeling wallpaper but they are in the middle of renovations It is close to tube stations and Kensington Gardens in a quiet street  many restaurants are close by as well I stayed here for   nights at a cost of about    quid night  I think if you got a similar deal then I would consider it but there are many nicer places to stay in london above this price especially if you try the last minute hotel websites and get good deals If I could get a cheap enough price I would consider staying here again but I usually prefer to be a little closer to town If you are used to a Holiday Inn or Hilton type hotel room you will be disappointed  If you stay in B amp Bs in some of the more remote parts of Britain then this room is fairly similar to that  
P =>   Very bad hotel We were staying in the hotel for   nights  Everything seemed to be ok until the night fell down  Fire alarms came every night for four nights and the staff had nothing to say about it  No apologies  no explanations  Breakfast was really poor  Their  quot continental breakfast quot  means only bread  butter and coffee tea juice and some breakfast cereals  Nothing else unless you pay   pounds for english breakfast which didn t seem a much better  Only positive thing is the location  You can easily get away from the hotel  So if you just need a place to drop your bags and change clothes and take a shower this might be a really nice hotel  And of course if you like the sound of a very loud fire alarm you can even consider sleeping there a night or two  
P =>   Blakemore do more Good location in Bayswater  Close to tube station and buses Room was small and needed some love  amp  care  Doing renovations while we were there and the builders started up outside our window at about  am Breakfast was great  plenty to eat and good food Staff were ok but at the moment there are a lot of non English personel working in London hotels and the Blakemore is one of them and getting the message across is sometimes difficultOverall I d give the joint       
P => not worse the price The location is obviously great  the hotel building itself and the lobby look great  but what a surprise when you get to the room  I ve had better cheap motels  Ugly   Crack on the ceiling  old curtains and carpet  a randomly attached wooden plank  covered in Formica  on the bedroom wall     The smell   a mix of moth balls and musty   To end on a positive note  the staff is competent and friendly  
P =>   Basic hotel I know it was about  yrs since I stayed at the Blakemore hotel but I remember it vivdly  The photos of the lobby and restaurant we saw online were lovely but the low prices should ve set alarm bells ringing Our double room was VERY basic  We actually walked in and saw a sink on the right hand side of the door  I thought to myself  quot please let us have more of a bathroom than that quot   Sure enough the rest of it was in the right place  the bathroom  Was a bit shabby then but I dont know if it has been done up since  Its in a great location  loved Bayswater  quiet and not far from nice restaurants and plenty of shops only about five mins walk If you re on a budget give it a look but dont expect the luxury that the lobby suggests  
P =>  Average This hotel has a good location     minutes walk from Paddington Station  As with other reviewers i thought that the entrance lobby was nice and had high hopes for my room  However  the room itself was tiny and the bathroom was so small that the sink was actually in the bedroom  The walls are also paper thin so be prepared to be able to hear conversations  and bathroom business   of people three rooms away or a floor above  below you  The heat is also permananetly on so we had to leave our window open all night  great when the builders  scaffolders working on the hotel redevelopment start work at the crack of dawn I booked a reasonable package to stay at this hotel but beware of paying full price  A good location but defintiely needs some improving  
P =>   Find a better hotel Stay away  We booked at a  star hotel and got this   Room      The room was very old and the bathroom was awful  The towelholder was falling down from the wall  the toilet didn t work well  the bathroomdor couldn t be opened from the inside  the phone didn t work and so on  We have been in london a few times and this was the worst room we have ever had The day we where leaving the cleaning personel locked themselves in and walked in to the room twice at       and       pluss knocked on the door ones  It seemed that they just want the guests out so they could do the job and go home  My advise is to find another hotel NB  on the possitive side  the windows are new Sinc M  Andersen 
P =>   request on booking not given priority i booked on internet this hotel on  th february for my stay last march   th because i will have my exam the following day   th on request form i requested if they can provide me a quite room i was surprised when i arrived as i was given a room      directly facing the lift on  th floor the occupant above my room walked as if she is in the street  you can hear the sounds of feet walking on that room as if somethings gonna fall  the occupant of the room next to my room were chatting with her companion and i can hear them the lift doesnt stop until as early as  am the room was so hot in fairness to the room its big enough for single  there was a tv kettle dryer telephone  bed blanket room wasclean have a nice bathroom clean shower enough water toilet bowl the sink was located near the main door i was disappointed with the room location plus the temperature of the room because i was not able to review and slept well because of the noise hot  it really affects my performance on my exam the location was advisable near the queensway underground kingston garden staffs are fairly approachable breakfast i was confused with the difference of oriental and the breakfast i was told to take on the right side  oriental  nice restaurant nice food  
P =>  Perfect for travelling on your own Let s start by saying I have stayed at the Blakemore at least   times  Each time my stay is exactly what I require and what I expect  I am a married man in my late thirties living in America  I try to get to London a couple times a year to watch my beloved Tottenham Hotspur FC play live  My visits are always the same  on my own and for   nights Friday  Saturday and Sunday evenings  The single ensuites are all that I require  The size is not a concern  It is perfect for the solo traveller  I have found the staff to be quite friendly and very help on each of my stays  The lobby bar is a very cozy and inviting place to relax and is usually open a bit later than the local pubs in Bayswater so if you are out and fancy a night cap all you have to do head head back to the Blakemore get your order in and relax while watching the large flat screen TV in the lobby  Others have commented about the location  Perfect    minute walk to   tube stations  Bayswayer  Queensway     minute walk to Paddington in one direction and a    minute walk to Notting Hill Portobello Rd in the other  The ensuite singles are always going for a bargain rate so for someone who would rather spend your travel dollars on other things besides overly posh accomodations the Blakemore is for you 
P =>  My First Choice I have stayed at the Blakemore probably    r   times now and each time I have found my room clean  and the bed comfortable The staff are excellent  very helpful and friendly  No complaints at all Breakfast is excellent and plentiful  The staff are continuously topping up and are available to guest  I always look for this hotel first  I have to admit I usually book through a cheaper Web Site but it has always been well worth the money I am married and in my    s  
P =>   Not for me I booked the Blakemore online and was impressed with the photos displayed on the hotel website  The Blakemore is easy to locate with two tube stations close by serving the circle and central line  The location of the Hotel was also good as it was close to Hyde Park and Kensignton Gardens  When we arrived the outside of the Hotel looked great as did the reception area  However  this is were the problems started  Firstly it took us half an hour to check in as all the staff were foreign and had spelt my name wrong on the check in computer system  Having sorted out this they then asked for payment for the entire stay plus a twenty pound deposit  I was unprepared for this as there was no warning on the Website When we got to our room our disappointment continued as it was tiny  even by London standards  the carpet was filthy and the ensuite was about the size of a phonebox  What made this hotel worse was the Canadian School trip guests who proceeded to run along the corridor all night  We didnt stay for breakfast and insteed went to a cafe down the street  Thankfully the city of London was amazing as usual  this helped compensate for the hotel  which we spend as little time as possible in  
P =>  Small but well furnished rooms Booked this hotel through Priceline for relatives who were visiting London  Used the name your own price service and was a little put off when I was allocated this hotel as reviews were not fantastic and the standard rooms looked a little basic Upon arrival at the hotel I was relieved to find the exterior of the hotel and the reception area looked smart and welcoming  A room on the ground floor was allocated  and going through to a corridor we were met with the smell of fresh paint and new carpet  It would seem we were given an executive room which had recently been refurbished It was very clean and reasonably well appointed with good quality fixtures and fittings  and comfortable beds  I am told that the shower was good and that they got a good nights sleep  The room was equipped with air conditioning  though not necessary in ember   TV  trouser press  hairdryer  iron and ironing board  and a safe  Despite the room being very small there were a total of three phones  The bathroom seemed quite new and also very clean   no mould or other nastiness The view from the room was the only bad point   a wall only a few feet from the window The twin room was small but big enough for two people to move around and to unpack their luggage  and the wardrobe was huge so good for an extended stay The location is reasonably good   a      minute walk to Paddington  Lancaster Gate or Bayswater tube stations  and only a few minutes to Bayswater road where frequent buses will take you to most places you d want to go For the rate we got on Priceline it was very good value  though the rack rate seemed rather steep  
P =>  Good value for money at an excellent location We stayed in a twin room for four nights  At an average price of GBP       per night the hotel was very good value for money  Our room was on the  th floor  and was of good size  There were no disturbances from neighboring rooms or the street  and the staff was friendly  Our only critisism of the price of GBP      for the english breakfast and that some of the interior in our room was a bit dated  We were very satisfied with our stay and would love to come back 
P =>   Good Location The Blakemore Hotel was quite a nice hotel for the most part  My boyfriend and I stayed in the King executive suite The hotel staff seemed to be quite friendly and sometimes even joked with us  They seemed to know where everything was in England as well The room was quite spacious although there is no air conditioning in the rooms  but they do provide fans which we found to be a nice little touch  The bathrooms looked a bit old fashioned  but this is to be expected of an older building  I liked the fact that when I put up the  quot do not disturb quot  sign on the door  the cleaning staff left us new towels and a roll of toliet paper right outside our door There is a restuarant and a bar in the hotel  Both are a bit pricey but nice if you just want to relax and don t feel like walking anywhere  The food isn t that bad either  The restuarant seating is quite small  Luckily  we never really had to wait for a table  There s only one main girl working the bar and the restaurant  which included cooking the food  which we felt sorry for her as it would get quite busy in the restuarant bar  and she d do her best to make everyone happy  On our last night there  another girl came to help  but she didn t know English too well  The staff are all foreign  but all seemed to know English with the exception of the forementioned girl The location is good as it s about a       minute walk from Bayswater Tube Station  and there are some good restuarants close by The downside of the hotel is that there is only one lift throughout the whole hotel   actually  there are    but one is for the staff only  The lift takes ages to reach you  but again  this is an old building Another downside is that if you re a smoker  there are no smoking rooms  All have become non smoking since y  My boyfriend and I smoke  so we always had to go outside to smoke  They do have ashtrays as well as picnic benches outside If you re a light sleeper  be prepared to be awoken by the cars which go by at every hour of the night  I didn t think it was too bad though  and I m a light sleeper  The only thing that woke me up was that the next building was having some construction work being done to it  and it all started up at   am  Needless to say  we couldn t get back to sleep The breakfast was alright  It wasn t good tasting nor was it bad tasting  For    a person  you can get a full English breakfast but all rooms come with a continental breakfast which consists of breads and cereal and juices coffee  We never had to wait for a table at breakfast  but we noticed that a queue had started to form after we had started eating  The staff did clean the tables as fast as people were done eating though Overall  the hotel is a bit overpriced but is still a nice hotel  
P =>   Find someplace else  Bedbugs The Blakemore reception staff is amazingly rude  The rooms are tiny even by European standards      by      The furniture is broken  mirrors are broken  doors are broken  and the linoloeum is peeling inthe bathroom  Carpet is threadbare  There were bedbugs in our room the first night so we changed rooms  The second room had twin beds instead of a double and that room was somewhat better  but not good  Breakfast was inedible  Don t bother to stand in line for it  which you will have to do   However  the bar is quite nice and the locationis excellent  But for the price  you can do better  
P =>  Best cheap hotle in London  I thought that the hotel was great  The location is fabulous and the price very affordable  They had a decent size elevator a concierge service  bar and restaurant  I stayed in a single bed with an ensuite bathroom for   nights  It was very small  but it was clean and the bed was comfortable  The room also had a tv  a hair dryer  a kettle and stuff to make tea and coffee  I also found my room very quiet  I have stayed in several cheap hotels in London and this one is the best  I would definately go back  
P =>  Dreadful Hotel would Never Recommend Hotel from the outside is ok  an old building with character  The reception area and bar were also ok  I booked   non smoking rooms for my directors and a client and   out of the   couldn t stay in their rooms because they were in such an apaulling state  All were smoking rooms   even though I had specifically mentioned that if only smoking rooms were available I would need to cancel my booking  not to mention thread bare carpets  chipped and cracked tiles in the bathroom  each room was as bad as the other  Would not recommend  
P =>   Nothing wrong with the Blakemore After reading some of the reviews on this website  we were a bit leary  but booked the Blakemore anyways  And it turned it there was nothing to worry about  The Blakemore is an older hotel  which as apparent in the decor  and could mabye benefit from a facelift  but was a very comfortable hotel  The beds were wonderful and the rooms were quite large  by London standards  We did have a room by the elevator  which is old and can be quite loud  but if you had a room further away  I m sure it wouldn t be a problem  It is located in a central part of town  with easy access to the tube and about a    minute walk to Paddington train station  I would definately stay at the Blakemore again  
P =>  Pleasant but in need of TLC  Traveling to London is always enjoyable  I ve stayed there on several occassions and rarely ever stay in the same hotel  Due to appointments arround Hyde park I chose to stay at the Blakemore hotel  locationThe hotel is conveniently located between several tube stations  Both bayswater  paddington  queensway and Lancaster gate are all within a ten minute walk  Leinster Gardens  the street on which it is located  is located just of Bayswater road  along which there s an artmarket every sunday  Instead of advertised  the park is not Hyde Park but Kensington Gardens  Seeing they are basicly part of one another it doesn t really matter  Hyde Park  Kensington Gardens  The Royal Albert Hall and the V amp A museum are all close by The hotel The building and it s surroundings are very nice indeed  The fact it s close to Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park is a big plus  The entrance is very wel layed out and both the pub and restaurant are very well taken care of  The entrance is however not accesable for persons making use of weelchairs  The halls are cosy and narrow  Well lit but the carpet seems threadbare in places roomI Stayed in a Single room on the top floor at the back of the building  Upon entering the room seemed small  No surprise for a hotel in london however  It was layed out efficiently  The decor was very much dated  but then     you are not in London to appreciate hotel decor The bathroom had both a toilet and bath  It takes a long time for the water to get warm  but once it is you d better turn the cold tap on asap  The bathroom is small and the way the complimentary soap is put up against the wall is lacking in logic  There is nothing to hold on to when you do get out of the bath  I can see older people having trouble doing it  The extraction fan in the bathroom is very noisy  but you can turn it of on the side  I found I could hear the fans of the neighbouring rooms  The room was reasonably quiet  The walls were thick enough  The wooden floors however did transport sounds from other rooms  Bar from some creaking and fans  there are barely any sounds coming from other rooms  You do get sound coming from the hall but that was doors being slammed shut excptionally hard My room overlooked the really open air stretch of the tube  I didn t mind the sound  The window was double glazed in a way which kept out the sound  The tube stops it s services at twelve and doesn t start driving till twelve  If you worry about sleep  ask for a room at the front of the building as the street seems deserted of traffic serviceI found the ladies behind the counter to be very friendly  The men  honestly  all of them  seemed gruff and stand offish  None of the staff was originally english  Flags on their name badges mark out which languages they speak  I found polish  spanish  italian  russian  english and Indian  The girls are very friendly and will go out of their way to help you  My room came with continental breakfast  This consists out of juice  coffee  tea  Several kinds of bread  jams  honey and a choice of cereals  All in all  better than I expected  A full english breakfast will set you back   pounds  Both come in the shape of a buffet so it s a bargain All in all  this basic hotel with it s great location is a good place to stay if you intend to stay out in town most of the day  If you however spend most of your rime in the hotel  this is not for you  I sincerely hope the owners of the hotel will look into replacing some of the threadbare carpeting and generally improve the looks of the rooms  
P =>  Blakemore I ve stayed at the Blakemore hotel on january   th with one of my friend and we weren t disapointed We were looking for a cheap night in London and we wanted to be situated in a good location without having to go to a Youth Hostel  The Blakemore was exactly what we were looking for  We had a great surprise on arrival  they gave us a triple room for the price of a double and they honored the internet booking price of approximately     USD without asking for credit card or deposit The room looked a bit old and plain but with a charming English style  Great view on Leicester garden street   From the  rd floor Staff pleasant and did speak english very well  Had constant water in showerGreat neighborhood to feel the London vibeOldish  but clean for all i ve seen Rooms were a bit bigger than what i was expecting after reading previous reviews   maybe cause of the triple bed room though Good value   Perfect for budget minded or young travelersWe were allowed to eat hot crescents before official breakfast time on return from a London night out  Anyways  we had a great time  Don t expect a   star hotel It s basic but enjoyable Tom 
P =>  value for money if u dont mind compromsing a little on comfort OK but not particularly very comfortable or cosy  Quite basic with no frills and a little shabby in places  That said probably the best value for money in this part of town and if u dont mind compromsing a little on comfort for one nights sleep then it does the job  
P =>  Loved it will come again I went with the band I work with for a three night stay  Great location  only a couple of minutes walk from the nearest tube station  and even less from Hyde Park The reception was good  and also all Italian speaking   very kind and helpful   out of   were refurbished rooms  quiet and clean The oly thing which wasn t perfect was the bar service  as there wasn t anyone to serve us The lobby is big and good for meetings  we did all our interviews there  The price quality rate was fantasti  We are definitely coming back in uary  
P =>   Good value for money   will come again I have stayed in this hotel in the beginning of ember       The single room  shower amp WC in the room   you need to check that while you make your booking  since the hotel offers also single rooms with shared facilities  was in a good size  very clean  the furniture are a bit old but it didn t matter to me  and there were hot water throuout the day with strong flow   which is important after along walking day in London    The staff was friendly and helpful  and breakfast was quiet good as well  The location is very convinient  in a quiet pleasant street about     minutes walk from Bayswater underground  circle  amp  district  and    minutes walk from Paddington It is definitely not a fancy hotel  but it is nice and cozy and definitely good value for money  I will come again  
P =>  hated this hotel this place is disgusting very ignorant people the rooms are tiny and not very clean i thought you only got cockroaches abroad i am disabled and they woudnt call me a cab and make sure you read what you are entitled to ie breakfast or youll get a shock when you check out 
P =>   good value and location Myself and a friend stayed at the Blakemore from ober                Our room was clean  had a nice big closet and shelves  but our bathroom was a bit small  We did overall enjoy our stay at this hotel  Some of the staff appeared to struggle with the english language  but were friendly enough  We were close to the underground  many pubs restaurants and some shopping souviners  in walking distance  Also  some sighting seeing places in walking distance  i e  Kenisington gardens  amp  Palace   Have to admit did not eat once at the hotel  therefore  can not comment on the food  There were so many restauarants and pubs that offered cheaper prices then the hotel  so we opted for the cheaper  Which were fairly decent meals  I would stay at this hotel again  The hotel did honour the internet pricing which we booked through  
P =>   A very nice surprise  I stayed at the Blakemore for   nights during y       After reading previous reviews  I prepared myself  and my daughter who was travelling with me  for a budget  youth hostel style hotel  We were pleasantly surprised with the Blakemore  Check in and concierge staff were friendly and efficient and we had a lovely room on ground floor  No view from the window and not very big  but very nicely decorated  clean and fresh  Bathroom had a bath  which I appreciated after a camping trip   and fresh towels everyday  It amazes me that some guests complain about the breakfast arrangement  Full English breakfast and Continental breakfast are served from different sides of the breakfast room  A very friendly member of staff checks room numbers on entry   no confusion about what you have paid for  Location of the hotel is perfect   Big London Bus  tube station  regular bus service and a super shopping mall nearby  All this for a VERY affordable price   even with an expensive rate of exchange  I will no doubt stay at the Blakemore again  
P =>  Very helpful and great location  This hotel is located in an excellent area  There are two metro stations nearby and Heathrow airport is about    minutes away  Lots of theatres and shopping around the Blakemore  The hotel room had air conditioning and was clean  The staff and concierge were very helpful and very accommodating  It made the trip go very smoothly knowing that the staff was there to answer questions and to give suggestions on where to go  Over all I enjoyed my stay in this hotel  
P =>  Good location best for the money  I love the location of this hotel  It was a quick easy walk through the park to Kensington  its very near   tube stations with easy access to all areas of London  We found travelling to and from the area very easy  The area itself isn t the nicest but it is quiet and I felt safe  In addition there are plenty of other tourists  as well as locals  and shops etc for anything you may need  I would definitely stay in the area again and more than likely at this hotel The Blakemore itself is far more impressive in its foyer  the rest of the hotel doesn t quite live up to this  Our only real problem with the hotel though was that the continental breakfast we had booked with the room did not apply and we were told we would have to pay extra for this  Obviously we didn t bother  The room itself was very small and warm  it could ve done with a lick of paint and replacing the very old bathroom  However  it was clean  fresh towels and cleaning done each day  and everything worked  All we wanted was somewhere to have a quick wash and to sleep and for this the hotel was fine and met all our needs  I wouldn t recommend it for any light sleepers as the walls are very thin and the maids probably will wake you up  There is also an open tube line running nearby which is very noisy and does go into the night so if this will bother you make sure you ask for a room at the front of the hotel  We did enjoy our stay in London  and the Blakemore was good for its price range  I would stay here again as long as the prive remains competitive  Would recommend as long as you are not looking for luxury or modernity  
P =>  Hotel is average location is good The hotel room was the smallest we d encountered throughout Europe  you had to manouevre yourselves when walking around the bed  The staff were fairly rude as well and didn t respond to any of my emails prior to our arrival  During our stay  one of the guests room were robbed so it s not the securest hotel  Also  it s next door to a train station and you hear the trains running one after the other  The only positive is the location  it s great for the price you pay  It s located across the road from Hyde Park  nearby to restaurants  the bus about tours and two different underground stations  Great if you re on a budget and can t afford a better hotel  
P => Cheap    but you get what you pay for  This hotel is OK for a night or two  it s saving grace is that it s cheap The room is old but clean  and a reasonable size No Internet  but there is a cheap one down the road We had to walk through the smoking bar to get to our room  not happy about that The breakfast is pretty ordinary and not cheap Not too far from a tube station  about   min Don t expect anything and you ll be ok  Count the money you are saving  
P =>  well do not expect too much      I just stayed at the hotel for   nights  I had a single room and my brother  his wife and son had a triple room  I actually felt guilty at the end because I booked this hotel for all of us  The only positive point about this hotel is that it is very clean but here are the bad  sometimes very bad sides of this hotel    very noisy hotel  as the hotel is very old and the windows also very old  you can hear everything outside like people talking  cars driving      really everything  and I was on the  th floor  so you can imagine my brother on the  nd floor   From my brother s room  you could hear the underground train in the room until       YES the undeground also called tube that are rolling under the stree  can you imagine       They were so tired in the morning  so so tired      The isolation is very bad as you can se       Some rooms  like mine  have a very very old TV  dated early    s   My brother even did not want to believe and came to my room to see it himself  How an I explain  you know it is a very small T V without remote control and with    buttons on the screen  so you have to get up each time you want to change chanel or switch it off  and anyway they just have   channels  all english crap ones   I know  I know  some of you might say    you do not go to London to watch T V   but believe me after a    hours walk around through London  you are happy to lie in your bed for a few hours to relax and to watch the news      Carpet in the rooms  they are very small and no air conditioning so good luck for the summer       everything in the rooms is old  windows  doors  toilet  sink         I would say from the    s  The door locks are those very old that are very easy to open  this is my point of view    You know those goldy round ones with the lock in the middle  very bad  I was happy each time I came back to the room and realized everything was still there          Breakfast  The room in    is very small for that hotel and often you have to queue and wait    minutes to get a seat  You can have breakfast from      and if you arrive at       be patien     and alos you only have the continental breakfast included which is not a problem but you have   sides  one with continental  bread  croissants  corn flakes  milk  coffee  jam  milk and tea  NO CHEESE  HAM or BEANS  I thought personaly that they could have added at least some cheese  but on the other side  you have ENGLISH AMERICAN BREAKFAST with sausages  ham  cheese  beans  eggs  bacon        but watch it there is a person watching  adn wou can only have contintental  if you want eat fod from the other corner   you have to add pay   GBP extra per day  I saw some people sitting down on the table and the employee of the hotel went to them to ask their room number and explaining how it worked       I find it very very bad because of course they make this on purpose as when you see and compare both  you are very tempted      single elevator for such a big hotel       be patient to get on it because it is very busy as you can imagine    They have a small bar but they do not serve you on the tables  you have to get up  order and pay at the bar and they have a very small choice of drinks  You rather have a drink outside the hotel in another bar I travel a lot all around the world but this one was a big shock for me I think you can find a better one for that price especially as the area is also not that good and safe but you can still find a pizza hut  burger king and KFC for those who are interested take care  
P =>  Good rates good location room for improvement of hotel This hotel is in a good location  being just    minutes from Paddington tube station   there are also a number of restaurants and shops in close vicinity which offer good value meals if you want to avoid city centre prices  The hotel itself is ok   the reception and bar areas make a good first impression  though the room I stayed in was in need of rennovation  The shower bath toilet room was tiny and leaked   though hotel staff were helpful in resolving the matter  The bed was fine and they used the small space well  One very frustrating aspect was that it was presented as a non smoking room but in reality it absolutely reeked of smoke  I appreciate that hotel staff cannot monitor this situation       but they were also unwilling to find me another room when requested  Would consider staying again on the basis of the very cheap rates and good location  
P => affordable old fashioned charm many people pay loads to find authentic old charm   however  they often expect this charm to come in new furniture  modern luxury     if you re able to deal with the fact that that old fashioned feel often comes along with indeed mayby slightly worn off furniture  you ve definitely come to the right place  For my job I typically get to stay in many  beautiful  hyperclean  rather neutral hotels  like Meridien  Sofitel     and I m not complaining  on business trips  main thing is a good bed  indeed a modern shower  and a tv to get my mind off thinking  But for my personal time  and yes  I admit also partly for budget reasons  I so much prefer this sort of hotels  When I walked in  my first feeling  of being displeased to having been accorded a room on ground floor  immediately dissapeared  The twin bed room was quite spacious  an old small  quot cupboard quot  with drawers and topped with green carpet to put your suitcase onto spontaneously conjured images of an old orient express feel  pinkish striped wallpaper made it quite clich  english  the crisp white linnen on the bed made it difficult to not just take a short nap  the two pillows in the cupboard were a sherry on the cake    in short  I think that the    pound  last minute rate  I spent for two persons together was very well spent  Yes  the bathroom was quite small  and the washing sink was in the room  but the tap was again so cute  really one that must have been installed year and years ago  Yes  the carpet was old and I ran around on socks  but I am easily grossed out  and on it s whole  I felt very clean in this place  The people at the reception were kind  the neighbourhood was very quiete and peaceful  but shops  a mall and nice eating places were a       minutes walk away only  though you need to know the road   i surely recommend this hotel  very above average for it s price 
P =>  A Good   Average Hotel The Blakemore is a good hotel  It s average and most importantly inexpensive in an expensive city  We found the hotel rooms clean and the water toliets just fine  The staff was exceptional  very accomodating  friendly and helpful  The concierge had to act as bellman  barman and concierge  but all staff were in good spirits  The Bayswater tube stop is just a   minute walk and the street  lined with other like hotels  youth hotels and apartments  was mostly quiet  There was no  quot night life quot   i e   clubs  to speak of in the area but the Bayswater tube stop made traveling to Picadilly or Covent garden relatively easy  We were looking for a good hotel at a good price  and the Blakemore fit the bill  Having said that  since it was just average we would probably try a new hotel next time we visit London in hopes of finding that  quot secret gem quot    We did not eat at the hotel at all  but would highly recommend  quot Tom s quot  in nearby Nottinghill for a great breakfast   
P =>  great if you re on a budget We were looking for a cheap ensuite double and the more we read about the  cheaper  hostels the more afraid we got ending up in a dirty and unsafe place  We decided to stay at the Blakemore Hotel then because the difference in price  compared to a hostel with ensuite  wasn t huge and the location is great We made a reservation through hrs  German company  English language  and paid  depending on the day of week  GBP        or     incl Continental breakfast    HRS does only guarantee the numer of persons per room  not the type of room beds  so we got a twin  two beds  instead of a double  We liked the room  thus we didn t complain Room      is on the third floor  lift available   has no A C  the furniture  wardrobe  doors  is  too  old and you can hear any word spoken on the street  However  street and hotel are very quiet at night  everything was clean and the L shaped room was a lot more spacious than expected  With two big suitcases on the floor it still seemed to big for us and had a desk  phone  hairdryer and water boiler for tea and instant coffee  The bathroom is standard  white tiles  WC  shower   The wash basin is not in the bath room They are located in Westminster Kensington Bayswater  you can easily walk to Bayswater or Queensway  latter one is closed until may       tube stations and Hyde Park  There are  day and night  busses  too  The area has many hotels  some fast food  restaurants  shopping and entertainment  i e  busy enough to feel safe as a tourist  day and night   The street itself is calm at nights but not dark and it s not a long walk The hotel has a nice lobby and bar  the staff is always friendly  Breaksfast is either Continental or English  both buffet style and all you can eat drink  Continental is fresh rolls  croissants  toast  cereals  jam  butter  coffee  tea  hot choclate  ask staff   milk  English is eggs  beans  sausages  etc They offer standard  executive and de luxe rooms  single  double twin or triple quad  The price differs a lot depending on how you make your reservation  Advanced payment is not required if you arrive prior to  pm One night at  am there was a false fire alarm  The staff knew it was a false alarm  however only the fire brigarde could turn the alarm off and it took them about half an hour to arrive     
P =>  Not the best in London I just returned from a   day trip to London  I will not stay at the Blakemore again  The hotel is older and has not been updated  There are several other nicer hotels on the same street  The carpet is ratty and the plumbing stinks  You can not take a shower for   minutes after flushing the toilet and you can t not use the sink shower at the same time  The service at the front desk and guest services is poor  We were looking for a market   minutes away and they couldn t find it  Keep looking for another hotel  I wish we had you can find nicer room in London for     pounds a night  Also  the closest tube stop Queensway is closed till        
P =>  Great little hotel  The Blakemore suited my needs for my   nights in London  I stayed in two rooms  a single and later a double when my sister stayed with me  The rooms are small  but fits my needs for keeping my belongings safe and having a safe place to rest  The staff were all friendly and helpful  I would not ask the desk to call a cab because they instead called a private car that cost twice what a cab would cost  My first room had a bath tub elevated with good water pressure  The second room had a shower only with poor water pressure  You can hear people in the halls and if you are near the tube you can hear it when it passes  The Bayswater tube station was a   minute walk away and there are lots of things in that area  places to eat  places to shop  The Blakemore was an excellent price for me and a great place to stay  I would stay there again  
P =>  Looks can be deceiving the staff was great  the room left much to be desired  the location was ok  but I think I would have been better to have stayed at one of the youth hostels  because the price would have been better and the quality the same  For a hotel  I don t think the quality was great  The room reeked of something moldy  bed was lumpy and we were given only ONE small pillow  the water pressure was awful and the water cut off while I was in the shower  TWICE   
P => Very pleasant  Location ok if you don t mind tube hopping I live in London and was staying in the hotel for a week to be with my friend  I found the rooms to be a bit small but very clean and everything needed was there  The bed was comfortable  The breakfast in the morning was nice and the bar is very comfortable and the staff helpful  However  I am writing this review for people who do not know London too well  The small shops in this area are an absolute rip off  I needed some painkillers for a headache and was charged   times what I would usually pay  The location is ok if you are fit and healthy and dont mind jumping on the tube but if you are looking for something close to the centre of London this is not really the place  This hotel would be good for those who are visiting London for Hyde Park and Kensington Palace  
P =>   Prisoner of Cell Block H Picture It  London       I had to make a last minute dash to London in the middle of the week for an appoitment  Hotels are pricier then that at the weekend and I wanted to make my trip as inexpensive as possible  My usual favourite haunts were coming in at nearly       but I found this on Venere for      Good deal  so I thought  How bad can it be  Well  when the taxi pulled up it looked bright and becoming and the AA had a sign up giving   diamonds or whatever it is the AA award Lovely Italian man in reception was very helpul and I made my way up to my room Oh dear  First of all the bed was a tiny single bed  Reminded me of the type we have in NHS hospitals or that I ve seen in prison dramas on TV  In the middle of the room right next to the bed was a washhand basin and in front of the washhand basin  so that I couldn t actually get into the washbasin  was the bed side cabinet  Now  I ve not seen washhand basins in the middle of the room since the days before en suite became the norm  The reason the washbasin was in the middle of the room was there was no room for it in the bathroom  This created a problem in that the mirror where one would normally do one s hair was above the basin and for obvious reasons there were not plugs near there  This meant having to drag the cord of my straighteners to its full length and go from another wall to the mirror on the wardrobe  This is a girly thing  that the gentlemen reading this probably won t have to worry about  but hey Ladies hair s important  The room was hot  Now I m from the UK and I know Americans like air conditioning and when in my own country I think opening the window is enough  Not here oh no  Boiling  By the time I d finished getting ready for the appointment I had  I was exhausted  Okay  the area is not great  It is at least a    minute walk to the underground and as a woman on my own when coming back to the hotel at night I thought I could be vulnerable  something I have never felt in all my years of nipping down to London  so ended up having to use taxis for my own security Now we come to sleeping in the prison cell bed  Can I tell you as I write this my back still hurts  The mattress was THAT bad  I m waiting for the Nurofen to kick in  The heat of the room  the fact that I could hardly turn round for fear of clanging myself against the washbasin or bedside cabinet didn t help  At least there wasn t space for me to fall out the bed  be this was the design  Between that  the heat and the noise from the underground  This was not a good experience If I had paid the rack rate of     for this  I d have been really angry      in the middle of London during the week is a low rate  However  the fact that I had to use taxis because of the safety angle meant I would probably have been better spenidng a little more and going to a nicer hotel that was very close to an underground and in a nicer area  Lesson learned I think    
P =>  Great value super location  My wife and I kicked off our European vacation with a   night stay in the Blakemore  This was our first time to London and we couldn t have been more pleased with the hotel  For the price  the hotel was superb   clean  quiet  close to the tube  friendly staff  and with good restaurants scattered throughout the area  We would absolutely stay here again  
P =>  OK but be realistic In all honesty I must say that a single for       GBP a night is a good price and it deserves mentioning that the staff is very friendly  However  you have to keep in mind that you get what you pay for  The rooms are small  the bathrooms in need of refurbishment  you will hear noise from the hallway AND  yes  the Tube passes just underneath the hotel causing both noise and vibration  It reminds me of the places we used to stay when on high school trips    years ago  but now on a business trip it was slightly too  quot rustic quot  to be comfortable  
P => One of the best deals in London I stayed with a party of four  two rooms  in Blakemore Hotel from il    to il     We were very satisfied with the place and think it is excellent value for money at a promotion price of GBP     I believe there are not many hotels in London offering a similar good deal The rooms are small  however  fitted with amenities such as TV  trouser press  iron  coffee and tea maker  Daily service has been good and the rooms were clean  The beds are very comfy The breakfast room on the lower ground has a stylish interior  Contintental breakfast is included in the rate and was quite ok with tea or coffee  juice  bread  amp  crossaint and jam  For an additional fee you can have a full breakfast including fruit  eggs  yoghurts  etc The location is just great  minutes from Queensway or Bayswater Station  We also found the neighborhood lively with many pubs  restaurants and shops We are very fond of the Blakemore Hotel and would definitely stay there again when visiting London  
P =>   A really nice hotel great deal We stayed at the Blakemore Hotel for   nights  the week of      The rate for the hotel was outstanding  really a bargain  The Blakemore is a charming and comfortable hotel  The room was clean and had a great view from a large casement window  Trees and birds outside  Hyde Park a block away  the Lancaster Gate tube station a short walk  a great little pub called the Leinster Arms down the street  Queensway dining and shopping  and a beautiful tree lined neighborhood  just about perfect  and the best deal we ve ever found in London Staff and service were really first rate  friendly and efficient  The Blakemore became our home for a week plus and we really enjoyed it  
P =>  Satisfactory visit Have just returned from   night break at the Blakemore Hotel  Staff friendly and welcoming  Room  rear facing  spotless with good supply of towels  comfortable bed  Bar very pleasant  again staff welcoming  Didn t have time to use restaurant Overall good value for money and hope to stay there again  
P => Great for Budget travelling I spent four days in London and stayed at the Blakemore  The neighbourhood is excellent and the tube station is only a short five minute walk away  There s a great patisserie for breakfast nearby and some restaurants to grab something to eat The staff was thoughtfull and everything went according with our on line reservation  No problems with that whatsoever  The rooms are tiny but clean and silent at night I would stay there again and recommend it to anyone who just wants a confortable place to sleep after a day amp night in town  
P =>  Good value and location I recently stayed at the Blakemore for   nights on my first trip to London  I had found other hotels in a similar price range  less than      night  with much worse reviews  so I felt comfortable with my choice  Upon arrival  before check in time   I had no problem getting into my room  I was a little concerned about having a room on the ground floor with a window facing the street  but did not have any problems with noise and never felt unsafe  Although the room was small  I had a single   I didn t expect spacious accommodations in a town like London  and the room was actually larger than some in NYC    and it was more than sufficient for my needs with a closet with shelving  desk and TV  The room and bathroom were kept very clean and the one time I needed assistance  an extra towel  the front desk staff were very responsive  even though it was late at night  If you re planning to spend a lot of time in your hotel room  why would you in London    or are looking for more than the basics  this may not be the ideal place  If you re looking for a  home base  convenient to public transportation    tube stops within blocks  and outdoor space  Kensington Gardens Hyde Park nearby   a quiet place to crash after a day of sight seeing  and friendly staff to help you out  the Blakemore will more than meet your needs  
P =>  Fine Hotel We have just returned from five days in London and we stayed at the Blakemore Hotel  The entrance has better look than the rooms  wich are small wiht a tinny tv only with three channels  all in english  and with no remote control  In general the staff is very friendly  except for one recepcionist that worked at evening at the weekend  We stayed far from the elevator and there was silence during all night  The location is great  near Hyde Park and Queensway  which is a good place to buy souvenirs and five minutes from the underground  Next time we would stay there again  
P => Cheap with some of Problems I was there for   Nights At first It is a good Hotel for sleep only and i am come back But in my Room I has Problems   A old Room with ugly Colors  The Window is damage  it close not realy good   It is a very lought Hotel  with many Kids  The Street is till  am lought and full of Tourists  The Room was a little bit Dirty when i has check in  next Day it was better   The Breakfast its not the greatest 
P => Good for a budget traveler Stayed at this hotel in ruary       I got a room rate of    GBP  which is excellent for this location  Continental breakfast was included in the room rate  I got an English Breakfast for an additional   GBP The next subway station  Queensway  was a   minute walk away The rooms are small and basic  but clean  Bathrooms could use some renovation  there are some cracks  Also  the window  which slides up or down  would not stay in the  quot open quot  position  so I had to support it with my camera tripod  I think this is a problem with that particular room only  I would stay here again when traveling on a budget  
P => Good for the Price   This hotel was nothing special  but with the high exchange rate   it was a great deal  We ended up paying around      US a night  The street infront of the hotel was VERY loud at night and the amenties were no   star hotel  The room was clean and the lobby and location were decent  It is very close to Kensington Gardens which is nice  The closest tube station is a  minute walk or so  Not bad  Don t pay much for this place  but if you can get a deal it is a pretty good bargain  
P => Clean and reasonable The hotel is clean  reasonable and has a good location  I have stayed at a few hotels in this neighbourhood  and this is above average  The hotel next door  Henry VIII  is better  but more expensive   The rooms are small  as in most London hotel   This is something that shocks all Americans  so remember this   One negative thing was the outrageous breakfast price        per person per breakfast is way too much  I would recommend to order without the breakfast  unless your loaded   and rather eat at a restaurant or buy a sandwich to eat in Hyde Park    minutes walk    
P => CLEAN AND CHEAP  I had the pleasure of staying here for   days last ember  and it was nice  The room was quiet  CLEAN and CHEAP  The Queensway tube Station is   minutes walking away and the surrounding area is really charming  Will make it a point to stay here again  hopefully soon  
P =>  Bear the noise My wife and I spent   nights at the Blakemore Hotel  London in ember       This hotel is quite centrally located which is about       minutes walking from the Bayswater Station  Most staff are helpful  As we stayed on the ground floor  the noise possibly from the trains passing through the Bayswater station was quite annoying Though we alerted staff that hot water supply to our room was only on after     am during our first day stay there  the  problem  remained the same during our last two days there  The receptionist answered that they supplied    hour hot water  I woke up at six  and waited till seven for a bath and some hot water to shave  
P =>  An excellent place to stay  I took a last minute trip to London and was apprehensive about what I would find when I opened my hotel room door  I was pleasantly relieved  My single room was clean and tidy  and plenty comfortable for the amount of time I planned to spend in it  very little   The front desk staff and concierge were very friendly and helpful The hotel is within easy walking distance of tube and bus stops  My only problem was that the first single room I was given was right next to the elevator and it was very noisy  I requested a new room and was given one at the other end of the hotel which was much quieter  I would stay here again  
P => The Blakemore The Blakemore is a great budget hotel  The rooms are clean and the location is convenient The bathroom is small  amp  old  Everything was in working order  amp  in good conditionStaff was helpful  amp  pleasantI would stay here again 
P =>  Very good value for the area I booked this hotel on Wotif  fairly last minute as our plans had changed  Stayed for   nights and found the rooms to be modest but clean and tidy Yes  the bathroom is tiny  yes  you couldn t swing a cat but let s remember   this is London and even finding a clean room can be a challenge About four blocks walk  flat  from Paddington station   this is great for Heathrow connections  Breakfast was not included however  chances are it would have been fairly average anyway so we weren t too bothered  Very close to Hyde Park so grab a coffee and a take away breakfast and sit in the park Our room faced west  so it was a bit hot however it also faced away from the street which meant is was very quiet I would recommend to anyone who is staying in London for a few days and needs a clean  simple room  
P =>  Nice place to stay Great Location near Kensington Palace  Very clean  And the people were supper friendly and helpfull  Can t wait to go back  
P =>  I recommend it    Well worth it     We had no problems what so ever  We made the reservation online  with a great rate  and they honored the rate with no question  The staff was friendly and helpful  They went out of their way to help us with a specific request we had  We actually stayed here twice on this vacation and both times were enjoyable  The rooms are typical for a    star European room  Small  comfortable  A bit stuffy in the afternoon  But a fan from the concierge took care of that  and clean  You can get an upgraded room with AC  etc    but it costs more  Its close to the Tube and bus stops and there are plenty of places to eat nearby  For you first time travelers to Europe  this is a great place to stay  Open your mind up and ENJOY    
P =>  GREAT BUDGET HOTEL I think some travelers have unreasonable expectations when they travel  I ve stayed the Blakemore several times over the years and think it s a fine choice if you are traveling on a budget  Bayswater is a great neighborhood  There are several tube stops very close by  shopping and dining on Queensway  It s also just off Hyde Park  I enjoy a morning stroll myself   The fact is  this hotel has rates starting at   GBP which is very cheap for London  You should not expect a Ritz Carlton at that price  It s clean  well located  the rooms are small but charming  you get a private bath  and the staff is pleasant  
P =>  Loved it  We stayed at the Blakemore on a school trip to London  and it was grand  Just a few short blocks from the Tube and friendly service all around  Try not to lose your room key though  there s a hefty fine for that  The beds are comfy  and the bathrooms are just big enough  Of course  if you re a tourist  you won t want to spend much time in your room  and I must say  the Blakemore makes the most use out of a small space  I hope you enjoy your stay in London  
P =>  Never again My husband and I had stayed at the Blakemore Hotel    years ago and truly enjoyed our stay  We returned in ember      and we were quite upset with the poor service we received  When we asked for the manager  he was even more obnoxious than his staff  The hotel has become quite run down which is a shame as it was very well kept    years ago  It is sad that it has changed for the worse  There are many hotels in the same area which will appreciate your business and take better care of their properties  
P =>  Cute hotel in the center of London As a student  i went to the Blakemore on a classtrip with    other students  The location of the Blakemore is wonderful  the tube station is right around the corner and Hyde Park is within walking distance  However  the hotel itself was not exactly up to par  On many occasions  the showers did not work  the doorknob and window were broken  and the elevator was out of commission  At times  the management staff was rather rude  and did not want to help the other students or myself  But  if you are a student in highschool or college and you are looking for a cheap place to stay  especially if you dont plan on staying in your room often  then the Blakemore is a great place to stay in London  
P =>  impressive the rooms were basic in decor and furnishings  also fairly small  so not a good choice if you are staying for more than a few days  however  the location of the hotel is ideal for visiting London  as the tube station was only a few minutes away taking you around the city and hyde park is literally  mins walking distance from the front door  the staff are extremely friendly and the decor of the rest of the hotel is of a very high standard  we found the price was very reasonable and thoroughly enjoyed our visit  all in all about   stars from us   
P =>  ent place to stay The Blakemore offered a clean yet tiny room in a perfect neighborhood for visiting downtown London  The tube was right next door    minute walk  and the staff was friendly  
P =>  Good Hotel for Students

P =>   Not What It Used to Be My husband had stayed at Blakes many times over    years and in the last    years I accompanied him and loved it  So we booked again and oh my things had changed  The first room they gave us   a so called  quot deluxe double quot  was terrible  Far too cramped and dark for two people and NOTHING like the charming rooms we always had  We upgraded and the room we got was just plain ODD but bigger so we kept it  We were dismayed at how frayed the hotel is looking   maintenance is not being done  floor coverings are frayed  plumbing is antiquated and not maintained and it s sad  Unless Blakes makes changes  sadly we will not be booking there again  It could be that its time has past and no one cares anymore  
P =>   Overpriced over decorated under serviced I stayed   nights at this hotel at the back end of a European business trip  I have stayed at many hotels in London  and chose this hotel because of a special offer from Virgin Atlantic  through Tablet Hotels  The location is ok  not far from   tube stations  The lobby is attractive  but that s it  I saw   rooms  rejected the first  stayed in the  d  My  d room was impossible to work in   it had lots of windows  good   but the sashes were loose  so cool air blew through constantly  unless one had the heavy  floor trailing drapes closed  which made the room dark and somewhat claustrophobic   I live in a big city and city noise doesn t bother me  but it might some folks  but then London is a very big city   There was only   electrical outlet which was usable  and it was located on a wall near the bed  so there was nowhere on which to put my laptop  etc   nor plug in the usual array of devices everyone has   mobile phone  etc  Each of the several standard lamps was plugged in  and one had a spare outlet  but it was located in a really awkward place as well  There was a big sofa  which was quite uncomfortable to sit on  but no table in front of it  or on the side  so I ended up snatching one from the corridor outside my room  While the linens were nice  I m accustomed to a duvet on the bed  this had a woolen blanket plus sheets   not my preference  The walk in wardrobe had a wide and low shelf in front of the chest of drawers  which had rickety drawers   so that I bumped my head a number of times before learning that I had to approach the chest of drawers very cautiously  Also  there were no drawers on the bedside tables  and barely any room for anything  The bathroom was adequate  except that it had the peculiarly English tap arrangement in the sink   one hot  one cold  and never the twain shall meet   which fortunately they did in the tub  Tissues were in several places  and consisted of a wadge of tissues tied up with a ribbon   most strange  and impractical to my mind  There was no holder for the toilet paper  so it resided on a shelf  or the floor  On a positive note  the soap smelled really good  I had to ask for a newspaper on day    although they had asked my preference  but didn t deliver it  they did on day    The television was extremely small and situated on top of a table at the far end of the room  reception on most of the stations was very poor also  There was a minibar  and although I didn t use it  I was charged for something  which I protested on checkout  and after they first didn t believe me  they did take it off the bill Breakfast was included in my  exorbitant and not worth it  room rate  but they added a service charge to the bill   again  I had to protest to get them to remove it  I have no objection to paying for service  but this isn t the way to do it  Also  I don t mind paying a lot for a hotel room  etc   but I expect value for money  as I m sure everyone does As to the decoration style of the hotel  it didn t appeal to me at all  but I m sure many people like it  That s a personal preference  I like my hotel rooms spare  large and light  but with a super comfortable bed  I like to try different hotels  and usually pick well  but not this time  
P =>   Why     I hate those places   staff makes you feel uneasy and uncomfortable  everything is bloody expensive  design is old now   Went there for dinner and drinks   And it was just bad Waste of time  money  energy   waste of everything I guess by now they ve been hit by the financial crisis a bit and they are eating their humble pie   Good   
P => up itself A great place to stay if you re a celebrity or friend of the proprietor  but otherwise you will be treated as a pleb  The literature in the rooms about the  concept  of the place is however fairly amusing and leaves you in no doubt about the high regard in which all those connected with the establishment hold themselves  
P =>  Crispy London Took my lovely wife for a surprise weekend in London for the sales  show and get away from the kidsWe found the hotel with ease  with our car  which the hotel arranged to be safely parked for the weekend near by  without any fuss The room was fantastic  large  warm  well lit and comfortable We didn t use the restaurant  but the breakfast on room service was spectatular and kept us well fuelled for the day  On the afternoon we requested a some sandwiches prior to and evening out and were supplied with a bounty of delights and good coffee We found the staff very help and friendly  the location is great and very good for getting to the major places in London If the stars go there then they were well hidden  but then perhaps that s why great place   will be going again 
P =>  Not worth the money I stayed here for   nights for business  This hotel is so overpriced  and it doesn t help that the US dollar is worth half the pound  Just to get a small carafe of coffee to your room is        US  Just coffee  An English breakfast at their restaurant downstairs is        US dollars  For bacon and eggs  The rooms are individually decorated  Mine was all black walls everywhere with Asian furniture  It was a dark room that the maids continually turned all the lights on all day while I was not in the room  I left notes for them to not turn all the lights on  a waste of energy  and to please leave my windows open  they wanted to keep shutting them  and they liked to reorganize my things on the nightstand  moving them to different shelves  They did read the notes and did as I asked   The maids also took my personal bar of soap I had brought  The hotel staff quickly went out and replaced it for me as the soap the hotel provides is way too smelly  The desk staff is extremely helpful  as I think they have had people complain before  They were so nice and quick to take care of anything  The location is quiet  Hugh Grant was spotted several times skulking about the neighborhood  I guess he lives in the area  There are no coffeemakers in your room  so you are forced to room service or go down to their restaurant in the morning  THe nearest cafe is a good       min walk  They do have wetbar that you can get your own things and put in the fridge  Another in our party stayed in their biggest suite       that has a kitchen with a stove but there was not one plate  pan  dish or cutlery in the kitchen  When we brought lunch in  we had to call and have them send up plates and cutlery and glasses  The restaurant staff were not nice and had an attitude  When asking a waitress what their special eggs were  she gave us definite attitude because she didn t know and that meant she had to ask the chef   quot only the chef knows quot   So we asked her to please ask him at which point she rolled her eyes and her anger was evident as she left  She did not speak English well either  Her attitude didn t change over the   days  We went to the bar one night  and my   drinks    margaritas and   vodka tonic  came to        US dollars  And the elevator in this hotel is the smallest thing you ve ever seen  Barely room for   people  Your luggage will not fit  they bring it up in a different elevator  I will not stay at this place again  
P => Beautiful but tired This old lady is still elegant  quirky  luxurious and expensive all at the same time  but  for the money  she s starting to look a little      I think Blake s is due a refurb in the next year  which will  no doubt  update some of the quirks  slow  small lifts  crap TV  dodgy bathrooms  which shouldn t be an issue with a hotel of this quality Staff still ooze charm and the hotel is very comfortable  all in all a lovely place  
P =>  Lovely Blakes My wife and I booked a room at Blakes for our anniversary on recommendation of a friend and wasn t disappointed  The hotel is tucked away  on a quiet square and the rooms are luxurious  very stylish with really comfortable beds  Do remember though that this is Kensington and not Kissimmee   Florida  so don t expect a room as big as your house  That said I did like the little design touches that set this hotel apart from a boring hotel like a riot and really gives this hotel in my opinion a personality but in my wife s opinion  a really nice tone of voice   I know  love is blind right  Anyway  we didn t spend too much time in the room as it was great weather so decided to get out and due to the hotels location next to Hyde park and all the museums  Natural History  V amp A  Serpentine etc etc   The front desk staff were happy to point us in the direction of all these great attractions which they assured us were a very short walk from the hotel  but still were happy to arrange a cab to take us to the sites  We kept the cab on for the whole day who also took us to the British museum and the National Gallery  On our return to the hotel my wife was very distressed to find her purse was missing  with all her cards and even house keys  Again the front desk staff jumped into action and called round all the sites we have visited that day to see if anything had been handed in  No joy until they called the taxi company and the driver checked his car to find the purse in the back of the car  Relief all round and the purse was returned to a happy wife and the earlier tears were soon dried and we decided to get ready for dinner  After all the drama of the day we decided to eat in the hotel restaurant and had a lovely meal  My wife had squid ink risotto and I had the rack of lamb  both were great but my only criticism would be that my lamb was a little more rare than medium  Still great food with excellent presentation and service   Overall the place was great  i understand that it is something of a celeb hang out  I certainly has grace and style but none of the poor service and stuffiness that you normally find in places associated with the supposed jet set  
P =>   in Desperate Need of an Update As usual  there is more than a grain of truth to the majority opinon on Tripadvisor  I was sent to the Blakes after the Pelham could not honor my reservation  I was  quot upgraded quot  to a luxury preferred room  but it was quite in need of refurbishing There may be many people who appreicate old world charms in a hotel  I am not one of them  and prefer my hotel rooms to be tastefully furnished and with modern amenities  Neither applied here  On the only positive notes  the room was quiet and large  The decoration looked like a cross between an    s disco  with themes of battleship grey and mirros  Raffles style singapore with tattered rattan  and old english manorhouse with portraits etc  If this sounds like it clashes  it does  But worse was that it was in desperate need of a remodel  Much of the bathroom was peeling apart  and the faucets and showers may have been the   th century originals  There were holes in the walls and the rattan was tattered  The bed was hard as a rock  The TV was an early    s    quot  sony with a remote control the size of a tennis raquet  And I found a used band aid on the couch under the throw  Staff were both efficeint and polite  but I will not return  
P => Unsurpassed Luxury at Blakes Tucked away down a quite residential street in South Kensington is the exclusive boutique hotel  Blakes  With my elderly parents coming to visit me from South Africa for the first time in ten years I needed a hotel a little bit special  From the moment you walk into reception the attention to detail really catches the eye  The staff were courteous and efficient  check in was quick and we were soon wisked upstairs by the bell boy carrying both my parents suitcases like there was nothing in them  As for the room  what can I say  Huge  soft four poster bed  Bose sound system  original fittings and an ensuite bathroom with marble throughout  You might say it was almost too nice for my country bumpkin parents but anyone not afraid of a little luxury could do a lot worse Roger Reid 
P =>  Wonderful   loved it  I stayed at Blakes over the summer for   days and had an incredible time  Each room is unique  The staff is attentive and knowledgeable  I felt like i was staying in a private residence  It s very close to Kings Road which made it great for long walks and window shopping  This is the quintessential  quot boutique quot  hotel and I much prefer it to the larger chain type properties  Highly recommended  
P =>  Overpriced  This hotel is very overpriced as it looks like the decor hasn t been touched since the mid    s  However  the staff  food  amp  location are excellent  
P =>  Don t do it  I only wish I had read the other reviews before we booked this pretentious  out dated and decidedly naff  so called  quot boutique hotel quot   what ever that much quoted phrase is supposed to mean A broken heating system and no air conditioning   so no chance of controlling the temperature in your room then   combined with all night partying in other rooms  till     a m     with no great measure of concern from the management  ensured an allmost total lack of sleep  capped by knocking on our door at      a m  and      a m   from the cleaners whom wanted to enquire  what time we would be checking out  Five Stars     you have to be joking     
P =>  An Experience not to be looked over We stayed here for our anniversary  Wanting something different from the regular style hotels you come across all too often  Blakes had everything we could have hoped for  From the staff who did all they could to make our stay worthy of it s reputation  to the suite we stayed in was beyond all expectations  This place is fun  I can t say enough about it  It is expensive  but then you pay for what you get  style  charm  excitement and sense of being well away from London and in some exquisite world only for those with an open mind and eagerness to experience a hotel rather than just sleep in one  All we can say is   I dare you  try something different and don t miss the bar and restaurant      
P =>   Small dark and depressing I stayed at Blakes for two nights during a London trip  I was on my own so had a small double  The room was dark and depressing  The decor was at least    years out of date with huge swaths of curtaining covering most of the windows  I felt it needed a complete redecoration  as did everywhere   Paintwork was chipped  paper peeling off at the corners  However  I did eat in the restaurant downstairs  thai  and I thoroughly enjoyed both meals  The staff were very friendly and helpful I wouldn t go back because it really is too expensive for what you get  
P =>  Tourist rip off   avoid Went to Blakes for an anniversary with the girlfriend  and rarely have i been so unimpressed by the value for money factor    booked a room  about      or something  it was in the eves on one of the top floors  so the amount of room you stand up in was minimal  it was a small  dark room and worth about       not       so we decide to move    we then are shown a very bright red room with a dramatic   poster bed  a snip at       perhaps we are out of our league financially  but this room seemed expensive  although it was dramatic and very  very red  as if you were suspended in a Moulin Rouge dancer s womb    i made the mistake of drinking half a bottle of champagne from the mini bar       the staff were highly professional and incredibly well trained  but the downstairs bar seemed very naff and tacky  the sort of black faux asian chairs that Pizzaland made famous in the    s  the atmosphere in the bar reeked of lined old men and ladies who either charge by the hour or were the early adoptors of plastic surgery circa       you might say this is unfair  and it might be if you have any sense of wanting value for money  and you re not loaded  you shouldn t stay something this expensive  i disagree  Blakes is overhyped  too expensive and i strongly encourage you to seek other boutique hotels when in London  p s  we ate at Racine nearby  very good  
P =>  Magical stay I recently had the most magical stay at Blakes Hotel in London From the moment I arrived until my departure the staff could not do enough for me without being intrusive The Bar and Restaurant Staff were very professional and welcoming and the Food was a wonderful  mouth watering  experience from start to finish throughout my stay The hotel itself was very luxurious and private and although there were obviously some  famous faces  around they were treated with respect and the hotel staff were very discreet I will certainly make sure I stay at this wonderful hotel in the future  
P =>   Low Grade   Stay Away My partner and I stayed here  and now reading the reviews below   see others have shared the same experience  Upon check in to a rather tatty reception area quite late at night  we were transported through the gloom to a room that had us in hysterical laughter and not the happy type  we had travelled far and by this time was exhausted  the bed was crammed behind a wall   that must have been a load bearing wall otherwise there is no way any designer worth their salt would have put one in  Either side of the bed was around    cm of space just enough to inch down sidewards  The silver grimy blinds over the window were all bent out of shape and would not open   no doubtless smashed by some poor soul who forgot to edge sideways to get into bed I could not get over the greyness and general  quot gloom quot   The lighting design is the poorest I have ever encountered and to be honest the decor must have been done in the     s after listening to one too many Madonna tracks with lace gloves on We also called the duty manager and begged to have another room   they duly let us at  am in the morning  we had arrived late due to travelling  and charged us a fantastic GBP     odd extra the new morning Anyhow  the garden bit is quite nice in the morning but this hotel is past it best   in the day and age of chic boutique hotels like Number     or opulent designed hotel where maintenance and care has been taken Don t stay here unless you are plumping for the best suites  the rest is a rip off and for the same rate I have stayed at some of the best hotels around the world   and yes I could walk normally down the side of the bed  
P => could be better for the price charged I adore the Colonial style of this Boutique hotel  decored in style with expensive and gorgeous furniture  You can tell it is a woman who did it  she think about all little details  The room is great  may be a bit dark  the bathroom however need a serious update  The restaurant is excellent and the loung bar also  The service at the reception is average for this type of hotel  And it was freasing cold in the reception  
P =>   A great Design Hotle with a passionless service The Problem may be is about expectations    anyway  would you arrive at the Blakes by black cab and no one come to help you with the bag and say welcome bla bla bla   would you step in carring your heavy luggage by yourself and see at the desk a blond busy receptionist dressed with a plain black t   shirt checking you in with a visible  quot in hurry quot  acting with no explenation of the Restaurant  the Court Yard  the Location  The hotel facilities    would you be taken onto your room by a nice concierge and discover you room is very small with a portable and not working air conditioning with the pipe that you must keep open Would you extra pay all the items from your minibar which is place on the floor and it is dated    years ago I do belive that Hanuske Hemple is a really great stylist with amazing ideas and she is divine  unfortunately the people from the blakes to me don t have a vibe as Mrs Hemple style has By the way the restaurant is amazing with a great style and such good stlish food  
P =>  Nice   but beware of WiFi I stayed at the Blakes between    th and   nd with my wife and we liked the atmosphere  location and decor  Unfortunately if you have to access the Internet be prepared to pay    pounds per day         which is a little bit too much   Overall though a positive experience  
P =>  Style I loved my stay at the blakes  from the Louis Vuitton trunks in the reception  to the articulately decorated rooms  there is no way that anybody could not enjoy their stay at one of the most magnificant hotels in town  The rooms are all very original  and have either a color or pattern theme  The room I stayed in was covered in miniture venisien mirrors  there were about    in total  it was gorgeous and on my highly proped and comfertable bed  you could only feel like a king  The restaurant right below the reception is also exeptional 
P =>  It s great staying at Blakes Excellent  Service beyond the call etc  An Experience  Staff sincere and willing  Guests treated like celebs  which is what I want at any hotel  but sadly not always achieved  Central for amenities   theatre  shops  Calm and peaceful in the city bustle  Exquisite gardens  Stylish but not over substance  Intriging design  Fresh white orchids in rooms  Feels like they really care that you have a good stay 
P => Beautiful Suites I stayed at Blakes several years ago  however it is still memorable to me  The suite was exceptionally beautiful  and the service was excellent  This is a small hotel and has the ability to cater to each guests needs  they also remember you when you return  C  Hendrix 
P =>  Just Perfect Blakes is performance art at it s best   guests are provided every comfort and courtesy with the eye of an artist and the hand of a conjurer  The hotel is a unique delight staffed and designed to the highest standards   without ceremony or affectation   but style and imagination  
P =>   D cevant  
P =>   Bel hotel  
P =>  Sch nes Design aber das reicht leider nicht
